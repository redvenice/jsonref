The bear blocks the path of traffic as it roams wildly around the industrial cityA decision will then be made on transporting it back to the Arctic or taking it to Krasnoyarsk\u0027s Royev Ruchei zoo.But the team cannot start work until receiving a go-ahead from officials in Moscow 1,800 miles away, and reports say this is still awaited.Expert Ekaterina Mikhailova said: \u0027Right now our top priority after sorting any potential health issues would be to make sure that the bear is moved as far away as possible from the city.\u0027We urge anyone who sees the animal NOT to feed it, and not to get close.\u0027 Local TV cameraman Artyom Smirnov said: \u0027I was stunned to see how people were going as close as 30 metres (100ft) to make a selfie with the bear.\u0027Some were bringing children with them.

There are lots of strays in Tiksi – people left their pets during the mass exodus’When the Soviet Union fell, thousands of people left small Russian Arctic towns such as Tiksi, where this photo was taken. It was my home town and I spent the first eight years of my life there, but it stopped receiving financial support and fell into neglect. In 1993, my family became part of the mass exodus.Tiksi was built on the coast of the Arctic Ocean as an outpost on the northern sea route, a port town and a military base during the cold war. When I was growing up, there was a whole secret part of town that even had its own schools where nobody was allowed to go. Tiksi was also really important in the history of Russian Arctic exploration – it’s where the icebreakers set off from. But today it’s struggling.I’d been away almost 20 years before I went back. Returning felt more like stepping into a dream than back into my childhood. When we’re little our memories merge with dreams. The Tiksi I went back to was nothing like the place I left. I found it really depressing. I didn’t have any relatives or friends, and the state of the town shocked me. When I lived there, Tiksi’s population was around 12,000. Now, it’s less than half that.One day, I went to the shore. I saw a family having a picnic with a bonfire. A little girl was throwing stones into the sea. She reminded me of myself. I took a picture of her, from the back, and didn’t think much more of it. But when I returned home to New York it was the only photo I’d taken that was interesting. I knew I had to find her again.I spent two years in and out of Tiksi, much of it with the girl, Tanya. I wanted to reconnect with the town through her eyes: to find her secret places, her favourite spots, and try and recover my past through her.She was a really happy child. She was 12 when I met her, approaching her teenage years, but still very much in her childhood. She was very playful and she loved the idea of photographing Tiksi, showing me around. But she was also very dreamy, and still is. In that regard, we had a lot in common.I was practically living with her family, almost like their adopted daughter. When this photo was taken, it was a beautiful summer’s day in June, and Tanya and I decided to go out for a walk. For some reason, she was convinced she was going to grow out of her favourite dress the following day — she insisted on wearing it because she would never be able to again. She tied her hair in pigtails and we wandered towards the sea.A dog started following us. When people left Tiksi, many abandoned their pets so there are loads of stray dogs wandering through the town. This one clearly wanted Tanya to adopt her. It was a beautiful make-believe: the dog pretended Tanya was its owner, and Tanya pretended the dog was her own.She was always climbing on things and scrambling around. She waded out and jumped on this little iceberg. This is the moment she was beckoning her new dog to join her. I knew I had to get the shot.I think the experience of taking this image was a closure for me. Through Tanya, I was able to reconnect with my childhood, to make sense of the place I had left and to rediscover the Arctic as my homeland.Today, the photo often gets read as a symbol. People have always romanticised the Arctic, and looked at it with a kind of awe. Now, we look at it and we’re scared, or we want to extract something from it. My work isn’t about “saving the Arctic”, but I hope it offers another way of looking at the region: a loving way, an appreciative way, one that reminds the viewer of their smallness in front of it.I’m still very close to Tanya and I know this photo is very special to her.

It wasn’t serious or smooth or delicate … it was crystal clear.”A Mexican actor believes the recording is actually of her voice, and was made in 1953 or 1954. Amparo Garrido, who gave the voice to Snow White when Disney’s 1937 film was dubbed into Spanish in the 1960s, told the Mexican radio station Radio Fórmula: “I feel it’s me and have for a while. I recorded various things for El Bachiller … I’m almost absolutely sure that I recorded this one.”Garrido’s children also say they recognised their mother’s voice in the clip.One of them, Ismael, has said he doubts Kahlo would have been well enough to record the reading.“Frida Kahlo was born in 1907, she died in 1954, and this audio is meant to be from 65 years ago – so it has to be from the year she died,” he told the station.“That makes things difficult, because in 1954, she was in hospital practically the whole time. And besides, the voice is rather an affected one.”Pável Granados, the head of the National Sound Library, said Kahlo’s voice was the “most requested and sought-after” by visitors.“Until now, there had never been a recording of Frida Kahlo,” he said last week. “Frida’s voice has always been a great enigma, a never-ending search.”The library’s role is to preserve and make public documentary sound archives for Mexico. Its collection, amassed over a decade, features the voices of some of the country’s most important historical figures."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e4da2a3cc1bfcd6dba6f945c44f9044f8026ed8/0_100_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=19e0ac42a2e959f76a1cdaa0861d70f2","title":"china karoline kan under red skies","story":"Karoline Kan’s memoir Under Red Skies charts the very different lives of three generations of women in her family. She talks about a giddying journeyWhen I sit down with Chinese journalist Karoline Kan to talk about her memoir, Under Red Skies, it is 5 June: the day after the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre. Kan’s emotional discovery of what is euphemistically referred to as “the June Fourth Incident” forms a moving part of her memoir about life as a millennial in China. “China collapsed for me suddenly,” she writes of the day she used a VPN to skirt web censorship and first learned of the killing and injuring of thousands, as she binged hungrily on suddenly accessible western coverage. “I no longer understood what was in front of me. I had no faith in what I had been brought up to believe.”She explains: “When you grow up in China, trying to find the accurate details of something that happened before you, sometimes they are not available. And it’s like trying to solve a puzzle.”Kan was born in 1989, the year of the massacre, and her memoir is a riveting blend of coming-of-age story, family history and cultural commentary, encompassing vast generational differences and the urban-rural ide. Kan is on the frontline of a rapidly changing country, having grown up poor in rural China, then attending university in the capital before working in the New York Times’s Beijing bureau. Her job title was “researcher”, as Chinese legislation does not allow citizens to be journalists for foreign-owned media. These days, she is the Beijing editor of website China Dialogue as well as a published author. It’s been quite the rise.“Nobody in my family ever wrote a book,” she says. “There isn’t even a journalist in my family or anybody who could be considered intellectual. So to me, it was a nice dream.” She was never concerned about reprisals for her writing: “I was nobody, just a writer, and also writing in English. So unless I decided to write something totally political about the Chinese president or the party, it was pretty much fine.”Kan was almost never here: under China’s one-child policy, her birth was forbidden. Kan’s mother entered a protracted game of cat and mouse with the Birth Control Office, tricking doctors into believing she had been fitted with the mandatory uterine ring by putting an iron ring in her pocket during an X-ray. She was also able to evade forced abortion and forced sterilisation. Nevertheless, having Kan lost her her job as a teacher.It’s unsurprising, then, that Kan is a vocal feminist, heavily influenced by the experiences of the women in her family. Her great-grandmother had bound feet, and her grandmother narrowly escaped the same fate. Kan writes: “At first, my grandmother, Little Guiqin, was told to practise walking so she could get used to the pain. The torture lasted for a few hours a day. She’d painfully and slowly pace up and down the yard. She’d cry and cry but then she got lucky. Less than a week after the initial binding, revolutionaries put a stop to the tradition.”She says now: “I grew up in a traditional Chinese family from a small town where women naturally obey men. My teachers would tell me: ‘You should choose a job that suits women, not compete with men.’ I felt unhappy with it. I don’t think I’m any worse than male students. But at the same time I was afraid of being regarded as somebody weird, who doesn’t fit in.”Reading feminist literature and journalism at university opened her eyes, but also revealed the gulf between herself – an educated, urban young professional – and her farming family, some of whom could remember eating grass and dirt during the Great Chinese Famine.“If I spend three days in my home town with my family, by day three I want to escape back to Beijing, because I don’t agree with them on many things. But I couldn’t change them. It’s not my job to change them. They were given different circumstances,” she says – though the questions about when she is going to marry and have a baby “kill me inside”.The pace of change in China in the 20th and 21st centuries may have been dizzying, but there is a poignant, contrasting thread in the book: the parallel life of Kan’s cousin, Chunting, who marries young and takes a job in a factory. Not all Chinese millennial lives resemble Kan’s Chunting is currently under great pressure to have a second child against her will.Does China’s older generation have empathy for millennials? “Normally they think we are so spoiled and have never really met real difficulties. You hear older people in China calling millennials little emperors or princesses. They think we use too much internet, that we don’t pay enough respect to the seniors in the family. I think the gap is getting really big. And the change is so, so fast.”After growing up on a diet of American TV, Kan recently visited New York for the first time, keen to see the city where they filmed Friends. How do she and her young friends feel about the US, given the anti-China rhetoric voiced by the current president?“I always took it for granted that the relationship between the two countries will get better and better,” she says. “And that we will live in the world that is getting more open and with more cultural exchange … but since last year, with the trade war, many young people in China are not so sure any more. Is the world turning better? Or is it going backward?”• Under Red Skies: Three Generations of Life, Loss, and Hope in China by Karoline Kan is published by Hurst."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40ee6553a79d7a81324de1cefa9719be88256473/0_0_3900_2340/master/3900.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3cd8e35442ca10e5193acbdea74fbc1d","title":"petition netflix cancel amazon prime good omens christian neil gaiman terry pratchett","story":"US Christian group condemns Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett’s story as ‘making satanism appear normal’ – but petition wrong companyMore than 20,000 Christians have signed a petition calling for the cancellation of Good Omens, the television series adapted from Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman’s 1990 fantasy novel – unfortunately addressing their petition to Netflix when the series is made by Amazon Prime.The six-part series was released last month, starring David Tennant as the demon Crowley and Michael Sheen as the angel Aziraphale, who collaborate to prevent the coming of the antichrist and an imminent apocalypse. Pratchett’s last request to Gaiman before he died was that he adapt the novel they wrote together Gaiman wrote the screenplay andworked as showrunner on the BBCAmazon co-production, which the Radio Times called “a devilishly funny love letter to the book”.But Christians marshalled by the Return to Order campaign, an offshoot of the US Foundation for a Christian Civilisation, disagree. More than 20,000 supporters have signed a petition in which they say that Good Omens is “another step to make satanism appear normal, light and acceptable”, and “mocks God’s wisdom”. God, they complain, is “voiced by a woman” – Frances McDormand – the antichrist is a “normal kid” and, most importantly, “this type of video makes light of Truth, Error, Good and Evil, and destroys the barriers of horror that society still has for the devil”. They are calling on Netflix to cancel the show.Gaiman responded to the petition on Twitter, writing: “I love that they are going to write to Netflix to try and get #GoodOmens cancelled. Says it all really. This is so beautiful ... Promise me you won’t tell them?”The publisher and science fiction critic Cheryl Morgan tweeted: “Miraculously God has already done it. Don’t tell them She put it on Amazon instead.”Return to Order is based on the writings of the author John Horvat II. It “calls upon Americans to put principles into actions by working toward what is called an organic Christian society”.

Hundreds of millions of people disturbed by the pace of advancement in their country are turning to faith for the meaning and hope they don’t find in the radically secular world around them. This search for the sacred is shifting social structures and shaping China’s future in new and significant ways.With more than 24 million residents, Shanghai is China’s largest city and the 10th wealthiest in the world. It is famous for economic dynamism and architectural daring, and has become synonymous with consumerism. At the same time, it is at the forefront of religious resurgence. Rooted in history, this revival has swept in on the tide of globalisation, fed by the inventiveness of the Chinese people.After decades of suppression during the Mao era, the number of followers of China’s five official religions – Buddhism, Taoism, Islam, Catholicism and Protestantism – are steadily rising alongside a rich range of unofficial groups and alternative spiritual practices. It is a remarkable recovery, especially considering the destruction of religious infrastructure and knowledge, and continued political suppression.Shanghai Sacred explores the spaces, rituals and communities – in official, unofficial, public and private forms – that together weave the spiritual fabric of the city. Intimate photographs document the creativity of the faithful when creating ‘sacred space’ in a dense and restless urban environment.The traditional east Asian Buddhist practice of freeing captive animals to accrue good karma has flourished dramatically in recent years in Shanghai, in step with the rise of social media and online money donation, which keeps the practice afloat. Here hundreds of inhabitants gather to liberate $3,000 (£2,400) worth of fish bought from the market that morning. Monks or devout lay people organise weekly devotional gatherings, performing the ritual throughout the public space, thus creating a new economy for fishermen and a sense of belonging in an ever-changing urban environment.In 1921, the Chinese Communist party (CCP) was founded in Shanghai. This museum venerates the party and preserves the “official” memories of this occasion with a waxwork of Mao Zedong at the founding meeting. This space is part of the sacred geography of the city and a place that Chinese tourists visit in a reverent manner.The Longhua Revolutionary Martyrs’ cemetery commemorates the CCP members and other activists who died during the revolutionary struggles of 1928-37. Located on a former section of the grounds of the Longhua Buddhist temple, it is part of the “sacred geography” of Shanghai.Dongyue temple hosts one of China’s three official Taoist learning centres and has seen a resurgence of students in recent years. The male students are trained in academic subjects, such as English and history, as well as in Taoist doctrine and ritual practice. Daily meditation time in a state-of-the-art, climate-controlled room has been tacked on to the curriculum.Baiyun (white clouds) Taoist temple was originally built in 1863 just outside the walled city. In 2004, the entire temple was relocated to within the former walled city. Moving temple buildings is not uncommon in China’s radical redevelopments.Jasmine left her job as a doctor to study traditional Tibetan Buddhist therapies. She offers Tibetan bowl singing therapy to her Chinese clients at a members’ club in the centre of Shanghai. With a growing interest in different forms of Buddhist practice, her business has proved lucrative.Super Brand Mall is one of the largest shopping centres in Asia. The Chia Tai Group, its Thai developer, set up a Buddhist shrine outside the entrance. A flow of passersby perform rituals at the shrine, which are believed to have improved the mall’s business.Throughout history migrants and traders from afar have brought new ideas, language and lifestyles to Shanghai and integrated them with local customs to form distinct, syncretic cultures. A young boy of mixed Chinese and Indian parentage celebrates Diwali in the luxurious Shimao Riviera garden compound.Twice a year people come to join the residents of Jinze Town on the outskirts of Shanghai to celebrate the birthdays of local gods. Members of devotional groups of the region show their skills at inserting gongs, incense burners or fishing hooks into their forearms.Fushouyuan is a luxury cemetery park. Most Shanghainese cannot afford to buy a funerary slot here. However, another option is available: a tower in the centre of the cemetery contains cabinets, which are sold as containers for ashes.Elaborate items are made out of paper as offerings for the dead. They also reflect the values of the living. Among these offerings, the omnipresence of joss paper houses speaks of both the scarcity of housing that Shanghai experienced in the past and the rapid pace of urban transformation from the 1990s onwards.On the coldest day in Shanghai for more than 40 years, migrant workers share a hot lunch offered by the Protestant church after the Sunday service held in a factory. The dedication to their faith and sense of community, as well as the promise of a hearty bowl of noodle soup, fuelled the congregation as they stood for two hours in -8C. The church, located in an old factory, was soon after moved to make way for the construction of Shanghai Disneyland.Pastor Dai Lizen, born in 1918, is the oldest female pastor in Shanghai. In 1981, she became the first woman to be ordained in the city. She trained as a pastor before the Cultural Revolution and retrained afterwards to serve a flourishing church community. She lives in one room within the church compound.Orthodox Christianity is not one of the five recognised religions in China. Services are held in the Russian Consulate due to its extraterritoriality status. The Easter 2016 service was the first one that both foreigners and Chinese were allowed to attend.A couple practise singing before a Taizé prayer evening at a Catholic church. Such events have become popular among young Catholics, who often meet partners there. A regular singles’ day is held to encourage matchmaking within the church.St Teresa’s church is located within one of the biggest lilong (lane house compound) of Shanghai, comprising of about 700 houses. In recent years a major relocation project has left many of these structures empty. The remaining church complex contains a number of artists’ workshops, including that of a nationally renowned stained-glass artist.The Fuyou Road Mosque is the smallest of Shanghai’s mosques, constructed in 1870 during the Qing Dynasty and re-established as a thriving centre of Islamic education and prayer after the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976).The faithful put their hand over a nephrite stone invested with “spiritual efficacy” at Jing’an temple. Nephrite jade was highly prized by the imperial court and thought more precious than silver or gold. It is a mineral of both secular and spiritual import.On New Year’s Eve, the Jiang family set a table in their kitchen with food and wine for their ancestors. After burning three incense sticks, leaving time for the ancestors to eat, they perform a worship ceremony (jizu) by burning handmade tin-leaf ingots (xibo).Indian Hindu woman lead an active spiritual life in Shanghai that includes Sanskrit reading classes and devotional singing groups in their homes in the Shimao Riviera garden compound. The community chose this compound because of its close proximity to the Huangpu River, channelling the pivotal role of holy waterways to Indians.The first thorough investigation of religious practices in a Chinese city, Shanghai Sacred was created collaboratively over four years by photographer and anthropologist Liz Hingley, alongside Professor Benoît Vermander, of the Xu-Ricci Dialogue Center at Fudan University and Liang Zhang, a researcher at the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences.

Classes held in less formal settings – where people can learn and unwind – are on the riseWhen the seven McAvoy brothers set up the Seven Bro7hers Brewery in Salford Quays, they were determined to put the Manchester community at the heart of their operation. Five years later, the family business has a bar, the Beerhouse, in Ancoats, as well as the tap room attached to the brewery, with both venues hosting a range of classes – from crochet to beer yoga – on nights throughout the month.Alison Watson is part of the extended family and runs the marketing and events for Seven Bro7hers. She says: “We always intended to put the community at the centre of what we do. It might be painting classes, or our women’s institute evenings, where they teach crafts such as knitting, or educational evenings about beer-making – all of them have made us a community hub.”Evening classes have started to appear in unconventional venues just as traditional adult learning has gone through a tough period. Over the past decade, austerity slashed adult education budgets, with the Association of Colleges warning that adult education “will disappear by 2020” if the sector continues to be starved of funding. But, at the same time, booming interest in arts and crafts has seen more people looking to be taught skills in less formal settings.Lessons are popping up in cafes, pubs, bars and restaurants. Online portals such as Obby and the Indytute advertise classes in calligraphy, embroidery, origami and ukulele-playing, as well as more familiar night courses in languages, technology and business. Many of these classes are held in venues more typically thought of as places to buy a cappuccino or a glass of wine than learn new skills.As education moves out of the classroom and into the bar, the benefits to learners, the businesses that host them and the community at large can be considerable. For the venues, there is the obvious advantage of increased custom at times when trade might otherwise be slow. “Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday nights are good days to schedule things,” Watson says. “People don’t want a heavy night of drinking, but they’re happy to come out and try something new while they have a pint. Chances are, they may order some food while they’re here.”“For independent businesses, such as the Seven Bro7hers, having access to data is vital. By using iZettle, they can see their data in real time – including total sales and peak sales times – so that they can make smarter business decisions and schedule things such as workshops and events accordingly,” says Ed Hallett, managing director at iZettle UK.From the punter’s point of view, they may be encouraged to try an activity – and a venue – they might otherwise have overlooked. Research by the Department for Education suggests adults can be encouraged into taking up learning if they happen across such opportunities in places they use in their everyday lives. And where is more commonplace for many people than a local pub or cafe?Gareth Shelton runs PopUp Painting, a business that hosts evenings on which participants recreate a picture by a well-known artist, such as Van Gogh, David Hockney or Banksy, under the guidance of a practising artist. Classes take place in pubs, bars, restaurants and hotels in cities including London, Birmingham, Leeds and Liverpool. “There’s a bit of fatigue these days at just going out for a drink after work – people want experiences,” Shelton says. “Many of those who come to our classes say they find it really relaxing to do something hands-on after a day working on a screen or immersed in their phone.”Business owners often approach Shelton saying they want something that sets their venue apart from others, introducing customers to them through a class in the hopes they will return at a later date. One hotel where PopUp Painting holds classes sees it as giving added value to the hotel guests. It can also help in terms of marketing, as the business can promote the events, while participants may also spread the word via their own social media.“Getting people through the door and having them come back for more is the most important thing for any business. Offering different experiences and activities is a great way to stand out from the crowd and attract people from across the local community to try out new things. They might come for the workshop but hopefully they’ll come back for the delicious pie and nice atmosphere,” says Hallett.So what sort of business is suited to running these kinds of classes? One that has the right space for the activity in question, of course. But often it is the attitude of the person in charge that is the most important thing. Shelton adds: “The attitude of the manager is everything. Yes, we need a venue that’s not too dark or noisy and that has tables for our desktop easels. But you need to work with someone who’s open-minded enough to try new things.”Watson agrees, and sees great reputational advantages to hosting classes. “It’s about sending out a message that you’re approachable as a business, both to the class organisers and to the customers,” she says. “You’re letting people come to you with ideas and letting them try them out. There isn’t really a negative about trying something new, even if it doesn’t work. You learn something every time and you’re creating a network of people. We consider the community events we hold to be an extension of our business.”To find out how iZettle can help your business, visit izettle"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb86cf47d464bcffae1f5458447e7f235c3c09f0/0_309_5536_3322/master/5536.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cac0e8d1072c158534e20305af21ad92","title":"british tourists empire hotels museums","story":"Hotels and museums do their best to hide the horrors of the past from those who visit, but it needn’t be this wayOver the past few weeks, I have realised that I am the worst kind of British tourist. My crime is way worse than binge drinking in Benidorm, or mortifying locals in Rhodes with sex acts performed in front of their Orthodox chapels. I’m the party pooper who, while on holiday in destinations popular with Britons, has the audacity to ask: what actually happened here?For example, I had the good fortune to find myself in Jamaica last month after a filming stint in Kingston, when I realised that my hotel was actually named after a former slave plantation on whose grounds it still stands. That history is completely invisible to the predominantly British tourists who stay there, unless they go out of their way to visit Rose Hall, a museum on the other side of the vast estate where the owners’ “Great House” still stands.Once you get past the British couples having their wedding photos taken on the steps of this slavery HQ – a strange choice in my personal opinion – the museum’s emphasis is all on the white mistress who lived here (an alleged serial killer of her slavemaster husbands) with barely a mention of the African slaves themselves. The cell where those who attempted to escape had their legs amputated by a bear trap, and were left to bleed to death, is now a tourist toilet that the guides assure visitors is “perfectly safe to use”. Tourists are reminded, repeatedly, that this site, ground zero of one of the greatest horrors in human history – is “paradise”.If “paradise” is Jamaica, in the British tourist lexicon, then “Africa” is basically Kenya. I realised this when I visited the east African country, which attracts huge numbers of generally privileged British visitors, either gap-year students backpacking and volunteering, or people who can afford ultra-expensive safaris. The  ran a piece recently listing 18 reasons to visit Kenya, and hardly any of them had anything to do with its African inhabitants, relating predominantly to the wildlife, landscape and history of any British royalty who had deigned to visit.In the highlands – site of a massive and enduring land grab by white settlers in the early 1900s – I met a British farmer who told me that were it not for his forebears, the natives would still be spearing each other in senseless “tribal wars”, which his community generously prevented by helping themselves to hundreds of thousands of the most fertile acres, creating a system of apartheid, and amassing significant personal fortunes in the process.There is no mention of this rather crucial episode in Kenyan history if you visit Karen Blixen’s house – an eery time capsule in which the aristocratic Danish author’s memoir Out of Africa was set, where nostalgia for an era of white adventure and loyal black servitude is a key attraction for today’s British tourists. It’s not subtle. When you go to buy wooden carvings in the gift shops in Nairobi afterwards, you may even be greeted by a Maasai warrior paid to balance on one leg.Both these countries depend significantly on British tourism, and as someone who treasures having been able to witness the beauty of both their culture and landscape, the last thing I would do is disparage that. Instead, I took it upon myself to talk to the other visitors I met about the aspects of the history that were conspicuously absent from tours that have been carefully designed not to make them feel offended, guilty, or uncomfortable in any way.And do you know what I found? We underestimate the good old British holidaymaker. People who have invested the time and money in travelling to Jamaica or Kenya – let’s not forget that by far the most popular holiday destination for Britons is the far closer and more affordable Spain – are genuinely interested in learning something new. Many have an intellectual curiosity that could cope with an honest appraisal of what happened in the past and how it relates to the seemingly faraway island that they inhabit. Everyone I spoke to, during the unofficial alternative history talks that I took upon myself to deliver (I told you I’m an annoying person to meet on holiday) said how little of these events they knew, yet how interested they were to learn more.They may have been politely trying to get rid of me. But I believe there is an opportunity to be honest with and educate British tourists in parts of the former British empire, instead of which we are stuck in denial. Tour operators, hotel and museum owners think that visitors want to hear something that conforms to their already comfortable worldview. They then produce experiences that do so, and British holidaymakers come away with their preconceptions neatly confirmed.It’s hard enough to get people to think about these questions here in Britain. But if Britons are still being helped to avoid the truth of empire in the places where it happened, and where local people are still living with the consequences, then what hope have we got?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66d09c9e97979490b7dc79bbda0fbda6d6a4fcd7/351_0_2190_1314/master/2190.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6615a6d360b96588d02d015ae2992b26","title":"cars cities land rover pollution urban spaces","story":"Land Rover’s latest ads would have us believe that gas guzzlers contribute to urban culture. They do exactly the oppositeWhat is the best way of wrecking a city? Pour cars into it. Heavy traffic, 50 years of research shows, breaks up communities, disrupts social life and crushes local cultures. Noise drowns out conversation and drives people indoors. Pollution makes streets inhospitable. Cars take up the space that might have been used for children to play, adults to meet, and local projects to grow.Land Rover’s new advertisements for its Range Rover Evoque create the opposite impression: that this ridiculous gas guzzler contributes to urban culture. The Evoque is marketed as “the Range Rover for the city”, which sounds like a contradiction: SUVs like this were originally designed for dirt roads in the countryside. But now, according to the agency behind this revolting campaign, we are invited to use it to “explore your city” and create your own “urban adventures”.One of the ads features the supermodel Adwoa Aboah driving through Brixton, staring at the interesting street life as if on a human safari and talking about its “amazing soul and rhythm … People here are real”. It gives the impression the car is passing through market streets where traffic is prohibited. Why? Because these are the places with the most “amazing soul and rhythm”.She also drives down Brixton Road, one of the most polluted streets in London. All the Evoque models have higher nitrogen oxide emissions than the average for new cars (and much higher CO2 emissions). The Evoque’s sole contribution to Brixton’s streetlife is likely to consist of accelerating the deaths of some of the “real” people it passes.Air pollution is now believed to kill more people than smoking. Across Europe it’s estimated to cause the premature deaths of 800,000 people a year. Every week, cars here kill far more people than the entire toll of the Chernobyl disaster. Air pollution damages hearts and lungs, causes a wide range of cancers, and damages the health of unborn children. It can radically reduce intelligence, as a result of oxidative stress and neurodegeneration. So along comes Land Rover, not only promoting a polluting SUV as a city car, but suggesting it should be used for fun: to kerb-crawl through congested streets gawping at the human zoo.SUVs are killing machines: because they are higher and heavier, you are more likely to die if you are hit by one than if you are struck by an ordinary car. The fashion for SUVs is one of the two main reasons for rising road deaths among pedestrians (the other is drivers using mobile phones). They are likely to be especially dangerous if you use them for human game drives, rather than watching the road.Another of the ads urges drivers to “Set off on an adventure. Discover Edinburgh, one of the UK’s most forward-thinking cities”. A forward-looking city should ban such cars from its streets. Land Rover’s advertising agency promises to roll out this campaign across the world, naming cities in South Africa, China and Colombia. Wherever interesting urban cultures persist, a Range Rover will plough through them.These ads are horribly reminiscent of the commercial Jeep tours through Rio’s favelas. Residents say the tours make them feel humiliated and objectified. The tourists sit behind the car windows, safely removed from the natives, filming exotic poverty as they are driven past people’s homes.They also remind me of Volkswagen’s disgusting adverts last year, which asked: “Looking to boost your school gate credibility? Our Tiguan has been voted one of the coolest cars for dads on the school run.” Poisoning children by driving a monster SUV to the school gate is, in my view, about the least cool thing a parent could do.These ads help to normalise antisocial – even pathological – behaviour. Just as we need to radically reduce the use of cars, for the sake of both human health and planetary survival (the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has just announced a car-free day in September to highlight this need), the manufacturers seek to drag us back into the 20th century.In his book Unlocking Sustainable Cities, Paul Chatterton argues that controlling the car is the first and most important step towards creating friendly and vibrant cities. He points to the work of architects such as Jan Gehl – who seek to reclaim the space now captured by cars, to allow “life between buildings” to flourish.Neither electric cars nor driverless cars will solve our problems. They take up as much space as fossil-powered vehicles. Electric cars are already triggering a series of environmental disasters, due to the rush for lithium, cobalt and nickel required to make their batteries. Driverless cars are likely to exacerbate congestion and accelerate climate breakdown, because of the energy demands of the data centres required to control them.It makes far more sense to build electrified mass transit. But those whose profits depend on urban carmageddon go to great lengths to thwart it. In the United States, Americans for Prosperity, a group founded and funded by the Koch brothers, has set up campaigns to fight new bus and light-rail schemes. It has managed to stop public transport systems in several states. The Kochs made much of their vast fortune from oil refining and asphalt production.Another planned advertisement for the Evoque, this time in Chicago, crudely defines the conflict. In Land Rover’s words, “The Evoque will literally climb on top of the covered entrance to a busy transit station.” The safari theme continues: the new Range Rover poses on top of the public transport system like a hunter with his foot on a slaughtered lion.In A Tale of Two Cities, Charles Dickens wrote of “the fierce patrician custom of hard driving”. As aristocrats raced heedlessly through the streets of Paris in their carriages, everyone else had to jump out of the way or perish. Dickens hinted that this barbaric practice was among the many atrocities that helped catalyse the French Revolution. Today, as cars clear a path through our lives, we need a new revolt against hard driving. It is time to reclaim the streets for the people."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ba04bcd16c570306ba1cd262952f30e613c5780/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7aacf33c77b839208f59a60156e69e08","title":"labour government corbyn radical support uk leaving eu","story":"The socialist project promised by Corbyn will be impossible to achieve from within the European Union. The party must boldly back leaveThe resignation of Theresa May, the rise of Nigel Farage’s Brexit party and the Tory leadership election have cast a sharp light on the choices confronting the Labour party. It appears that, notwithstanding frequent assertions to the contrary, the balance between leavers and remainers has not shifted much since the referendum. As soon as political leadership became available, leave’s mass support across England and Wales was reaffirmed, including in the working-class heartlands of Labour.Farage spoke to popular frustration with the parliamentary shenanigans over May’s deal and the associated failure of democracy since 2016. It is deeply unfortunate that a rightwing populist has again been able to make inroads into the natural constituency of the left. His success makes it vital for the Labour party to offer fresh leadership, while maintaining its working-class roots. For that, Labour must not side with remain.The demise of May and her deal is only partly due to the inherent complexity of Brexit. The main centres of economic and social power in Britain are determined to maintain the closest possible links with the EU single market and customs union. The City is the financial heart of the EU, seeking to operate freely in foreign exchange transactions, derivatives clearing, bond issuance and so on. The manufacturing industry, competitive in aerospace, pharmaceuticals, defence equipment and high technology, sees the EU as its terrain. Financiers and manufacturers have furiously lobbied parliament to avoid a rupture with the single market and the customs union. In the process the democratic will of the British people has been obstructed for two years.For decades the political strategy of the British establishment had been to accept the position of net contributing member of the EU in exchange for significant “opt-outs”. That strategy came to an end when David Cameron was unable to secure “special status” in 2015-16. After the referendum, May attempted to reverse the strategy by taking Britain out of the EU, while “opting in” on issues that were important to big business. Her deal was intended to formally satisfy the demand for exit, while allowing British business to maintain close links with the EU. She failed because – in addition to her political maladroitness – the British political system is in deep crisis and cannot fulfil even its basic functions.The most important aspect of this political crisis is that the Tory party has practically ceased to speak for the interests of British big business. Justified concerns about sovereignty in the EU have assumed a life of their own, taking a firm grip on the nationalist wing of the Tories. From the standpoint of the establishment, things became even more volatile after Jeremy Corbyn shifted the Labour party radically to the left. In that context, May’s minority government never stood a chance.Farage has marshalled the anger of leavers but cannot offer a way out because his party lacks even a basic programme. What he has done is to force the candidates for Tory leadership to adopt the language of “hard” Brexit. Yet the new leader will inherit an insoluble conundrum due to the isions of the Tory party and the unchanged Commons arithmetic against no-deal Brexit. Florid phrases will be of little use. As 31 October approaches, another sharp political crisis is likely to emerge that may well involve calling a general election.It is not surprising, therefore, that the battle for the soul of the Labour party has commenced again, especially after its poor European election results. The worst outcome would be for Labour to become openly wedded to remain. That would detach it from its historic roots, ruin Corbyn’s socialist project and directly undermine his personal position as leader. It is also likely to destroy Labour’s electoral support in precisely the marginal constituencies that the party must win, a point powerfully made by 26 Labour MPs in a letter to Corbyn. The final nail in the coffin would be for Labour to advocate revoking article 50, which would be an insult to democracy and a huge national humiliation rolled into one.The radical change promised by Corbyn is impossible to achieve within the regulatory structures of the EU. These structures are designed to serve the interests of big banks and large corporations. Brussels would not tolerate socialist policies in the UK (or anywhere else). It would use its extensive powers to undermine them, in cahoots with domestic British interests, thus also impeding the democratic renewal of Britain.As for “remaining and reforming” the EU, this is a wild goose chase. EU institutions are designed to be impervious to expressions of popular democratic will. Any treaty reform would require unanimity among member states, while any reform via secondary legislation would need the consent of the commission, the majority of governments and the majority of MEPs, before jumping the hurdle of the European court of justice. There is just no chance.Britain certainly needs a fresh start, and its people demand it. The radical transformation promised by Corbyn – especially to the young – is possible only if Labour does not become attached to remain. The party must continue to honour the referendum result but should also be bolder in airing the radical possibilities offered by leaving the EU. So far Labour has been reluctant to do that, exuding confusion and allowing its rank and file to drift toward remain. It is not too late to correct the balance, if it wants power.• Costas Lapavitsas is a professor of economics at the School of Oriental and African Studies (Soas), University of London, and a former Syriza MP"},{"url":null,"title":"it takes two creative duos on how collaboration makes them thrive","story":"Two heads are better than one, so the saying goes, and if these Coal Drops Yard pairings are anything to go by, there’s something in it …Creativity and collaboration are at the heart of Coal Drops Yard and its array of independent businesses, offering everything from bras to baguettes. We spoke to three of the district’s creative duos to get some tips on pairing up and the art of compromise.Lots of siblings wouldn’t be able to work together – have you guys always collaborated well?Mazie: We have entirely different skills, which I think is critical to us getting on. Abbie heads up design and I head up the marketing. We don’t step on each other’s toes and we trust each other’s judgments. She’s a bit more daring and I’m more commercial, so we’re a good balance.Abbie: The crossover in our pregnancies, with hormones raging, was pretty much the only time we had a row. One argument in three years of collaborating together on Beija isn’t bad, I reckon. Our working relationship improves all the time, as we gain confidence and toughen up.Has your relationship changed since you began working together?Mazie: It’s definitely stronger. She was my stroppy older sister before, but now she’s my best friend. I like to think we’ve both matured a lot since launching Beija.What do you each think the other brings to the brand?Abbie: Mazie brings so much – ideas, jokes, vision and commerciality. I can get a bit avant garde. She reins us all in.Mazie: Abbie brings gorgeous bras that women want to wear – simple styling and beautiful colours. She has great taste and won’t compromise on quality for price, which is what I really respect about her. She’s got high standards.What’s a day in the life of Beija like?Mazie: No day is the same – it’s a ride of amazing highs and frustrating lows. We’re still in our infancy, so I have a lot of jobs – a mix of copywriting, contacting buyers, planning newsletters, designing digital ads, social media, looking at fabrics, plus planning the future of Beija …Abbie: I reply to emails in the morning and do lab dips – approving and rejecting fabric colour submissions. Then I smash through patterns, make sure all the fabrics are there for cutting, so that the samples can be picked up and sewn. Measuring and fitting, then more emails and catching up with the factories. I meet with fabric suppliers, and then have meetings with my team at various points in the day. When I’m designing I have to get away from the office, as there’s no brain space with so much going on.Has Coal Drops Yard influenced your work?Mazie: I visit Coal Drops Yard twice a week and I never want to leave. It’s got a style about it that I really love – it’s laid-back and effortless. I’m always blown away by how cool and well-dressed everyone is.Abbie: The customers who shop here definitely influence us. They are pretty cool, understated and modern. And architecturally, yes. It’s a super slick, strong and neat space – all characteristics I admire and consider when I’m designing.What’s your working relationship like?Missy: In any successful relationship, work or otherwise, you have to put as much energy into understanding and knowing the other person as you do into the actual work. It’s complex being involved with your work partner in a romantic way, because sometimes you’re restricted by what they know already – about you, about the business and the way you work. Collaboration is as much about space as it is about closeness.Our ideas cross over the most in the creative, fun parts of the business, which is what we both enjoy most, but that’s not all the business is. There are a lot of times we just have to get our heads down and split the crappy jobs that no one wants to do!What do you each bring that’s unique?Gabriel: Bodega Rita’s is the product of two people with very different sensibilities and very different ways of working, and we are extremely lucky that these juxtapositions balance out in a beautiful way. It allows us to split responsibilities based on our inidual strengths, enabling us to encourage and support each other while getting on with what needs to be done.Missy: Gabe’s a brilliant chef but, more than that, he understands the importance of the experience of eating, and the transportive quality of flavour. He brings his references together in a way that is honest and thorough and not at all pretentious, and translates food that belongs in a restaurant into a tiny grab-and-go sandwich shop with eight seats.Has your store been influenced by its Coal Drops Yard location?Missy: The power of food is that it’s unifying, so we are absolutely influenced not only by the history of the area but the fact that it’s a workplace for some people, a day out for others, a place of study … I’m looking forward to summer when we can keep the front doors open, have music playing and create a lovely hangout spot for people visiting the area.What advice would you give to someone embarking on a creative collaboration with someone they’re in a relationship with?Gabriel: Work out your inidual strengths and respect them. Communicate and support each other. And always make time to do stuff together that has absolutely nothing to do with work – regularly. Don’t let work get in the way.How did you become business partners?Joao: We have been mates for a long time and we both share the same love and respect for the craft of tattooing and the piercing industry. Sacred Gold was the perfect opportunity to join forces and create something special.What’s a typical day in the life of Sacred Gold?Guy: Adorning lots of people from all walks of life. From mild to wild, discreet to ostentatious, we have something for everyone.What do you think each other brings to the business?Joao: Guy has a lot of experience and insight into the management and approach of running a studio, and a business awareness that benefits us greatly.Guy: Joao has a very unique style that is instantly recognisable. His tattoos are extremely hard to duplicate, creating something special and exclusive to Sacred Gold.What advice would you give someone starting a creative collaboration with a friend?Joao: I would say a successful partnership consists of friends who have opposing qualities. Guy and I have different strengths, so we can both bring something different to the table and balance each other out.Guy: Collaboration means bouncing ideas off one another and expanding on them. Seeing things from a different set of eyes can really expand an idea. A different perspective can also be refreshing and can help when an idea feels stagnant.Has Coal Drops Yard inspired your work?Joao: It’s been an influence on the interior of the studio. We wanted to reflect the way Coal Drops Yard has held on to the historical structure while adding modern elements.Guy: I think what influenced us the most was the style and high spec of Coal Drops Yard – we knew we had to do something that would do justice to such an incredible project.Looking for a more personal shopping and dining experience, or simply want to discover somewhere new in the capital?

Poland and the Czech Republic are understood to be holding out against the 2050 target but Slovakia has dropped its opposition, splitting the central European Visegrád group.“We still do not have unanimity, but an overwhelming majority of member states, including member states you would never expect of being ready to accept such an objective are going in that direction,” the diplomat said.Other sources said it was unlikely the EU would agree a 2050 net zero emissions target, which is supported by at least 18 countries, including the biggest economies, Germany, the UK and France.Diplomats hope instead that the EU will be able to make the pledge as part of a long-term strategy that will be submitted to the UN in early 2020.The EU, which likes to vaunt its green credentials, is under pressure to pledge a net-zero carbon emissions goal in 2050 before a crucial UN climate action summit in September.The UN secretary general, António Guterres, wants the summit to put the world on a path to limiting global warming to 1.5C – a non-binding aspiration of the 2015 Paris accord.Guterres wrote to European council president, Donald Tusk, last month and called on him to demonstrate the leadership of the EU. “I write to you today both as a G20 member and as a leader who I believe can bring the ingenuity needed to transform our economic systems and avert the negative impacts of a world with high levels of carbon emissions – from rising levels of pollution to costly natural disasters,” he stated.The letter calls for a change of course to “achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050” and specifies that leaders should curtail current coal-burning power stations and discontinue new ones beyond 2020.Green campaigners are calling on the EU to make a clear 2050 pledge at Thursday’s summit.“Weasel words won’t defuse the climate emergency time bomb,” Greenpeace EU climate policy adviser Sebastian Mang said. “With people clamouring for a political response and a call for urgent action from scientists, European leaders are under pressure to show that they will do what it takes. They need to set Europe on a rapid path to full decarbonisation and make this a turning point in the global response to the climate crisis.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e32ab211de7c983596e6d0593565ea399dace400/0_45_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6e7ede9b31e0f93d904c9bd02e2fa384","title":"uk citizens assembly on climate emergency announced","story":"MPs launch assembly plan but environmental activists say its conclusions must be bindingA citizens’ assembly on the climate emergency will take place this autumn to explore the fastest and fairest ways to end the UK’s carbon emissions.Six House of Commons select committees announced the assembly on Thursday. It is the second of the three demands made by the Extinction Rebellion protest group to be addressed.However, the group have criticised the initiative as it wants the assembly’s decisions to be binding, not advisory. Parliament declared a climate emergency in May, but the third Extinction Rebellion demand – action to cut emissions to net zero by 2025 – has not been met.Theresa May followed official advice and set 2050 as the date for the end of greenhouse gas emissions earlier in June, making the UK the first major economy to do so.A citizens’ assembly is a representative group of members of the public who come together to learn about and debate issues, and come to conclusions on the best solutions. Parliament has had such assemblies before, for example to assess social care. The climate assembly will take place over a series of weekends in the autumn but the people and locations are yet to be determined.“This isn’t a challenge for just one parliament, one political party, or one generation to achieve net zero by 2050 we need to build cross-party and cross-generational support for the actions needed to deliver it,” said Rachel Reeves MP, chair of the business, energy and industrial strategy (BEIS) committee.She said there needed to be both strong government action and buy-in from the public for the environmental, health and employment benefits that achieving zero emissions could bring to be realised. “I hope the citizens’ assembly will demonstrate that, when all is considered, there is strong public support – even demand – for the government to take the action necessary,” she said.Greg Clark MP, the secretary of state responsible for climate action, welcomed the citizens’ assembly. “Initiatives to engage the public will be vitally important to appreciating the challenges of getting to net zero and giving people a say in shaping the future policies to achieve the target,” he said.But Roger Hallam, from Extinction Rebellion, said: “We have a citizens’ assembly that will give recommendations. Everyone knows what that means, which is it will come out with some ideas and get ignored, like people have been ignored for the last 30 years.”“If you are going to do a citizens’ assembly it has to have teeth and be legally binding,” he said. “We are facing a dire existential emergency. It’s what the UN is saying, what scientists are saying – the only people who haven’t taken it on board are politicians around the world.”Cutting emissions to zero will require the further introduction of renewable energy and electric cars, the end of gas heating and cooking in homes, restrained flying and meat-eating and the planting of 1.5bn trees to absorb any remaining carbon dioxide. But measures such as a diesel tax in France have been seen as unfair.Extinction Rebellion mounted large-scale protests in April and young people inspired by the teenage Swedish activist Greta Thunberg have put further pressure on politicians to act rapidly. The government has already announced that young people will advise ministers on how the UK should meet the net zero target. Extinction Rebellion is also protesting in the Scottish parliament on Thursday to demand a citizens’ assembly.Areeba Hamid, at Greenpeace UK, said: “The citizens’ assembly shows our politicians are starting to take this major existential threat a bit more seriously, but for it to work, it needs to be more than just a glorified public consultation. Will ministers be forced to take its conclusions into account or will they be able to brush them aside as they have done with countless consultations before? The solutions to tackle the climate emergency have been around for decades – what’s been lacking is the political will to make it happen.”The House of Commons select committees organising the citizens assembly are BEIS, environmental audit, housing, communities and local government, science and technology, transport and treasury."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d78961f8d86e92a13aeb182857491e95332ae53b/370_191_2762_1657/master/2762.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dba2e70aab1d5ae8408bb44aa5e702fd","title":"what oil companies knew the great climate cover up podcast","story":"Oil firms are said to have known for decades of the link between burning fossil fuels and climate breakdown.

Here, its co-founder, Sébastien Kopp, files his travelogue from a trip to Amazonia where the shoes are madeby Sébastien Kopp photographs by  Jonny WeeksWe started working in Amazonia, in the Brazilian state of Acre, in 2004. Acre is a frontier: the last point before the Amazon rainforest begins. From Rio Branco, the state capital, it’s a few hours’ drive to get to the forest and, on the way, it becomes clear just how big a problem deforestation is. Where once there was forest, there is now field upon field of cattle and the opposition between the forest protectors and cattle farmers here has been an ongoing issue for the last 40 years.The legacy of Chico Mendes, the Brazilian environmentalist and trade union leader who was killed by a rancher in 1988, is still close to the cause. We started working with Bia Saldanha, who could almost be considered one of Mendes’s spiritual daughters, in 2008 and her experience has brought a lot to the Veja project in Amazonia. She has devoted her life to the fight for the forest and we love having her work with us.We buy wild rubber from communities of rubber tappers whom we work with inside the Amazon rainforest. The rubber is tapped directly from the Hevea trees that grow here. The rubber tappers are increasingly aware of the fact that they can be s of this immensely important forest. Every time we visit, we have open meetings with the community to help us understand how we can do better for them and the forest.On this trip, we discussed a premium cost that we recently added to every kilo of rubber, which specifically goes towards protecting the forest. They told us how a lot of the younger rubber tappers have realised they can now make more money through their work with us than raising cattle. This makes me so happy and I told them that in each pair of our shoes there is a piece of them, there is a piece of the forest.A typical day for a seringueiro (the Brazilian name for a rubber tapper) usually starts at 4am, when they head out on their forest trails to extract and collect rubber milk from the Hevea trees.A seringueiro normally collects 10 litres of rubber milk a day, which we use for the soles of Veja sneakers. Through this process, we are able to support the working communities here and protect the forest from being cut down.The rubber tappers are the first to see the impact that climate change has on the Amazon rainforest the rivers that are drying up fires that didn’t exist before. They share their hopes for a sustainable future here and ask if there are more companies like Veja that can help to avoid deforestation by working with the amazing wealth of the forest without destroying it.The rubber tappers can be the destroyers or s of the forest: we try to push them towards being its s. Sebastiao, one of the leaders in the community, insisted on showing us the Hevea tree plantation he has created on previously deforested land that was used for cattle farming.Every time we come to visit, we are welcomed by such amazing people. We sleep in hammocks and are treated to the most beautiful sunsets and delicious breakfasts. On this trip, we were welcomed by Senhora Conda. She told us all about the work she and her husband do as teachers to the children who live in the forest. She talked about what is changing here, both good and bad. They tell us their stories, their dreams and their difficulties.Our team in Brazil is made up of 25 talented people. They are shoe-makers, specialists in research and development of material and logistics managers who handle our complex production chain, from the ecological raw materials such as organic cotton or wild rubber that we use to make the shoes. In 2019, we have bought almost 200 tons of each. The collection is designed in Paris and brought to life in Brazil.We have a lot of exciting projects coming up and the team is always busy, researching and looking for more ecological raw materials and fabrics. Veja is becoming a test lab for innovations.

And you’re keeping it beating.”In the trailer for the new film of the same title (out in September), it’s 1927 and downstairs Downton is in a fret. The king and queen are coming for a luncheon (expect slaughtered birds in aspic and confusing forks). “I want every surface to gleam and sparkle,” the housekeeper, Mrs Hughes, tells the staff. Just as it did in the ITV series, but even more so.Foreign markets demand that Britain serve itself up on screen as something it never was. Nobody wants British cars, computers or carrots, but everybody wants a bit of posh. It’s why Meghan married Harry. We manufacture our past, package it up in cinema and TV, and flog it abroad. And then that image gets reflected back and distorts us even more.The manufactured Britain that gets sold across the Atlantic is often the realisation not of England’s dreaming but of Americans dreaming of a realm that never existed: that’s why Julian Fellowes’ precursor to Downton, Gosford Park, was directed by Robert Altman and the new Downton film by another American, Michael Engler. Britain has long submitted to cultural colonisation by the US – it’s why I can quote more from Seinfeld and The Simpsons than Shakespeare – but that also works through Britons basking in American-directed movies about Britain.The Downton franchise’s business model also requires an American character in a symbolic position. When Elizabeth McGovern plays Cora Crawley, the Countess of Grantham, she incarnates something desirable for US viewers: she bankrolls cash-strapped Downton and so saves it, just as GIs would save our limey asses in the second world war. That’s why Shirley MacLaine got a cameo as Cora’s mother: a woman even more waspish – imagine! – than Dame Maggie Smith’s Dowager Countess.Dreaming of a past that never existed serves a political function. When David Cameron made Fellowes a Conservative life peer in 2010, the reason was implicit: Downton Abbey not only depicts a reactionary social order, it helps create one. Throughout Tory austerity, it made us content with our domination by heartless Etonians. Now disinterred, Downton Abbey fits with BoJo and MiGo’s mendacious case for Brexit in telling us bewitching lies about Britain’s glorious past.Britain’s cinema has often produced films eulogising the landed classes of yore. Which is odd given that British landowners long ago flogged off their estates and that Qataris own more of London than the Queen. The Downton movie sequel should reflect this, ideally by being called Doha Abbey and featuring Sheikh Abdullah bin Mohamed bin Saud al-Thani (the current CEO of the Qatar Investment Authority) taking over the Earl of Grantham’s ancestral seat.It’s certainly curious in British cinema how often an interloping outsider gets rubbed out for daring to subvert the aristocratic social order. In Stanley Kubrick’s Barry Lyndon, Ryan O’Neal’s eponymous Irish adventurer, after marrying an English heiress and attempting to buy himself a lordly title, loses his son, his fortune and his left leg below the knee. We last see him hobbling on crutches towards a coach headed back to Ireland, tail between what is left of his legs, as Michael Hordern’s voiceover tells us our hero is doomed to spend his declining years gambling hopelessly in continental watering holes.Another interloper, Mr Neville in Peter Greenaway’s The Draughtsman’s Contract, suffers an even worse fate. Hired by Mrs Herbert to depict her stately home in 12 drawings, Neville winds up upsetting the neighbourhood bigwigs, chiefly by getting it on with his employer. Result? He has his eyes burned out and gets clubbed to death, his corpse chucked in the moat by a nocturnal mob of landed locals and lickspittles. Neville represents the penetrating, rational and thereby egalitarian gaze of the enlightenment the toff mob, on the other hand, is the irrational, old order keeping an aristocratic heel on the underlings’ throats.But it is in Joseph Losey’s adaptation of LP Hartley’s novel The Go-Between that class politics are most horribly manifest. The go-between of the title is a 13-year-old middle-class boy, Leo Colston, who is holidaying with his boarding-school chum Marcus Maudsley in the summer of 1900 at the latter’s Norfolk estate. Leo travels between classes as he unwittingly delivers love letters between Marcus’s beautiful sister, Marian, and the estate’s tenant farmer Ted.Marian falls for Ted rather than the toff lined up by Daddy. But when Leo discovers Marian and Ted having sex, it precipitates not just Leo’s traumatic reaction (he is impotent for the rest of his life), but Ted’s suicide. Say what you want about Lady Chatterley’s Lover, but at least Mellors survived the crime of getting her to decorate his tumescence with a daisy chain.Very few British films show aristocrats getting their comeuppance. The best counter to the Downtonisation of cinema is Kind Hearts and Coronets, from 1949, in which ex-draper Louis D’Ascoyne Mazzini murders the seven people (all played by Alec Guinness) standing between him and a dukedom. This adaptation of Roy Horniman’s Edwardian novel Israel Rank: The Autobiography of a Criminal was not on-message at the time. To fit with the postwar Britain of the NHS, state education and nationalisation, Louis should have sought to string up all aristos by their entrails for a more egalitarian Britain, rather than terminating those between him and the ducal crown.But in any case the leading role of the underclass in British cinema is not to get on, but to be ruthlessly erased. In Peter Watkins’ Culloden, based on John Prebble’s Fire and Sword trilogy, the Duke of Cumberland’s men butcher the retreating Highlanders on the road to Inverness.In Douglas McGrath’s 1996 adaptation of Jane Austen’s Emma , Harriet Smith and her schoolfriend Miss Bickerton go out for a walk and are importuned by gypsies in the woods. Miss Bickerton sprints off, but Harriet suffers cramp from the previous night’s dancing at the Crown Ball (we’ve all been there, right?) and is left to the gypsies’ mercies. Harriet gives them a shilling, but they demand more. Just then Ewan McGregor’s Frank Churchill arrives on a horse, rescues Harriet and transports her to Hartfield where, her exposure to rustic roughnecks mingling with erotic flutterings for her hero, she faints.It is striking that Fellowes sets his Downton Abbey film in 1927 – a time when the stately homes of England and the gentry were under threat as never before. Increasingly, the greatest houses were being bought for the National Trust, the organisation founded in 1895 by Octavia Hill, a devotee of John Ruskin, who believed beauty should be for everyone. But that egalitarian sensibility is not shared by all. The same year Fellowes got his peerage, the conservative philosopher Roger Scruton gave the Gifford lectures in Edinburgh, arguing: “The parks and houses preserved by the National Trust owe their beauty to the patterns of ownership that the Trust itself destroys.”Scruton suggests that presenting the aristocracy’s ancestral seats as museums for the plebs is a betrayal of lordly spirit. What has this got to do with Hugh Bonneville’s stewardship of Downton? Think of it this way: it is only a matter of time before he is obliged to flog his ancient birthright to the National Trust or English Heritage.What remains after such an aristocratic yard sale is to muse nostalgically on what was lost. Downton Abbey, and so much of Britain’s cinema, asserts that upstairs and downstairs must be kept apart for the national good. At the same time, this cinema proselytises for the return of the old order, a golden age where everyone knew their place and we were happy to abase ourselves before our betters, even if they were drunk, stupid and inbred.Scruton gives gloss to this when he writes that the philosopher John Locke believed the mix of labour with the things of the earth is the justification for private property. But hold on: the labour wasn’t done by property-owning aristocrats. In Michael Winterbottom’s Thomas Hardy adaptation Jude, Christopher Eccleston’s protagonist is doomed to labour, shoring up the Oxford colleges for the proto-Camerons, Johnsons, Osbornes and Mays who study there. He builds the walls that keep him out.In 2019, with too few of those from state schools going to our top universities, it is Jude’s message, not Downton’s, that needs to be heard. Just down the Surrey road from where Austen’s ladies got importuned is the setting for Kevin Brownlow and Andrew Mollo’s film Winstanley, the biopic of the proto-communist Gerrard Winstanley, who established a self-sufficient Digger farming community – until the lavishly moustachioed 17th-century powers rode in and duffed them up. Such is the fate of Britons who challenge the Downtonisation of the supposedly green and pleasant.The genius of Fellowes and other suppliers of period drama is to make us nostalgic for a time when the riff raff could aspire only to serve. This year we will see Ben Whishaw as Uriah Heep in Armando Iannucci’s adaptation of Dickens’s David Copperfield. The cloyingly obsequious Heep is a projection of the tendency of British society to be ’umble in the face of posh an alibi for the crime we commit every time we revel in Downton or elect Etonian prime ministers, like those those who camp outside Buckingham Palace to give TV interviewers their thoughts on the latest royal baby.We aren’t a nation of shopkeepers, but a land of Uriahs, bowing down before Downton Abbey when we should be rising up against what it stands for. We Britons are a people that never got used to unbending the knee. If Downton is the heart that keeps a community beating, better bring about a nationwide cardiac arrest."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3956e7aff8c8cd5c575079dd30ab3f07e67aa12f/0_0_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6b656ec17624e020836a253c6b5937cf","title":"mmm bap the long search for the perfect burger bun","story":"Every year since the 70s the burger bun has got fluffier, sweeter and more golden – from a squidgy, dull bap to a gleaming brioche. But where will it go from here?This is going to sound like a dream I had, but it’s true: I once travelled 200 miles to taste a “doughnut burger”. Instead of just one patty of ground meat, there were two, with bacon and untold gunk in between. More to the point, instead of a bun, there was a doughnut. The story was that there were as many calories as you ought to eat in a day, in this single burger, so how would you feel at the end of one of those?The answer is, I felt fine. But the journey of the burger bun mystified me. Every year since the mid-70s, it has got higher, fluffier, more golden – unless it is charcoal, in which case it has got more sinister. Every year it has looked more like a gourmet item in its own right. And this increasing perfection has gone hand in hand with sweetness, so that you end up with a bun that is basically not very bread-like, that you would hesitate to eat at home because you would be thrown into confusion about whether you were having breakfast or high tea.Most of the buns you find in shops and supermarkets remain old school – bready, not especially fluffy, extremely yielding in the hand. I love them for madeleine reasons: they remind me of other times I’ve tasted them, very often in a garden, with people I am fond of. Domestically, you mostly serve burgers to people you like. They’re food for intimates, because you’re going to eat them with your hands and they will probably fall apart.In pubs and restaurants, though, buns have gone full million-dollar smile. The original pub buns were highly processed, never went stale, tasted of nothing and were squidgy. I had nothing against these buns I still don’t mind a Wimpy. But what they didn’t have was integrity: the bread changed composition on contact with the meat, became a kind of slick starchy layer. The old outrage of the 20th century – how food looked in adverts versus how it looked in real life – was largely down to these buns. They weren’t pillowy and didn’t gleam. But pubs used them for years, following the not-broke-so-don’t-fix-it module on their MBAs.The quest for the perfect bun was always more fevered in the US, possibly because the burgers were bigger. By 2009, they were havering between the potato-starch roll – still the Shake Shack staple – and a cross between challah and a breakfast roll, which is basically on its way to the brioche. Over the same period in the UK, Byron Burger was launching and Meat Liquor was finding its feet, and both went through existential self-reflection on the matter of the bun. Brioche seemed very sweet for the everyday palate.Then came Young’s “standard brioche”, devised by the pub chain and the Bread Factory bakery, and now the staple of most large pub chains. Oisin Rogers, a long-serving Young’s landlord, describes its traits: glazed top, the colour of an expensive person’s tan, “lots of sugar, can’t freeze it, can’t keep it for longer than a day, costs a lot”. Inspired by both challah (whose complication is eggs) and the pretzel bun (which has syrup and butter), it had a ton of ingredients.Two things happened: first, this bumped the price of burgers closer to a tenner than to a fiver second, they became cosmically delicious to look at, right at the point when people started taking photos of their food. Overnight, the burger became expensive enough to invite discernment, gorgeous enough to be part of your aspirational lifestyle, eventful enough to have on a date.By 2012, the Ship in Wandsworth, which Rogers was then running, was shifting 50,000 burgers in a year. It’s a large boozer, but by any kind of maths, the majority of people who walked in were ordering a burger, and some people had two. The evolution from the 90s – when a pub burger started entirely in the freezer and popped out whole from the microwave – had happened mainly in the bun. There aren’t that many decisions you can make about meat, beyond good quality or bad, rough chopped or minced, medium or rare.I still wouldn’t choose this bun at home: it’s just too sweet. You might as well put raisins on your meat. But I do admire the statement way it looks, and will often choose the fancy – sesame seeds or a glaze – over the plain.On the face of it, bun creativity has ground to a halt: there’s just a lot of monkeying about with colour, to bring us the entirely black charcoal bun or the sort of green avocado bun. Charcoal is actually completely inoffensive, except for its colour, which is its talking point, and the medical claims it makes to alleviate hangovers by soaking up toxins, which are simply … I don’t even want to dignify them with a word like “wrong”.“A burger in a restaurant has to have a narrative,” Rogers says. “So fair play to whoever came up with the charcoal bun or the avocado bun, because people need to come out and tell a story about where they spent their 12 quid.” He is convinced that the brioche will have been supplanted in five years, and, if forced to make a prediction, I would bank on the end of sugar and a return to the days when the main thing you could taste was salt – a bun that reminds you of bread."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e7bf7c7de93da287e2f24330e99d136a8fedbd8/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=68f8766ec9ac5ba39f455cd6e04ae4e2","title":"the great british tea test which part of the country brings us the very best brew","story":"As a proud Lancastrian, I ought to favour my local blend in a taste test with rivals from Yorkshire and beyond. However …I made the mistake of buying some Lancashire Tea bags recently. It seemed like the right thing to do at the time. I was born in Lancaster – and they were on offer in Morrisons.What a disappointment. We Lancastrians may have won the Wars of the Roses* and be vastly better at football than our transpennine rivals, but, by ’eck, the brew bearing my county’s name is an insipid affair. More than once I had to go back to the cupboard and check I hadn’t picked up a decaf bag in error. Lancashire Tea is murky. It has a sinister tinge of that slightly bruised purple you get when suffering a tea with the good stuff removed.Chances are, you have never tried Lancashire Tea. You probably didn’t even know it was a thing. It has only existed since 2002, when Paul Needham and Lynn Hitchen looked enviously at the success of Yorkshire Tea and decided to copy the gimmick over on the rainy side of the M62.It is, I would argue, a bit of a swizz. The website gives little away, but moderate sleuthing reveals it is not even boxed in Lancashire. They blend it in Newton-le-Willows, St Helens, which hasn’t been in Lancashire since 1974. I guess Merseyside Tea doesn’t carry convey quite the same romance.It was all excellent viral marketing for Yorkshire Tea, which used the resulting publicity to clarify that the tea is in fact only blended in Yorkshire, before being shipped around the country.Despite living in Stockport (the west, correct, side of the Pennines), I drink Yorkshire Tea. It’s strong and northern, like me. We don’t even keep it local in the ’s Manchester office, despite the paper’s 198-year foundations in the historic county of Lancashire. We too buy the Tykes’ tea, in 3kg sacks from our stationery supplier.But is Yorkshire Tea really the nation’s finest mass-produced regional chai? I decided to find out, with the help of Jimmy Green, an ex-military man who became addicted to tea when serving in Hong Kong alongside teetotal Gurkhas. He runs Tea from the Manor, which blends loose-leaf teas for hotels across the north-west.He invites me to his office, in an unpromising oblong building on an industrial estate in Denton, Greater Manchester. Appearances deceive. Inside is a tea lover’s paradise. His desk is made of tea chests and two walls are packed floor-to-ceiling with his blends, which include everything from traditional oolong (a superstrong Chinese number only for the hardcore) to a gin and tonic concoction he had made recently for some Cheshire hipsters.A brew with Green is a formal affair. I immediately feel underdressed. He is wearing a dickie bow and pristine white shirt and boils water not in a kettle but in a shiny samovar. Cups are china, naturally, and he has put on a tantalising spread of chocolate eclairs and slices of Victoria sponge that he forbids me from touching until after the tasting, lest I sully my palate.He has laid out some tea leaves on a saucer. One pile, fine brown shavings, he dismisses as “dust”. That, he says, is what we will find inside all the tea bags we are to test today – blends, he suggests, that are fine only in texture. Cheap and tawdry, lowest common denominator stuff. He wants me to compare the dust with the much bigger dried tea leaves he puts into Tea from the Manor blends, which he insists will impart vastly more flavour.I line up the teas we are to taste: Yorkshire Tea, Lancashire Tea, Cornish Tea, West Country Tea, Welsh Tea and Ringtons (which trades heavily on its Newcastle-upon-Tyne origins), plus the only tea I could find that is grown wholly in Britain: Kinnettles Gold, propagated and hand-rolled on a farm in Angus, north-east Scotland, in such tiny quantities that they produce no more than 2kg a year.Green is not keen to taste these heathen teas: “It’s like asking someone used to drinking fine wines to have a bottle of cheap cider.” Nonetheless, he forces down a few mouthfuls, grimacing as if I have made him drink meths. He complains of a “furry taste” (Ringtons), being left with a coating on his tongue (Cornish) and points out some white scum that gathers in the Yorkshire bag. We decide to make each cuppa as I would at home or in the office: straight into the cup. We are not to stir – or worse, use a teaspoon to squeeze out the flavour: “Stirring it is wrong. We should let it steep itself.”I can’t tell the difference between most of them – apart from the fairy-light and appleish Kinnettles, which isn’t an English Breakfast blend and really belongs in a totally different category. I decide I like Ringtons best: it is neither baggy nor crepy and has slightly smoky overtones. Yorkshire and Welsh are pretty much interchangeable: a discovery confirmed by blind tastings in the ’s Manchester office, where even proud Bradfordian Josh Halliday, a lifelong Yorkshire Tea drinker, was fooled by its Welsh brethren.Nazia Parveen, a Brummie, manages to distinguish northern from southern. We all agree the Cornish and West Country brews are a bit too light for our unsubtle palates. It could be the water: ours in Manchester is soft and might not bring out the best in teas blended in England’s lower half. That said, most tea blenders import water from across the UK to check their product will still be drinkable outside their home region.Back at Tea from the Manor, Green reluctantly tastes a sip of Lancashire. He rolls out another simile to explain the offence I am causing his taste buds – “It’s like making a Bugatti owner drive a Transit van” – and makes a face. “Not nice.” He prefers its transpennine rival, too, not that you would ever catch him drinking mass-produced “dust” on his own time.But before Yorkshire folk get too cocky, their brew didn’t come out top in my tasting test. That honour went to Ringtons of Newcastle. Forget the Wars of the Roses: the Geordies win the ’s tea tussle.* Don’t bother the readers’ editor with this one, Yorkshire chums. Yes, there were several wars, not one, and you won a few. But the last one ended when Henry Tudor (later Henry VII), a Lancastrian, defeated and killed Yorkie Richard III (the car park king) at Bosworth Field on 22 August 1485. So we won.Yorkshire Tea (£2.79 for 80 teabags) A no-nonsense brew, befitting a county that gave us Geoffrey Boycott and Sean Bean. Like a Yorkshire terrier: feisty but reliable and surprisingly domineering. 45Cornish Tea (£2.99 for 80 teabags) Pleasant enough but lacking in personality. I was expecting more subversion from a tea with the subtitle “smuggler’s brew”. 35Welsh Brew Gold (£3.69 for 80 teabags) A hearty brew – strong and confident, yet strangely comforting, like a male voice choir. Can double for Yorkshire Tea. 45Ringtons Gold (£3.97 for 100 teabags) Blended on Tyneside since 1907, Ringtons is my fave: a slightly smoky brew with a bright and golden hue. 55Miles West Country Original (£2.50 for 80 teabags) Barely there. Disappointing for a region famed for its cream teas and Cheddar cheese. 35Lancashire Tea (£2.30 for 80 teabags) Odd purplish hue. As satisfying as a weak handshake. Very “meh” for the county of strong women like Thora Hird, Emmeline Pankhurst and Barbara Castle. 25Kinnettles Gold (£40 for a 20g tin) Grown and hand-rolled on Kinnettles farm in Angus, north-east Scotland, this delicate yellow-green tea bears no relation to any of the above but scores highly for refreshment and novelty value. 45"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/74b6928638e1f5d9524f48d35b1755e6a5d83291/71_0_3860_2316/master/3860.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02c38b0e2b21537afb58c6c935c3f8fb","title":"argentina messi copa america leadership finances talent","story":"The only positive for Argentina, and it is a dubious one, is that it could have been worse. A draw against Paraguay means they will probably advance to the quarter-final of the Copa América if they beat Qatar on Sunday – but there are no guarantees either that four points will be enough even for a best third-placed finish or, on current form, that they will beat the Asian champions. This was an extremely fortuitous point after another dismal performance.Again, Argentina were painfully disjointed. Again, it was almost impossible to discern a plan. Again, there was little attacking flair and panic at every counter. Little wonder Sergio Agüero and Nicolás Otamendi have gone grey with the stress.That Argentina did not repeat their opening defeat was down largely to two moments of fortune. First, the very modern penalty they were awarded, and that Lionel Messi converted, after Lautaro Martínez’s shot brushed an arm of Iván Piris before striking the crossbar, an offence so meagre not a single Argentinian appealed and most looked bewildered as the referee stopped them taking a corner to check the replay. If HotSpot or Snicko haven’t yet been added to the VAR toolkit, it can only be a matter of time.Then, Derlis González saw his penalty saved by Franco Armani. It’s not the most significant detail, but it was mystifying that whereas Piris was booked for having an arm, Otamendi got away without a yellow card for chopping down González as the forward spun away from him in the box. That became significant in the 83rd minute as Otamendi was booked for a wild lunge Paraguay should have had 14 minutes (thanks to the VAR-induced stoppage time) with an extra man. The result may have been better but this was arguably a worse Argentina performance than in the 2-0 defeat by Colombia.It would be absurd to blame the caretaker coach Lionel Scaloni, the latest patsy to be shoved into the spotlight. If he is not grimly sweating on the touchline as his predecessor, Jorge Sampoli, did, watching in helpless horror as his reputation collapses around him, it is probably only because he doesn’t have a reputation to collapse.What manner of shambles is it that has allowed a country that in the past year has produced the managers of both Copa Libertadores finalists and one of the Champions League finalists, the manager of the previous season’s Europa League and Copa Sudamericana winners and five managers at last summer’s World Cup to go into this tournament with someone who had never taken charge of a competitive fixture? Scaloni may develop but at the moment he is probably only the third-best Argentinian coach at this Copa América.And then there is the awkward issue of Messi, whose quest to end Argentina’s 26 years of drought and win a senior international trophy has become the defining narrative of his national side. He is brilliant, clearly, and has dragged Argentina to what heights they have reached recently. Last time Argentina faced Paraguay in the Copa América, in the semi-final four years ago, he played a part in the buildup to all six Argentina goals and, at one point, left three defenders neatly stacked on top of each other after a body swerve.Yet he also is a complication. He has followed the path beaten by Cristiano Ronaldo in doing less and less as his career has gone on to become a player far removed from the willing presser of a decade ago (in 2009-10 he won the ball back through tackles and interceptions 2.1 times per game in the league last season it was 0.5). Perhaps that is only reasonable as age begins to drag at his 31-year-old legs perhaps the lack of other responsibilities enhances his creative output. But as with Ronaldo, such focus comes at a cost to the rest of the side.It’s not just that the psychological urge to give the ball to the star – as outlined by Paulo Dybala – becomes a tactical imperative that leads to predictability, it’s that his lack of defensive work inhibits everybody else as they pick up the slack, which can lead to rigidity and tentativeness. A club as good as Barcelona, for whom domination of possession is habitual, can, to an extent, cater for that, although as Liverpool showed even Barça can flounder against teams who call their bluff, don’t sit deep and don’t devote multiple players to trying to stop Messi.But what can Argentina do? Whatever difficulties Messi poses, he is not the fundamental problem. Rather the inability to resolve the Messi conundrum highlights all the other issues around the squad: the lack of leadership, the lack of financial resources, the sense that other countries are benefiting from their coaching expertise and the diminishing pool of high-class players.And that, perhaps, is the biggest worry for Argentina. For a quarter of a century the question has been why, when they had so many gifted players, have they never won anything. That has now subtly changed: how, when they have so few gifted players, can they ever win anything?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e54f60048e6b44c702afad7a6bf6d15f2f2d2850/0_71_4700_2820/master/4700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=de6c01de57a066a3e9502e1d4b96a0d0","title":"why are the best footballers in the world suing their bosses","story":"The Women’s World Cup is nearing the knockout stages, with the tournament favourites, the US, in blistering form.

None of these candidates come close to having any of these attributes and it makes me despair for our country ZeitgitThe whole thing was dismal. What seems striking is that anyone should continue to bother to ask these people exactly how they’ll get Brexit done, when it’s painfully obvious that their plans range from non-existent to laughable fantasy to just-about-possible-if-a-miracle happens.The merits of leaving or remaining in the EU are now beside the point. Brexit has become a vacuous non policy, which depends for its continued existence on not being specified to any credible level of detail. Once you start to pin down exactly how it would be done, support evaporates from one side or the other.Herein lies its real purpose: to create an endless and insoluble riddle, causing sufficient ongoing distraction and chaos to enable the disaster capitalists to ply their trade. There is no actual Brexit that true Brexiteers would support, because then it would become a boring and difficult reality the fantasy is so much more appealing and useful to them. This is why Farage’s party had no manifesto. Michael GallagherEvery single one of them ignored the repeated question regarding the correlation between poverty and their ideological cuts. Johnson well and truly in script mode, maybe his handlers should have instructed basic listening and response skills. Stewart was squeezed out time and time again by Emily and the other candidates. The only solace I can take from all of this, given the majority view of PM candidates on Brexit, is that we will be facing a general election very, very soon. Jazzfunk23My concern is that Johnson is not running for PM, but for ‘having been PM’ and the lucrative reward that this will afford him for the rest of his life. At least Stewart looks like he means it and that he wants to affect change of some sort. Gove, too, is committed I think and has a track record of actually achieving things... disastrous in education, but actually quite good in environment. I only hope the privileged few who get to choose our leader think about this, though I doubt many will be reading here! ExeprattlerIt’s satisfying and fun to rip in to this collection of deluded misfits. None of them deserves the top job, and most sensible people can see how flawed and uninspiring they are. But, the fact is that no matter how much we mock Boris Johnson’s mannerisms, or his hair, or his fecklessness, the UK is on a collision course with an economic crisis. Isn’t it about time we put aside the sniping partisan politics of our echo chambers and worked towards a solution? The first part of any way out of this mess must be the rejection of no deal as an option. The next stage would be a public consultation on what out negotiated leave options are and how they stack up against not leaving at all. It’ll never happen of course, but my point is that until the current tension is diffused nothing objective can be achieved. FreeThinker73Out of this bunch Gove is by far the best candidate. That’s not to say that I like him, or his politics but considering this is a Tory leadership contest and I’ve voted Labour in every election of the last 30 years, I’m not going to like any of them. Gove is the most serious, the most informed and the most likely to be able to elicit some movement from the EU. The fact that he comes across as that annoying little pip from school doesn’t change that. Nor does what happened within education whilst he was there the policies may have been poor but ultimately he delivered them, which was his job. I can’t stress enough that I don’t even want a Tory government, let alone one with any of these people running it. If we have to have one though and if it has to be run by one of these, it’s Gove. AndyOldhamOn the plus side, the Tory party will almost certainly be crucified on the Brexit cross. Whoever takes leadership has a year, maybe two before they befall the same pitfalls as their predecessors. Reality is simply something none of them are able to face (bar Stewart). There is no logic, or ration, or reason, to what they are doing. Still they believe they can abolish legal issues with force of will. Frankly both main parties may well be sacrificed in the altar: If the Tories fail to deliver Brexit, they are doomed. When they deliver it, they have nothing left to offer other than tax cuts.

Also underpinned by the EU are everyday services such as the operation of cross-border taxis and mobile phone roaming services.Repatriation of waste, the prevention of the spread of animal diseases such as BSE and TB, flood risk management, wildfire initiatives and horse racing are also listed in the study.The Brexit select committee said the list showed the extent to which cooperation on the island of Ireland was underpinned by the Good Friday agreement and “the extent to which each is underpinned by existing EU legal and policy frameworks”.Among the most serious issues impacted by Brexit is cross-border policing. It is known that both the Garda Síochána and the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) are concerned about the future of data sharing and potential difficulties in apprehending criminals who flee across the border in the absence of the European arrest warrant system.But the mapping exercise also lists “liaison, training, disaster planning, joint investigations and communications”. It also notes there is a cross-border agency on smuggling and tax evasion, involving the Irish Revenue Commissioners and HMRC.Nineteen areas are listed as “avoiding a hard border” and include everything from the central issues of customs and physical checks on live animals crossing the border to rules on movement of national treasures.The latter is governed by EU rules that “stop national treasures from leaving the country and prevent illicit trafficking and looting”.Movement of medicine across the island is also an issue as “Northern Ireland and Ireland is currently treated as a single entity by pharma and medical device companies”, and will be subject to checks unless EU regulations apply.David Lidington, the de facto deputy prime minister, told Benn that the documents “were produced as part of a scoping exercise” and were intended to form the basis of discussion and not to be published separately.The government has never published its full Brexit impact statement for Northern Ireland.The mapping exercise does not detail the contingencies for police or for the supply of energy, for example. At one point the government considered putting a flotilla of barges in the Irish Sea to deliver energy to Northern Ireland if it were to become cut off from the all-island energy grid."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7770dfad94e76efa8ab40e3d9a07f1c4232ef9c5/0_281_5165_3099/master/5165.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc10f817b791074bc5f05edd01fc52f0","title":"sajid javid knocked out in fourth round of tory leadership race","story":"Boris Johnson, Michael Gove and Jeremy Hunt will face fifth vote to decide final two candidates later on ThursdaySajid Javid has become the latest candidate to exit the Conservative party leadership race, with the home secretary coming last in the fourth round of voting by Tory MPs, behind Boris Johnson, Michael Gove and Jeremy Hunt.With all 313 MPs again casting votes, Johnson was once more the clear winner, on 157 votes, with Gove overtaking Hunt into second place, with 61 votes to 59. Javid was fourth on 34 votes. All 313 MPs voted but two ballots were spoiled.The focus now shifts to a fifth and final round of votes, in which the final two will be selected, who will be put to a vote of Conservative party members. In effect, this will be a run-off between Gove and Hunt for the right to face Johnson. The result will come at 6pm.The final two will then undertake a long series of hustings events with party members around the country before the winner takes over from Theresa May as Tory leader and prime minister on 22 July.In a tweeted statement, Javid said he was “proud to have made the case for being a party that heals isions, protects our precious union, embraces modern Britain, and brings Conservative values to new audiences, and that my team have navigated this contest in an honest, decent and straightforward way”.Javid said he hoped his candidacy could be an example “to kids who look and feel a bit different to their classmates, those who don’t have as many toys, or private tutors, those who feel like outsiders and wonder whether ‘opportunity’ is just for other people”.In a boost to Gove, the Scottish Conservative leader, Ruth Davidson, who had been backing Javid, said she would now switch her support to him. Gove said he was “absolutely delighted” to come second. The environment secretary tweeted: “It’s all to play for in the final ballot this afternoon. If I make the final two I look forward to having a civilised debate of ideas about the future of our country.”A member of his camp said: “We are in a strong position to make the final two, where we can have a civilised debate in the country.”The result is a blow for Hunt, with backers of the foreign secretary seeking to immediately rally support for him. Penny Mordaunt, the defence secretary, said Hunt being in the final two would avoid the drama of a new showdown between Johnson and Gove, who fell out over the 2016 leadership battle.“That doesn’t necessarily mean the best entertainment for journalists, but for people who are going to focus on the issues, the policies, and set out a vision for the party,” she said.A source in the Hunt camp said: “Boris and Michael are great candidates but we have seen their personal psychodrama before: it’s time to offer the country someone the EU will actually talk to.”One of the challenges for Johnson will be to convince Tory members he is serious about making Brexit happen on 31 October.On Thursday, Johnson was formally endorsed by London’s Evening Standard, edited by the remain-backing former chancellor, George Osborne, with an editorial in the newspaper predicting that Johnson would end up persuading the Commons to “vote for a repacked version of the existing deal”.In a verdict unlikely to go down well among hard Brexiters – or Johnson’s camp – the editorial noted that he had pointedly not completely guaranteed an exit on 31 October, and was the candidate with the most room to manoeuvre.Theresa May is travelling to Brussels for a European council summit and will miss the second vote. She has entrusted a proxy vote to Charles Walker, the acting co-chair of the 1922 Committee of Tory backbenchers, which is organising the contest.During the two-hour voting process, Javid arrived with a series of MPs who have supported him and they posed for a photo in the corridor near the committee room 14, where the voting took place. Javid told reporters he was hopeful of progressing.His exit from the race follows that of Rory Stewart, the international development minister, in the third round of voting on Wednesday.In the previous round, Dominic Raab came last and went out. Esther McVey, Mark Harper and Andrea Leadsom failed to reach the necessary vote threshold in the first round, while the health secretary, Matt Hancock, later withdrew."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58c0b8353472774b8b8b8d4cf058d84dbebedf39/0_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=26757f8413f70dbadc861e3fbb1c9322","title":"conservative leadership election full results","story":"A longlist of 10 candidates was seeking the top job in parliament’s largest party, a role that brings with it the title of prime minister.

However, he died before he could spend the money and it was used instead to pay for his funeral.After his death, the Liverpool Echo published two letters from two different doctors that had been ignored by the DWP.One note, written by Dr Terence Crowley, stated that Smith “could not mobilise a distance of 20 metres repeatedly without needing to stop due to pain and breathlessness”.Amid widespread condemnation of the department’s treatment of Smith, the MP for Birkenhead, Frank Field, wrote in April to Rudd, the work and pensions secretary, to call for an official inquiry into the case. Rudd refused to grant a full inquiry and instead ordered the internal review.Writing to Field to reveal its results, Rudd said: “Whilst the policy guidance was followed in Mr Smith’s case, there were crucial safeguarding opportunities which were missed by the department. The review has identified areas where we need to change our policy and we will be implementing these changes to ensure our most vulnerable claimants are protected.“The department will be working at pace to ensure that these are embedded and that vulnerable claimants are receiving the best possible support from the department. I am adamant that we will learn important lessons from this tragic case and make changes to protect people like Mr Smith in future.”Among the jargon-heavy changes Rudd outlined were improving awareness of how changes to benefit entitlement could affect other benefits in payment or under appeal and “identifying other trigger points for information sharing between benefit lines to improve, join up and provide more holistic support”.A DWP spokesman described the missed safeguarding opportunities surrounding Smith’s case as “failings”. He said the changes would ensure that if someone’s condition deteriorated while they were appealing against the result of a work capability assessment, they would be able to access the benefit support they needed, and greater links between the department and authorities such as social services would be established.In response to the letter, Field said: “What kind of policy guidance is it that fails to recognise that somebody is seriously ill and dying? This letter heavily disguises the fact that we’re talking about a man who lost his life, not a package that got lost within the DWP. It sums up much of what’s wrong with the DWP, which is apparently very short on human sympathy.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e5fa319730025904529835c921bc13f559a1e19/0_84_3383_2029/master/3383.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aa76ea2266a758858f6c198e07d24944","title":"lloyds pharmacy apologises to woman refused emergency contraception","story":"Pharmacy says sorry after staff member refused to dispense product for ‘personal reasons’A pharmacy chain has apologised after a woman was refused emergency contraception because the pharmacist said it went against her personal beliefs.Siani, 41, who did not want to give her surname, pre-ordered and paid for contraception online through the Lloyds Pharmacy website.After arriving at a branch in Brighton to collect the medication, the pharmacist told her the product was ready but that she would not dispense it for “personal reasons”.The pharmacist did not disclose the reasons and was the only staff member in the store at the time.Despite being assured online that she could collect from any outlet, Siani was told to either return the next day or go to the nearest open branch – 10 miles away in Newhaven.“I just don’t think that’s really offering an acceptable alternative at all,” she said. “I’m shocked that a big company like Lloyds can discriminate against women by having their only branch in the city that’s open on a Sunday staffed by a lone pharmacist who won’t dispense women’s services.”Siani said she did not want to “go after” an inidual for her beliefs but thought it was “really important that women’s access to reproductive health services isn’t obstructed, and a big company like Lloyds ought to ensure that they make reasonable accommodation to ensure that if people won’t dispense some medicines, they have other staff available who will.”Lloyds Pharmacy said it was looking into the incident and admitted there was “more the pharmacist could have done for the patient”.A spokesperson said the company encouraged pharmacists to use professional judgment but expected them to follow General Pharmaceutical Council guidelines on the application of personal beliefs.These guidelines specify that pharmacists are obliged to “recognise their own values and beliefs but … not impose them on other people” and “take responsibility for ensuring that person-centred care is not compromised because of personal values and beliefs”.The spokesperson apologised for “the distress and frustration” caused by the incident and said the company had reached out to Siani to ensure she had received the support she needed.Mandu Reid, leader of the Women’s Equality party, expressed concern and said “women’s reproductive rights are under threat the world over”.“It is not the decision of inidual pharmacists to dictate women’s reproductive rights. I would expect the pharmacist to be sanctioned in the same way as if they denied any other health treatment or medicine,” she said.A petition to prevent pharmacists refusing to dispense medication because of personal beliefs has been launched in response to the incident."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c729d9b73f64b0e7a371eb5e4c0b18e294ec41ce/0_117_3375_2024/master/3375.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4995adf453bd7a2b63e96a135d66e531","title":"england sri lanka cricket world cup preview","story":"It is not really the rain that is haunting the organisers of this World Cup it is the results. England are about to play the 27th match at Leeds against Sri Lanka in a tournament that has 45 league matches before advancing to the semi-finals.Mathematically just about anything is still possible though Afghanistan would have to beat India on Sunday and win the rest of their games to have the slenderest chance of qualifying. Realistically it is hard to see how any team is going to displace the current top four – and the semi-finals are still over a fortnight away.Yet again there will be agonising of what is a brilliant tournament – once we reach the knockout stages. The format of cricket’s World Cup has changed just about every time, which is incontrovertible evidence that the solution remains elusive.There is always a problem, the greatest of which was early exodus of India in the Caribbean in 2007, which prompted a major overhaul that was triggered by distressed commercial men. There have been calls to enlarge the competition despite the enhanced possibility of mismatches, which have resurfaced after the current struggles of Afghanistan.The format of this tournament is fundamentally fair and will result in the best four teams in those semi-finals, but it is likely to become laborious when another dead match hits the screens at the beginning of July. My current preference – though this can change like the weather – is for a 14-team tournament, two groups of seven decided by seedings, a guaranteed passage for the group winners to a semi-final, two “quarter-finals” for the sides who come second and third in their groups. This would slightly reduce the number of games and therefore the duration, something, which might be welcomed by all but the money men. Alternatively, perhaps we should adopt The Hundred format, have three matches per day and it will all be over in a week or two? In which case England would be ahead of the game for 2023.Of course such speculation may prove to be redundant if those in the bottom half of the table at this World Cup suddenly have a resurgence. However this feels unlikely. It would be astonishing if India were defeated by Afghanistan at Southampton on Saturday and very, very surprising if Sri Lanka beat England at Headingley on Friday.The solitary concern in the England camp remains the injury to Jason Roy. He will not be available at Headingley so James Vince has another chance to deliver a meaningful innings for England. Against Afghanistan his contribution was elegant and painfully exasperating. Yet again he unveiled some silky smooth shots before being dismissed in clumsy fashion, gloving an attempted hook shot.Vince may recognise that he is in the most coveted slot. So far this has been a tournament for top-order batsmen. The white ball – sadly – has declined to swing and generally the pitches have been reliable so there have not been too many hazards at the start of the innings.The major runscorers, Shakib Al Hasan, Joe Root, Aaron Finch, Rohit Sharma and David Warner, all bat in the top three. Nor have the pitches offered much for the spin bowlers. Despite the obstinacy of the white ball to move the pacemen – with Mitchell Starc and Mohammad Amir at the top of the list – have been the prime wicket-takers. Imran Tahir has been the most successful of the spinners with eight victims in five games. Oddly enough Sri Lanka, pursued by rain, which has caused two of their games to be abandoned, have barely used any spin bowlers so far.At Headingley England are likely to play the same side, in which the pecking order has quietly changed. Jofra Archer (12 wickets in five games) is an automatic choice so too is Mark Wood (nine in four). Liam Plunkett, who has bowled well in his three outings, currently hovers as a reassuring reserve. Meanwhile, Tom Curran has only become a trigger for jokes about Love Island, which I don’t fully understand.Victory for Sri Lanka, would transform a campaign in which they have defeated only Afghanistan. They look a shadow of previous World Cup teams. Their openers, Dimuth Karunaratne and Kusal Perera, are the only batsmen to have shown any form. Their most accomplished player, a tormentor of England in the past, Angelo Mathews, has scored nine runs in three innings. Dinesh Chandimal was not selected. Lasith Malinga tries to recreate former glories at a vastly reduced pace.So expect England to win comfortably before they tackle the strong sides – Australia, India and New Zealand – at the end of this phase. If that is not the case there will be much agonising in their camp it would also stall what seems like an inevitable procession to the semi-finals. And the tournament would be invigorated for a while.

Be glad that he wasn’t run out, because he’s brought his bag of tricks and he’s here to party. Gets down low and scoops Zampa over his own shoulder for a couple of fine leg, then once more drops like it’s hot and reverse-sweeps over backward point for four! Zap, pow. Misses one that he nearly nicks. Charges one and defends. Sweeps conventionally to keep the strike. All happening. They need 8.98.19th over: Bangladesh 105-2 (Tamim 45, Mushfiqur 2) No top spot for Shakib, he has to settle for 425 runs from his fifth World Cup 2019 innings, and his first thus far that hasn’t passed 50. Big chases are a lot about luck as well as skill, and there are little moments that have to go your way. Mushfiqur Rahim comes to the middle, vastly experienced wicketkeeper-bat in this team. He’s nearly run out for 1 as Tamim hits straight to Smith at midwicket and sets off regardless, and Mushy can only watch and hope the ball misses as he runs to the striker’s end. It does. He still ran, though. NB: Usman.It’s not Zampa who does it! One of those strokes of luck that falls one way and not the other. A simple shot from Shakib, trying to turn Stonis away square, but instead he gets a leading edge that loops up to mid-off.18th over: Bangladesh 102-1 (Tamim 44, Shakib 41) Right then. It’s leg-spin time. Adam Zampa has got to for a pile of runs if Bangladesh have any hope. We’ve seen that teams can get on top of him if they attack early. But also he often gets his wickets when teams try to attack him. Who wins this part of the struggle? Zampa takes the early honours, beating Tamim’s outside edge with a straight ball, and going for only four singles. 17th over: Bangladesh 98-1 (Tamim 42, Shakib 39) Slashed for four! Stoinis thought he was in business there with a wide ball bowled and backward point in play. But Tamim got his shot fine of Maxwell and it flies away to the boundary. Equally he nails a whip shot to close the over, but it’s saved on the fence. Again, seven runs scored including a couple more singles. Bangladesh need 8.6 per over from here and they’re nudging up towards 6 an over so far. 16th over: Bangladesh 91-1 (Tamim 36, Shakib 38) Tamim finally hits a pull shot flush, and this time will collect two as Cummins has some distance to cover in the deep. Then there’s a lovely late steer from Shakib that has the crowd in raptures as it beats Maxwell at gully, but they quiet down rapidly when they see third man is set quite square and will save the boundary. Tamim flicks a run, Shakib pulls one. Seven from the over. This is a crazy-tough chase, but they’ve got a real sense of purpose in their batting.Shakib needs 63 to get back to the top of the runs list, by the way. Count down.15th over: Bangladesh 84-1 (Tamim 31, Shakib 36) A classic picket fence from Stoinis: six singles, as the batsmen do a decent job of having a look at him while at least scoring a few. He looks to be bowling freely, and does what he always does, hanging back of a length to avoid letting batsmen get a good swing. 14th over: Bangladesh 78-1 (Tamim 28, Shakib 33) And these are the kind of overs they can’t afford. Coulter-Nile gets away with three singles, bowling a couple of good bouncers to force a dot ball and then a mistimed pull that only gets a hurried single. Stoinis will replace Maxwell next, and they’ll need to take plenty from him too...13th over: Bangladesh 75-1 (Tamim 27, Shakib 31) If Bangladesh have any hope in this monster chase they have to target Australia’s weaker bowlers. Glenn Maxwell is an obvious target. Shakib zeroes in, lofting a straight drive that hangs in the air a fair while before bouncing for four, too straight to catch. Then a flatter harder one that skips over the straight rope. And two more runs to square leg. A dozen from the over with a couple of singles. These are the kind of overs they need, and plenty of them.12th over: Bangladesh 63-1 (Tamim 26, Shakib 20) Shakib isn’t nailing the pull shot today. Tries again versus Coulter-Nile, but can’t time it to get more than a single. Four of those from the over as Nathan CN settles on a difficult length to get away. Paul Headon emails in. “In reply to Nick Toovey, over 5, my over-riding memory is Hussain running out Strauss shortly before he managed a second ton on debut. As I recall, he retired from the international game immediately after getting his own 100…” As a direct result, presumably. I’ve always said that Adam Voges should have done that, in his 20th innings when the statisticians had to count his record, during which his average went up to about 101 while he was making a huge score in New Zealand. Should have walked straight off the field at that moment and never returned. It would have made everyone so mad. 11th over: Bangladesh 59-1 (Tamim 24, Shakib 18) Thanks Adam. Now Maxwell has had a chance of ends, after Cummins had a change of ends. Off-spin from the Pavilion End now. Tamim nudges a single. Shakib drives a couple in front of point, then two more lofted over backward point. He’s gone back past Finch on the World Cup runs list, and taken his personal total past 400 for the tournament. Whew. Bangladesh chasing 382 need 8 per over and they’re at 5.5.10th over: Bangladesh 53-1 (Tamim 23, Shakib 13) Target 382 Coulter-Nile is bowling the final over of the first power play and he does well to keep Shakib stuck to the crease until the penultimate delivery, the No3 leaning into a glorious straight drive for four! He tries to pull the final ball but it doesn’t get beyond midwicket. A nice little recovery.Righto, I’m back over to the radio for a bit. I’ll leave you with Geoff. 9th over: Bangladesh 49-1 (Tamim 23, Shakib 9) Target 382 Cummins again and Shakib is very keen on a shorter ball outside the off stump, crunching his cut shot to the eastern boundary. Beautiful cricket. The crowd are very involved now. 8th over: Bangladesh 41-1 (Tamim 22, Shakib 3) Target 382 “As a Dutchmen and cricket lover, it’s generally rather lonely when you try to make a conversation about what’s happening. So I cannot say thank you enough to OBO for existing, cause at least I now get the joy of listening to other people’s conversations.” Great to have you with us, Jaap van Netten. “One point I’d like to make here, seeing all the Maxwellball discussion: during the most recent series against India (when Australia still regularly lost ODIs) I remember one of you guys (I guess it was Geoff) tweeting after a cheap dismissal: “this is the ball they’ll use to drop Maxwell from the World Cup team.”Yeah, that was me. “What turned this around, with Maxwell now being by far the most dangerous batsmen in their team, and everyone raving about Maxwellball? Is it really Finch being captain, rather than Smith?”I think Maxwell is in a very good headspace and it doesn’t hurt at all that one of his best mates is the captain. It doesn’t stop certain parts of the cricket community pling into him every time he’s out but he’s learned how to shut all that out. NOT OUT! Well, it is a good bit of bowling but it is just pitching outside leg, so that’s the end of that. Australia lose their review. HAS COULTER-NILE TRAPPED TAMIM LEG BEFORE? It has been given not out but they are sending it up to the DRS. Stand by.7th over: Bangladesh 38-1 (Tamim 21, Shakib 2) Target 382 Shot! Tamim is away, clipping Cummins beautifully through midwicket his third boundary. With those runs in the bank, he plays conservatively for the rest of the set, getting under the bumper when it inevitably comes, finishing with a solid push past point for two.6th over: Bangladesh 32-1 (Tamim 15, Shakib 2) Target 382 Glenn Maxwell is it, the two southpaws in the middle surely influencing this decision. It doesn’t quite work to play at the start, the offspinner overpitching and creamed for four to the cover rope by Tamim, who is in very good touch today. A few more singles follow but the Bangladesh fans are up on their feet again in protest when Khawaja’s throw hits Tamim on the leg, flooring the opening for a moment. Play on.“Basically, the meteorological reason for the amount of rain in Manchester is the Pennines (the hills running down the centre of the country to the east of Manchester),” explains Mark Gillespie. “Prevailing weather comes from the west over the Atlantic, and picks up a lot of water. When that hits high land, i.e the Pennines, it dumps it as rain.” Well there we go! Most informative.5th over: Bangladesh 25-1 (Tamim 9, Shakib 1) Target 382 Starc, into the breeze, is sending them down at 92mph. As you do. Shakib is having a look, defending then pushing one to get off the mark. Tamim gives the No3 the strike back and he has to duck under a zippy bumper to finish. Much as it was against England and West Indies, I’m sure they will try and test Shakib out early with the short ball. “Would Khawaja be the record holder for the highest scorer that has to hide in the dressing room for fear of being eviscerated?” asks Nick Toovey. 4th over: Bangladesh 23-1 (Tamim 8, Shakib 0) Target 382 Earlier in the Cummins over, Alex Carey failed to glove adequately glove a delivery that ran away for four byes. But that’s all forgotten about now. Shakib ducks his first ball. As Michael Clarke points out on telly, the excellence of Finch there was taking an extra beat rather than throwing reflexively. He had the time, took it and nailed his ping. “Here is a run-out story,” writes Hari Shankar. “In my school cricket as a tail-ender I was “protected” by my senior top-order batsman. For three consecutive overs the last ball ended in a single. On the last ball of the fourth over I decided to do a Khawaja. Much to my chagrin and to the delight of the watching girls I was chased all over the ground by a seriously-angry-swearing bat. My heart goes out to poor Khawaja when he walked back to the Aussie dressing room.”We’ve all done it. I’ve twice been run out before facing a ball. Once, by a bloke who now plays in the Japan national team. If you’re reading, Bebe, I’m over it.Brilllllliant fielding by the Australian captain! They practice that exact move at training over and over again, Finch sliding at mid-on then pinging down the stumps at the non-strikers’ end. Soumya is well short, Tamim sending him back upon realising the trouble. A very nasty mix up, both men running to begin.3rd over: Bangladesh 19-0 (Tamim 8, Soumya 10) Target 382 “Steve Smith has a whole bag of gloves,” says Michael Clarke on the commentary. That’s what I’m here for, Pup. Next: has a sack full of thigh pads? A container of helmets? Back to the middle, Soumya gets down the other end via a leg bye, Tamim tucking a single. The strike rotation is followed by back to back boundaries for Soumya, clipping aerially through square leg then glancing a rank full toss fine, which Cummins misfields on the rope! You. Do. Not. See. That. 2nd over: Bangladesh 9-0 (Tamim 7, Soumya 2) Target 382 Cummins is bowling the second over today rather than the first, as he has in the last few games. It’s a nice little sidebar of the Australian campaign so far: who is the top dog, Starc or Cummins? Who has choice of end? Who picks the ball? I love this stuff. Anyway, it is Cummins from our northern or broadcast end, to Soumya to begin who drives in the air towards Warner who makes an excellent ing stop. Tamim’s turn, who strikes the first boundary of the reply with a beautifully timed straight drive.“Enjoying the OBO,” emails Robert Hogg. Why, thank you. “On childhood memories of weather, I grew up in Manchester. Winter was mild, wet and dominated by a sky the colour of lead. You had to detect changes in the seasons by the warmth of the drizzle. I can’t remember summer ever coming up as a topic of conversation.” Is there a meteorological reason why it rains more in Manchester? Or is it a bit of a made up thing and it rains there as much as it does anywhere in that region? 1st over: Bangladesh 4-0 (Tamim 3, Soumya 1) Target 382 Starc opens up from the southern or pavilion end. It almost certainly has other names but let’s not get into OBO End Chat quite yet. We’ll save that for the Test Matches later in the summer. He’s on the mark to begin, Tamim playing straight before punching with control through the gap at cover for three to get the chase underway. When the attack leader goes a fraction shorter, Soumya opens with a steer down to third man.Lovely bloke, Tamim. I went to his house to interview him in Chittagong a couple of years ago and he invited me to stay with his family for Eid lunch. Great people.Afternoon everyone. Bangladesh have to start this positively. They weren’t able to against England in Cardiff in pursuit of a similar target a couple of weeks back due to the way that Archer and Woakes opened up at them. They can’t allow Starc and Cummins to do something similar. Instead, take the example of Sri Lanka, who were right on top in the power play on Saturday before throwing it away.With this being the final game at Nottingham for the World Cup, the volunteers (Cricketeers) are doing a lap of honour. Nice touch. The Australians are warming up in front of us, Marcus Stoinis getting ready to bowl. “But can he get through ten overs?” asks Michael Clarke. If he can’t, Australia will have a decision to make.“Just another thought,” emails Damien McLean. “The really frustrating thing is that run out risks taking oxygen away from the story of what was a fantastic innings for Khawaja. Great to see him back in some form, even if it ended badly.”Yep, I share that. He batted wonderfully. Nothing detracts from that. I wish that Maxwell had the chance to finish what he started, but there’ll be other days. As the players make their way to the middle, a reminder that you can chat with me throughout Bangladesh’s chase in the usual ways: email or twitter. Can the Tigers pull off something ridiculous? Or will Australia move to top spot? Let’s find out.Orders don’t come much taller than that. They needed 387 to win against England a couple of weeks ago, and Shakib made a hundred that gave the impression he wanted to salvage net run rate. Then they needed 322 against the West Indies and Shakib made a hundred like he’d never considered the possibility of not winning. He’ll need another of the latter today if they’re to be any chance, but they’re unlikely to get bowling anywhere near as sloppy as the men in maroon dished up. David Warner, it seems strange to say, never seemed entirely in control as he has in the past. But he showed his ability, in finding a way to fight through a tricky start and then just keep going, maintaining his aggression en route to a large and fast hundred. He laid a massive base with Finch, Khawaja played his best innings coming in lower down the order, and Maxwell came in for a devastating salvo at the end that was cut short by Khawaja and a run out.Bangladesh were dominated today. They lost the toss, had to bowl, and never threatened. They were forced by injury to bring Sabbir into the side, who dropped Warner on 10, and Rubel, who went for 83 off 9 overs without a wicket. Their opening batsman had to bail them out with the ball, taking 3 for 58. Nothing went right really. It will have to go astronomically well with the bat for this match to be anything but a foregone conclusion.Adam will be back to take you through the chase, with occasional cameos from me as the day wears on. You can direct your emails to him from here on.50th over: Australia 381-5 (Stoinis 17, Carey 11) We’re back. Mustafizur has the job of closing the innings off for Bangladesh. Carey slams a yorker to deep cover for a single, and that sets the tone for the next two balls. But when the Fizz misses that length, Stoinis powers him back past the non-striker along the ground for four, hard enough to split the men in the deep. Super shot. Followed by a very not super shot, as Stoinis aims over midwicket but gets a thick lofted edge that floats over the keeper for four more. He finishes the innings with another slammed drive and Carey coming to the danger end bolts back for two.That’s one hell of a score for Australia!One over for Australia to face. A restart is announced, as the sun comes out and sweeps briefly across the ground. Ten minutes away, at 14:35 UK time.“When I see the phrase ‘golden arm’ I always think about Mudassar Nazar’s 6 for 32 at Lords in 1982. Not bad for an opener.” Quite so, David Brown. Soumya bowling the death overs is right up near that level.As for the next wicket, “Maybe Smith’s review was on the basis that the bails weren’t going to come off?” writes Jim Luetchford. Hit on the front pad, while standing back on your stumps, by a full toss in front of middle... that was a review more worthy of humour than any of poor Shane Watson’s work.Thanks Adam. I’m glad I wasn’t on the keys when Maxwell was run out. There would not have been enough capital letters on the internet to adequately respond. Jane Evans agrees. “Topping the poll for this week’s least popular Australian cricketer is David War ... no ... Steve ... no ... Usman-there-shalt-be-no-Maxwellball-Khawaja.”Writes Damien McLean, “The really frustrating thing is that run out risks taking oxygen away from the story of what was a fantastic innings for Khawaja. Great to see him back in some form, even if it ended badly.”It was good to see, and he played beautifully. But that really looked like the work of a batsman who was thinking about his hundred and keeping himself safe rather than what the team could make. Understandable to a point, because he’s been messed around regarding his place in the side and in the batting order, and making a hundred is the riposte that no one can deny. But late in the innings you’ve got to take the risks and play for the more dangerous batsman.49th over: Australia 368-5 (Stoinis 6, Carey 9) Soumya bowling the death overs here is everything I want in World Cup cricket. Yes, Carey found a way to slap him out to the deep cover boundary late in the over - a beautifully timed shot after getting to the pitch. But nine off it? Mashrafe Mortaza would take that. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? NOW IT IS RAINING! THE PLAYERS ARE OFF THE FIELD WITH AN OVER TO BOWL! With that, back to Geoff to OBO the rain. Urrrrrgh! 48th over: Australia 359-5 (Stoinis 3, Carey 3) What an excellent fightback from Mustafizur, who was toyed with by Khawaja in his previous set. His skipper needed him to bounce back and he has in this over, getting Smith’s wicket and giving up only five singles. Can’t ask for much more than that from the young gun. “Disappointing not to see Maxwell get a chance to go on with it,” says Damien McLean. “Did Khawaja have a responsibility to sacrifice himself there? Surely Khawaja had done his job by then, no shame being run out for 89 trying to build.”Yes. In a word. Yes.“Then to top it off goes out himself two balls later... Geez. An opportunity missed for us Maxwellball fans.”Let’s be happy it happened rather than sad because Usman DIDN’T RUN. Three wickets in six balls for Bangladesh! The Fizz traps Smith, who was deep in his crease trying to flick to square leg but doesn’t make contact. He reviews, because that’s what you do in over 48, but it is hitting middle half way up.47th over: Australia 354-4 (Stoinis 1, Smith 1) The two wickets have done the job, only two runs coming after Maxwell’s run out. Two new men are out there for the final stanza. Can Bangladesh keep their cool for the next 20 minutes? Soumya has a third! Can somebody please commission me to write 2000 words about this spell? It’s slow (they all are) and Khawaja is through his pull by the time the ball arrives. A tiny underedge is located on the way through and that is that. Well played Usman. That innings is going to make Justin Langer very happy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1fe6e09bad6b9d9cd42abafd5c7bab6ef90e7a0c/0_76_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=84fe1373289ed5f624bd0a913efcd15f","title":"royal ascot 2019 gold cup day live horse racing","story":"Willie Mullins is not here at Royal Ascot to see his horses run this week and the owner Rich Ricci has just told ITV the trainer has had surgery, details unspecified. “There was no serious cause of it but, like the rest of us, we’re getting older and need a little maintenance.

In fact, prizes are only handed out to grooms here after the Group One races, but that policy could usefully be reviewed.Increasingly, it’s clear that racing’s audience expects grooms to be recognised when their charges win major races. We see this on social media, when viewers protest about grooms not being able to lead their horses into the winner’s enclosure if the owner wishes to do that by themselves. In fairness to Ascot, names of grooms are presented next to the runners in racecards throughout the Royal meeting.Straarius is looking well to take Frankie Dettori into Ascot history again in the Gold Cup.Simon Clare of Ladbrokes-Coral is taking cover.The odds are shortening. Frankie Dettori’s mount Straarius is odds-on for the Gold Cup now that the jockey has ridden the first three winners and Turgenev, his mount in the 5.00, is 13-2 from 12-1 in the last hour. The bookies are very worried. According to Oddschecker, British bookmakers are set for a monster £180m payout if Frankie Dettori can complete the perfect day at Royal Ascot and go through the card. Oddschecker spokesperson Callum Wilson: “Frankie Dettori is showing why he is one of the most revered flat jockeys in history as he looks to go through the card at Royal Ascot in a feat that would write him into folklore. His popularity means recreational punters will have chanced their arms on the man on fire and bookies are taking evasive action on his last three rides of the day.” It’s all Frankie!Some interesting new opponents line up against Straarius, suggesting the chestnut is still seen as beatable in some quarters. This is hard to fathom. As he has shown repeatedly over the last two years, he is an exceptional stayer and can prove it with a second success in Royal Ascot’s feature race. Versatile as to ground and increasingly hard to outbattle, Straarius has the right men around him to make the most of his exuberant talent, in John Gosden and Frankie Dettori. He can outclass Cross Counter, whose globetrotting exploits, while impressive, still leave him something to prove here. When last seen in Britain, the Godolphin horse was beaten in a Group Two, though he did have Dee Ex Bee four lengths behind on his previous start. Dee Ex Bee has made a good start to his career in marathons but the form of his wins doesn’t entitle him to take this. Flag Of Honour might be more of a threat, bearing in mind he got within three lengths of Straarius last year when just a three-year-old.And they’re off ... Peach Tree and Fanny Logan lead ...Shambolic now second ... Frankellina is close up ... Queen Power is there but Fleeting is trying to catch Star Catcher ... but it’s Star Catcher .. and a hat-trick for Frankie Dettori!Frankie now all the rage ... his mount is being well backed in the nextFleeting looks like being a short price on the strength of her running-on third in the Oaks but she was ridden to pick up the pieces that day. This will be more of a test and it’s by no means clear that she’ll thrive on it. Queen Power did well at Newbury to overhaul talented rivals who had first run off a steady pace and the well-bred filly can prove hard to beat. The inexperienced Frankellina might be best avoided by anyone who’s had enough of backing horses that don’t start this week, as she was very slowly away when second in the Musidora. She seemed beaten on merit when sixth in the Oaks but perhaps she has more to offer three weeks down the line. John Gosden fields four but the pick of them, Star Catcher, seems held on her third to Queen Power last time. Frankie Dettori has not been leading jockey at Ascot since 2004 but he has not ridden better and has Straarius to come in the Ascot Gold Cup.And they’re off ... Kick On leads and Great Scot is pulling too hard ... Cape Of Good Hope is prominent ... Arthur Kitt is in second ... Sangarius takes off and kicks clear wuth Frankie Dettori on board again! Fox Chairman’s jockey got a lesson there! Never got a run.The ground is drying up ...She’s not wrong ...Aidan O’Brien had a rough time of it on Wednesday, with three consecutive beaten favourites, but Cape Of Good Hope can steer the Irishman back towards the winner’s enclosure. His plugging-on fourth in the French Derby was a bit dour but reads well in this company and, as a brother to Highland Reel, he should have plenty of improvement in him. Headman has become a non-runner because of the rain-softened ground but that won’t be a problem for King Ottokar, who won in the Newbury mud in April, beating Dancing Willoughby, the Queen’s Vase winner on Wednesday. He may not have stayed in the Chester Vase and this return to 10 furlongs could help, though it’ll be a stiff 10 furlongs. Fox Chairman was also beaten at Chester, in the Dee Stakes, when he didn’t get a clear run but seemed to me to lack a bit of tactical speed. I’m surprised he’s as short as 4-1. Sangarius was third to King Of Comedy last time, which is strong form, but his pedigree isn’t crying out that he wants 10 furlongs on soft and he hung badly last time. Great Scot won’t stay unless he learns to settle and is a risk in this atmosphere. Cap Francais went close behind Cape Of Good Hope at Epsom but seemed to regress at Lingfield, albeit that race was won by the subsequent Derby winner.And they’re off ... Misty Grey is prominent ... Cool Sphere leads ... A’Ali takes it up inside the closing stages and kicks clear.Nicola McGeady of Ladbrokes said: “We suspended betting on the colour of the Queen’s hat this morning. Pink was the favourite but after witnessing a run of bets on greysilver at 121, alarm bells rang. It was clearly the right decision to pull the plug with the grey gamble landing this afternoon.”A’Ali was beaten favourite on his only start so far but the winner had the benefit of a previous run and it was nine lengths back to the third at Ripon that day. Frankie Dettori climbs aboard. Aidan O’Brien’s runner is Mount Fuji, a half-brother to a Group One-winning juvenile. He overcame greenness to win on his debut but will have to be a lot more savvy here. The French raider Real Appeal has strong form, plenty of speed and was sold for £265,000 on Monday. It’s slightly surprising that he’s drifted from 12s to 20-1.The royals went for a coordinated look, with the Queen, Duchess of Cambridge, Duchess of Cornwall, Princess Beatrice, Princess Eugenie and Zara Tindall all arriving in varying shades of blue. Could the royals be entering a blue period? William and Kate have form on this front, having gone for a blue theme on several of their Christmas cards. Examples of “group dressing” also extended outside the Royal Enclosure, with several groups opting for yellow – aka the shade of the summer and “the left-field hit of the spring catwalk shows”, which featured at Erdem and Givenchy, Moschino and Oscar de la Renta, to name just a few. The novelty of jumpsuits, first permitted by Ascot in 2017, also appears to have worn off, with the majority women opting for dresses and skirts instead. Yet there were fewer full-length dresses than one might have expected in a year when the prairie dress has reigned supreme, considering that, at the stricter end of Ascot’s dress code, hemlines are required to be “of modest length defined as falling just above the knee or longer”. Tulle – the material dubbed by this paper as “the first major trend of 2019” – did get a look in however, appearing on the Duchess of Cambridge’s Elie Saab gown, amongst others. As always, the hats have been a focus, providing an ample platform for the literal dressing trend favoured by Melania Trump on her recent trip to the UK. Horses, the Union Jack, bees and even a floral arrangement spelling out the word ‘Ascot’ all featured this year, along with a hat comprised of a stack of hats, as worn by model Jodie Kidd. Poppies were another recurring motif – and black and red a popular colour combo for men and women – cropping up on both hats and dresses in what could well be a nod to the 75th Anniversary of The D-Day landings, which was commemorated earlier this month.Royal Ascot is always as much about what is seen and happens off the track as it is on. And Ladies’ day is the most important day of the week in that regard. Let our fashion expert be your guide ... After a rainy start to Ascot, Ladies’ day brought the sunshine – and the fashion. Gone were the plastic ponchos – but if florals for spring aren’t exactly “groundbreaking”, neither is the prominence pink on Ladies’ day. Pink pom-poms adorned oversize hats, alongside pastel pink hair, and almost-fluro pink dresses – a carryover from this year’s Oscars celebrations perhaps, where bright pinks ruled the red-carpet.

But just look at those prices!Royal Ascot 2019 is the first at which detailed sectional timing – information about how fast the horses are going at every stage of the race – is being supplied after every race, something that has been standard practice at several of the world’s other major tracks for some years.Sectionals offer what can seem, at first sight, to be a bewildering array of numbers, offering insight only to a punter with a first in advanced mathematics.What the numbers reveal on closer inspection, however, is the underlying rhythm of a race. How strong was the pace? Was it even throughout? Was the runner-up given too much to do? Sectionals offer answers to these questions and more, all of which can be of considerable assistance when attempting to back future winners.Despite this, though, there are those who remain unconvinced about the need for such information to be made widely available to punters – including, oddly, some who make a living from … making information available to punters.Bruce Millington, the former editor of the Racing Post no less, suggested as much in a recent column, claiming that “a better ambition would be to present existing data in a way that will appeal to a new generation of punters, but that will rely more on clever use of symbols, colours and user experiences than by smearing even more numbers across a card.”Simon Rowlands, a leading advocate for sectionals, responded for the defence here and punters who like to think for themselves can find a more general guide to the data and its uses here. Race-by-race data can be found via the results section on the At The Races website – look for the “Sectionals PDF” link at the bottom of the result.I don’t think there’s another jockey in Britain or Ireland who gets second-guessed as much as Ryan Moore it comes with the territory, when you’re first jockey at Ballydoyle. He’s had a fruitful week but his critics were still out in force after he was well beaten on Norway, 11-4 favourite for Wednesday’s Queen’s Vase. Looking at the replay again this morning, I think he was the victim of circumstance to a large extent. On the short run to the first bend, a row of three horses went past on his outside, heading for the front of the field, and you can almost see him thinking: ‘Hold on, they’re about to go a bit quick here.’ On a horse whose stamina was not assured, he understandably opted to settle out the back. What happens next but those horses, having reached the front, slam on the brakes and it becomes a steady pace all the way down to Swinley Bottom. The first three at that point remained in the first three all the way to the line. With half a mile to go, Norway was obviously in an impossible position, though it has to be said he still didn’t finish like a horse who could have done a lot better behind a stronger pace. It was a frustrating experience for his backers but I don’t blame Moore for what happened.Fashion is front and centre today and I can recall when the lampshade hats first appeared on the fashion catwalk in the early 90s I did opine that this was the last thing we would ever see on the street. But they did appear at race meetings – at Epsom at the 1991 Derby and at Royal Ascot in 2000. Blue ‘won’ the Queen’s Hat Stakes on Tuesday and Wednesday so will the Queen pull off the greatest shock of all by wearing a blue hat in this now traditional daily betting heat for the third day running?Ladbrokes opened their betting like this: Pink 21, Yellow 31, Green 31, Purple 61, Red 81, Orange 101, CreamWhite 101, Silver 121, Gold 141, Blue 161, Brown 201, Black 501, Union Jack 5001.However, it appears the layers are running scared and they have suspended betting. Ladbrokes have had a big run on pink. Nicola McGeady, the firm’s spokeswoman, said: “We have suspended our betting. The shrewd money was on silvergrey which was the early gamble. Pink was also very popular and due to the volume of bets we feel someone knows somethign we don’t.”A spokesperson for bookmakers.tv said: “Despite bookies having reportedly their best ever day in the Queen’s hat betting history on Wednesday, firms have battened down the hatches for Ladies’ day. Pink, yellow and even silvergrey have all been reported as favourites. As a result, odds compilers are taking no risks on punters fighting back from their worst run of hat betting in recent memory.” Aidan O’Brien 3 winsWilliam Haggas 2Andrew Balding 1Charlie Hills 1Sir Michael Stoute 1Mark Johnston 1Ian Williams 1Charlie Appleby 1David O’Meara 1O’Brien is well on his way to being top trainer here for the 10th time, as Haggas just can’t match him for firepower over the final three days here. John Gosden has yet to score, a situation he hopes to correct in today’s Gold Cup with Straarius. Wesley Ward is 04 so far but Kimari went close for him in the Queen Mary and the American has five more shots at Ascot glory this year.Ryan Moore 3 winsDanny Tudhope 3Frankie Dettori 2Jim Crowley 1Oisin Murphy 1James Doyle 1Richard Kingscote 1Moore was beaten on three consecutive favourites on Wednesday but still bagged the final race to hold onto his position at the top of this table, underlining the quantity of good material he gets to work with. He’s ahead by dint of his three second places, while Tudhope has none of those, but then Tudhope has achieved his three wins from just five rides and that surely is the greater achievement. Of course, Tudhope isn’t even at Ascot today, he’s chasing easier meat at Ripon, which is why he’s an 8-1 shot to come out on top by Saturday evening, odds that do not look generous.You want to know what’s going to win, right? Here are our selections for the third day. Stay here and we’ll have an in-depth preview for every race as the afternoon goes on.2.30 Norfolk StakesSunday Sovereign 9-43.05 Hampton Court StakesCape Of Good Hope 6-13.40 Ribblesdale Stakes Queen Power 100-304.20 Gold CupStraarius 5-45.00 Britannia HandicapEclipse Storm (nap) 40-15.35 King George V HandicapConstantinople 9-2Nothing remarkable about five of those but the elephant in this room is the 40-1 nap. Sometimes “nap” represents great confidence. On this occasion, it stands for my sense that this is a potential winner at a really big price. Is Eclipse Storm the most likely winner in the race? I wouldn’t argue that. But there’s easily enough encouragement in his background to think he could be in the shake-up and it’ll be some thrill if it pans out that way.Saturday’s big race, the Diamond Jubilee Stakes, looks a stormer after the news this morning that Blue Point has been declared to run again, having won the King’s Stand here on Tuesday. He will try to become just the second horse to do the double, following the extraordinary performances by the Australian raider Choisir in 2003.Blue Point evidently loves Ascot, having won four times from five races here, and Charlie Appleby reports him in the form of his life, which explains why they’ve opted to roll the dice with him. Also making a quick reappearance in the race is Le Brivido, who didn’t quite get home when fifth in the Queen Anne on Tuesday. Aidan O’Brien clearly thinks he might have enough speed to make a classy sprinter.After two consecutive days when the forecast rainfall for Ascot was barely on nodding terms with the drenching actuality, it is probably unwise to point out that the prospects for Ladies’ Day, featuring the Gold Cup at 4.20, are much more promising. But you can only deal with the forecasts put in front of you and there is genuine hope of a dry afternoon on the biggest day of the week at the Royal meeting.That would be good news for anyone with an expensive outfit to protect from the elements. Whether it is quite as much of a positive for the punters remains to be seen. Ascot’s ground drains more freely than it did in the past but it still has a reputation for turning a bit gluey as it does so and Straarius, last year’s winner and the favourite for the Gold Cup, is the most obvious example of a horse that might not find it entirely to his liking.The latest going report from the course has just dropped on Twitter and Chris Stickels, the clerk of the course, reports that “the going this morning is now soft, good-to-soft in places”.He adds: “It’s actually been dry since racing yesterday, but we did have 10mm of rain during racing yesterday afternoon. The forecast is better for today, it’s due to stay largely dry, with a risk of an occasional sharp shower this afternoon. “There’s a decent breeze blowing up the track at the moment so we may see an improvement in the conditions as the day goes on. The forecast for the rest of the week is largely dry, with a reduced risk of showers for Friday and Saturday.”It was good-to-soft when John Gosden’s magnificent chestnut took the stayers’ race on Champions Day last October, becoming the first Gold Cup winner for half a century to go unbeaten through all season. That, though, was a Group Two and his best form is all on good-to-firm ground. It is certainly something for punters to think about ahead of today’s race and it looks like they already are, with Straarius out to 6-4 from a price of 6-5 overnight.The strength of this year’s opposition may also have something to do with that, as he faces up to last year’s Melbourne Cup winner in Cross Counter and also Mark Johnston’s Dee Ex Bee, who was within two lengths of winning the Derby when he finished second to Masar at Epsom last June. Capri, the 2017 St Leger winner, adds further quality to the line-up, bringing form that includes a three-and-a-quarter length fifth behind Enable in last season’s Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe. Straarius will still start as one of the shorter favourites of the week, and with Frankie Dettori in the saddle after his fine double yesterday, the success, or otherwise, of the Gold Cup favourite is likely to a defining moment in the week-long battle between bookies and punters. The Oaks third Fleeting, in the Ribblesdale Stakes, and Pat Twomey’s exciting Irish two-year-old Sunday Sovereign, a recent purchase by the King Power Racing operation to run in the opening Norfolk Stakes, will be other big fancies today but Straarius is the one that really matters.Chris Cook’s tips for the day are here and the action gets under way at 2.30pm."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a367e6a64395b1dd39af9a5a84e822f2f10f753/306_670_3666_2199/master/3666.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f79a92e200a325568a38ff548c85ed63","title":"wheres the cheapest place to store 500gb of data online","story":"Reeling from a Dropbox price hike, Kate wants somewhere cheaper to store her 500GB of photos and filesI’ve just received notification that my Dropbox account is going up in price to more than £90 a year. I like Dropbox’s interface and ease of use from the mobile app, but £90 seems steep for what I require. What cheaper options do I have for securely storing about 500GB of photos and files? KateMost of us just evolve the way we do things by making convenient short-term decisions. A price jolt should prompt you to rethink how you are storing your data, where you are storing it, and why. Different people have different devices and different needs, so I can’t pick the best strategy for you or anybody else. However, I can give you a few things the think about.The first and best reason is that you often need access to the same data from multiple devices, some of which you use while away from home. The second – very sensible – reason might be that you want an off-site backup where your data will be safe if you’re burgled, your house burns down, or there is some other catastrophe.A third reason might be that you are sharing your photos and (less likely) data with friends and family, or possibly with the public. Millions of people shared their photos on Flickr, and billions share reduced-quality versions on social networking services such as Facebook and Instagram.A fourth reason might be that you have no way to keep a local backup. If so, you are in trouble. Online storage services are like lobster pots: it’s easy to get into them but hard to get out.In a better world, you would be able to move 500GB of data from one service to any other in a few seconds, without downloading it and re-uploading it. Sadly, that’s not the case today. And if your data only exists in one online storage pot, then you have no backup and your data is at risk. People lose data every day because they forget and can’t recover passwords, their accounts are hacked, or their service provider has a hardware malfunction or makes a mistake.You should have local copies and backups of everything, so that you can walk away and just let Dropbox close your account. If you are not in that position, keep paying Dropbox until you are.Dropbox has increased its starting price to £95.88 a year, which is £7.99 a month if paid annually. However, it also doubled the storage allowance to 2TB, which used to cost about $200 (£158) a year, and it has added some extra features. It’s still competitive with other leading services that usually don’t store 30 days of revisions or let you easily undo a file deletion.Google One, as it’s now called, charges £7.99 a month for 2TB, which drops to an annual fee of £79.99 a year. At that price, I’d stay with Dropbox. It’s better.At the moment, your best bet appears to be Switzerland-based pCloud, which offers 500GB for £3.59 a month or £42.99 a year, and 2TB for £7.99 a month or £84.99 a year. Better still, pCloud is currently offering a lifetime 500GB for a single payment of £160 (usually £430) or 2TB for £320 (usually £850). I’ve not used the service, but you could try its free 10GB offering and see if it suits you.Think about splitting your photo storage and your data storage. If you are like me, you have large image files – each jpeg from my Nikon D7500 takes up about 12MB – and relatively small text files. My Work folder holds more than 10,000 files but still consumes less than 3GB. I could zip it, password protect it and store it in any of the free online drives, except Dropbox.Flickr used to be a great place to store 1TB of images for free, but late last year, Verizon sold it to Smugmug. Smugmug charges $5.99 a month or $48 a year for unlimited photo storage. That’s not a bad deal for a service that works really well with photographs.Both Amazon and Google also offer unlimited photo storage, with slight catches.Amazon Photos is free with an Amazon Prime account, and part of its appeal is that it will accept and display RAW files, not just jpegs. And while it can analyse and tag your photos for search purposes, that’s optional.Google Photos, born out of the wreck that was Google Plus, offers unlimited storage as long as your photos are less than 16MP. This makes it useless for most serious photographers, at least as a backup service. Google also uses machine learning to analyse your photos so that you can search for people, places and things. Search is a useful feature, but photos give away vast amounts of personal information.If you use an Android phone, your snaps are stored in Google Photos, and you can choose to clear local copies from your phone to save space and pull them down from the cloud on demand – internet connection required. Amazon Photos can do something similar.Test any photo storage site before you commit to using it. Upload a couple of photos and then download them to make sure they still have the same dimensions in pixels, that the files are the same size, and that they have the same names. This rules out Facebook, Instagram, Imgur and many other services.Online storage sites are really handy for storing smartphone pictures until you can download and archive them, and for sharing photos with other people. However, SD cards are getting so much bigger and cheaper that they’re an increasingly attractive alternative.All my photos are on three hard drives (each PC is backed up to a 2TB or 3TB drive, and the backups are backed up to an 8TB drive), but SD cards make it easy to create an off-site backup.Also, if you have a laptop with a card slot, you can hide as much data as you’re likely to need while travelling somewhere about your person. Micro-SD cards are tiny. The obvious drawback is that, unless you encrypt the data, they are not secure if you lose them.Have you got a question?

LGBT critics such as RuPaul have suggested the show fails to capture the concept of “camp” and I generally agree. Nonetheless, it’s a great opportunity to see the fun, extravagant side of the Costume Institute’s amazing collection. Also, the show includes a great display of art and objects from LGBT history, including Pennington’s portrait – the only full portrait – of Oscar Wilde, and Paul Cadmus’s often-discussed but rarely seen The Fleet’s In!, with its scandal-rousing scene of mixed gay and straight cruising in 1930s New York.The show Art After Stonewall, 1969-1989 is spread over two spaces: work from the 1970s is at the world’s only museum of LGBT art, the Leslie-Lohman Museum (suggested admission $10, until 21 July), while art from the 1980s is at NYU’s Grey Art Gallery (suggested admission $5, until 20 July). The show clearly sets artworks in the context of the fight for LGBTQ rights and changing concepts of sexuality and gender. Highlights include David Hockney’s unusual portrait of Divine, a Bachardy charcoal sketch of the dying Christopher Isherwood, a great collection of Boston school photographs, and pictures by and of Keith Haring (I especially like an Annie Leibovitz shot of Haring nude and body-painted by himself).The New York Public Library’s Love and Resistance: Stonewall 50 (until 13 July) exhibition features archival material from the period around the Stonewall uprising. Photographs by lesbian activists Kay Lahusen and Diana Davies are the unifying theme but there are also other photos such as Fred W McDarrah’s iconic shot of Stonewall’s strikingly erse patrons. The ephemera are particularly touching, such as a Gay Liberation Front newsletter from 1970, asking readers to send suggestions about commemorating the Stonewall uprising to Craig Rodwell, one of the organisers of the first Gay Pride march.The Lesbian Herstory Archives (484 14th Street), in Brooklyn’s original “lesbian” neighbourhood of Park Slope has thousands of archival items, memorabilia and artefacts from the city’s lesbian history and culture that will help visitors gain insight into the evolution of the community. It is free to visit but check the opening times, which change month to month. Group tours are available but should be booked in advance.Restaurants Via Carota, Buvette, and the newly opened Bar Pisellino (all in Grove Street, West Village) are owned by the astoundingly successful couple Jody Williams and Rita Sodi, who have bought their passion for – and knowledge of – authentic French and Italian cooking to the West Village with these three classy establishments. Via Carota’s green salad was described as the best in the world by chef and writer Samin Nosrat in the New York Times, while the “near genius” Manhattan served at Buvette is the best in the city, according to grubstreet.The Bureau of General Services – Queer Division (208 West 13th Street, until 15 September), at the LGBTQ Center, is my favourite queer bookstore in NYC with a great selection of ’zines and artist books. Make sure you check out the Bureau’s Y’all Better Quiet Down, a group exhibition of art and ephemera in response to the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall uprising curated by Nelson Santos.At the Brooklyn Museum, the Nobody Promised You Tomorrow: Art 50 Years After Stonewall exhibition (until 8 December) explores the profound legacy of the Stonewall uprisings within contemporary art and visual culture today. The show masterfully embodies queerness at its most fluid and expansive, bringing together the voices of 28 artists born after 1969 whose artworks look at the past in search for mirrors to their own queer identities, while projecting a more nuanced and intersectional future. In the heart of the West Village is Julius’ (159 West 10th Street), the city’s oldest standing gay bar, where the famous Sip-In took place. The 1966 action by the Mattachine Society challenged bars and restaurants that refused to serve alcohol to homosexuals, a common practice at the time. Go for the happy hour (every day from 4pm-9pm) and stay for the comfort food.Take a voguing class (single class $17, held twice weekly from 6pm), at the Gibney Dance studios on Broadway with Jason Anthony Rodriguez, aka Slim Ninja. Vogue is a form of self-expression in which striking elegant poses elevates your confidence and, most importantly, yourself. After body-conditioning and stretching you will find exercises and combinations that weave together key voguing elements such as arms control, runway, cat walk, duck walk, and dips.Alice Austen House on Staten Island was the home of the prolific and pioneering photographer where, rebelling against Victorian mores, she lived with her partner, Gertrude Tate. The museum houses a permanent collection of Austen’s work, with documentary photos capturing city life in the late 1800s and early 1900s, sitting with early images of women dressed in male drag. There are also exhibitions of other photographers’ work – the current exhibition, Stonewall at 50 (until 30 September), includes portraits of 15 intergenerational LGBTQ+ activists and artists by Collier Schorr. (Museum entrance is a $5 suggested donation).Another special exhibition to mark the 50th anniversary of Stonewall, Pride: Photographs of Stonewall and Beyond, is on at the Museum of the City of New York (until 31 December, $18). It is made up of a wealth of images by Fred W McDarrah, former staff photographer for the Village Voice, who worked at the liberal US news and culture paper for more than five decades. The show includes photographs of the initial Stonewall uprising, intimate portraits of significant people in the LGBTQ rights movement, and images of pride marches, protests and other public LGBTQ events.Dance bands from around the world bring a glorious open-air party to Lincoln Center’s Damrosch Park for the annual Midsummer Night’s Swing, with events every night until 13 July. It’s one of the city’s largest outdoor dance events, and has been running since 1988, and includes different live acts each night playing swing, salsa, R\u0026ampB, disco and tango, alongside DJs, dance instructors and a late-night silent disco.Bayard Rustin’s Residence was the home of the key strategist in the civil and gay rights movements. He was a proponent of nonviolent protest, a mentor to Martin Luther King Jr, and a lead organiser of the landmark 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. He lived at the Chelsea apartment from 1962 to 1987, and a plaque outside now honours his life and work, including the famous quote: “We need, in every community, a group of angelic troublemakers.” For more on this, there is a Making Gay History episode from 2016 featuring an interview with his partner Walter Naegle, and a 1986 recording of an interview between Bayard and Peg Byron, who was writing for the DC-based gay newspaper the Washington Blade.Mood Ring is a gay bar in Bushwick on Myrtle Avenue, a few steps away from tropical-themed party venue Bossa Nova Civics Club. I’ve hosted my queer Caribbean party “No Badmind” at Mood Ring and the uplifting energy and inclusiveness is what keeps me coming back. The drinks list features astrology-themed cocktails ($11) and this is definitely my go-to spot for a good late night.Looking for a holiday with a difference?

In the last three weeks alone, two of the most notorious examples have made their way to screen. Admittedly one – Amazon’s Good Omens – functions as a pretty watertight argument for never trying to adapt an unfilmable book. But the other is Catch-22, and that functions as an equally watertight argument to the contrary.I have to admit that I didn’t see this coming. Throughout its gestation, the Catch-22 series seemed like an almighty act of hubris as if Hulu, still drunk on the success of The Handmaid’s Tale, went out of its way to adapt an even more knotty work. Catch-22’s unfilmable reputation came about in part because someone did try to film it once, in the form of Mike Nicholls’ 1970 feature, and the results were patchy at best. A similar fate of smug, too wacky mediocrity seemed inevitable.And yet somehow they have pulled it off. The Catch-22 series is successful in almost every way. It is beautifully shot, thoughtfully written and incredibly well acted. It takes plenty of liberties with Joseph Heller’s book – there are approximately 25 fewer characters, almost no flashbacks and the ending is entirely different – but, having seen the series, I have come to the conclusion that these changes are exactly what make it sing.I’ll try to stay clear of spoiler territory, but the biggest decision made by the film-makers was to break the book apart and put it back together in the right order. The book hops about all over the place, leaping from viewpoint to viewpoint and back and forth through time. It’s a terrific sleight-of-hand – when Heller decides to fill in the blanks caused by this literary restlessness, it comes as a punch in the guts – but it would have made for an incredibly annoying TV show.Instead, the series takes its time to wear down its protagonist, bombardier John Yossarian (Christopher Abbott). His downfall is parcelled out carefully along the way, and each new attempt to escape his fate brings about new and awful consequences. By the time he is finally broken, it has a feeling of inevitability that wasn’t present in the novel. It also reinforces the notion that Yossarian is a classic antihero, rather than a sane innocent trapped in a world of madness. Every time he tries to wriggle free of his commitments, he causes something terrible to happen to someone else. When this happened in the book, everything was rationalised through prose. Without that safety net, Yossarian quite often just comes off as a dick. Perversely, this makes him a little easier to understand.Speaking of prose, another smart decision was to avoid Heller’s tone as often as possible. The book is a smashed Rubik’s cube, full of repetition, circular reasoning and busted logic. All the characters are trapped by their own thought patterns, which is fun to read but – as anyone who has watched every episode of the tonally similar W1A can attest – can be brutal to sit through. It still happens here and there, so the doctor’s explanation of insanity is thankfully still intact, but it isn’t quite as punishing. Stripping the plot back and rebuilding it in the shape of a classic drama feels like a something of a masterstroke.Especially compared with Good Omens, which suffered enormously from how faithful it was to the book. I don’t know anyone, aside from those falling within the very highest percentile of Terry Pratchett fandom, who didn’t groan in despair when Amazon’s adaptation opened with several minutes of arch narration over what seemed to be a deliberate copy of QI’s opening titles. Catch-22, less in thrall to its fans, is much more confident in its ability to take on a new shape, and this makes it far easier to watch.It also feels more open-ended, as if Hulu has already entertained the idea of lengthening the series out beyond the source material. Let’s hope that the failure of the last two Handmaid’s Tale seasons is enough to put them off. However, if this was always intended to be a finite six-episode retelling, then Catch-22 might just go down as the first time that anyone has successfully filmed an unfilmable novel.Catch-22 airs Thursdays, 9pm on Channel 4"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d3456b9d369a3802f35ccfb8ef120dfb48b24c46/1217_1039_3286_1972/master/3286.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=da84e941fa211cee3227a6fb5bcd0073","title":"i wake up around 430am top chef adria wus recipe for a productive week","story":"In a series on the efficiency secrets of highly productive people, restaurant chain owner and Sunday Brunch regular Adria Wu explains why she loves to start her day early and how some clever productivity innovations bring order to her busy scheduleThanks to her previous life in finance and engineering, Adria Wu professes to being more “annoyingly detailed” than others in her industry.

And her early morning starts, a focus on team management and her embrace of nifty productivity systems means there are still enough hours in the day for her to enjoy life beyond work – and even spend a bit of time in the kitchen with her first love: food.I normally wake up earlier on Monday mornings – around 4.30am. The rest of the week it’s usually around 5.30am. If I don’t set my week on Monday morning the rest of the week starts falling behind. I can’t work at night so early in the morning I find time to get organised for the day, get my thoughts sorted and understand my own priorities.I have a written to-do list. I know a lot of people on my team use the Sticky Notes function on their laptops so they always have it on their devices. I like having my quiet time in the mornings, if I’m having a cup of tea I don’t really want to get overwhelmed by my phone or laptop. I have my notebook instead and I can think without any distraction about what I need to get done for the day.I usually eat breakfast with my daughter after she wakes up. My mornings are spent with her until her nanny arrives at 10am. I try to squeeze in a quick one-hour workout either with my trainer, or on my Peloton bike – which lives in my room and is a constant reminder for me to work out.I calendarise everything. If I need an hour to check emails, I put it in the calendar, if I need half an hour for a call, I put that in my calendar. If my nanny is off for four hours or my husband needs to travel, that goes in as well. My staff also do it so I don’t bother them when their time is blocked off. I mix all my social plans and work into one big calendar, it’s a tool I find really, really important.Most days I have meetings here and there, but one day a week is dedicated to team meetings. I have about 30 people on my team and we all have one-to-one meetings with our direct reports. Throughout the week we use collaborative online docs to jot down any issues that come up that we want to discuss, for example, if I want to make changes to pricing. It means the team isn’t calling each other every time something happens at a store.It also means less time organising, updating and checking actionable points and more time to think strategically about the business. And it’s much more reliable to have things recorded on a page, as there’s a much lower risk of miscommunication.As a business we probably spend a disproportionate amount of time on good HR practices. It’s so important to have the right team supporting me. To make sure everyone is at their most productive, we ensure everyone’s job description is shared. So anyone from the kitchen porter to the head of operations has my job description and vice versa.I love leaving voice messages for the team on WhatsApp. I started doing this because some investors I work with are based abroad and calling long distance over the time zone differences is not so easy. Now, we all do it. For example, if my head chef goes to see some new central kitchens, he records photos, videos and two-minute voicemails that he sends over instead of writing everything down in an email. This simple technology really makes it much more efficient to communicate and share ideas.I take part in a mentorship program called Mentor Matcher. I take on up to two interns at a time and they come in at least three times a week. I come from a spreadsheet and PowerPoint background so they’re always showing me new and interesting tools. One of them introduced me to Canva for design – it is like Photoshop but online-based and much simpler to use. This reduces the time spent sharing files back and forth.I miss cooking a lot. I have a wonderful head chef who takes care of the day-to-day menus in stores. I don’t get to do as much physical cooking, but I do get to do some recipe testing. Right now, I’m working on a porridge recipe with a magazine and researching vegetable-based recipes for a show I’m presenting.I love having a glass of wine to wind down in the evening. Even though we do nutritious food at Maple and I teach and talk about all things healthy and amazing for your body, I find having a glass of wine really relaxing.I find my brain stops working around 8.30pm. I try to get home around 7pm and see my daughter before she goes to bed. I love to cook dinner at home and watch cooking shows or sitcoms on Netflix. The last thing I do is have a hot shower. I find it super relaxing and it’s one of my favourite things to do at night.SAP Concur provides intelligent solutions to help your business automate admin tasks such as expenses and invoices – giving you and your business the time and energy to focus on growing, innovating and making fruitful connections.

Leading campaigners on how to look after yourself before heading back into the frayEvery week it seems there is something new to protest about. If we are now in the Anthropocene age – where human effects on the globe take precedence over nature – we are also in the age of activism, one of protesting against our damaging impact on the world. This dissent has moved beyond the fringes of political engagement to packing our streets with people and placards bearing slogans that range from seeking to stave off climate change to stopping Donald Trump and staying in the EU. Protests are increasingly taking in wider age ranges and demographics, too, but for those grassroots organisers for whom this is a long-term mission, the toll of such responsibility can be a heavy one.Activism comes with all the stresses of any job – long hours, “office” politics and overflowing inboxes. Couple this with the fact that activism is in a sense defined by its marginality and the job sits firmly between a rock and a hard place. How, then, do activists stay motivated when the odds are against them?Bill McKibben, environmentalist and author“Try to spend a little time outdoors, whether it is in a city park or out in the woods or mountains. One of the things we are fighting for is a world where nature still has some place and so it’s good to get out and remind ourselves of that. I try to get outside every day, just for a few minutes. If I can just see the sky, that’s good sometimes I only want to see the stars for a few minutes and that makes me feel worthwhile.”Eve Ensler, playwright and feminist activist“It is important to realise that the struggle is long, so you have to take care of your body. You have to have pleasure, joy and humour in your life, otherwise you just become bitter and full of sadness. Nature is critical, dance is critical, sex is critical.“Pleasure is what fuels us. Sometimes when we are doing this work, it can feel like we are not allowed to feel anything but pain, yet having done this work for a long time, if you want to keep going you need to have joy, as that’s what will keep you motivated to go back.”Bisi Alimi, LGBT activist“I can get a lot of online abuse for the work that I do, as well as often seeing a lot of trauma from fellow LGBT people who reach out to me. That used to give me very intense anxiety. I have started going to the gym regularly for my mental health and sometimes, when I am really angry, I will go to a boxing class, which helps me get it out of my system. This allows me to see whatever has upset me less personally. I go to the gym five times a week and I also run at least twice a week, so every day I am doing something active that allows me to disconnect.”Harry Gay, founder of Lesbians and Gays Support the Migrants“Anger is an important motivator and it is important we don’t shy away from it as a driver for change. It is natural to be angry about the state of the world and at the things we see that are unjust. We’re often told that anger is a negative emotion and that we should shy away from it perhaps interpersonally that is true, but on a structural level it is important to not get sad about what is happening around you but to get angry and then to channel it in the right way, through action. That is what keeps us going and fighting for migrant rights and for all those who are discriminated against we cannot get despondent.”Patrisse Cullors, founder of Black Lives Matter“I’m a big proponent of therapy and always tell activists and organisers that they should be seeing a therapist to get them through. We are on the frontlines hearing so many painful stories from so many people that we become therapists ourselves, but we are not trained, so it creates an unfortunate environment for burnout.“I have been doing activism since I was 16 years old, but I soon found out that it was triggering difficult memories from my childhood and was having an impact on how I saw myself – I couldn’t separate myself from the people I was organising. I have been doing this for 20 years now and the only reason I have been able to do it for so long is because I have been relying on other people’s skill sets to help me take care of myself and be a better person.“People forget that activists are human beings and that there is a lot at stake for us. Often we do this work because it’s what we have experienced ourselves.”Gina Miller, anti-Brexit campaigner and lobbyist“What can stop me in my tracks are those who attack my family and do it premeditatively, those who rant to my children, put it in an envelope and send it to my address. To get a letter which says, ‘We know where your children are, we’ll be taking them today,’ is truly shocking.“When that happens, I have to cry and let it out because you can’t hold it all in. There is a temptation that as activists we have to be strong all the time, but in private you have to look after yourself and let your emotions come out when they arise. I will cry it out, I will hug my family and then refocus on what I am doing and get ready to keep going again. I will take the negative energy and redirect it into something positive.”Miqdaad Versi, anti-Islamophobia campaigner“My parents sacrificed so much as immigrants coming to this country and working all hours to send me to a private school, which they thought would give me the best chance in life. While I might not agree with private schools as an institution, I understand how important it was for my parents that I succeed in life, so I have a responsibility to them to not only do well but to stand up for others like them and to make society a better place for everyone.“I have been lucky that my parents worked so hard for me and that means I can and should take the time to continue my activism. Knowing what they went through pales in comparison to my struggles and that keeps me going.”Owen Jones,  columnist and activist“It is important to feel that you are part of a broader movement for justice and that you are not just some isolated inidual in fear. I spend a lot of time with LGBT activists, socialists, feminists and anti-racism activists, and this reminds me that I am part of a collective struggle. The attacks I receive aren’t personal and I am not the only person who gets them – these people just hate the things we are fighting for and believe in. It should never become background noise but, equally, I wouldn’t want to be intimidated by it because that would be giving them a victory they don’t deserve. We have to maintain our solidarity in the face of the far right.”Lucy Gavaghan, 17, environmental campaigner“You have to realise that, as one person, you can’t change everything and do it all. If you start feeling guilty that you are not doing all the right things it can really set you back and mean that you are not making progress. You need to give yourself time to step back from your cause and what you are fighting for because then, when you go back to it, you are ready and not exhausted.“In a way, school work can be a good way to step back and it doesn’t become too pressurised if I stay on top of it. Through the campaigning I can keep a wider perspective on changing the world and through school I can also focus on my own future.”Sam Knights, Extinction Rebellion“Finding people to talk to and support you is incredibly important. I cannot describe the huge emotional weight that was lifted for me when I first felt comfortable talking about the climate crisis and how that was affecting my mental health. It’s easy to feel like we are alone but there are thousands of people who feel like this and they want to talk to you, too. So please, as a first step, start talking to people about it.”Ryan Hart, domestic abuse campaigner“My brother Luke and I campaign against domestic abuse because our mother and sister Charlotte were killed by our father. That means that we spend all day speaking about our trauma. It gets very emotional. However, the dogs that we share have really helped us. They have shown us how to live in the moment and they are always happy as long as we are there. Luke and I were at university for most of the dogs’ early years and Mum and Charlotte were the ones who raised them. The dogs have mannerisms which remind me of them and it keeps their memory alive.”Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, cook and environmental campaigner“I have a cold shower every morning to wake me up and get me going. I have a blast of cold water for a minute or two and that is a real shock to the system when you first start, but it helps you go through the day with a spring in your step. It’s almost like the worst thing that could happen to you all day has already happened. It’s never a pleasant feeling when that cold water comes down, but you always feel so much better for having done it. No matter how hard things have been in the days before, that cold water is a ‘reset’ it means each day starts anew.”Ash Sarkar, journalist and activist“I quite enjoy that feeling of sparring with someone online. It is a reclamation of your agency. Twitter is also a little crucible for comedy it trains the bit of your brain that puts together things that are incongruous or funny.“It is important to remember that a lot of activists aren’t at the sharp end of this politics. We are leading relatively comfortable and protected lives and the people who are on the frontlines live in fear and can’t speak up for themselves. The thing that makes me feel a great sense of purpose and political will is that these people have never stopped fighting or organising because they don’t have the luxury of giving up – it is a fight for survival. If they can do it, so can I – even on Twitter.”Aderonke Apata, LGBT activist, founder of African Rainbow Family“Each time we think we have tackled an issue, another one rears its ugly head. There is no way that I or any other activist in the world can solve all of its problems, but we have to keep sight of the small victories those are the ones that keep us going.“If any of the people we work with get granted asylum, it is a huge victory for me and shows us that we are doing good. Although there is a lot that we still need to change, it gives me satisfaction that we are moving in the right direction. We need to remember to celebrate that small step towards disrupting the whole system.”Farhana Yamin, human rights lawyer and environmentalist“I didn’t watch the Channel 4 report on me getting arrested for gluing my hands outside the Shell building for weeks, until my daughter said it had got more than 1m views. I started reading the comments online and the majority were positive, but there were lots that were very offensive and rude. However, it did make me realise that for every nasty comment, there are many more constructive ones, supporting the cause and pushing me to do better. Even though there is never enough time to read and respond to everything, I want to make the conscious choice to engage as much as possible as that is the only way to keep going. We need to encourage discussion within the movement – and with the public who might be against us.”Tarana Burke, founder of the #MeToo movement“Our work as activists can be incredibly challenging and personal you have enormous responsibilities to speak up for those who have been victimised and abused. Yet, of course you can’t speak for everyone and all causes, and that can make you feel incredibly guilty. It is important, then, to remember that the arc of progress is long and that we have to pick our battles, to stand up for what we believe in and who we speak for. If you try to do everything at once, you just won’t be able to succeed.”Robin Morgan, poet and radical feminist“I look around me to stay motivated. People need to do something active and positive, however small. Write a letter, send an email. Picket, march, protest, sign a petition, sit in. Join a group and multiply your effect. Run for office. Say what you actually think. You can’t wring your hands and roll up your sleeves at the same time, so do something – and right away you will feel better. So will the world.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a2ac6f4eb46720977891a3b2c1aaa79a742c3517/101_477_3078_1847/master/3078.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1e77b3c5be6ddc505ab765aac5baa306","title":"giulio regenis parents demand italy recall cairo ambassador","story":"Family of researcher say Egypt is impeding investigation into Regeni’s deathThe family of Giulio Regeni, the Italian doctoral student who was murdered in Egypt in 2016, are demanding that Rome withdraw its ambassador to Cairo for a second time in response to what they say is Egyptian pressure on their lawyers and efforts to prevent investigation into their son’s death.“Enough is enough,” Paola and Claudio Regeni said in a joint statement with their lawyer, Alessandra Ballerini. “The withdrawal of the Italian ambassador from Cairo can no longer be postponed.”Italy recalled its ambassador in April 2016 in objection to Egypt’s unwillingness to cooperate with an investigation into the murder of the 28-year-old.Regeni’s mutilated body was found on an outlying Cairo desert highway in February that year, eight days after he disappeared while researching trade unions in Egypt. An Italian autopsy found his corpse bore the hallmarks of torture, and there were widespread suspicions that Egyptian officials were responsible.An Italian ambassador returned to Egypt in August 2017 in an effort to “reinforce judicial cooperation and as a consequence the search for the truth,” according to the then foreign minister, Angelino Alfano.But in the two years since, Italian officials have accused their Egyptian counterparts of impeding their investigation and of failing to provide vital evidence that could show how Regeni disappeared and who was responsible for his death. The Regeni family and Ballerini said the Egyptian authorities were instead focused on intimidating their legal team in Cairo.“This is an outrageous and disturbing attitude,” the statement said. “At this point the only possible step is to withdraw the ambassador.”A spokesman for the Egyptian ministry of foreign affairs repeatedly declined to respond when contacted by the  to ask about the Regenis’ comments.Maha Ahmed, of the Cairo-based Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms, is under investigation and risks imprisonment, according to the ECRF. The commission tracks enforced disappearances like Regeni’s, while some of their employees act as the Regeni family’s Egyptian legal counsel.“With Maha, they are repeating the same scenario as Amal Fathy,” said Mohammed Lotfy, the executive director of ECRF. Lotfy’s wife, Amal Fathy, was arrested during a dawn raid at their home last May and imprisoned until December, accused of a range of charges including “spreading false news” and membership of a terrorist group.Lotfy and the ECRF believe the Egyptian authorities are seeking to prevent them from working on the Regeni case by intimidating ECRF employees and their family members. “I think the message is clear: take your hands off the case or else you’ll get hurt,” said Lotfy, adding that Ahmed’s husband, Mohammed Helw, was one of the ECRF lawyers granted power of attorney by the Regeni family.An ECRF researcher, Ibrahim Ezz El Din, was forcibly disappeared a week ago. A team headed by Sherif Magdy Abdel Al, an Egyptian National Security Agency official, arrested a second lawyer, Haitham Mohamedeen, on 13 May. Abdel Al is one of five Egyptian NSA members named by Italian prosecutors last November as suspects in Regeni’s disappearance.Italian officials are continuing to maintain pressure on Egypt. “Giulio’s parents will not be alone,” wrote the Ppresident of the Italian parliament, Roberto Fico, in a statement on Facebook. “Next week we will talk about Giulio with the German Bundestag: Giulio was not in fact just an Italian researcher, but a European one. It is a matter that concerns and must concern all the countries of the union.”Italian prosecutors confirmed they had requested further evidence from their Egyptian counterparts after a new witness came forward testifying that one of the five accused men was overheard discussing Regeni’s kidnapping at an African security conference in 2017.The ECRF believes that the Egyptian authorities are unwilling to shed light on Regeni’s case owing to what it could reveal about the widespread practice of enforced disappearances in the country, where civilians are covertly arrested without legal representation or access to their families. The ECRF documented 230 cases of enforced disappearances between August 2017 and September last year.“The authorities say there are no enforced disappearances in Egypt,” said Lotfy. “Yet while we are working on the case of a forcibly disappeared Italian researcher in Egypt, they forcibly disappear one of our staff members working on one of the most important cases,” he said. “They’re unafraid of public opinion. They want the world to believe what cannot be believed.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1c4cc3966eb00cc9e08a628c93f77e4f4c02e067/537_178_1795_1077/master/1795.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a156ebbd43601eb672c115927d8a2c3a","title":"slovakias liberal president zuzana caputova makes first visit to czech republic","story":"Zuzana Čaputová’s arrival in Prague comes as activists plan fresh protests against rightwing Czech governmentSlovakia’s newly installed liberal president, Zuzana Čaputová, has arrived in the Czech Republic on an official visit that will culminate in a symbolic visit to the grave of Václav Havel, the former dissident who was the first post-communist leader of the former Czechoslovakia.Čaputová lay flowers at the Havel family plot in Prague’s Vinohrady cemetery in a mark of respect to a man she has identified as a role model and a statement of her own self-avowed values of tolerance and decency. Havel led the protests that resulted in the fall of the communist regime in the 1989 Velvet Revolution.The wreath-laying event came after she was greeted at Prague Castle by Miloš Zeman, the populist Czech president whose controversially outspoken views are seen as the polar opposite of what his new Slovak counterpart represents.The two leaders exchanged friendly words but appeared ill at ease as a brass band played during a welcome ceremony attended by senior Czech politicians and other dignitaries.There were fears beforehand that the meeting might be marred by Zeman’s penchant for politically insensitive and sometimes sexist remarks.The visit followed a convention established after the 1993 dissolution of Czechoslovakia into the separate states of the Czech Republic and Slovakia that the presidents of each country should call on the other as their first trip abroad.But the visit of Čaputová, five days after her inauguration last Saturday, carried added piquancy because her political outlook is so at odds with Zeman’s. It also came as liberal activists were preparing to stage what they promise will be the biggest protest rally yet this Sunday against Andrej Babiš, the Czech prime minister and Zeman’s political ally who has faced a series of demonstrations demanding his resignation over perceived corruption and conflicts of interest.Čaputová was not scheduled to meet Babiš, who was in Brussels for a European council meeting.By visiting the grave of Havel, however, she appeared to be drawing explicit attention to the contrast between current Czech politics and her election in March, which followed a wave of popular protests in Slovakia over the murder last year of Ján Kuciak, a journalist who was investigating corruption, and his fiancee.Čaputová was greeted by a small number of Czech well-wishers at Havel’s grave, some waving Slovak flags, with whom she briefly chatted afterwards and posed for selfies. The group all repeated “yes” in unison when asked if they wished Čaputová was president of the Czech Republic.Analysts and political activists say Čaputová – a lawyer who came to public attention by successfully leading the fight against an illegal landfill site in Slovakia – is seen as a ray of hope by many Czechs, who despair at the state of local politics but bemoan a lack of alternatives.“It’s an inspiration for us to see that in Slovakia civil society can work to create not just a new party but to win a presidential election,” said Benjamin Roll, deputy leader of the Million Moments for Democracy movement that has organised the anti-Babiš rallies. “There was a lot of sadness last year that Miloš Zeman was re-elected despite all he had done. Now these people look at Slovakia and see some hope that we can find someone like Čaputová in the next presidential election.”Jiří Pehe, director of New York University in Prague and a Czech political analyst, said many Czech people were “projecting their political aspirations” on to Čaputová. “I see a lot of people on social media who would not be typical fans of Václav Havel but who are unhappy with the current president and say openly that they would be happy if someone like her became president here,” he said.In an interview with the  this year, Čaputová identified Havel – who died in 2011 and became the first president of the Czech Republic after Czechoslovakia’s breakup – as one of her political heroes. “I consider Václav Havel to be one of the most inspiring political leaders, specifically in that authenticity that he exuded,” she said.Michael Žantovský, director of the Václav Havel library and author of a biography of the late leader, said Čaputová was an apt successor. “Her visit is symbolic because Havel had always expressed hope that his successor might be a woman,” he said. “I believe she is a worthy representative of his values.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5a39afaf1f92f89511bc17904ea5f33100e8f67/0_374_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=81f39ae3cbed60a795a802e80e10feb5","title":"sommaroy island norway attempt create first time free zone","story":"Residents of Sommarøy, bright 247 in summer, say they want to do ‘what we want, when we want’The 350 residents of Sommarøy in the land of the midnight sun are hoping to free themselves from the tyranny of the clock by declaring the small Norwegian island the world’s first time-free zone.“All over the world, people are characterised by stress and depression,” Kjell Ove Hveding, the leader of the campaign on the island, west of Tromsø and inside the Arctic circle, told the Norwegian public broadcaster NRK.“In many cases this can be linked to the feeling of being trapped by the clock. We will be a time-free zone where everyone can live their lives to the fullest … Our goal is to provide full flexibility, 247. If you want to cut the lawn at 4am, then you can do it.”The islanders, whose main sources of income are tourism and fishing, are calling for formal opening hours to be abolished and people to be allowed to “do what we want, when we want” – although children will still have to go to school, Hveding said.Sommarøy spends November to January in darkness, but in summer residents know that when the sun rises on 18 May, it will not set again until 26 July.“It’s constant daylight,” Hveding said on the campaign’s Facebook page. “If you want to paint your house at 2am, it’s OK. It we want to take a swim at 4am, we will.”The residents added: “Here we enjoy every minute of the midnight sun, and yes, a coffee with friends on the beach at 2am is a normal thing.”Tourism officials told NRK they suspected the campaign was mainly a clever ploy to attract more summer visitors, but a philosophy professor has hailed it as an intriguing idea.“It’s a fascinating concept,” said Truls Egil Wyller of the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim. Society had been ruled by the clock “and so disciplined in a very special way” only for the past two centuries, he said.“Before that, you worked mostly as long as it was necessary, you ate food when you were hungry and you lay down when you were tired. In modern society, everything we do is controlled by the pace of the clock, from the moment we get up.”He said though that residents of Sommarøy would not find life without time particularly easy. “I’m not going to say it’s impossible to pull a whole island out of the global clock,” he told the broadcaster. “But it does sounds very difficult.”After a public meeting in May, the islanders last week handed the local MP, Kent Gudmundsen, a petition calling for the scheme to be debated in parliament. He told the iTromsø newspaper it sounded exciting and suggested it could be considered as a third option alongside summer and winter time.Visitors to Sommarøy have reportedly embraced the idea enthusiastically, with some abandoning their watches and attaching them to a bridge leading to the island.But not all residents are so sure. “I can foresee challenges with some guests when it comes to checking in and checking out, and the opening hours of the bar and restaurant,” said Malin Nordheim, a receptionist at the Sommarøy Arctic hotel. “I’m a little sceptical.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e78c6682352eab1f9d7f349c5564e177a9ee0b58/0_0_6089_3655/master/6089.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7a51e2baec326ca0b22fb08e48faa8ee","title":"venice mayor luigi brugnaro urges unesco to place city on world heritage blacklist","story":"Luigi Brugnaro says he has no faith in Italy’s government to resolve cruise ship problemThe mayor of Venice has urged Unesco to place the city on its world heritage site blacklist as he lambasted Italy’s transport minister for failing to endorse a plan to ert cruise ships from the busy Giudecca canal.Luigi Brugnaro’s frustration has been brewing since a huge vessel crashed into a tourist boat on the canal in early June, injuring four people.“We will write to Unesco to ask for the city to be put on the blacklist,” he told Radio 24. “Venice is in danger and we feel in danger.”Brugnaro said the city had no faith in the government, and felt particularly let down by the transport minister, Danilo Toninelli, who has rejected a plan agreed by Italy’s previous administration that would have closed off the canal to cruise ships.After the crash, which provoked more protests against cruise ships in the lagoon, Toninelli said a solution would be announced soon. Toninelli, a member of the Five Star Movement, which often fights against major infrastructure projects, visited the city last week – by helicopter.A source at the local authority said he did not meet the city’s leaders to discuss the original plan or his alternative proposals, which include building a new cruise ship terminal at either the Lido San Nicolò or in Chioggia, a coastal town south of Venice. Toninelli has suggested putting the options to a referendum on his party’s online platform, Rousseau, which it often uses to craft policy.Unesco originally gave authorities until 2017 to undertake measures to protect Venice’s monuments and preserve its fragile environment, or risk the city being put on its endangered world heritage list. That deadline was extended by a year, and again until 2021 as leaders showed encouraging signs of making improvements in terms of managing the tourism flow.Their most crucial task, however, was to come up with a plan to ert cruise ships. The project agreed in 2017 foresaw those weighing more than 96,000 tonnes entering the lagoon via the Malamocco canal to reach the mainland area of Marghera, where a passenger terminal would be built.

Stock photograph: Thomas_EyeDesignGetty imagesSome women pilots in Irish-registered airlines are being told they have a choice:\u0026nbspterminate their pregnancy or terminate their employment, the president of the Irish Air Line Pilots\u0027 Association (IALPA) has claimed.Capt Evan Cullen told an Oireachtas Committee investigation into bogus self-employment that about half the pilots working in Irish-registered airlines were hired as self-employed contractors.He said all Irish-registered airlines were involved to some extent in employing workers as self-employed contractors with many global airlines, who were “not household names”, setting up companies and registering here to take advantage of Irish labour law.For the pilots there were implications for wages, sick pay, maternity cover and pensions, as well as collective bargaining and other rights.Capt Cullen told the Committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection that many pilots were afraid to speak up.He said women pilots were being told not to get pregnant, and that women\u0026nbsppilots who present as pregnant were told: “you have a choice, you terminate your employment or you terminate your pregnancy”.Capt Cullen said there were important implications for safety involved as pilots were rated against each other for performance.He cited two academic studies from the University of Ghent and the London School of Economics which showed pilots’ decision making was affected by the security of their own position.He said the studies had shown, in cases where pilots had safety concerns, they were more likely to fly if they were contractors.Loss of money to StateCapt Cullen said at a “conservative” estimate the State was at a loss of about €16 million a year in employer PRSI contributions.He also criticised the Department of Transport which he said had referred to the value of “innovative employment measures” in the industry.Bríd Smith TD asked Capt Cullen if Ryanair was one of the airlines which employed contract pilots, and was asked by the chairman of the Committee John Curran to desist form naming any inidual or company.Capt Cullen responded that “all Irish airlines” were involved in hiring contract pilots with practices ranging from 5 per cent contractors, to 100 per cent of the pilots being “in this kind of precarious employment”.He said IALPA had taken part in one Revenue test case on behalf of a pilot, but the case is currently three years running.Joan Collins TD said she deplored “what is happening to women” because of global companies “using Ireland as a tax haven”.She said employment was returning to “the days of 1916” where “people are going down to the docks and looking for work and really afraid they are not going to get that work”.Ms Collins instanced workers in the Ivy restaurant, Dublin, who had a dispute with their employers and who she said were now terrified to speak about their conditions.Thomas Fitzpatrick of the Unite Trade Union said the issue of workers being hired as self-contractors was also rife in the construction industry and the English-language-teaching industry.Mr Curran said a report would be published before the Oireachtas summer recess."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3932045.1561039888!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eu has run out of patience with the uk over brexit varadkar","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEuropean Union’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar shake hands prior to the European Union leaders summit in Brussels. Photograph: Olivier MatthysReutersTaoiseach Leo Varadkar has warned that the EU has run out of patience with the UK and that there is “enormous hostility” among European leaders to any further Brexit extension beyond October.“There is very much a strong view across the European Union that there shouldn’t be any more extensions,” Mr Varadkar said in Brussels on Thursday. “While I have endless patience, some of my colleagues have lost patience quite frankly with the UK and there is enormous hostility to any further extension.“So I think an extension could really only happen to facilitate something like a General Election in the UK or perhaps something like a second referendum if they decided to have one,” Mr Varadkar said. “What won’t be entertained is an extension for further negotiations or further indicative votes – the time for that is long since past.”Mr Varadkar was speaking before entering the two-day summit of EU leaders in Brussels, where the main business will be the allocation of top EU jobs for the next five years. He played down the chances of a breakthrough on an agreement over who should lead the European Commission, the European Council, the European Parliament and the European Central Bank, indicating that a further summit may be required in the coming weeks to strike a deal.“It’s quicker to elect a Pope very often,” Mr Varadkar said.Differences among EU leaders on who should get the jobs, including between France and Germany, as well as between the party groups in the new European Parliament continue despite a frantic last minute round of diplomacy and politicking on Thursday morning.Irish commissionerMr Varadkar reiterated his Government’s backing for the EPP choice to head the European Commission, the German MEP Manfred Weber, but few in Brussels expect Mr Weber to overcome French opposition.He declined to say whether the Government would nominate Irish Commissioner Phil Hogan for another term, though the move is widely expected in political circles.“I’m not going to make that decision until we see who the President of the Commission and the President of the Council is, because, you know, there’s a certain balance to be had,” he said.“Also, a crucial thing aside from the person who will be the next Commissioner for Ireland, is what portfolio we hold.“Needless to say, we are going to want to have one that is influential,” Mr Varadkar said.In a statement earlier in the day, after a meeting with the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier in advance of Thursday’s summit, Mr Varadkar said “Brexit negotiations can only happen with the EU and not with inidual governments, and . . . the Withdrawal Agreement won’t be reopened.”However, he indicated that the EU was willing to rewrite the political declaration which accompanies the withdrawal treaty, and which paves the way for the future trading relationship between the bloc and the UK once it leaves.The statement said Mr Varadkar had a “very good meeting to review the current situation with Brexit”. “Michael Barnier stressed the unity of the 27 members with Ireland and its commitment to the Withdrawal Agreement,”it said.“The Taoiseach and Mr Barnier acknowledged that we now await the election of a new UK Prime Minister and hearing about their proposed approach to Brexit.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3932043.1561031075!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"summit q a what are eu leaders discussing at today s meeting","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar and the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier talk prior to the European Union leaders summit in Brussels on Thursday. Photograph: ReutersAn intensive round of last-minute meetings is underway in Brussels before today’s EU summit in an attempt to strike a broad deal which would fill all the EU’s top jobs for the next five years.Is it just about jobs? Few things enliven politicians more than the prospect of new jobs for politicians few things interest the public less. But it is the main business of this summit and it is vital for the future of the EU.Who leads the EU institutions, and how they do it, has a significant bearing on not just what the EU does, but how it is perceived by its citizens. If this summit is primarily about EU housekeeping it’s no less important for that.So despite expectations that no deal on the jobs would be possible, a flurry of meetings are taking place this morning in advance of the real horse-trading at the summit-proper later.The heads of the European Parliament’s groups are meeting this morning and are due to publish a political programme for the next parliamentary term. More significantly, a meeting of the “co-ordinators” of the three big groups – the liberals, the socialists and the Christian Democrats – is specifically addressing the question of the top jobs.The prime ministers of the liberals – now called “Renew Europe” and incorporating French president Emmanuel Macron’s MEPs – are also meeting, while the socialist group and the EPP will have their usual pre-summit meetings a little later.The President of the European Council Donald Tusk – who, as chairman of the group of heads of government convenes these summits and controls the agenda –\u0026nbsp is also engaging in a last-minute round of contacts with EU leaders. He wants a decision as soon as possible, and diplomats have speculated that if no deal is reached this evening, leaders could return for a special summit next week in order to finalise the slate of appointments before the new European Parliament meets on July 2nd. Some Brussels sources say that the process could drag on into July it all depends on the approach the leaders take this evening.How is it going to play out? The summit will demonstrate how power has shifted dramatically in the European institutions since the last summit. The EPP, which has held all the top jobs in the last term, no longer dominates either the parliament or the council. Its great champion, Angela Merkel, is in the last phase of her career and her influence is waning. How that power moves, and to whose advantage, is the great undercurrent of this summit.What jobs are to be filled? The most important is the presidency of the European Commission, replacing Jean-Claude Juncker who retires when the current commission’s term expires in October.Under a convention applied last time (but not before that) the main groups in the European Parliament propose a lead candidate – or “spitzenkandidat” – before the Parliament elections, and whoever gets the most votes is then nominated by the Council, and approved by the parliament.That process is in trouble for two reasons: firstly, the EPP candidate Manfred Weber is not viewed by many of the leaders (particularly Macron), who has made his opposition blunt) as a candidate of sufficient standing for the Commission job. It’s traditionally the preserve of former prime ministers (as Juncker was), and the prime ministers on the European Council are unsurprisingly in favour of appointing former prime ministers to these important roles.Secondly, while the EPP is the largest group, it would be a stretch to say that it “won” the European Parliament elections, and the other groups have said that they will block his ratification. In other words, as things stand, he doesn’t have the votes.But nor do the other “spitzenkandidaten” – the Dutch socialist Franz Timmermans and the Danish liberal Margrethe Vestager. So various names have been touted as compromises, including the Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier, who is meeting the Taoiseach this morning.What are the other jobs? Whoever is selected for the Commission job, it will be part of a package that also sees the next head of the Council (Tusk’s job), the next ECB President – hugely important, though less political – to succeed Mario Draghi, the next President of the European Parliament (high profile in Brussels, but not that important) and the EU’s High Representative for Foreign Affairs (a second-tier job).It is all about jobs then? Ah no. The leaders will also discuss climate change, the EU’s strategic agenda for the next five years, international affairs and the next EU budget. Tomorrow there will be a discussion on Brexit, ever the Irish priority. EU leaders will be delighted not to have a summit dominated by the question of the UK’s exit, for once. But all are aware of the inexorable progress of Boris Johnson towards Downing St, and what he has been saying to get there. The impending Brexit meltdown in the autumn – when Johnson will come looking for a new deal as the clock ticks down to Brexit day at the end of October – is another reason to agree on the jobs and present a united front."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3932068.1561035034!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"sajid javid eliminated from tory leadership race as gove surges","story":"Candidates for the British Conservative Party leadership race said they were ready for a last day of voting  that will whittle down the contest to the final two who will then face a postal ballot of the party membership.

Photograph: Vickie FloresEPASajid Javid has become the latest candidate to exit the Conservative party leadership race, with the home secretary coming last in the fourth round of voting by Tory MPs, behind Boris Johnson, Michael Gove and Jeremy Hunt.With all 313 MPs again casting votes, Mr Johnson was once more the clear winner, on 157 votes, with Mr Gove overtaking Mr Hunt into second place, with 61 votes to 59. Mr Javid was fourth on 34 votes. Two ballots were spoiled.The focus now shifts to a fifth and final round of votes, in which the final two will be selected, who will be put to a vote of Conservative party members. In effect, this will be a run-off between Mr Gove and Mr Hunt for the right to face Mr Johnson. The result will come at 6pm.The final two will then undertake a long series of hustings events with party members around the country before the winner takes over from Theresa May as Tory leader and prime minister on July 22nd.The result is something of a blow for Mr Hunt, with backers of the foreign secretary seeking to immediately rally support for him. Penny Mordaunt, the defence secretary, said Mr Hunt being in the final two would avoid the drama of a new showdown between Mr Johnson and Mr Gove, who fell out over the 2016 leadership battle.“That doesn’t necessarily mean the best entertainment for journalists, but for people who are going to focus on the issues, the policies, and set out a vision for the party,” she said.A source in the Hunt camp said: “Boris and Michael are great candidates but we have seen their personal psychodrama before: it’s time to offer the country someone the EU will actually talk to.”One of the challenges for Mr Johnson will be to convince Tory members he is serious about making Brexit happen on October 31st.Osborne backingOn Thursday Mr Johnson was formally endorsed by London’s Evening Standard, edited by the remain-backing former chancellor George Osborne, with an editorial in the newspaper predicting that Mr Johnson would end up persuading the Commons to “vote for a repacked version of the existing deal”.In a verdict unlikely to go down well among hard Brexiters – or Mr Johnson’s camp – the editorial noted that he had pointedly not completely guaranteed an exit on October 31st, and was the candidate with the most room to manoeuvre.Theresa May is travelling to Brussels for a European council summit and will miss the second vote. She has entrusted a proxy vote to Charles Walker, the acting co-chair of the 1922 Committee of backbench Tories, which is organising the contest.During the two-hour voting process, Mr Javid arrived with a series of MPs who have supported him and they posed for a photo in the corridor near committee room 14, where the voting took place. Mr Javid told reporters only that he was “hopeful” of progressing.His exit from the race follows that of Rory Stewart, the international development minister, in the third round of voting on Wednesday. – Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

An accompanying message invited students to get in touch via a direct message “if you want tomorrow’s A-level maths, stats and mechanics paper 3 exam”.Others claimed that the entire paper had been leaked and was circulating in group message conversations on the morning of the exam.This is the third consecutive year that questions from Edexcel’s Maths A-level papers have surfaced online ahead of the exam.Police launched an investigation last summer after questions were reportedly circulating online where they were being auctioned off for hundreds of pounds the night before around 50,000 students sat the A-level exam. In 2017, last minute changes were made to the exam paper at some schools after it emerged that questions had been disseminated ahead of the exam.Pearson said that a total of 29 candidates have been disqualified over the two leaks, and police investigating the 2017 breach have now passed a file to prosecutors.This is the first cohort of pupils to take the reformed Maths A-levelA possible criminal offence would be theft, if the exam paper had been improperly obtained from the exam board. Earlier this year, Pearson announced that some of this summer’s exam papers will be micro- in an attempt to combat online leaks. Under the new security initiative, micro-chips were inserted into packs of A-level and GCSE questions, allowing Pearson to track the time, date and location of an exam pack if it is opened prematurely.This means that the school or exam centre in question can immediately be alerted to the breach, which should make it easier for officials to swiftly identify the perpetrator and contain any potential leak before information is circulated more widely.  Some of this summer\u0027s A-level Maths papers were micro-chipped, The Daily  understands, but it is unclear whether the questions that were were leaked online had been included in the pilot. Roughly 60,000 students took EdExcel’s Maths A-level, which consisted of three exam papers spread over last week and this week.    This is the first cohort of pupils to take the reformed Maths A-level, which was designed to be more challenging and better prepare sixth form students for university.Pupils set up a petition to demand “some form of compensation” or “special consideration” after finding the exam “extremely difficult and unreasonable”.The petition, which by Friday night had accrued over 11,000 signatures, complained that the questions on the exam board Edexcel’s Maths A-level papers were “unlike any specimen, past or textbook questions”.A separate petition claimed that students’ hopes of attending university have been “shattered” thanks to the Maths exams.But Pearson, which owns the exam board, said that students should be “reassured” that grade boundaries are set depending on the difficulty of each exam.They explained that this “ensures a fair system, so that students of the same ability will be awarded the same grade in different years, even if there are differences in the demand of papers”.Ofqual, the exams watchdog, uses a system called “comparable outcomes” to ensure that roughly the same proportion of pupils get similar grades each year, and those who are the first to take the new, reformed courses are not at a disadvantage compared to other cohorts. “All students should be reassured we have well-established processes in place to ensure no-one will be advantaged or disadvantaged, and this paper will not have to be resat.”An Ofqual spokesperson said they are aware of “allegations of malpractice or wrongdoing in relation to Edexcel’s maths paper” and are working with Pearson to establish the facts.Nationwide investigation launched into far-Right threats against German politicians Former school teacher Chris Dawson charged with underage sex after viral murder mystery podcastSchool forced to apologise after it organised \u0026#39best looking pupil\u0026#39 contest UK\u0026#39s most senior Catholic \u0026#39more concerned with church\u0026#39s reputation than child sex abuse victims\u0026#39, report findsNicola Sturgeon vows to reassure parents over safety of school built on landfill site after four cancer casesIreland\u0026#39s prime minister warns of EU-27\u0026#39s \u0026#39enormous hostility\u0026#39 against Brexit extensionComment: Like #NeverTrump Republicans, Labour moderates are rallying around Corbyn at the first hint of powerSpeedboat killer Jack Shepherd wins appeal against conviction for skipping bail, prompting further upset for victim\u0026#39s familyComment: Tory MPs must now choose between a bloodbath and a boring coronationPoldark actress says BBC failed to invite her to premiere of new season because she is middle-aged woman Whales are being released from Russian \u0026#39jail\u0026#39, says Putin during phone-in showPolo club frequented by Prince William and Harry in row with neighbours over plans to double capacityTeenage boy\u0026#39s heart condition discovered by accident while he played with GP mother\u0026#39s stethoscopeTrump says Iran has made \u0026#39big mistake\u0026#39 after spy drone shot down in GulfSenior HSBC banker wins compensation from hairdresser who burned her head during blow dryRoyal charity split: Duke and Duchess of Sussex to leave Royal Foundation Find out which Conservative leadership candidate is right for you with this quickfire quizFrench claim discovery of new ‘cat-fox’ species in Corsican forestCruise ships ‘seized by Russian authorities’, putting hundreds of holidays at riskWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"clean air day find polluted area go breath fresh air","story":"This year’s National Clean Air Day comes at a time when air pollution is still consistently ranked as one of the most serious public health issues faced by the country.Pollution levels in parts of the UK regularly break international air quality standards, but they vary massively around the UK -

This small, dynamic NGO, deploys teams of ex-military, first responders and committed civilians into the heart of natural disasters.Most recently in Mozambique, Team Rubicon’s unique approach and expertise alleviated the desperate circumstances of over 177, 000 people in dire need.  We tackle the challenges that larger charities cannot.But I am frustrated.More than £18 million was raised by the Disasters Emergency Committee from the ever generous British public for humanitarian efforts in Mozambique but Team Rubicon did not see a penny of it.Nor can we access Government funding. DfID spent 75 per cent of the £14.5 billion Official Development Assistance budget last year but Team Rubicon got nothing.Ever get the feeling that the bank will only lend you money when you have it, not when you need it? During the response phase, Team Rubicon delivered 60 per cent of the remote aid outside of Beira in Mozambique but DfID focused solely on the largest NGOs, granting hundreds of millions – they don’t want to support us because we don’t fit their conventional model.Eye of the storm | Hunger stalks a shattered nationTheir strict criteria and stringent processes are, I grant,  reassuring for taxpayers but their approach to funding the very small (less than £250K income) or the very big (at least £10M in reserves) leaves Team Rubicon and our former military and emergency services personnel out in the cold. We\u0027re a young charity but the concept is proven. The larger NGOs do amazing work operate on a staggering scale and are not the target of my frustration – but they need smaller-scale delivery partners if victims are to be properly served in the challenging circumstances that are created by natural disasters. Our people thrive in ‘challenging’, they are built for it and have proved themselves capable and responsive in those environments many times already. Team Rubicon bridges a gap between immediate search and rescue operations and longer term recovery.  Our people load up their backpacks and walk in. They navigate devastated terrain to reach remote communities who would otherwise wait weeks or months for assistance after a natural disaster. Many communities are abandoned to their fate – because they are too hard to reach.In Mozambique our teams of four not only found these forgotten communities they sourced the aid and delivered it by helicopter, truck, motorbike or foot. Many had been without clean drinking water for weeks so our teams carried in portable water purification systems which they then instructed the local people how to use so they could move on to the next task. In emergencies like these, interventions of this nature can be life-saving.Sebastian Rhodes Stamper of the UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in Mozambique, said: “Team Rubicon UK is a critical component of the broader response throughout the affected area. They bring with them determination, drive, professionalism and a highly commendable ‘can-do’ attitude. In short, Team Rubicon UK is a real asset here and is making an extraordinary difference.”Why does this matter? In the last 30 years, more than 2.5 million people have died and over 3 trillion pounds has been lost because of natural disasters. The World Bank reports that almost 75 per cent of the losses are attributable to extreme weather events.We need to get our response right, but Team Rubicon doesn’t just respond when things go wrong –  it’s trying to stop the rot and its disaster risk reduction programmes can help reverse the current trend of rising disaster impact both physically and financially.Cyclone Idai | Clinging to lifePost response and recovery, Team Rubicon\u0027s programmes address the continued human suffering that remains, often for prolonged periods of time. In 2018 there were communities in Lapabesi, Nepal which still had no power three years after the earthquake, relying on kerosene lamps – the equivalent of smoking 20 cigarettes a day. We provided solar power because our teams put the equipment on their backs and carried it through the mountains.We have trained communities in the Caribbean hot to protect their way of life and return to normality more quickly.  In Indonesia and Nepal, we have been able to assist where other International Aid agencies could not. And we are looking at proactive, life changing projects in the DR Congo, Sierra Leone and the BVI.Why should you care? Because we do not, and must not, abandon people who are suffering unimaginable hardship and loss from climate change and natural disasters, simply because of the vagaries of birth and geography. Throughout my life I have worked with those who walk towards danger or suffering to help fellow human beings and it humbles me that Team Rubicon is willing to do it still. And they are volunteers!It cost us £1.01 to help each of the 178,000 people in Mozambique. We cut costs on delivery wherever we could – our teams’ mantras being ‘we are spending your mother’s money’Team Rubicon UK is the plucky underdog swimming with the big dogs and punching way above its weight. It represents the best of Great Britain’s compassion and moral conscience yet despite our best efforts the Government has no desire to support us.There is extraordinary growth potential. With £5 million we could respond to nine UN emergency response deployments plus 10 other international disaster relief operations. It could provide another 2250 Team Rubicon volunteers and cover all training, deployment and operational costs. It would mean we could reach 3.2 million people in need.Five million out of our £14.5 billion UK aid budget doesn’t sound very much when you look at it like that, does it?General Sir Nick Parker is Chairman of Team Rubicon UK  and a former Commander in Chief of UK Land ForcesProtect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Department for International DevelopmentNationwide investigation launched into far-Right threats against German politicians Former school teacher Chris Dawson charged with underage sex after viral murder mystery podcastSchool forced to apologise after it organised \u0026#39best looking pupil\u0026#39 contest UK\u0026#39s most senior Catholic \u0026#39more concerned with church\u0026#39s reputation than child sex abuse victims\u0026#39, report findsNicola Sturgeon vows to reassure parents over safety of school built on landfill site after four cancer casesIreland\u0026#39s prime minister warns of EU-27\u0026#39s \u0026#39enormous hostility\u0026#39 against Brexit extensionComment: Like #NeverTrump Republicans, Labour moderates are rallying around Corbyn at the first hint of powerSpeedboat killer Jack Shepherd wins appeal against conviction for skipping bail, prompting further upset for victim\u0026#39s familyComment: Tory MPs must now choose between a bloodbath and a boring coronationPoldark actress says BBC failed to invite her to premiere of new season because she is middle-aged woman Whales are being released from Russian \u0026#39jail\u0026#39, says Putin during phone-in showPolo club frequented by Prince William and Harry in row with neighbours over plans to double capacityTeenage boy\u0026#39s heart condition discovered by accident while he played with GP mother\u0026#39s stethoscopeTrump says Iran has made \u0026#39big mistake\u0026#39 after spy drone shot down in GulfSenior HSBC banker wins compensation from hairdresser who burned her head during blow dryRoyal charity split: Duke and Duchess of Sussex to leave Royal Foundation Find out which Conservative leadership candidate is right for you with this quickfire quizFrench claim discovery of new ‘cat-fox’ species in Corsican forestCruise ships ‘seized by Russian authorities’, putting hundreds of holidays at riskWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/06/20/TELEMMGLPICT000201184618_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"french claim discovery new cat fox species corsican forest","story":"Researchers believe the cat-fox is a new speciesFor centuries, its furry tail was the stuff of fairy tales on the French Mediterranean island of Corsica.Shepherds recounted sightings of an elusive metre-long, ring-tailed feline with razor-sharp teeth that would attack ewes and goats at night.Now, scientists believe they have finally identified the animal as an entirely new species dubbed the “cat-fox”.It\u0027s a wonderful discovery, said Pierre Benedetti, chief environmental technician of the National Hunting and Wildlife Office (ONCFS).We believe that it\u0027s a wild natural species which was known but not scientifically identified because it\u0027s an extremely inconspicuous animal with nocturnal habits,” he told AFP.Dubbed Ghjattu volpe” by locals and found in the island’s Asco forest, the furry creature resembles a domestic cat in many ways but has distinguishing features, including a black-tipped tail with two to four rings, very wide ears, short whiskers and highly developed canine teeth. Researchers hope to have the \u0026#34fox-cat\u0026#34 recognised and protected within four yearsMeasuring around a metre from head to tail, it has stripes on the front legs, very dark hind legs and a russet stomach. Experts say its silky coat is a natural repellent for fleas, ticks and lice. It\u0027s their size and their tail that earned them the name \u0027cat-fox\u0027 across the island, said Mr Benedetti.The cat-fox is thought to have taken residence in such a remote habitat as it offers water and plant cover from its main predator, the golden eagle.Researchers perfected a method of attracting the creatures to a stick daubed in essence on which it left fur.By looking at its DNA, we could tell it apart from the European wildcat, Felis silvestris silvestris. It\u0027s close to the African forest cat, Felis  silvestris lybica, but its exact identity is still to be determined, Mr Benedetti told AFP.  Using nonviolent methods, the ONCFS captured their first cat-fox in 2016 and have now caught 12 from among 16 felines seen in the area, releasing them swiftly after examination.Officially the creature has not been declared a new species and sceptics suggest it may simply be a cross between a domestic cat from Corsica and neighbouring Sardinia.But the researchers disagree and say they hope to have this cat recognised and protected within two to four years.The cat-fox is part of our shepherd mythology. From generation to generation, they told stories of how the forest cats would attack the udders of their ewes and goats, said Carlu-Antone Cecchini, ONCFS field agent in charge of forest cats.How it ended up in Corsica is unclear, though one theory is that it was brought to the island of beauty by farmers 6,500 years BC. If the hypothesis is true, its origins are Middle Eastern, said Mr Benedetti.Nationwide investigation launched into far-Right threats against German politicians Former school teacher Chris Dawson charged with underage sex after viral murder mystery podcastSchool forced to apologise after it organised \u0026#39best looking pupil\u0026#39 contest UK\u0026#39s most senior Catholic \u0026#39more concerned with church\u0026#39s reputation than child sex abuse victims\u0026#39, report findsNicola Sturgeon vows to reassure parents over safety of school built on landfill site after four cancer casesIreland\u0026#39s prime minister warns of EU-27\u0026#39s \u0026#39enormous hostility\u0026#39 against Brexit extensionComment: Like #NeverTrump Republicans, Labour moderates are rallying around Corbyn at the first hint of powerSpeedboat killer Jack Shepherd wins appeal against conviction for skipping bail, prompting further upset for victim\u0026#39s familyComment: Tory MPs must now choose between a bloodbath and a boring coronationPoldark actress says BBC failed to invite her to premiere of new season because she is middle-aged woman Whales are being released from Russian \u0026#39jail\u0026#39, says Putin during phone-in showPolo club frequented by Prince William and Harry in row with neighbours over plans to double capacityTeenage boy\u0026#39s heart condition discovered by accident while he played with GP mother\u0026#39s stethoscopeTrump says Iran has made \u0026#39big mistake\u0026#39 after spy drone shot down in GulfSenior HSBC banker wins compensation from hairdresser who burned her head during blow dryRoyal charity split: Duke and Duchess of Sussex to leave Royal Foundation Find out which Conservative leadership candidate is right for you with this quickfire quizCruise ships ‘seized by Russian authorities’, putting hundreds of holidays at riskComment: All political parties should follow Change UK\u0026#39s example and adopt the IHRA definition of anti-SemitismWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/06/20/TELEMMGLPICT000201184033_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqT1yghX8zbx7fxQBY89c64XuNz4jGHGsSQrNbcoF3ur4.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"japanese nuclear plant sparks panic ticking wrong box fax wake","story":"Roads were damaged in the 6.7 magnitude earthquakeStaff at the largest nuclear power plant in the world ticked the wrong box on a fax message and triggered an atomic scare after a strong earthquake struck northern Japan on Tuesday evening.The magnitude 6.7 quake shook large parts of the country at 10.22pm on Tuesday and employees of Tokyo Electric Power Co. stationed at the company’s Kashiwazak-Kariwa nuclear plant, in Niigata Prefecture, responded by following established protocol in the event of a natural disaster.A form was faxed to the local government to reassure them that the plant had suffered no damage and was operating normally. Unfortunately, TEPCO staff had ticked the wrong box on the form and informed prefectural authorities that an anomaly had been detected in the reactors.The document was handed to Masahiro Sakurai, the mayor of Kashiwazaki, who - with the March 2011 disaster at the Fukushima nuclear plant still fresh in the memory - immediately ordered his staff to determine the scale of the problem and the measures that TEPCO was taking.Seventeen minutes after the fax was sent, officials at TEPCO’s headquarters in Tokyo noticed the error and released a correction emphasising that the reactors had not been damaged.Shops and homes were damaged by the tremorsTEPCO - which also operated the Fukushima plant and was widely criticised in subsequent inquiries into the 2011 disaster - has confirmed that the initial message had been checked by another official at the plant before it was sent, but there has been no explanation as to how the error was not noticed.Despite being one of the most technologically advanced countries on the planet, many Japanese firms still prefer to communicate via fax.In a statement to The , TEPCO confirmed that employees “mistakenly shared incorrect information when they checked a box indicating there was a power supply abnormality related to the cooling of the spent fuel pool when, in fact, there was no such abnormality.“We sincerely regret the error. TEPCO is looking into the cause and will consider measures going forward”.Mr Sakurai has condemned the operator’s errors.Fukushima: Tokyo was on the brink of catastrophe“When a real earthquake is happening, not a drill, this is a massive error”, he told local reporters.“It is extremely poor on their part to make errors with the most important and basic information at a time of crisis”, the Asahi Shimbun reported.TEPCO has issued an apology and stated that it will not make the same mistake again.The Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear plant was only 12 miles from the epicentre of a magnitude 6.6 quake in July 2007 that shook the facility beyond its design capabilities, causing widespread damage but no leak of nuclear material.The plant was shut for 21 months and underwent seismic upgrades, although it has again been shut down for additional improvements and assessments since the Fukushima disaster.Tuesday’s earthquake left 26 people injured and caused damage to buildings and infrastructure in towns along the Sea of Japan coast. Meteorological authorities issued a tsunami warning but the alert was lifted after waves of around 4 inches were recorded.Nationwide investigation launched into far-Right threats against German politicians Former school teacher Chris Dawson charged with underage sex after viral murder mystery podcastSchool forced to apologise after it organised \u0026#39best looking pupil\u0026#39 contest UK\u0026#39s most senior Catholic \u0026#39more concerned with church\u0026#39s reputation than child sex abuse victims\u0026#39, report findsNicola Sturgeon vows to reassure parents over safety of school built on landfill site after four cancer casesIreland\u0026#39s prime minister warns of EU-27\u0026#39s \u0026#39enormous hostility\u0026#39 against Brexit extensionComment: Like #NeverTrump Republicans, Labour moderates are rallying around Corbyn at the first hint of powerSpeedboat killer Jack Shepherd wins appeal against conviction for skipping bail, prompting further upset for victim\u0026#39s familyComment: Tory MPs must now choose between a bloodbath and a boring coronationPoldark actress says BBC failed to invite her to premiere of new season because she is middle-aged woman Whales are being released from Russian \u0026#39jail\u0026#39, says Putin during phone-in showPolo club frequented by Prince William and Harry in row with neighbours over plans to double capacityTeenage boy\u0026#39s heart condition discovered by accident while he played with GP mother\u0026#39s stethoscopeTrump says Iran has made \u0026#39big mistake\u0026#39 after spy drone shot down in GulfSenior HSBC banker wins compensation from hairdresser who burned her head during blow dryRoyal charity split: Duke and Duchess of Sussex to leave Royal Foundation Find out which Conservative leadership candidate is right for you with this quickfire quizFrench claim discovery of new ‘cat-fox’ species in Corsican forestCruise ships ‘seized by Russian authorities’, putting hundreds of holidays at riskWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 20 june 2019","story":"A visitor looks at \u0027Untitled\u0027 by Keith Haring, part of the American Icons exhibition at the Opera Gallery, New Bond Street, London.Geoff Pugh for The  Nationwide investigation launched into far-Right threats against German politicians Former school teacher Chris Dawson charged with underage sex after viral murder mystery podcastSchool forced to apologise after it organised \u0026#39best looking pupil\u0026#39 contest UK\u0026#39s most senior Catholic \u0026#39more concerned with church\u0026#39s reputation than child sex abuse victims\u0026#39, report findsNicola Sturgeon vows to reassure parents over safety of school built on landfill site after four cancer casesIreland\u0026#39s prime minister warns of EU-27\u0026#39s \u0026#39enormous hostility\u0026#39 against Brexit extensionComment: Like #NeverTrump Republicans, Labour moderates are rallying around Corbyn at the first hint of powerSpeedboat killer Jack Shepherd wins appeal against conviction for skipping bail, prompting further upset for victim\u0026#39s familyComment: Tory MPs must now choose between a bloodbath and a boring coronationPoldark actress says BBC failed to invite her to premiere of new season because she is middle-aged woman Whales are being released from Russian \u0026#39jail\u0026#39, says Putin during phone-in showPolo club frequented by Prince William and Harry in row with neighbours over plans to double capacityTeenage boy\u0026#39s heart condition discovered by accident while he played with GP mother\u0026#39s stethoscopeTrump says Iran has made \u0026#39big mistake\u0026#39 after spy drone shot down in GulfSenior HSBC banker wins compensation from hairdresser who burned her head during blow dryRoyal charity split: Duke and Duchess of Sussex to leave Royal Foundation Find out which Conservative leadership candidate is right for you with this quickfire quizFrench claim discovery of new ‘cat-fox’ species in Corsican forestCruise ships ‘seized by Russian authorities’, putting hundreds of holidays at riskWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"tory leadership race candidate brexit views","story":"Below, we take a look at whos still in the running - andfar-away favourite Boris Johnson could go all the way.The third round of voting took place on June ,  - with one candidate dropping off the ballot.Boris Johnson was the runaway winner with  votes.Jeremy Hunt came in second with , followed by Michael Gove on .Sajid Javid won  votes, while Rory Stewart was knocked out of the contest with just .The remaining contenders for the Conservative crown are Jeremy Hunt, Michael Gove, Sajid Javid, Rory Stewart and runaway leader in the race, Boris Johnson.The former Foreign Secretary quit his role because he disagreed with Theresa Mays plan for Brexit and is currently the bookies favourite to win the leadership contest.Boris Johnson was at the helm of the Vote Leave campaign back in  and nearly beat the current PM to the role after Cameron resigned.Since the referendum the -year-old has been brandishing his leave credentials. In a speech in Switzerland he vowed to take Britain out of the EU with a deal or no deal come October he gets chosen.Johnson said he would hold the EU to ransom and refuse to pay the £billion orce bill unless they agree to more favourable terms for Brexit.He also vowed to slash income tax for three million Brits.He said: Our friends and partners need to understand that the money is going to be retained until such time as we have greater clarity about the way forward.I always thought it was extraordinary that we should agree to write that entire cheque before having a final deal.

He’s just done so again.People who want a second vote on Brexit should go and live in North Korea, he said. Meaning that they had no time for democracy.Gallagher — like almost every bloody pop musician — backed Remain in the ­referendum. But he said: “There’s only one f***ing thing worse than a fool who voted for Brexit. That’s the rise of the c***s trying to get the vote overturned.”His message, then, to the relentlessly moaning Remainers who have tried every trick in the book to get that democratic decision overturned is: Don’t look back in anger — get on with your lives and let Brexit happen.As we decided it must.And here’s the thing. I suspect most Remainers think exactly the same. The people I know who voted Remain were saddened by the referendum result and they wished we’d all voted dferently.But they all believe that the vote must be upheld. And there should not be a second vote.And when I talk to them, they don’t call me a Nazi or a fascist for voting Leave.They don’t suggest I’m too thick to be allowed to vote or that I hate all foreigners.They just agree to dfer on that simple issue of in or out, and there’s no bad ­feeling at all.This is the thing. The politicians and commentators insist Brexit has ­brutally ided the nation. That the wounds will take a long time to heal. That we’re all at each other’s throats. The .million versus the .million.It’s not so at all. The only real ide is between the four or five million Remain voters who simply won’t have it — and the rest of the country.A lot has been written about the people who voted Leave — most of it codswallop.“It was just the poor and the left-behind, the uneducated and the ­xenophobes.”The statistics simply don’t bear that out.People of all walks of le, all levels of education, all ages and all ­backgrounds voted Leave.This is not, however, true of that hardcore of Remainers, between a quarter and a third of that million, who demand we run the vote again.They are insulated from the normal world. When they say they don’t know anyone who voted Leave, they’re telling the truth.They work in professions where ­virtually nobody voted Leave.In our ­universities , in schools , and among luvviesand scientists .And the BBC — I don’t have figures for the BBC but I would guess it’s close to  per cent for Remain.This is the real ide. Between a ­liberal middle-class elite who simply do not understand the hopes and aspirations of the rest of us. And react with absolute fury when they don’t get their own way.When Brexit is over, one way or another, that liberal elite will still be with us, utterly out of touch with the rest of the country.That’s the ide that matters today. A small minority determined to inflict their liberal policies upon the rest of us.THE BBC shoved an imam from Gloucester on to its Tory leadership debate programme and has now had to apologise.Abdullah Patel asked questions of the candidates about anti-Muslim bigotry in their party.

Big mistake.Be proud of your given Christian name, Roderick Stewart. It means great ruler. Rory, I think, just means drunk Glaswegian eating a pie.THE bigger and richer charities get, the less likely they are to do the job they were set up to do.

It will be a shiny new global currency for the st Century, taking on the dollar and the Pound.But I’m not fooled. I think we all know what Facebook is really up to.This is yet another way to harvest data about our financial habits which it can then use for targeted marketing. Critics are already calling it the “most invasive and dangerous form of surveillance ever designed”.Collecting and exploiting information about us is, after all, the whole reason for the company’s existence.Years ago it was basic stuff, like quizzes asking, “What kind of personality type are you ”Fill that in and you are practically begging to be ­targeted in marketing and ­political campaigns. But handing over our spending details is quite another matter.This may be spun as ­connecting the world and ­revolutionising payments but it is really all about tapping the modern-day version of oil — the wells of data.Facebook already knows who you are. Accept Libra and it will know what you are buying, who you’re paying and how much you have.Will it be regulated by the UK Financial Conduct Authority, as banks are in this country  Certainly, the company has not shown much desire for regulation so far — of which more later.But what do we know about how trustworthy, secure or morally sound this would-be money broker is The Cambridge Analytica scandal, where data from million users was shared with political consultants, led to a fine of £, by ­Britain’s Information ­Commissioner’s Office.Last September the company admitted that data from million of its users had leaked due to a security flaw.In  it failed to stop the live broadcast of the torture of a disabled man in Chicago. It has also refused to take down neo-Nazi content.Facebook is under criminal investigation by US prosecutors who are looking into data-sharing deals with, among other, Amazon and Apple. It has been caught out farming data from apps whose users might have been unaware they were feeding information to Facebook.The company was found to be harvesting the dates of female users’ periods via an app which tracked ovulation.Facebook has also been accused of doing little to protect ­vulnerable children from ­promotions of self-harm. British father Ian Russell has directly linked Facebook-owned Instagram to the suicide of his -year-old daughter, Molly.Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg refused to attend the UK ­Parliament’s committee on ­disinformation and “fake news” last year, amid concern the social media giant is ­positioning itself as a news publisher but without ­compliance with any of the regulation or laws governing traditional journalism.The  has been blamed for spreading hatred. In March this year an ­Australian white supremacist live-streamed on Facebook his massacre of  people at two New Zealand mosques.It has further been accused of putting IS terrorists in touch with each other via its “suggested friends” application.When challenged as to why it does not do more to tackle ­terrorism, it falls back on the explanation that it does not have the technology to watch what its .billion users are doing all the time.Yet somehow that does not seem to stop it farming commercially valuable data from our accounts.The same will no doubt turn out to be true about Libra. This week French finance ­minister Bruno Le Maire warned that the cryptocurrency would inevitably be used by terrorists and criminals to sht money around undetected.When it happens, Facebook will no doubt shrug its corporate shoulders once more and say it is powerless to stop it.In theory, the very complex nature of cryptocurrencies means that it should be near impossible for anyone to steal our money.But we have all heard the horror stories. The best-known cryptocurrency, ­Bitcoin, ­at first soared in value, ­making millions for people who latched on to it early. But  months ago it crashed.Of course, most of us like to shop on the internet — and e-commerce is only likely to grow in the coming years.But most of us do it with our bank cards or direct from accounts which hold our money in a ­currency which is backed by the central bank of a First World country.This means we can be ­reasonably sure the currency won’t ­suddenly disappear or become valueless. It is quite another matter doing business in a currency that is backed by internet firms.How can we be sure that Facebook will still be around in a few years’ time Of course, banks sometimes go bust, but at least we have some protection in the form of the Government’s financial services compensation scheme which will refund up to £, of savings in the event of a failure.Facebook claims Libra will be backed by an independent foundation in Switzerland and will be free from the kind of speculation that drove the value of Bitcoin, because its value will be linked to a basket of currencies.But I’m sorry, I’m just not buying it.

It is however unclear whether government is achieving its objectives in the  UK Aid Strategy.“Government does not know whether giving responsibility for spending ODA to a larger number of departments has had the impact it intended. And its progress in improving the transparency of spending has been slow.“While there is good evidence that many aid programmes are securing an impact inidually, government does not know whether all parts of ODA, taken together, are securing value for money.”The reports piled pressure on Aid Secretary and Tory leadership candidate Rory Stewart.Responding to the reports he said last night: “The NAO report raises questions about how aid is spent across government.“So I will be working closely with my colleagues in other aid-spending departments to support them and ensure they benefit from DfID’s expertise.

with levels reaching very high for most of the country.Pretty bad newsyoure one of the estimated  million hay fever sufferers in Britain.But is it a legitimate reason to take time off work For those lucky enough not to get hay fever, it may seem a ridiculous suggestion - nothing more than a pathetic excuse.But in severe cases, the allergy can trigger deadly asthma attacks, with others left unable to drive and operate machinery due to their symptoms and the drugs they have to take to try to get some relief.Allergy expert Dr Jean Emberlin previously told The Sun: If symptoms are severe enough to impact your ability to do your job, certainly take a day off sick.Depending on what your job is, having very watery eyes or frequently sneezing may have a signicant enough bearing on your ability to perform at the required level.And in those cases, taking a day off work is a necessary measure.Another key point is that evenpeople arent off work as a result of their hay fever, their productivity may be adversely affected by their symptoms, meaning the impact of hay fever on work extends further than missed days.But she said,you are forced to take time off work with hay fever, it is important to see a GP or pharmacist, to ensure you have the right medication.And Dr Emberlin said its worth remembering hay fever symptoms, while they feel a lot like a nasty cold, arent contagious so theres no need to worry about spreading the misery.If your job involves lots of driving and your hay fever is causing your eyes to stream and you to sneeze frequently, that is certainly bad enough not to go to work, she added.Boots pharmacist Natalie Masters said: “You may have seen reports on rising pollen counts this weekend.If you’re a hayfever sufferer, don’t panic. When there’s more pollen in the air, your symptoms may worsen, but there are lots of steps you can take to alleviate these.Prevention is key, which means avoiding coming into contact with pollen in the first place.Grassy areas are often best avoided andyou can, don’t spend time outdoors at the times when pollen counts are highest, typically the early morning and late afternoon and evening.If you need to go outside, applying a petroleum jelly balm to the inside of your nostrils or using an allergy barrier nasal spray can help prevent pollen from entering your nostrils, whilst larger wraparound sunglasses can help stop pollen from irritating your eyes.There’s also several products you can purchase which can help to alleviate your symptoms when they start flaring up.Speak to your pharmacist about anti-histamine tablets, hayfever eye drops or a suitable steroid nasal spray.If you’ve been outdoors when the pollen count is high, make sure to shower and wash your hair once you get home to wash away any stray pollen particles.Regularly vacuuming and dusting your house with a damp cloth and washing and drying your clothes indoors may also help to keep your home a pollen-free zone.Importantly, try not to be worried or stressed about your hayfever. It has been claimed that hayfever can be exacerbated by this, so try to keep calm and consider dferent products and methods – hopefully you’ll soon find what works best for you.”Boots is currently has their own brand hay fever products on offer for  for £, including Boots One-A-Day Allergy Relief mg tabletsand  Boots Hayfever Relief for Adults  micrograms dose Nasal Spray  Metered Sprays .Branded products are also on offer at two for £.Hay fever can be very debilitating for sufferers, interfering with all aspects of work, family and your social le.For teenagers at this time of the year, it can impact on their performance in exams or at sporting events.And it can trigger asthma, in severe cases.If its not managed properly, hay fever can evolve into asthma, Dr Emberlin said.This is obviously a serious condition, with signicant health and lestyle implications.Hay fever can also be bad news for the estimated .million people with asthma in the UK  - as pollen can trigger their asthma.Dr Andy Whittamore, GP and Clinical Lead at Asthma UK warned that high levels of pollen in the air can inflame the airways and spark a potentially fatal attack.He previously told The Sun: When pollen is in the air it can inflame people’s airways, triggering asthma symptoms.Stormy weather can make it worse as it breaks the pollen into much smaller particles, which are then inhaled more deeply into the lungs.“If you have asthma and are already noticing more symptoms because of hay fever, such as coughing, a tight chest or breathlessness, make sure you keep your blue reliever inhaler with you at all times.Dr Whittamore advises taking hay fever medicines and using the preventer inhaler - usually brown - as prescribed.Experts predict a million new people will develop an allergy to pollen this summer.An estimated  per cent of adults in the UK reported suffering from hay fever in , according to research.Last year that figure increased to  per cent with a million new people buying hay fever medicines and remedies for the first time.The rise is believed to be due to changes in our climate as weather conditions become more extreme clearly defined seasons are blurred.Experts say a long winter followed by a short spring condensed the flowering season of trees and shrubs into a much shorter time period.They say this causes a so-called pollen bomb as plants burst into le at the same time."},{"url":null,"title":"politicians briefings ufos government sightings seriously","story":"The Senators on the Intelligence Committee were given the briefing about a series of encounters between US Navy planes and unidentied aircraft, one of them has said.A spokeswoman for Senator Mark Warner, the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, confirmed the briefing took place.“If naval pilots are running into unexplained interference in the air, that’s a safety concern Senator Warner believes we need to get to the bottom of,” Rachel Cohen told Politico.Donald Trump said he too has been briefed on UFOs but admitted he doesnt believe in them.The Navy itself didn’t comment on the latest meeting but has in the past confirmed that it provides briefings for the Congressional members by Naval Intelligence officials as well as aviators.Earlier this year, the Navy revealed there have been reported sightings of UFOs hovering above top-secret military bases and flying near aircraft.The daily sightings came over the course of  and  and were reported to the Pentagon and Congress.Briefing requests by Congress members have been on the increase since it was revealed  the Pentagon’s shadowy Aerospace Threat Identication Programstill investigates UFO sightings, the New York Post reported.He also says there have been more than , recorded UFO sightings in the past -plus years.The first recorded flyby occurred in Portland in , where viewers reported seeing a “buzzing” sphere-shaped UFO that descended from the heavens.Sightings have spiked dramatically over the past -plus years with mysterious lights taking over from saucers as the most popular description of objects spotted.The National UFO Reporting Centre is an organisation that investigates sightings.Since it was set up in , reports have been sent to it via its  hour hotline and it says that between May and June this year there have been more than  new sightings.The United States collectively reports , sightings per  million people, which is  times more than the global median. The existence of the AATIP was revealed in , along with a -second DOD video that shows an airborne object being chased by two Navy jets off the coast of San Diego in .At the time, former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid took credit for arranging  million in annual funding for the AATIP, telling the New York Times that it was “one of the good things I did in my congressional service.”The service is drafting new guidelines for pilots and other naval employees so its easier for them to report any mysterious objects they spot in the sky.A few years ago, a leaked report from the Pentagon revealed that a supersonic UFO shaped like a Tic Tac sweet had stalked a US Aircraft carrier for days before vanishing into thin air.Some of the pilots said that the aircraft could make itself invisible as it travelled next to them.The craft was described by one of the pilots mentioned in the report as solid white, smooth, with no edges... unormly coloured with no nacelles, pylons or wings, and looked like an elongated egg or Tic Tac.Sceptics think that the sighting could be explained by equipment mal or human error."},{"url":null,"title":"tory leadership vote live candidates","story":"MPs will cast their ballots twice today as they knock four candidates down to just two.The embership of the party will then choose the next PM after a series of debates and hustings across theand breadth of the country.MPs are voting this morning and again this afternoon to boot two people out.Boris Johnson is still the favourite, followed by Jeremy Hunt and Michael Gove.Earlier it was confirmed that two MPs spoiled their ballots in the third round.

It’s a debt, a debt which must be paid back out of an amount not enough to live on in the first place.So they’re faced with making tough choices. Heating or eating, a le thrown into further and spiralling debt and as I heard last week, some women are having to turn to sex work to survive. Yes, you heard it right.As a member of the Work and Pensions Select Committee I’ve heard heart-wrenching stories from travelling the country to visit some of the poorest Brits with our chair Frank Field, seeing first-hand the effects of the benefits freeze and the rollout of Universal Credit.Brexit has completely paralysed politics and taken our focus away from what should matter to Government the most - helping the neediest in our society.The design of the new benefits system means they won’t get paid for five weeks and it’s a issue I won’t let go of.As both The Sun’s Make Universal Credit Work campaign and the food bank operator Trussell Trust argue – that wait is five weeks too long and we need to fix it to make the benefits system work properly.Making the advance payment the first payment rather than a loan to pay back is the best way to stop thousands falling into poverty.Time and time again I hear stories from people who are pushed further into poverty and destitution because of Universal Credit’s five week wait.And for years the recommendations we make to Government based on the evidence we hear are ignored as they relentlessly try to defend the fundamental design flaws in the system.And the heartbreaking thing is I can see how easily we could transform people’s experience of Universal Credit.The DWP say the ‘solution’ to the wait is for people to apply for an advance. But what they continue to fail to recognise is that this ‘advance’ is a loan which can push people into deeper debt, with record numbers forced to use food banks.For the most vulnerable, the answer is clear, make any advance payment their FIRST payment. If they have no money and no prospect of income, why on earth are we waiting for a four week assessment period for them to prove they have no money It makes no practical nor moral sense.One million people are already receiving it and by the time the system is fully rolled out in , nearly  million will be on it.But there are big problems with the flagship new system - it takes  weeks to get the first payment and it could leave some families worse off by thousands of pounds a year.And while working families can claim back up to  per cent of their childcare costs, they must find the money to pay for childcare upfront - we’ve heard of families waiting up to  months for the money.Working parents across the country told us they’ve been unable to take on more hours - or have even turned down better paid jobs or more hours because of the amount they get their benefits cut.It’s time to Make Universal Credit work. We want the government to:Together, these changes will help Make Universal Credit Work.% of claimants are taking up an advance payment as they can’t afford to wait for five weeks, so the money is going out of DWP’s door anyway!This would stem the spiral of debt and give the most vulnerable a fighting chance.Couple that with an immediate lt of the benefit freeze and our welfare system would start to motor again.Heidi Allen is the independent MP for South Cambridgeshire and a member of the work and pensions select committee.Apply for an advance - Claimants are able to get some cash within five days rather than waiting weeks for their first payment. But its a loan which means the repayments will be automatically deducted from your future Universal Credit pay out.Alternative Payment Arrangements- If youre falling behind on rent, you or your landlord may be able to apply for an APA which will get your payment sent directly to your landlord. You might also be able to change your payments to get them more frequently, or you can split the paymentsyoure part of a couple.Budgeting Advance - You may be able to get help from the government to help with emergency household costs of up to £youre single, £youre part of a couple or £you have children. These are only in cases like your cooker breaking down or for help getting a job. Youll have to repay the advance through your regular Universal Credit payments. Youll still have to repay the loan, evenyou stop claiming for Universal Credit.Cut your Council Tax - You might be able to get a discount on your Council Tax or be entitled to Discretionary Housing Paymentsyour payments arent enough to cover your rent.Foodbanks - If youre really hard up and struggling to buy food and toiletries, you can find your local foodbank who will provide you with help for free.

It’d be Britain the “do-as-I-say-not-as-I-do” years.An horric thought that certainly added a bit of perspective to the penultimate episode of Years And Years, which was written by Doctor Who’s Russell T Davies in a fit of anti-Brexit Trump rage, thereby guaranteeing it would age about as well as Neil “Razor” Ruddock.The blasé assumption that went with it was that this series would be one of ’s big hits, so I won’t pretend the fact it’s died like the proverbial flea in a Russian’s beard hasn’t given me a lot of pleasure.It will have been a huge shock, though, to the BBC because, on the face of things, it was a bold and imaginative idea to travel ten years into the future with “an ordinary, everyday” family like the Lyons.Or it was up to the point when it became clear they were the sort of “ordinary, everyday” family who lived in a million-pound mansion and had more ticked boxes than Stephen Hawking’s homework.They were mixed race, naturally. One daughter was a lesbian left-wing activist, another was in a wheelchair, there was a gay son, with a refugee boyfriend, a cross-dressing nephew and niece who was “trans-human” and could take photos by blinking her eyes. All of them were bloody insufferable.The plot didn’t offer a lot of joy or surprises either, as it began with Donald Trump starting a nuclear war. An idea that secretly thrills all thosereaders who long to shout: “I TOLD YOU SO.”Armageddon quickly fizzled out, though, and was replaced by the melting of the North Pole, bananas becoming extinct, poor people being banned from London’s Kensington, Biblical downpours of rain and the Ukraine causing a refugee crisis when its Christian regime started arresting homosexuals, as Christian regimes so often don’t.Ben Shephard: “What is the fth letter of the alphabet ” Faith: “F.”And Love Island, Tommy: “What year did World War One start ” Molly-Mae: “.”Cheerful and brave, it most certainly wasn’t. The BBC doesn’t get a real buzz, though, unless it’s sticking it to the mother country.  So, on last week’s episode, Viv Rook became PM and immediately started planning genocide on asylum seekers. It’s not an original drama idea, obviously.Dennis Potter did the groundwork for Davies in Brimstone  Treacle, over  years ago. On Years And Years, however, plot twists come with a gear-crunching speech or a history lesson, spelled out here by the Thompson character.The thing about giving history lessons, though, is you’ve got to get them right. Years And Years didn’t.Simple Googling would’ve told the BBC concentration camps were actually a Spanish invention, during the Cuban wars of independence, and forced labour dates back centuries.I suspect they didn’t bother because the BBC and Russell T Davies are both so full of self-loathing they want to believe the worst things they hear about their own country.If you didn’t pick up that contempt for the audience from Years And Years last week, you certainly will have got a sense of it from the fact the BBC decided to land .million people over the age of  with a £. bill for the licence.It’s unlikely anyone would volunteer to pay that sort of money to endure the Years And Years lecture, no matter what it conjures up in tonight’s finale.Though how the hell it ever survived to , under the current management, will be the real mystery for most viewers.Shelley Kerr: “The one thing we want to do is win or get a draw.”Claire Rafferty: “England need more of the same but dferent.”Rachel Brown-Finnis: “Phil Neville is the female version of Gareth Southgate.” He is .LONG, cold evenings in a Highland yurt, staring at the same ruddy animals year after year, can lead presenters down all sorts of weird television cul-de-sacs.Take, for instance, Springwatch’s Michaela Strachan who, after a couple of weeks huddled in the Cairngorms, on BBC, suddenly piped up with some hot news about: “Starling testicles.”Yes. Starling testicles, which are a bit like Aston Villa, apparently.  Timid, puny little things in the winter but quite magnicent come the spring.A fact that led Michaela to wonderviewers could “imagine flying round with testicles the size of a bean ”  I could, and it quite took the thrill out of my new superpower, I can tell you.If that wasn’t a vivid enough image for you, though, co-host Chris Packham was on hand with a starling testicle-size graph and a prop, to tell her thathuman testicles swelled to the same scale, they’d be the size of basketballs.“And that’s quite a thing to get your head around, isn’t it ”I’ll take your word for it, Michaela.HAVING gone absolutely nowhere for over a week, Love Island was transformed on Wednesday by the arrival of a heat-seeking missile in human form. She’s Maura Higgins, an Irish “ring girl”. A description you can interpret pretty much any way you like.Because she may look like one of The Corrs, but Maura has a gob on her like Father Jack and, within five minutes of meeting Molly-Mae’s partner Tommy, was telling anyone who’d listen: “I swear to God, the things I’d do to that man. ‘Oh Tommy, Tommy, Tommy’. I can imagine screaming his name already.”That was just for starters, though.By Thursday, Maura was announcing her intention to “wrap my legs round his head”, which Tommy said was “doing a -degree turn”, without any danger of cutting off the blood supply to his brain. And on Friday she told all the other girls Tommy was giving her “fanny flutters”, who I think I once backed to win the  Guineas.Tommy’s now wearing the same haunted expression as a male praying mantis just before his head’s removed during the mating process, but by far the best thing about Maura’s arrival in the villa has been her verdict on herself. “I’m a girl’s girl.” RemarkableThe naive but still widespread belief Madonna will one day give a good interview.

But were talking about the Westminster turmoil which will see a new British Prime Minister in No next month.    Outgoing Mrs May said: “There is a leadership election taking place, obviously there are further votes taking place this afternoon and then the question of the leadership of the Conservative Party will go to the members of the Conservative Party across the country.” She admitted: “This is expected to be – certainly the last scheduled – European Council I will be at. “I will continue to do what we have always done as the UK, which is to play a constructive role within the European Union while we are part of the discussions round the table. “But in the future the UK will taking a dferent role because we will be outside the European Union.” Bookiesapos favourite Mr Johnson has insisted the UK will leave the bloc by the October  deadline, with or without a deal.  The former Foreign Secretary has vowed to renegotiate the exit pact which the Commons rejected three times – and scrap the Irish backstop to prevent a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.

Empty words THE hollow promises of Theresa May were exposed yesterday when she was challenged by Jeremy Corbyn on the Government’s response to the Grenfell tragedy. The Labour leader, who praised our Never Again campaign, asked the PM to explain why hundreds of blocks still have dangerous cladding. He also wanted to know why sprinklers had not been retrofitted and why no action was taken to improve tenants’ rights. Mrs May failed to answer any questions.

The self-styled King of Kids was also a role model to young boys on the Tilery Estate in Stockton-on-Tees, who were often seen congregating outside his flat. But Maxwell was a far nastier piece of work than the TV cameras captured.    In fact by the time the show aired in May , the cocaine addict was serving a two-year sentence for stabbing a man in a block of flats.He had slashed him across the back leaving three deep wounds, one cm long, reports Teesside Live .Then in December , soon after he was released, Maxwell was jailed again for two and a half years for a series of brutal assaults on his former lover after featuring on the programme. High on Spice, jobless Maxwell pushed his ex-partner down the stairs, swung her around by her hair and threw a television at her at the home they shared. When the woman tried to climb out of the window, Maxwell pulled her back, punching her in the face before throwing a car seat at her and pouring a can of pineapple juice over her head, the court heard.  Maxwell claimed he had “ramped up” his drug taking because of the fame the show had brought him, and he had launched the attack after his girlfriend had gone to the cashpoint to take out money to buy crack cocaine. The charges of assault and  imprisonment added to an already shameful rap sheet, which included robbery, fraud, resisting arrest, dealing drugs and shining laser pens at police helicopters. But any pretence that the reality star was just a lovable yob ended on December  last year. After hearing that Lee Cooper was among men who had attacked a friend living in a Stockton hostel, he sent a text message saying “al put this blade straight through that scatty **** lee”. Cooper, , was arrested for the assault, then bailed at am. At .am Maxwell’s injured friend was chased down a town centre street after he saw Cooper and heard someone shout “that’s the one that grassed you up”.  Within minutes Neil Maxwell, with cocaine and cannabis in his system, was on the warpath. During a two-hour rampage, he and Luke Pearson, , attacked Matthew Elsy, slashing him on the back and maiming him for le, before assaulting his own school friend Jame ‘Jogga’ Jackson at a hostel for no apparent reason. Then, shortly after am, Lee Cooper and two other men arrived on the street, armed with a hammer, a pole and a vacuum cleaner pipe. After emerging from the house, Maxwell and Cooper began by hugging each other. But violence erupted as Cooper headbutted Maxwell, knocking him into a car then kicking him. After a stand off, Maxwell took a weapon - most likely a hammer - and chased Mr Cooper down the street.  After knocking him to the ground, he carried on hitting him, slashing his face and body and Pearson joined in. Lee Cooper was also attacked with a Stanley kne, knuckle duster and a TV stand, stripped naked and sustained more than  injuries including multiple skull fractures. After the attack Maxwell reportedly stood over dying Cooper and said: “You deserve it, ‘coz you did my mate.” Later at a police station, Maxwell showed no remorse, even bragging about the murder to officers. He crowed: “He got a good hiding, yeah, and he deserved it and I’m proud I did it. I leathered that daft ****.  He dismissed Cooper’s injuries as “chicken scratches”, adding: “He’s lucky I didn’t cut his f***ing throat.” Stepping into the witness box months later, however, Maxwell claimed partial amnesia due to drug use, saying: “I just went berserk”. And he apologised to his victim’s family, claiming he felt “disgraced” and “gutted for the lad and his family”. He said: “Whatever happens I deserve what I get, basically.” Maxwell’s court evidence revealed glimpses of a shockingly warped view of violence. Slicing victims’ backs was in Maxwell’s eyes simply “a bit of a warning”, a message on the back not to p*** about with me, “nothing that’s going to be seen”. He said matter-of-factly: “I know it’s not nice and I don’t condone it but it’s generally what I’ve done, under certain conditions. “I would rather do that than kill somebody or take an organ out. It just sends a message out. There’s no internal damage or nothing like that.”  He denied Mr Cooperaposs murder and tried to reduce his responsibility to manslaughter on the grounds of loss of control. But the jury never got to consider his case after Judge Stephen Ashurst rejected his defence. He said: There is no sufficient evidence from which a properly directed jury could reasonably conclude the partial defence of loss of control might apply. Put shortly, there is compelling evidence that Neil Maxwell did not lose control at all. From the first hammer blow to the last disfiguring slash to Cooperaposs back, he was completely in control. He said the evidence pointed to the administration in cold blood of ferocious violence. Both Maxwell and Pearson were found guilty at Teesside Crown Court on Monday and will be sentenced later today.

When Annie Glasspool unexpectedly went into labour at her home in Witton Gilbert, near Durham, her husband Harry quickly phoned .A ambulance crew was dispatched and when paramedics arrived, they found baby Katie’s head already showing and she was born within minutes, ChronicleLive reports .But they were stunned to see that Katie was still inside her amniotic sac. Usually the sac, which protects the baby inside the womb, bursts during labour and the fluid comes away, known as your waters breaking. These special births are incredibly rare but do not put the baby or mother at risk and are even considered lucky by some. Paramedic Ian Nattrass, who has helped to deliver numerous babies in his eight year career as a paramedic, said: “Katie made a very unique entrance to the world, arriving in her amniotic sac, still intact – something that is extremely rare and is estimated to happen only around six times a year nationally.       “We helped to open the sac and cut the umbilical cord and checked both mum and baby over before transported them both to hospital in Durham.” Ian worked with clinical care assistant Martin Heath and emergency care technician Nicola Lowes, while Michelle Ferguson, health advisor at the North East Ambulance Service , took Annie’s call. Nicola added: “This is the first baby birth I’ve been to working for NEAS and it was lovely to hear her first cry so that we knew everything was OK.” Now two months on from the birth, the team came back to reunite with the family and see how they were all doing. Annie, who also has a two-year-old son called James, recalled: “I had been in early labour for several days, but every time we were about to go to hospital, it slowed down. On the day, when I rang the hospital after the first contraction, they said to wait an hour, but within half an hour, she was born.”   Annie added: “I was so impressed with everyone. We were all listening to Michelle on the phone and once they arrived, Ian, Nicola and Martin were very reassuring. I had no idea that the birth was complicated because they were a real calming influence. It’s been lovely to see them all again and meet Michelle who answered the call in person.” NEAS health advisors can take between  and  calls for patients during a  hour sht but baby births often stand out.  Despite helping a number of new mums bring their babies into the world over the phone during her  years’ service, mother-of-two Michelle has never met any in person. She said: “It’s always an honour to be involved in a baby birth and it’s been extra special to meet the family.” "},{"url":null,"title":"meghan markle prince harry split","story":"NewsWhy Meghan Markle and Prince Harry have split from charity with Kate Middleton and Prince WilliamMeghan Markle and Prince Harry have left the Royal Foundation and will set up their own away from Kate Middleton and Prince WilliamShareCommentsByZoe ForseyAudience WriterDavid Burke:,  JUN Updated:,  JUN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video harry-meghan-set-up-charity-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest Royal Family stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe Cambridges and the Sussexes have confirmed they will separate in yet another huge area of their lives - their charity the Royal Foundation.After months of speculation Kensington Palace announced the change today , revealing Kate and William will continue the charity under the new name the Royal Foundation of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, while Meghan Markle and Prince Harry will set up a new one.The statement says both couples are incredibly proud of what they have achieved together but claims the new structure will best support Their Royal Highnesses with future charitable activity.The brothers set up the Royal Foundation in  and Kate joined two years later after marrying William , and she has been a key part of its work since.Meghan joined the trio on stage for the first time in the lead up to her wedding for what was due to be an annual meeting - earning them the nickname the Fab Four.    The charity split is the latest way the two couples are cutting their ties to each other. Last year Meghan and Harry split from the Kensington Palace household, setting up their own office within Buckingham Palace.Before Archie was born, the couple moved out of their palace home, which was just a few doors up from Kate, William, George, Charlotte and Louis, and set up their new le in Windsor at Frogmore Cottage .   The charity is the base for most of their works, including Heads Together and the Invictus Games, so why have they decided to split  According to the official statement the change comes after a review into the charities structure. It reads: Later this year The Royal Foundation will become the principal charitable and philanthropic vehicle for The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will establish their own new charitable foundation with transitional operating support from The Royal Foundation. In addition both couples will continue to work together on projects in the future, including on The Foundation’s mental health programme, Heads Together.    These changes are designed to best complement the work and responsibilities of Their Royal Highnesses as they prepare for their future roles, and to better align their charitable activity with their new households.However many people believe there could be more to the decision, claiming that the rt between the two couples could be part of the reason . According to the Sunday Times , the two couples have clashed repeatedly.William was said to have been upset about Harry being dismissive of Kateaposs family, while the younger brother felt the Cambridges did not make enough effort with Meghan.    Kate and Meghan reportedly fell out in the build up to last yearaposs royal wedding in a disagreement over Princess Charlotteaposs bridesmaid dress. William is also claimed to have asked Harryhe was sure he wanted to marry Meghan, causing tension between the brothers. And many of Harryaposs pals - including Tom Skippy Inskip - were not invited to the wedding after allegedly falling out of favour. A source told the Sunday Times: Anybody who voiced any sort of reservation about Meghan has been sidelined. Signs that things were not right between the two couples reached a head when it emerged last year that Harry and Meghan would be moving to Windsor - rather than living next to the Cambridges at Kensington Palace. Meghan is also said to have upset royals by holding a baby shower in New York, costing more than £,, the Sunday Times reports.    Now Harry and Meghanaposs office is being moved to Buckingham Palace so the Queen can have more oversight over what they are up to, it is claimed. An insider who used to work for the Prince of Wales told the Sunday Times: Williamaposs quite controlling, and he was in control when it was just the three of them, but now heaposs not. I personally wouldnapost overegg Meghanaposs role in this because itaposs unfair, but equally she knows what sheaposs doing as an actress from Hollywood.The insider said the Sussexes are more aware of how to use social media - with a new @sussexroyal Instagram account launched in April.   Before that, both the Cambridges and the Sussexes had a joint @kensingtonroyal Instagram account. Prince Charles is reportedly keeping out of the dispute between his sons. Describing the Royal Foundation on the charityaposs website, Prince William says: “In an age when our pressures seem so urgent, our attention spans so short, our Foundation can look beyond the horizon. We have the chance to work with experts to not just raise awareness about issues, but do the much harder work of truly changing mind sets. We will not seek quick wins, but will strive to make a real and lasting dference.” "},{"url":null,"title":"mum who thought spiked night","story":"NewsMum who thought she was spiked on night out loses both legs to adult meningitisSarah Hayward, , from Wigmore, near Gillingham, went home early after feeling chilly and strangeShareCommentsByGregory KirbyNicola Jordan:,  JUN Updated:,  JUN NewsShe wants others to be aware of the dangers of adult meningitis \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email A mum who thought her drink had been spiked was actually battling adult meningitis which saw her lose both legs.Sarah Hayward, , ed home early from an evening out with pals after she started to feel aposchillyapos and aposstrangeapos.

If Ciara hadnapost realised something was up, the outcome could have been much worse. Medics took her to intensive care where she had a heart attack and her organs began to fail.    Two weeks later Sarah regained consciousness, but doctors later amputated both of her legs below the knee after doing all they could to save them. Sarah is now back at work as a hospital administrator after a dficult period overcoming the emotional trauma of her horric ordeal  months ago. She said: I was really struggling to adapt to my new le.

Sarah is now helping the charity Meningitis Now with its aposAdults Get it Tooapos campaign which aims to overturn the belief that meningitis only affects babies and young children. She said: I was ignorant to meningitis before this happened to me. If I had been better informed I may have known to look for the discoloration in my legs instead of going straight to bed.  Before contracting meningitis, I assumed the rash was the telltale sign. But there are so many other symptoms that I didnapost appreciate - like cold hands and feet, vomiting, a high temperature and just the general feeling of not being with it.

Sarah, of Wigmore, near Gillingham in Kent, added: Most people I know are misinformed. We all know the consequences but have assumed that it is something that only affects children. Maybe itaposs because parents have been taught to check their kids for symptoms, but not themselves. Meningitis is a killer, and has le changing consequences for the person and everyone around them.

Despite vaccinations being available at school and then at university, Sarah thinks its best to get vaccinated as soon as possible. Sarah, who now drives a specially-adapted car and lives in a bungalow, is now enjoying le again and has also noticed the positive impact of the ordeal on her daughter. The mum-of-one added: Ciara is thriving. What happened has made her stronger and she now grabs le by the horns. It has also helped our bond as mother and daughter grow.

On May  Nathaniel Holmes and Cynthia Ann Day were found dead in their room at the Bahia Principe hotel in the Dominican Republic. The couple were the third and fourth US citizens to die at the hotel, with further deaths in nearby resorts brining the total American death toll on the island to nine in a year. With cops investigating whether the deaths are linked to counterfeit booze stored in the hotel minibars, two Brits are terried theyaposve been poisoned.    Since they ed from the Bahia Principe hotel - where four tourists died with two reportedly drinking from the minibars - Emma Plappert and boyfriend Leigh Bailey have had serious health concerns. As well as crippling stomach pains, intense exhaustion and red lumps on their legs, they have endured bloody diarrhea after flying back to their home in Southend, Essex on May . When they heard the mysterious deaths could be linked to alcohol miniatures, the couple rushed to retrieve bottles they had taken from their minibar and gted to friends at home. Luckily they got the bottles back before theyaposd been opened. Now Emma and Leigh are calling on UK authorities to test the alcohol as they continue to battle their mystery illness.    The first thing we noticed that was strange was the alcohol from the main hotel bar, explained Emma, who forked out £, for the two week holiday after Leigh won £, on the slots. It just didnapost taste like alcohol at all. It just tasted weird. I said at the time that they had put fake alcohol in it. It tasted a bit chemically. Several days into the holiday the -year-old woke up in the middle of the night to a strange sulfurous smell in her room. Mum of three Emma said: I woke up and it smelt like rancid rotten eggs. I think it was coming through the air conditioning. I started to think of chemical gasses. I was really scared. After that I had the worst tummy ache of my le.    Numerous people have reported strange smells at the Bahia Principe Hotel including Philadelphia couple Doug Hand and Susie Lauterborn.After staying at the resort Susie told CBS Local how she had rashes on her torso, cold sweats, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and a temperature over  degrees, which she first put down to food poisoning.She reported off tasting wine and pasta like battery acid. When a Maryland couple died at the hotel of what Dominican Republic National police said was respiratory failure and excess fluid in the lungs however, Susie got suspicious. She said: Maybe there’s something deeper here. It’s really crazy to hear that people had passed away. “I don’t think it’s just limited to those people either. I bet with some further investigating, they’ll find out that way more people that visited that place got sick or even died.”  The first death occurred in June last year when bride-to-be Yvette Monique Sport had a drink at the minibar of the Bahia Principe hotel, took a shower and then went to bed. Her fiance was unable to rouse her when he came to wake the -year-old from Glenside, Pennsylvania.  Almost a year later on May  Miranda Schaup-Werner, a -year-old from Allentown, Pennsylvania, collapsed and died suddenly on May  in her room at Bahia Príncipe hotel. She also had just had a drink from the minibar.  Just five days later Nathaniel Holmes, , and Cynthia Ann Day, , died at the same hotel inside their rooms. They reportedly suffered from respiratory failure and pulmonary edema according to an early autopsy, although their families members are pushing for a second opinion back in the US.  Emma stopped brushing off fears about her illness and offers from her dad to take her to hospital when she became aware of the deaths. People kept saying aposgo to the doctorsapos and I kept saying aposI know, I knowapos, she continued. Then people started dying and I began to get really worried. Iaposm really scared now, but we are the lucky ones. We are ill yes, but others have died. We never would have gone therewe had seen this news before hand. The US embassy in the Dominican Republic called in the FBI to carry out toxicology reports which could take up to  days to be completed.    It said in a statement last week: “These incidents are tragic and we offer our deepest condolences to those personally impacted. “Dominican authorities have asked for FBI assistance for further toxicology analysis on the recent Bahia Principe, La Romana, cases and our FBI colleagues tell us that those results may take up to  days.  “We ask everyone to be patient while these investigations run their course.” Francisco Garcia, the country’s tourism minister, called the deaths “isolated incidents” earlier this month and said that the Dominican Republic was a “safe destination”. In a statement on June  Grupo Pinero, which owns the Bahia Principe, called news reports inaccurate and .They added: Bahia Principe Hotels  Resorts would like to express our deep respect to the authorities and the ongoing investigations. We reiterate our firm commitment to collaborating completely with the authorities and hope for a prompt resolution of their inquiries and actions and will not be making any further statements that may interfere with them. As a result of the misinformation that has been published, which we wholeheartedly disagree with, Bahia Principe Hotels  Resorts has suffered great damage to its image and reputation. contacted the company for further comment.

The weather should be fairly nice today, with sunny intervals across parts of the UK this morning and consistent sunshine later on in central and north-east England. Things will really pick up for the Summer Solstice tomorrow when much of the country will bask in sunshine, with Wales and south-west England enjoying the best weather. Temperatures will be fairly low, with highs of around C, although it will feel a lot warmer thanks to low winds and little cloud.    Saturday will see the mercury rise slightly as all of Wales and sections of England enjoy a sunny day, although Sunday will be overcast. A netweather.tv spokesman said: Friday is the Summer Solstice and in a timely manner for a change, high pressure will build in from the south during the day, so although there will be some showers at first affecting mostly northern and northwestern parts, many places will be or become dry and fine through the day. Just a few showers may keep going in the far north-west.

Aoe Bell says she was addicted to alcohol from the very first sip at the age of . And it soon consumed her le and left her spiralling into a deep depression, reports MyLondon . She hit rock bottom three years ago when, struggling to sleep, her brain thought the best thing to do was take all her anti-depressants. She called for an ambulance but by the time it arrived, she had forgotten it was for her and ran away in confused fear.    Aoe was in her third year at university but had to live at home - and it was this insignicant move that caused her mental health to suffer. But, Aoe admits, she had not been okay for the previous eight years either. The -year-old has been left with permanent brain damage, a scarred bladder and memory issues after her years of binge drinking. She said:  I honestly think I was addicted from the first time I had a drink. I would always be the one who got blackout drunk, I was drinking to numb myself and that continued for a couple of years. I was quite shy until I started drinking. I felt that I could never do what normal -year-olds do until I had a drink. I always had something in me where I just wanted to a rebel. I was a terrible, terrible teenager. My friendship group was the same. Alcohol was so easily accessible, it was never an issue getting it. It started to get really out of control at , I was drinking in the day, in the morning. My college was really left wing, drinking was part of that culture. Everybody always knew I was dferent in the way I drank. I was always the liability.    Iaposd always get into fights with my friends, my mum was in despair. I donapost know how I made it through college, but somehow I did. I couldnapost talk or walk or anything. Despite the drinking she still managed to get the grades to go to university in Brighton to study textiles and business. And being at university helped.  She explained: When I went to uni, I had this motivation come over me, I wanted to be there, I wasnapost rebelling anymore. I did drink a lot, but it wasnapost as much, wasnapost as disal. She loved her le in sunny Brighton - loved her degree, her new group of friends, her boyfriend. Aoe said: I’ve been suffering from pretty severe anxiety and depression since I was  but this had all taken a back seat because I was truly happy and content. I was absolutely dreading moving back home and leaving my le behind, I knew it was going to be bad but, in reality, I had no idea. After two years of living independently, I was thrown back into a world that I didn’t want to be in and I found it really hard to adjust.  My boyfriend had also just broken up with me and the combination of these two relatively insignicant events honestly made me lose my mind. This was when Aoe was put on the anti-depressants that nearly killed her. Both my depression and anxiety literally disappeared after around four days and I really was the happiest I had ever been, she said. This was the beginning of my first episode of mania.  It took about three months before things started to get weird. I was behaving ridiculously recklessly and doing things that were very out of character. I completely lost my sense of reality but was clueless to this at the time. People were really worried about me but I was entirely delusional. It all escalated to one night when she couldnapost sleep, and decided the best remedy to this would be to take all her anti-depressents. In a rare moment of clarity she realised what she had done and phoned for an ambulance, but by the time it arrived she had forgotten she had called.    When she went outside to see what was going on she quickly realised they were there for her and ran down the road, convinced she was running for her le. Eventually she was taken to hospital, waking up to find she was attached to a drip and had two police officers watching over her. I was eventually able to get out of bed and speak to the psychiatrist, she said. He was pretty sure that my problems were more extreme than the anxiety and depression that I felt. Her parents were very supportive throughout everything, and insisted that rather than being put on the NHS waiting list for help they would send her to see someone privately - the cost was nothing compared to her le. After seeing a psychiatrist she was diagnosed as bipolar and suddenly everything made sense. Aoe said:  per cent of bipolar patients suffer with substance abuse because they are misdiagnosed, so they are self medicating. She added: I was in the hospital and I spoke to a psychiatrist who gave me a talking to and told me I was going to dieI carried on the way I was going. At the time I was still manic so I couldnapost understand the extremeness of the situation.  Quitting alcohol was hard, and she had to take medication and be monitored as itaposs so dangerous to come off alcohol cold turkey. It should be recognised as a mental health problem better - people just see it as you have no self control, Aoe said. Itaposs a very, very stereotyped illness, people think of grown men living on the street. I just felt that I couldnapost talk about it with anyone, I didnapost look like an alcoholic so people didnapost take me seriously. Still in rehab as an outpatient, Aoe has to attend Alcoholics Anonymous and a post-detox class three times a week - and she has high praise for everyone she has encountered while ill. She has been sober since May  and is confident sheaposll never touch another drop. Aoe said: I went to rehab and when people asked me about my job I was so embarrassed [about my situation] and I just decided to tell the world. If I told the world my deepest darkest secret I have nothing left to be embarrassed about. From this came the movement  Mental Health Liberation . The group has written a manesto listing the things it thinks are vital to improving mental health awareness and support, from proper education in schools to positive media exposure of the mentally ill.  Aoe added: It [bipolar disorder] is one of those mental health issues that we really donapost know much about. Iaposm passionate about more research being done, but for me and my group itaposs about all mental health. At the moment weaposre just working on growing our following. We are not an activist group but we do think the mental health community is still entitled to more. Weaposve been in talks with City Hall, they contacted me on Twitter . Iaposm also in contact with broadcasters and some celebrities to help raise awareness and end stigma. So how is she doing personally  She said: In the grand scheme of le Iaposm better but I do still experience mania and real highs and lows. However, Iaposm not as concerned anymore. Every day is a struggle and I am by no means under any kind of illusion that my journey will be easy. I have had to accept that I will spend the rest of my le in recovery.

Laura Hood, , wrongly told police the driver had stopped his cab at the side of the road and sexually assaulted her in the back seat whilst he was giving her a lt home at the end of the evening, it was said. Detectives investigated Hoodaposs claims during which they arrested Haroon Yousaf and also the driver of a dferent taxi with a similar number plate. Mr Yousaf, , who was detained in front of colleagues at a cab rank spent a total  hours in custody and had to give intimate samples before he was released without charge and exonerated of any wrongdoing. It was claimed police suspected he had been ly accused when he gave details of a tracking device linked to the black cab which showed the vehicle had been driven straight to Hoodaposs home in Stockport, Greater Manchester without stopping.  There was also no evidence of physical contact between them. The other suspect was also cleared of any wrongdoing and Hood was subsequently charged with faking her account. Details emerged at Minshull Street Crown Court, Manchester, as she denied perverting the course of justice. If it were not for that tracker data Mr Yousaf may have found himself on trial for rape because the defendant made up a story about him, said Geoff Whelan prosecuting. Perhaps only the defendant knows why she would fabricate such an allegation, but make it up she did. A  allegation is a very serious matter. She accepts that she was in Mr Yousafaposs taxi and she accepts that he drove her home. She further accepts that Mr Yousaf did not rape her - but says, somehow that she honestly believed she was raped whilst in that taxi. The incident occurred on January   after Hood, from Stockport had been out with friends at Revolution bar at the Deansgate Locks complex in Manchester city centre. Mr Yousaf had just dropped off a fare when Hood got into his vehicle at .am and asked to be taken home. Mr Whelan added: She appeared to be drunk as she did so and said she just wanted to go home as she had lost her friends and her mobile phone. She said she had £ and asked how much it was going to be. Mr Yousaf gave her an estimate of about £ and she asked to be taken to a bank. Mr Yousaf drove her to a Tesco Express where CCTV footage showed the taxi stopping there at .am with the defendant getting out to use the cash machine.  By .am the taxi was driving off again and Mr Yousaf followed the directions on his satnav and took her straight home and reached the destination. The fare was around £, and the defendant gave him £ and said keep the change and paid the money through the slot in the middle of all black cab taxis. Mr Yousaf then thanked her then turned around and drove back to town. That  minute journey was in all respects entirely unremarkable. But at . when the defendant got home, it seems she was quite noisy and her mother askingshe was ok. The defendant then went upstairs to her mother and stepfatheraposs bedroom where she was sobbing uncontrollably as she came into the room. Her mother asked her what was wrong and she had lost her phone. She was crying, shaking and unable to breathe and then said that she had been raped. Her stepfather phoned the police and the defendant said she had lost her phone in Revolution and had started to panic and asked a taxi driver take her to Stockport. She said that they were going down the road and thought it was strange because he turned left when they live on the right. She said that he stopped and the driver got in the back of the cab, grabbed her and pulled her knickers down. Her mother asked her why she didnapost fight back and the defendant said that she was scared and that she thought that it would get worseshe tried to fight back. She said that he dropped her off at the end of the road and that he wouldnapost drop her off outside the house. The defendant was hysterical as she was speaking to her mother.

The -year-old was left with a bloody mouth, broken teeth and a hole in his jaw after the explosion. The boy then had to travel  miles from a small town in Nevada to a pediatric hospital in Utah with his mother. There, doctors rushed him into surgery , working to reconstruct and repair shattered bone. But the freak accident is just one of thousands in recent years, documented in a a new case study on e-cigarettes which have become increasingly popular in recent years.    The teenager had no idea the vape could explode according to Dr Katie Russell, the trauma medical director at Primary Childrenaposs Hospital who first treated the boy. He repeated the line over and over again in the emergency room, she remembers, and he was still pretty freaked out hours after the explosion.    At that time, in my career, I had never seen this. I never heard of this as a possibility said Russell, who described the boyaposs injuries in the New England Journal of Medicine. I just wanted to get this out there so other people could know that this was possible, she added. The boy Russell treated was a tough kid, she said, and he healed well. Itaposs unclear what type of e-cigarette was involved in the incident. But others have not been so lucky.     in February, a Texas man died after his e-cigarette exploded and shrapnel tore through his carotid artery. Part of the device remained lodged in the manaposs throat at the hospital, according to his family. About a year ago, a Florida man was also found dead after his e-cigarette exploded during use, sending a projectile into his head.  Both deaths were in adults, but numerous teenagers have reported burns from similar e-cigarette explosions.  One teenager in Oregon nearly lost his eye when his vape exploded two years ago, according to CNN affiliate  KYTV .

I think he got in the Championship Team of the Year when they won the league in  so he’s a top player.“He was good defensively for us and got up and down all day long.“That’s what you’re looking for from a full-back nowadays.”Losing Smith and McDaid, along with last season’s Championship top scorer Lawrence Shankland, goalkeeper Ross Doohan and defender Michael Rose was a blow for the Honest Men.However, Paisley-born Docherty insists with most of their squad from last season signed up, they can make a push for promotion once again.Experienced heads like former Terror Mark Kerr, Steven Bell, Michael Moffat, Andy Geggan, ex-Dundee man Jamie Adams and Craig Moore have agreed new deals since the end of the last campaign and Docherty has warned they should not be counted out of competing at the top of the table again.He added: “The team did so well and maybe over-achieving has cost us a little.“With that you are going to lose a couple of players.“The big-hitters are away but we have a lot of players signed up who know the club and what it’s all about.”A four-season veteran at Somerset Park, Docherty has made  appearances for Ayr.However, in recent times, he has been dogged by injury and has only had  run outs in each of the past two seasons.He believes he has put those fitness woes behind him and aims to get himself back in the engine-room of a successful team.Docherty added: “Last season I was coming back from injury and once the season started it was hard to get in.“We were doing so well and I was happy to play a role but it was a bit frustrating.“Hopefully, I can be a lot more involved in a good season this time out.”"},{"url":null,"title":"caley legend tokely thinks dundee and united could struggle with promotion pressure","story":"Inverness Caley Thistle legend Ross Tokely believes his old club can capitalise on huge pressures weighing on the Tayside clubs in next season’s Championship.Tokely, who made a club record  appearances across four isions in  years with the Caley Jags, is convinced John Robertson’s team can mount a renewed title challenge next season.And he is convinced relegated Dundee and play-off failures Dundee United will face a burden of expectation up against less-fancied rivals like Inverness.Tokely said: “It will be another interesting league with two Dundee sides in there next season.“United will be spending the money again, as will Dundee, but Caley Thistle just need to do what they do best and not worry about anyone .“They just need to build momentum and wins – and leave the pressure to Dundee and Dundee United.

league win at FC Lahti.It was ideal timing that RoPS should be in league action just hours after the draw and McInnes made the most of it to get an early lowdown on the Finns.Aberdeen face RoPS in the first leg at Pittodrie on Thursday July  before thethe following week at Rovaniemi, just four miles south of the Arctic Circle.At stake is a clash with CS Fola Esch of Luxembourg or FC Chikhura Sachkhere of Georgia in the second qualying round.RoPS were unseeded in the draw and are a lowly th in the UEFA club coefficient rankings, below teams from Gibraltar.However, McInnes – who will also have their games in Finland before the tie scouted – will take nothing for granted.He said: “We watched a stream of their game on Tuesday afternoon and there will be other opportunities to see RoPS in action.“We will get more games online and will get over to Finland to see them as well.“I think we will be able to see them three or four times before we face them in the first leg.“That is one of the benefits from facing a team who are midway through their season, although I would always want to play someone who is at the same stage as us.“We are well on the way to getting a good handle on RoPS.”RoPS Rovaniemi qualied for Europe by finishing second in the Veikkausliiga last season behind title winners HJK Helsinki.They have failed to recreate that form this season as RoPS are currently third bottom of the top flight with just  points from the opening  league games.Although RoPS won on Tuesday, the Dons will take heart from their opponents’ form at home on the articial surface at Keskuskentta stadium, where they are now six games without victory.McInnes said: “They finished second in their league last season and on the back of that their manager got a move to HJK Helsinki.“They have a new managerand we believe they have had a few injuries lately. The Finnish league is a decent standard so to finish second is a good achievement.”RoPS may be struggling in their league but McInnes is wary that they have that match sharpness that only comes from sustained competitive action.He will use the next three weeks of pre-season training and friendlies to ensure his squad are not “under-cooked” for the tie.McInnes said: “The biggest trepidation is going into the game under-cooked compared to the team you are playing.“From that side they have an advantage because we always need to get our legs going.“We will try to deal with that.“There is no doubt it will be a tough game. But we have handled that in the past and we have the experience now.“It is important we try to utilise the time we have between now and that first game.”There are a few familiar faces in the RoPS squad as defender Mahamadou Sissoko was at Kilmarnock from  to ’.Keeper Antonio Reguero was at Inverness Caley Thistle during the - campaign and Ross County in - and also spent a spell at Hibs.Former Marseille, AC Milan, Dynamo Kiev and QPR left-back Taye Taiwo, capped  times by Nigeria, also stars for the Finns.McInnes said: “They have a couple of players who have played in Scotland before so they will know what to expect coming to Aberdeen.“There is that added excitement now of the Europa League and we will try to come through the pre-season and the friendly matches without injury complaints.“Hopefully we can have a full squad ready to set about the task of getting the club into the next round.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/06/2.41464370-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/06/2.41464370-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/06/2.41464370-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/06/2.41464370-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"aberdeen airport workers set to take part in more strike action later this month","story":"Workers at Aberdeen International Airport will go on strike again later this month.Members of the Unite union will walk out on June  and , between am and am, as the dispute with the airport’s owners AGS, over pay and the closing of their defined benefit pension scheme continues.Union chiefs say airport bosses had offered a “repackaged % pay offer” which it claims is materially the same as one tabled in April.

An implementation plan was produced in December  to cover the years -. Who in Argyll and Bute is responsible for this plan  How many of the outcomes have been achieved As someone who has been involved with autism personally and professionally for many years, I find it extremely disappointing there seems to be an inability by those in authority to get organised enough to address the issues and provide services for autistic people and their families.There is no need for further drafts and consultations.Someone in the authority needs to take responsibility for the existing strategy and implementation plan and get on with it.Maureen Mackintosh, Ardrishaig.Sir,Scotland’s small building firms had a strong start to , in contrast to the UK construction small and medium sized enterprisesector, according to the Federation of Master BuildersScotland.The FMB State of Trade Survey for the first quarter of , the only quarterly assessment of the UK-wide SME construction sector, showed SME workloads declined for the first time in six years.In Scotland, however, there was a jump of  per cent compared with the previous quarter. Thirty per cent of weighted responses were positive, up from  per cent from the fourth quarter of .It is encouraging the Scottish construction industry is bucking the wider Brexit trend with workloads and enquires in rude health. The UK-wide picture is very dferent, with the construction SME sector overall contracting for the first time in six years.Scotland’s good fortune could be due to fewer EU workers being based north of the border compared with other parts of the country, like in London where one in three construction workers are from the EU.Relying less heavily on migrant workers has meant the Scottish construction industry hasn’t fallen foul of thousands of EU workers ing home during the long march to Brexit due to no longer feeling welcome in the UK or sure of their future here.Scotland’s builders, however, must not be complacent. Looking ahead, the First Minister has indicated thatthe UK does leave the EU later this year, she wants a second independence referendum before the next Scottish Parliament election in . This additional political uncertainty, on top of the continued uncertainty stemming from Brexit, could impact on the construction sector in Scotland.The fear is a looming second referendum could test consumer confidence this year and next. For construction SMEs, this is particularly concerning as their prospects are vulnerable to dips in consumer confidence as so much work comes from the private domestic sector.Gordon Nelson, Director of FMB Scotland.Sir,I was joined by my fellow Conservative councillors in Kilmory recently as we discussed atthe numerous challenges facing Argyll and Bute.Ferry sailings, roads, education and the SNP#s late single farm payments were all mentioned.With the SNP hammering local authority spending and cutting our budgets, challenges in delivering services will become more prevalent.Despite this climate of cuts from the separatists, Conservative councillors are delivering for Argyll.

This new parliament will be pivotal in determining the nature of our future regulatory environment and we are keen and ready to meet with them.Our industry faces a number of challenges over the coming years, not just in relation to Brexit but on issues such as climate change, environmental policy, plant protection and animal health and welfare. There will also be opportunities for farming and we must ensure that we make the most of these opportunities to build a forward-looking, progressive and resilient sector that benefits farmers and consumers throughout the UK.We would like to invite all UK MEPs on to farms in their local areas to discuss a range of priority issues and to answer any questions that they might have.

Design fleets comprising the Sigma s, Sonatas, Etchells and Hunter s joined the racing at Tarbert.Amid a flurry of rib activity laying and moving marks, it was not long before the CYCA  passage race fleet approached the finish line.The teams later caught up in the bar for the day one prize giving as new event chairman Glenn Porter welcomed everyone to Tarbert. With a number of races omitted due to protests, it was a nice easy start for Glenn.The Hunter s and Sonatas saw a spread of results after some close racing. The CYCA class  fleet on the Largs passage race was won on corrected time by Celtic Spirit. Additional prizes were awarded to Encore for the passage race line honours and Shona of Ashton for toughing it out at the rear of the passage race.Saturday was a much more challenging day on the water with a light wind and dreich drizzle.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"square peg bags window trophy","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe winner of the  Lochgilphead Armed Forces Day window dressing competition is The Square Peg.The champion was decided on a public vote after a number of Lochgilphead shops took part in decorating their windows in the fourth year of the popular contest.#I am delighted to win,# said Square Peg owner Jilly Wilson. #I actually enjoyed doing it.

The day after the crash, Superintendent Jim Guy of Strathclyde Police said there had been no evidence from the crew of any problems before the tragedy.He said the evidence available suggested an accident rather than terrorist attack.

These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area.

It could become a great asset from a tourist and amenity point of view.#And any Kintyre people who really took up the sport would have a great advantage over other surfers when it comes to competition because they have the benefit of readily available beaches all year round.#If this club gets going, the chances are that the British surf champions in the years to come will be Kintyre people.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOOrr Ewing CupFootballers were favoured with beautul weather last Saturday and the games played on Kinloch Park in the Orr Ewing Cup competition brought together very large gatherings of spectators.The match in the afternoon was brought to a sudden termination by an unfortunate dispute over the award of a goal. The opposing teams were Kintyre and HMS Thames.Kintyre opened strongly and after  minutes# play had scored twice. The dispute arose over the award of the second goal, which Thames claimed to be offside.The referee, Mr Duncan McCallum, an old Hearts player, was of a dferent opinion, and on his allowing Kintyre the goal, the naval team without more do walked off the field.It is understood that the Thames team intimated to the league at the weekly meeting on Monday night their withdrawal from the competition.The teams were: Kintyre # Jas McKinlay: James Black and Archd Sharp: M Muir, A McCrank and T Cameron: R McGeachy and D Brown: Dan McNaughton: N Scally and J Donaldson.HMS Thames # Meese: Jesseman and Love: McCloud, Hirst and Fernie: Dunnell and Weekes: McGeachy: Slynn and Segrott.Referee # Mr D McCallum.In the evening, the opposing teams were Campbeltown and Kilbrannan. A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week june 7 2019","story":"As I retreat into the comfort of a warm house and an even warmer coffee, I wonder what it must have been like for Columba and his fellow monks as they made their way from the shores of Ireland to the wilds of Argyll.The fragile shell of a coracle was not the most effective shelter against the wildness of our coastline.Yet they came.

Itrsquos in such a beautul part of our county that the journey there was an adventure in itself.The loch is hidden, surrounded by a wood which embraces its secrets. Irsquod never visited it before, but Irsquod been told how magical this place is and that it has a story attached to it.Finding an appropriate place to park was our first challenge. There is no direct access to the loch and no car park with signposts, so care is needed in finding a suitable place. A private farm road that takes you to the entrance gate is not an option, so initially I struggled to find a suitable place, but some kind advice from a friendly farmer helped us out.Itrsquos a perfect time of year for such an adventure. The woods are fully clothed and still echoing with birdsong. I like to explore new places initially without a map or guide. It adds to the adventure, as we had to decide which way to go and initially wonderedwersquod taken the wrong route. But there is a circular walk around the loch, so once the path is discovered there isnrsquot a wrong way.It is a beautul and tranquil place, and as we wandered along the tree-lined loch I thought about the story of the man responsible for its creation.That man was Harry Younger, of the well-known brewing family. His ancestor, William Younger, had been the man who had built up the famous brewing business which produced Youngerrsquos Ale. A huge chunk of the Canongate in Edinburgh was taken over by their Holyrood brewery, including the site where the Scottish Parliament now sits.When William Younger died in , he was a hugely wealthy and successful businessman but also, it seems, exhausted and overworked. The empire he left was continued by the family but eventually in , the Younger enterprise was merged with rivals McEwanrsquos, to form Scottish Brewers Ltd.This merger, the reasons for which are another story, meant the Younger family branched out into other ventures. In the s, Harry Younger, the then head of the family, bought the land at Baro and began transforming it into the haven of nature it now is.Harry led an interesting and privileged le. He was an internationally known curler who regularly competed and won trophies. His intention was to create a new home amid the beauty of this area of East Lothian. He set about building a house, but also developed Bara Loch as it now exists and surrounded it with an embrace of trees.But the dark clouds of the Second World War intervened in his plans to enjoy this paradise. He had attended Sandhurst in his earlier years and seen the last months of the First World War. He remained involved in the Territorial Army and in January  he was sent to France as commander of a mechanised unit.It is recorded that he was killed in action on June  at St Valery-en-Caux. His unit, the Lothian and Border Horse, had been part of the brave and ferocious defence of the Dunkirk beaches. Anyone with knowledge of this action will understand the hell and desperation of that defence, and the supreme courage and sacrice of the defenders.Harry died on the day these brave defenders had to finally surrender, after over , had been evacuated from the beaches. How he died, what horrors he witnessed, we can only guess. He lies buried in the St Valery-en-Caux Franco-British Cemetery.And so this is the story attached to this beautul place. The man who began its creation never got the chance to enjoy it.In our walk, we arrived at a stone seat overlooking the loch. It had a worn inscription on it. We could make out the words lsquoin memoryrsquo or lsquomemorialrsquo and lsquoYoungerrsquo, but the rest was too worn.But I knew this must be a memorial to Harry Younger, which was later confirmed when I found a wonderful blog called Walking East Lothian in which the author explained he had traced the inscription to reveal Harryrsquos name and the date , the year of the lochrsquos creation.I sat on the seat and watched my kids play in the wood. The trees on the north side arch over the waterline to catch the sunlight, creating a canopy which dips into the loch. The serene tranquillity and beauty of the place is no doubt what Harry intended.But that in a sense is part of the magic of this place. As the pioneer Nelson Henderson once said to his son: ldquoThe true meaning of le is to plant trees under whose shade you do not expect to sit.It was these words I was reflecting on as I watched my children play. Harry was of course wealthy but we can all plant trees, either real ones or metaphorical ones, as a legacy for others.The recent death of a fellow storyteller and all-round wonderful woman, Ros Parkyn, was also on my mind. I had spoken about this place to her and of my intention to visit it. She loved nature too and would have gladly come along with me. But I sadly left it too late.Ros encapsulated all that was good and compassionate about humanity and she also planted many trees, some in the ground for she was a nature lover, but even more were planted in the hearts of those who knew her. They all now will grown as part of her wonderful legacy.As we left the wood, butterflies and blue dragonflies accompanied me, along with thoughts of my friend Ros and a man I didnrsquot know but whose trees shaded us.I willin autumn to see the colours and pay quiet homage to those who leave this world having made a positive dference."},{"url":null,"title":"new-primary-school-at-letham-mains-starting-to-take-shape","story":"Work began on Letham Mains Primary School, on Haddingtonrsquos western edge, earlier this year.The

Tranentrsquos eastern edge, despite the land being earmarked solely for economic development.Developers insisted that the only way to bring businesses onto the site was by generating funds from the sale of the new homes.They argued that making the site suitable for development would cost pound.million and it was not viable without housing.However, East Lothian Council rejected their plans at a meeting in August when officers insisted the site should be retained for employment use.Councillor John McMillan, economic spokesperson, referenced the Kevin Costner movie Field of Dreams when he told colleagues: ldquoIf we build it, they will come.Developers appealed to the Scottish Government to overturn their decision, insisting the local authority had failed to acknowledge the evidence they had provided which, they said, demonstrated the need for enabling residential development on the land.However, the Scottish Government Reporter appointed to investigate the appeal has now rejected their argument, siding with the council.He said that the Local Development Plan for East Lothian had set aside the land at Kingslaw for economic development and it should be retained as such.And he pointed out that the housing proposed by Barratt,which was described as lsquowindfallrsquo housing ndash which refers to a site which becomes available unexpectedly ndash would ldquosimply supplement an already generous housing land supply.Despite rejecting the appeal, the reporter said that he accepted the views of the developers and the District Valuer that the site was not financially viable as employment land in the current market conditions.He said: ldquoWhile I cannot be certain that there is no prospect of a business or industrial use being realised on the whole site, the information for this appeal indicates that, in the current economic conditions, it would be unlikely.However, he questioned whether the plans to build  houses and provide the local authority with . hectares of ldquoserviced land to build business units on it were possible, with no evidence the units would be created or could operate next to the new residential development.The reporter said: ldquoI find that the housing proposed would not directly enable commercial development to take place.ldquoAlthough not likely to be currently viable, the site would be removed as a strategic long-term employment option.East Lothian Council welcomed the ruling which is the first housing appeal to have been ruled in their favour since their new Local Development Plan was adopted.Councillor Norman Hampshire, planning convenor, said: ldquoWe welcome the outcome of this appeal both in the context of the Scottish Government Reporter upholding a decision that was carefully considered by East Lothianrsquos Planning Committee, and of course in respect of our adopted East Lothian Local Development Plan , which is now the basis of all planning considerations in East Lothian and provides clear guidance on

There are several factors influencing this, but the major factor which has tipped the balance is the extended funding hours and the negative impact this is having both financially on small businesses, like Mary Poppins, and to the quality of early learning and childcare.New Scottish Government policy instructs councils to increase their funded childcare hours from  to , by . This move also includes longer opening hours and a move from term time to year-round opening hours to attempt to make childcare more nationally accessible.Ms Dewar said: ldquoThe money received for funded places does not cover the costs of providing the quality of early learning and childcare which we want and are required to provide, especially with regards to staff costs.ldquoThe timescales and measures that the Scottish Government has put in place to educate a workforce to meet the increased requirements are insufficient, and there is a serious shortfall to meet the requirements of the extended funding.ldquoEast Lothian Council indicated it estimated it would require approximately  staff to facilitate the increase in funded hours in East Lothian. The majority of these posts are early learning and childcare practitioners.ldquoThe local authority advertises early learning practitioner posts at between pound. and pound. per hour.

The nursery sector has been warning the Scottish Government that private nurseries are struggling in the run-up to the roll-out of its flagship , policy from August .ldquoMinisters must act quickly to address the sectorrsquos concerns and ensure that the capacity exists to deliver the funded hours next year.A Scottish Government spokesperson said: ldquoIt is, of course, concerning to hear of any nursery considering closure, and the obvious effects this might have on staff, parents and children.ldquoEast Lothian Council has provided assurance that they will support families to find alternative early learning and childcare places for children who had been expecting to use the Mary Poppins Nursery from this August.Ms Dewar added: ldquoI am distraught that circumstances have forced me to this decision and that such a wonderful place for children to experience their early years is to close.The decision was met with an outpouring of grief on social media.The nurseryrsquos recent th birthday was marked with a garden party.The nursery was founded by Sue Armstrong, affectionately still called lsquoMiss Suersquo, after she had written to Mary Poppins author P L Travers to askshe could use the name.Miss Sue said: ldquoI received many letters from P L Travers about the nursery.ldquoAt the beginning, she wanted to know what the nursery was going to be like. She had no objection to me using the name, she just wanted to find out more. I ended up meeting her as well.ldquoWe were hoping to get her to come and open the nursery  years ago, but her arthritis was bad. We stayed in touch, however. I would send her letters about how the nursery was getting on along with photos, and she would write back saying how she liked it, and ideas of what to do.ldquoShe said that the children should be encouraged to make up their own stories. lsquoChildren like doing that,rsquo she said.Miss Sue sold the nursery to Ms Dewar in  as she was ldquosick of all the paperwork.She said. ldquoWhen I heard it was to close down, well, itrsquos just all so sad really. Itrsquos such a terrible shame.ldquoIt is such a nice and happy place for the children, homely and warm.

This really is an exceptional moment in politics. Everyone says that Boris Johnson is unreliable, untruthful, unfaithful, unruly and unpredictable. Yet, he is almost certainly going to be our next Prime Minister. How did we get here Hes a chat show celebrity, of course. But its not ashes seen in a positive light by the media glitterati. Last week, Ian Hislop, the lead list on BBCs Have I Go News For You, on which Boris famously starred, called for him to be jailed. TV presenters loathe Johnson, which is why his minders have tightly controlled his TV studio exposure. He has been pilloried in the press, rubbished on social media and disowned by Tory cabinet ministers.Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Tory leader, made no secret of her dislike for the former London Mayor and even launched a campaign, ldquoOperation Arse to stop him. The Conservative Scottish Secretary, David Mundell, said he ldquowouldnt serve in a Johnson cabinet . But somehow all this bounces off the Teflon Blonde. In last weeks first round of voting, Johnson won more that twice the votes of his nearest rival.The short answer of course is Brexit, but that doesnt explain why Tory MPs are so keen to have this recklessly outspoken politician as their leader. The other candidates are no less Brexity than he is. Yet he is crushing the le out of them.Iain Macwhirter: Brace yourselves, wersquore in for a Trump-Johnson double actHard man Dominic ldquokarate Raab, is a dedicated No Dealer, yet he was left gasping on the canvas after last weeks votes. The Environment Secretary, Michael Gove, is still in the race, despite his cocaine confessions, but only just. Sajid Javid, has ldquoalso ran written all over him, despite winning the support of Ruth Davidson.This just leaves the Foreign Secretary, Jeremy Hunt, as the safety-first candidate. Hell probably win enough votes to come second to Johnson and be one of the two candidates offered to the wider Conservative Party membership. But he is so colourless - a male version of Theresa May - that hes most unlikely to succeed. Tories realise that this isnt the time for safety-first candidates. Theyve been there done that.Media commentators have been talking up the ldquoWhite Walker, Development Secretary, Rory Stewart, who squeaked into the second round. He certainly has a good back story, with his wanderings in Afghanistan, and possesses the effortless self-confidence that only an Eton education can provide. Hes a youthful breath of fresh air, but Tories arent interested in fresh air right now. They prefer the fug of populism.Which leaves us with Boris Johnson as the next Prime Minister. Even as I write that again I can still hardly believe it. Consider this testimonial by one of Johnsons former employers. ldquoHe is a far more ruthless, and frankly nastier figure than the public appreciates...I would not take Boriss word about whether it is Monday or Tuesday.. He is not a man to believe in, to trust or respect, save as a superlative exhibitionist.That was Johnsons former editor, Max Hastings, of the Tory-supporting Daily. In the same article, Hastings said thatJohnson ever became Prime Minister hed be ldquoon the first plane out of Britain. I hope hes booked his tickets.: Scottish Tory MP warns Boris Johnson against trying to \"subvert\" leadership voteEveryone knows that the former London Mayor was sacked as a journalist for lying, and then again as a junior minister for lack of candour. His infidelities are legion. Hersquos barely capable of appearing in public without provoking offence, usually from ethnic minorities. Three years ago he won pound from the Spectator magazine for a limerick that referred to the President of Turkey having sex with a goat.You think Im making that up, dont you  But the next PM really did write this about of President Recip Erdogan: ldquoThere was a young fellow from Ankara. Who was a terric w@nkerer. Till he sowed his wild oats. With the help of a goat. But he didnt even stop to thankera. Dont think hell be reprising that when he meets the Turkish President.The Tories used to be the sober, serious and sensible party. The political wing of the Anglican Church. Its in the name: ldquoConservative. So what are they doing electing this man  Are Tory MPs so addled by Brexit they cant see whats coming  A Prime Minister as chaotic and unpredictable as Donald Trump.In many ways, Boris Johnson seems the polar opposite of Trump. In terms of education, wit, literary ability and social background, he couldnt be more dferent to the belligerent billionaire. But they share one important characteristic: they are charismatic populists. They are rule breakers, who can be guaranteed to defy convention, for good or ill. Theyre not really politicians in the conventional sense, but anti-politicians, repositories of popular discontent.Many voters like Boris because he is the embodiment of political incorrectness. He is guaranteed to provoke outrage from the professional offence-takers and social justice warriors who populate social media. Many middle Americans voted for Donald Trump, not because they expected him to be a model president, but because he would upset self-righteous scolds who tell people what to say and what to think. The woke s of the culture wars, who police the language of ersity, and condemn jokes about gays, women or racial minorities.Boris is also someone who will make trouble, and many voters want to make trouble right now. That is why, paradoxically, the party of the establishment, is embracing someone whose demeanour seems so anti-establishment. Conservatives know that the only thing that matters is getting power and keeping it. Back in the day, this involved electing boring politicians in sensible suits who wouldnt frighten the middle classes and would invite deference from in the lower orders. Politicians behaved like bank managers, headmasters, churchmen.But the middle classes have been plunged into insecurity by the financial crash, working people no longer defer to authority figures, and respect for religion has largely vanished from our secular public realm. In many ways, the passing of deference is a good thing. But we have also become an irritable and fractious society that doesnt know what it wants, but wants it now. Brexit is a touchstone issue here: a political project which no one really understands, because it is about complex trading law, but on which everyone has an emotionally-charged point of view.Boris Johnson, is natural material for these emotive times. He is a performance artist, really, a living commentary on the state of society. A politician of shting principle, who is not expected to honour his promises, and whose moral compass is his own ambition. So, prepare for a bumpy ride. The one thing Boris Johnson will never be is boring."},{"url":null,"title":"Marianne Taylor  March on the Tories  not the BBC  over free TV licences","story":"Older folk on this side of the Atlantic are indeed preparing to change out of their slippers, albeit for a very dferent cause. Thousands of pensioners plan to march this week on BBC sites across the UK in protest at the corporationrsquos announcement that from  it will stop giving free TV licences to everyone aged over , at a cost of poundm a year, moving instead to a means-tested system where only those claiming pension credit will be exempt from paying the pound. annual fee.Read more: Pensioners to march in fury over BBC licence fee grabThe National Pensioners Conventionwhich is organising the protest, off the back of an Age UK petition that has already garnered more than half a million signatures, has called the BBCrsquos move ldquocallous and cruel.The NPC claims the issue is ldquouniting generations when the reality, of course, is that universal benefits for pensioners like this one and the winter fuel allowance ndash which costs around poundbn a year ndashincreasingly ides society by age, with the gap between older, private-pensioned, property-rich haves and younger, debt-ridden have-nots growing by the day.What really dispirits me about the outcry over this move, however, is the way in which large sections of society have fallen hook, line and sinker for the Tory ploy to blame the BBC. The corporation was, after all, left in a no-win situation when it was landed with free licences as part of its settlement in . If it continues to fund them for all over s, the very services viewers and listeners say they value, that mark the corporation out from lesser commercial broadcasters ndash the peerless radio output, BBC and BBC ndash would have to go.Read more: Pensioners to march in fury over BBC licence fee grabAnd make no mistake, this isnrsquot just an opportunistic shting of responsibility for an unpopular policy from Government to BBC, though it seems ridiculous that anyone would believe a broadcaster would or should be in charge of welfare policy. Rather, it is a calculated move as part of a much bigger, more ideological and potentially damaging attack on our public institutions.How George Osborne, the former Tory chancellor who made the decision to cut funding for free TV licences, must have laughed over the last week as he put out article after article about the brouhaha in the newspaper he now edits, the London Evening Standard.The joke, of course, is on us. Mr Osborne and his chum David Cameron were two of the most blatantly mendacious politicians of the modern era. It is they who sowed the seeds of the dangerous political situation we currently find ourselves in, who set the standard for the motley crew of charlatans and nersquoer-do-wells lining up to lead the country further into oblivion.Letrsquos do a quick recap. Despite casting themselves in  as modern, centrist one-nation Conservatives, the Cameron administrationrsquos post-crash austerity narrative disguised a strategy specically designed to run-down, undermine and under-fund our public institutions and services. Indeed, this agenda, taken alongside the EU referendum, suggest Cameron and Osborne were doing the work of the Tory hard right from the off. We should have remembered from the s that the Tories are past masters when it comes to ide and rule. And yet here we are in , iding ourselves into ldquothem and ldquous politically, constitutionally, culturally, economically, on the precipice of a disastrous no-deal Brexit under an odiously populist leader. The services and institutions that used to anchor us on common ground, the post-war settlement that encompassed social housing, the NHS, the BBC, have or are in the process of being deliberately, ideologically undermined.And by attacking the BBC over free licences, we are doing the work of these ideologues.Though I do not agree with the view that all over-s should get a free TV licence, I respect the NPCrsquos demand to retain the benefit. The plan to march on the BBC, however, is not only wrong-headed but plays straight into the hands of those who would like to see our remaining public services either privatised or obliterated.More likely to vote than other groups and with higher incomes, older people now have more clout than ever before they should use it by putting on their marching shoes and heading to Conservative HQ."},{"url":null,"title":"TV REVIEW  Who won the Tory manspreading contest ","story":"Not THE Boris Johnson, blonder than Harlow, more reclusive than Garbo, the dude the media cannot tame  The very same.

Thatrsquos a laudable objective. But the strategy to achieve this is dafter than any character Jerry Lewis or Norman Wisdom created.Comedy writing has never been about defending the patriarchy. More often than not itrsquos been about two blokes sitting in a flat throwing ideas back and forward while eating caramel wafers and sooking strong tea. This double male world usually features one typing while the other lays on a couch scratching his bits and trying to come up with a killer line to end the first scene, all in time for Countdown starting.This female-free writing form has resulted in the likes of Steptoe and Son, The Likely Lads, Porridge, Dadrsquos Army, Are You being Served It Ainrsquot Half Hot Mum, and Hi-de-Hi, all classic sitcoms written by the likes of Galton and Simpson, Clement and La Frenais and Croft and Perry.Andthis new mixed writing team rule were to apply to the BBCthis would mean our own comedy duos such as Still Gamersquos Kiernan and Hemphill and Burnistounrsquos Florence and Connell would be wasting the caramel wafer money. Two Doors Downrsquos creators Carlyle and Sharp would have had to squeeze an extra chair into Carlylersquos parentsrsquo garden shedand hope the added voice didnrsquot obscure their own.Saskia Schusterrsquos bosses should point out her virtue signalling is not only wrong, itrsquos stupid, isive and ill-thought out.They should underline the idea that writing success generally emerges from a connection of minds, two people on the same page, literally and figuratively, two people in love with the same idea, of how to create a character, a plot line, a set-up, gag. To impose an addition to the process ndash regardless of sex ndash is to deny the alchemy already apparent.What Schuster is doing in demanding female representation in every comedy script submission is to create arranged marriages. But the chances of such marriages producing offspring that will become loved by a nation are slim.There is no doubt that some of our television writing in the past has had a smear of sexism. You could argue the Pythons team could have done with the addition of a female writer to reduce the bikinis on display. But itrsquos also important to remember women have never been banned from writing for television think Carla Lane, Jenner Saunders, Victoria Wood. Itrsquos even more important to point out the most successful comedy writers right now are female: Fleabagrsquos Phoebe Waller-Bridge has Killing Eve and the upcoming Bond movie to her credits, Derry Girlsrsquo creator Lisa McGhee is on her third network series. Male-female writing teams already work,allowed to emerge naturally, as was the case with John Cleese and Connie Boothrsquos Fawlty Towers, and is the case with Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaneyrsquos very funny C Catastrophe.Yes, we would all love gender balance in TV writing. Last year, women wrote % of TV episodes. But the way to bring about balance is not to squeeze a female into the garden shed. The way forward is for television to invest in more writer workshops, encourage the likes of female writing collectives such as Glasgowrsquos based Witsherface,which features the likes of Karen Dunbar.The way forward is for teachers to show episodes of Derry Girls to th year pupils and say ldquoPay attention, girls. You too can have a career in TV writingyou can come up with something as funny as this.So letrsquos have a re-think, ITV. And bear this in mind the sweet BBC sitcom success Mum was written by a man. Which tells you that being funny isnrsquot gender related. We can write for each other, that comedy isnrsquot sex prescriptive.Look at your real failings, ITV. The likes of Love Islandrsquos new series which already faces accusation of racism, gaslighting and now sexual harassment by a female on a male,Itrsquos a show pumped full of Viagra in the form of a beautul villa, alcohol and cash, in the hope those taking part will take each other apart and at the end of the night behave like farmyard animals.The response to discrimination is not to discriminate against men.

The majority of the aforesaid members are over  years of age and appear to care little for the unprecedented economic, social and political vandalism that those who come after them will be bequeathed. Attitudes are hardening across the country and those who desire real social democracy will not, I fear, find it in any future Conservative Government. English nationalism, fuelled by Brexit as well as an international fillip for those on the far right, must now wag the Tory party dog for the immediate political future.Ruth Davidsons anti-independence mantra now looks hollow and isolated and Scottish Conservatives must undergo an existential self-analysis. Many Scottish voters are now disillusioned and feel impotent in the face of a future Boris Johnson premiership and its implications of American hegemony.Independence has never looked so irresistible. The only question is:not now, then when Owen Kelly, Stirling.IAIN Macwhirter paints a rather bleak view of Scotlandrsquos future in the UK and appears to use that to justy resorting to an independence referendum or some other means that is not founded on a legally binding agreement with the UK Government .It is surprising to read a serious commentator talk of \"extra-legal means of securing Scottish independence\". Surely the SNP leadership can wait until the fog of Brexit clears, to seethe public mood in Scotland is genuinely behind revisiting the issue of our membership of the UK. To push on when the majority opinion is against holding a vote any time soon appears to be unnecessarily provocative and likely to be self-defeating in terms of how people will vote.I do not favour breaking up the UK, but equally I accept that majority opinion in Scotland must ultimately be respected. Yet of course, it was not so very long ago that we all put a great deal of focus on the issue of independence and gave a clear answer. Meanwhile circumstances have changed but is seems that the weight of opinion on this matter has not. For all our sakes, I hope that cooler heads in the Scottish Government manage to steer away from inflicting further and unnecessary discord on us when we are neither ready for it or wanting to compound the constitutional uncertainty of recent years.Keith Howell, West Linton.SOME of your columnists are working themselves into a frenzy over a rush to independence. But before we compound the disaster of Brexit by doubling down on the uncertainty likely to be caused by another referendum, let us reflect.I wrote to you a couple of weeks ago about the mediocrity of the current crop of politicians in Scotland and across the UK. In the interim, things havenrsquot suddenly, dramatically improved.The track record of the Scottish Government in dealing with newly devolved powers is mediocre: infrastructure issues, under-estimates of staff required to administer devolved powers and budgetary black holes. Do we really believe theyrsquoll be any better when they are required to implement and administer the powers and services that independence will confer upon them Two wrongs do not make a right. To suggest a rush to independence, at a time when the whole of the UK is in a period of uncertainty, is plain wrong. It is wrong firstly, because the Scottish Government is not prepared for a complete break from the rest of the UK. But secondly, and more importantly, the majority of the populace still do not want to split.Supporters of independence are loud, vocal and visible. The silent majority see no need to publicly counter these ostentatious displays of faux-Scottishness. They will turn out again at the ballot box, to vote down a break from the Union, regardless of whether Boris Johnson becomes PM or of whether or not Brexit is delivered.JS Brennan, Glasgow G.If the SNP Finance Secretary, Derek Mackay, is listening, then why not reduce Scottish income tax levels and Land  Buildings Transaction Tax levels too and see that the lower the taxes, the higher the tax income received due to greater activity and productivity  The SNP might not be happy to admit this but the Tory tax policy of allowing people to keep more of what they earn is not a crime and the \"attainment gap\" would close naturally rather than articially. Alternatively we can just wait until  and the next Holyrood elections. What goes up, must come down .Dr Gerald Edwards, Glasgow G.IF the people of Scotland wish to remain part of the UK and an integral part of Europe the population needs to vote Labour. I suggest that to make this palatable to voters currently aligned to other parties, the Labour Party and the trade union movement have an urgent requirement to replace an inept Jeremy Corbyn. People have little confidence in Mr Corbyn ndash perceived as another Michael Foot. Hopefully the same will be true of the Tory Party faithful and this will eventually thwart Boris Johnson. My own preference for Labour leader would be Emily Thornberry, and Rory Stewart for the Tories .Robert Gemmell, Port

Scottish Budget.\"They will also enable us to increase our reserves to ensure we can respond to future challenges.:Tom Gordon: Ministers need to look their budget fears in the eyeLabour said the underspend was six times the poundm needed to mitigate the impact of the two-child benefit cap in Scotland.Mr Kelly said:ldquoIt is disgraceful that Derek Mackay is sitting on a slush fund in St Andrewrsquos House whilst children are queuing with their parents at food banks across Scotland every day.ldquoTime after time he told the public he canrsquot afford to lt the two-child cap or end the rape clause and all the while the money to do so was lying in his governmentrsquos bank account.ldquoOur schools, our NHS and our councils are being starved of cash by the SNP.ldquoItrsquos time for Derek Mackay to listen to Scottish Labour and use this money to help the most vulnerable people in our society.Mr Harvie added: \"The Scotland Reserve is the main mechanism to deal with year-to-year volatility in the Scottish public finances, but after the Government draws down money from the Reserve as it proposes, there wonrsquot be enough to cover the predicted shortfall in the coming years.\"The Finance Secretary must explain how he plans to rebuild the reserve so that it can cover the estimated poundbn that is needed, and whether he plans to use tax or spending powers to do this."},{"url":null,"title":"beef event one of the best yet","story":"Early morning rain failed to deter farmers from attending the Scottish Beef Association#s Scotland#s Beef Event  held last month on a leading Aberdeenshire beef farm.Around , people streamed into North Bethelnie Farm, near Oldmeldrum, on Thursday, May .Rural Economy Cabinet Secretary, Fergus Ewing, speaking at the opening ceremony“It was a very successful day and generally recognised as one of the best of the biennial beef events the SBA has organised over the years,” said SBA vice-chairman, David Barron, who chaired the organising committee.“The  trade stands reported good business and the extensive technical demonstration area was thronged throughout the day with farmers keen to pick up all the latest technology for the beef industry.”Mr Barron was full of praise for the host farmers, Robbie and Barbara Milne, and their son, James, who put on a great show.One of the highlights of the day was the tour of the  acre all-grass farm – with no fewer than  tractors and trailers at the ready to avoid queuing – which took visitors right to the top of the hill, where they were treated to an ice-cream from neighbouring farmers, Mackie’s, while enjoying magnicent views of the Aberdeenshire countryside looking up to Bennachie.Beef farmers – like all farmers and indeed the whole of industry – are facing an uncertain future as the debacle and stalemate of the Brexit negotiations continues.The only thing farmers can do is to make sure they are operating as efficiently and productively as possible so they are in a strong position to cope with whatever hits them in the future – in or out of Europe – and they had plenty of pointers at the Beef Event which more than lived up to its theme - Breeding, Feeding, Succeeding.Rural Economy Cabinet Secretary, Fergus Ewing, who in giving the official opening address, reiterated his support for the beef industry and determination to reverse the continuing decline in the national beef herd.But saying is not doing although, in fairness to Mr Ewing, he dropped more than a broad hint that the Scottish Government is looking at an emergency support package for the beef sector. This could take the form of increased headage payments under the existing beef calf support scheme.The SBA, along with NFU Scotland and other industry stakeholders, have been pressing Mr Ewing on the issue and SBA chairman, Neil McCorkindale, was hoping for an announcement by the Cabinet Secretary at the event.This didn’t materialise but Mr Ewing indicated he was sympathetic to the plea and accepted the argument that headage payments would be a more effective approach than area based support which would simply encourage inertia in the industry.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..!

Not content with writing just one book, he decided to author two: one will be the scuttle story in photographs, From Scuttle to Salvage, which will be launched this Thursday, June . The  other, The Last Days of the High Seas Fleet, is the more in depth story of the German Naval mutiny, and how the Fleet came to be interned in Scapa. Both are on sale at the Orcadian Bookshop.As with Jutland, Nick decided to tell the story in film. He is passionate about passing history on to his childrens’ generation, and says he felt that this would be a best way of reaching younger people who prefer video to text. The -minute animation has already been seen by more than , people online, and was made possible through crowdfunding and the help of numerous museums and archives, the Kirkwall Library and Archives being among them.Nick will be talking about the scuttle on June  at pm at the St Magnus Centre, where with him, many of the descendants will participate. He’ll also talk at Stromness Academy on Monday June , and at Kirkwall Grammar School that afternoon.

OK, yes it isspeeding.Surely the issue is appropriate speed # like doing  mph when there are pedestrians or next to schools, built up areas, where there is a limit etc Kat is so right to complain about dangerous driving.It has become an unwanted fad amongst young menwho must be so stupid and so bored that they are prepared to risk le and limbto get their kicks. My belief is that the pointless and brainless cavortings of silly,silly moronic types on programmes like Top Gear are partly to blame.In addition , street racing in cities like London take place late at night driving people to distraction.Police keep an eye on proceedings but it still goes on. Not easy for police cars to safely keep up with idiots in illegally souped up cars travelling , as reported, at  mph.I understand people that have the need for speed. But keep in mind, just because you think you#re a confident driver, that you are safe because you can drive. Doesn#t mean you#re safe. Just recently there was a news report about a drunk driver going off the road and hitting another car. If you#re going at a high speed and that thing comes at you, what can you do  Swerve  There#s a good chance you#re dead, in hospital or best case scenario, your car is totalled.Just because you think you#re a competent driver, doesn#t mean everyone  is. Drive safe.Of course, accidents do happen even to competent,confident, safe drivers but there are people who cast aside such standards in favour of dangerous, unlawful behaviour.These are the ones who need to be severely apprehended.Try to be less pedantic when reading comments.Johan, youseemto have missed the point of Kat’s letter.Nobody has said that overtaking is illegal or wrong but It was estimated that the Audi was travelling at around  to  mph. An offence.In addition , about six or more cars were overtaken in one fell swoop.Not advisable by any stretch of the imagination. Suppose there had been a need to suddenly pull in due to an unforeseen hazard.Something would have had to give , possibly causingan accident.My father used to say to me when I was learning to drive “ always drive asother drivers are stupid”.In short, drive defensively NOT offensively.It seems to me that the Audi driver falls into the stupid category.Better to be ten minutes late in this world than fty years too early in the next.Have you seen this stretch of road  It is the only place in Shetland where there is a lane for overtaking # that is two lanes going up a hill.Very often you are overtaking quite a few things even at  mph going up because of slow things and other cars not overtaking.Unless she actually had a speed gun she cannot judge the speed of things. I regularly see traffic pouring down Herrislea hill and I know that although it looks fast, some of them are actually sticking to the  mph limit.I maintain that it’s better to be safe than sorry.Ease off and keep the undertaker waiting !! Or,you feel so inclined, speed up and become a statistic.Your choice.You need a fair few horses to go up some of our hills at  mph. She is right in that respect, it would need to be a #sporty blue audio or similar#.Johan, I’ve driven on the roads of Shetland and I can’t recall any that could be called steep.Gentle slopes maybe but nothing to compare with the really steep roads of Scotland and Wales. Even England has some pretty steep examples in the Lake District.The sharpest inclines I’ve experienced in Shetlandare on Foula.I doubt that quad bikes would be much use on the hills though I have seenthem being driven on the low level road.It would be interesting to gauge why people bought a certain model of vehicle in proportion to its top speed, and whether or not this was a deciding factor  The power of an engine could be compared as well  How often would the said person go well over the speed limit just to test the engine or impress a passenger in the vehicle with them regardless of any safety  If a vehicle can do  # mph, why would this be allowed  Why would there not be a limiter to say mph installed If the law allows such vehicles to be sold, why would this be the case Good questionI think more and more there will be speed limiters on cars and insurance companies and Companies already want these.Johan,The EU has already sorted this one for us.Thanks MHJ. Electric self charging cars available by then too I would think.It’s an attractive and interesting idea Johan but I doubt that such a short time scale will see the hope come to fruition.Predictions do not suggest that the high cost of EV manufacture will reduce for quite some time to make such purchases viable in the immediate future.Motor production is going through an increasingly lean time and it seems unlikely to me that the decline will bounce back into the black by trying to incrrease the sales of expensive electric cars.

Abandoned - BlissThe first dog to arrive at the centre was -year-old Spaniel Grace, found by a member of the public at the side of the road. She was taken to the vet immediately, but after an owner didn’t come forward, she was brought to Dogs Trust.Two weeks ago, another Spaniel - aged eight and nicknamed Bliss by the team - was found tied to a fence not far from the rehoming centre. Like Grace, the Spaniel has not been microchipped, which has been a legal requirement for all dogs since  and the easiest way to identy a dog who has become separated from their owner. Shockingly just one week later, a Cairn Terrier - less than a year old, was found by a rehoming centre staff member at the very same spot where Bliss was left. Terrier Rizzo was lucky to be found as she is quite small and it would have been easy to miss her in the long grass.The most recent addition to the ranks of abandoned pooches is Sally, an eight-year-old Collie cross, who was found as a stray by a member of the public and brought to the rehoming centre.Abandoned - RizzoOonagh Philips, Rehoming Centre Manager said: “We want to remind anyone who no longer feels that they can care for their dog to contact their local rescue organisation for support. When a dog is abandoned on the road side, it not only puts them in danger, but also drivers. We are so thankful that all four of these dogs were found when they were.“Grace and Bliss were very shaken up by their ordeal when they came into our care and it took them a couple of days to build trust around people again. We could tell Rizzo hadn’t eaten in a while, which could have resulted in a deterioration of her physical health. Sally is incredibly sweet natured, and just like the others, will make a wonderful addition to the right home.“We are not sure why there has been a recent influx in dogs being abandoned. We always remind people that ‘A Dog is for Le®’ but we understand that le happens, and places like Dogs Trust are there to support any dog owner who experiences a bump in the road and needs our help. Sometimes the most responsible thing we can do as a dog owner is admit that we aren’t coping with our pets, but it is important to ensure they are kept safe and not left to fend for themselves.”If you are interested in adopting a dog please get in touch with the team at Dogs Trust Ballymena on  or visit www.dogstrust.org.uk our-centres ballymenaAbandoned - SallyThis is how many points youll get on your licence for these driving offences Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"try catch "},{"url":null,"title":"n i road reopens after road traffic collision","story":"The collision occurred on Glenravel Road near the village of Martinstown in Co.

As a result of its strategic importance both sides concentrated some of their best armoured regiments and equipment in this area. The Guards Armoured Brigade comprised of three tank battalions and had been set up and trained in England. The three battalions were the nd Battalion of the Grenadier Guards, the st Battalion of the Coldstream Guards and the nd Battalion of the Irish Guards. The Irish Guards were recruited from Northern Ireland and the nd Battalion contained men from the Province. You can see it in the tank commanders names. We have Agnew, Brennan, Carson, Connolly, Healy, Harbinson, Mahoney, McCorkell, McGuire, McHugh and Robinson amongst others.The nd Battalion Irish Guards was equipped with American Sherman tanks. These were  ton Medium tanks and mainly equipped with a  mm gun, a useful weapon against infantry but not entirely satisfactory against tanks. The battalion was organised into sub units. There were three squadrons in the battalion, each composed of four troops and each troop had four tanks. The Irish Guards named their tanks after towns and the nd Squadron named theirs with B’s. So we have Ballina, Bangor, Bantry, Belfast, Benbane and Ballynahinch. We also have Ballyraggett and BallymenaBallymena was a special Sherman tank. Ballymena did not have the standard  mm gun. The inconvenient truth for the Allied tank crews was that their tanks were not as good as the best of German ones. A German Tiger tank, for example could destroy a Sherman tank at a distance of over a mile. A Sherman on the other hand would be lucky to harm a Tiger at  yards.  The Britsh crews themselves had already concluded that a Sherman tank was not considered as safe a location as many would have been believed. Hence they covered the front with extra metal tracks and the propensity of the Sherman to do a “Ronson”, that is light up, encouraged the crew to get out very quickly.To deal with the stronger German tanks the Allies devised a way of mounting a bigger gun on some of the Shermans. This new gun was so big it meant redesigning the tank and reducing the size of the crew. These Shermans, now armed with a  pounder gun, which referred to the weight of the shell it fired, were nicknamed FireflyThe Irish Guards arrived in Normandy  days after the initial D Day landings. Caen had still not been completely captured so the Irish Guards eere given a mission to help bypass the city of Caen by gaining ground to the east of the city and drive towards the village of Cagny. This was Operation Goodwood, named after the racecourse in England.Undercover of darkness on the night of th July, Ballymena and the other tanks moved over the River Orne on newly constructed bridges and prepared for battle.The smoke, noise and movement of the battlefield created chaos. Units became mixed up and both sides sometimes got lost. This led to one of the most famous incidents of the battle. By the middle of the afternoon of July th the Irish Guard’s assault is under fire, stalled and mud bound outside the village of Cagny. Lt John Gorman of B Squadron th troop commanding a mm armed Sherman called “Ballyraggett” gets slightly ahead of his comrades and spots a German King Tiger at about yrs. Knowing his gun could do little damage to the King Tiger, Lt Gorman chose a dramatic course of action. He had previously briefed his crew Gunner Albert Scholes, Driver James BaronRadio operator Agnew, and told themhe got the chance they would adopt “Navy tactics”. He instructed Baron to drive at full speed ahead and prepare to ram the German tank. Firing a high explosive shell at close range stunned the inexperienced German crew but had little impact on the tank. However, the high speed collision effectively immobilized both tanks. The Sherman and the King Tiger were abandoned and their crews hid in the fields.Lt Gorman realising the King Tiger was still a viable threat ran towards the nearest Sherman Firefly, in the knowledge only a  pounder gun on the Firefly could do any meaningful damage. This was Ballymena. Some of Ballymena’s crew were already either dead or injured but Gorman jumped in and directed fire on the abandoned King Tiger.  The fighting continued for a while but eventually Gorman was able to rescue his own and other crews and get back to safety.For his exploits Gorman - later Sir John - was awarded the Military Cross. Editor’s note: Sir John, who died aged  in May , was a Northern Irish Roman Catholic Unionist with an unflinching sense of service.After the war he joined the Royal Ulster Constabulary before becoming a senior manager with British Overseas Airways Corporation, then head of the Northern Ireland Housing Executive. Finally he was elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly as the sole Roman Catholic member of the Ulster Unionist Party, and served as Deputy Speaker until the Assemblys suspension in . He was a frequent visitor to Ballymena during his time with the NIHE and he never failed tomention that he had married a Ballymena woman, Norah Caruth. Lady Gorman, passed away peacefully in Ringdufferin Nursing Home in .

At the time it was taken in the iconic Flamingo Ballroom, they were members of local rock’n’blues band, Tailor.The band was formed in the early s by Tucker McIlwee and John Tennant.“Other band members who played with Tailor over the years were Ronnie McAuley, Hubert Dunlop and Ricky Maybin, Henry McQuillan, Dave Moore Trevor Erwin andGerry McNeely. We were transported to and from the gigs by Brian Surgenor, ” says John.“Our first gig was at a place called Betty Staffs in Belfast but we travelled throughout Ireland playing most of the towns on the circuit.“Amazingly, we had never played in Ballymena until Sammy Barr of the Flamingo approached our manager to offer a booking.”It transpired that Tailor were playing on the same bill as Rory Gallagher. As you would expect, the group were excited but, in their own words, ‘not overwhelmed.’John remembers: “We met with Rory and his band during set up,. Rory was a very down to earth guy. We discussed what songs we were going to play as we were going to have a one hour set. The Flamingo was full to the brim, the crowd were electric and Tailor recieved a tremendous welcome.“Following the gig we met with Rory for the photo call. The rest is history. Tailor continued to travel theand breadth of Ireland entertaining the young and not so young ravers until the group members went their seperate ways after six years of traveling on the road.”After years of inaction the group reformed to play two gigs for Cancer research, The Countryman Inn and the Telecom Club were filled to capacity for the night of nostalgia and entertainment. pound was raised for charity.And John ponders: “Will the group do it again  Watch this space!”Rory Gallagherwas an Irish blues and rock multi-instrumentalist,songwriter, and producer.Born in Ballyshannon, County Donegal, and brought up in Cork, Gallagher recorded solo albums throughout the s and s, after forming the band Taste during the late s. His albums have sold over  million copies worldwide.Gallagher received a liver transplant in , but died of complications later that year in London at the age of .He began playing after school with Irish showbands, while still in his early teens. Having completed a musical apprenticeship and influenced by the increasing popularity of beat groups during the early s, Gallagher formed The Taste, which was later renamed simply, Taste, a blues rock and RB power trio, in .Performing extensively in the UK, the group played regularly at the Marquee Club, supporting both Cream at their Royal Albert Hall farewell concert, and the blues supergroup Blind Faith on a tour of North America.After the break-up of Taste, Gallagher toured under his own name. The s were Gallaghers most prolic period. He produced ten albums in that decade, including two live albums, Live in Europe and Irish Tour . November  saw the release of the album Deuce. In the same year he was voted Melody Makers International Top Guitarist of the Year, ahead of Eric Clapton. Though he sold over thirty million albums worldwide, it was his marathon live performances that won him greatest acclaim. He is documented in Irish Tour , a film directed by Tony Palmer.During the heightened periods of political unrest in Northern Ireland, as other artists were warned not to tour, Gallagher was resolute about touring Ireland at least once a year during his career, winning him the dedication of thousands of fans, and in the process, becoming a role model for other aspiring young Irish musicians.

It is just one of many activities we have planned to celebrate the enormous pride that the people of Northern Ireland have in the achievements of our golfing greats. “While Northern Ireland might one day boast its own ‘Mount Rushmore’ for golf, we can reassure everyone that this stunt is digital theatre and something we hope will raise a smile ahead of July.” Robin Daly, son of the late Fred Daly, said: “Our family are extremely honoured that my father is being remembered in this way. We are really looking forward to theof The Open to our shores for the first time in nearly  years and this sculpture is a wonderful tribute to the talents of these local sportspeople who have earned their place in the history book of golf.” McIlroy and McDowell will tee up at Royal Portrush alongside fellow local and former Open Champion, Darren Clarke, in front of a passionate home crowd when one of the world’s greatest sporting spectacles - The Open - s to the famous Dunluce links for the first time in nearly  years.

Kenneth stands aghast as chants of ‘Greysteel seven, Ireland nil’ rain down from the stands as the match kicks off.Shell-shocked following the match and all that went on during those fraught  minutes, Kenneth brings Ernie home and begins to question what could be his inevitable pathhe doesn’t start making some changes.Lead actor Matthew Forsythe has a total of  roles to portray in this fast, furious and incredibly demanding one-man show. It’s no easy task but each character is brought to le vividly through his tone, his stance and his voice. Even a simple fold of the arms can work wonders, whether’s it’s Kenneth’s ‘keeping up with the Jones’ snooty we Deborah, his boss Gerry, or Wee Ernie, the bitter and wheezing father-in-law.Chris Hunter’s set design is in a sense the only other character beside Kenneth and that too is brought imaginatively and effectively to le. Astro turf gives us our pitch, but it’s the innovative scattering of cardboard boxes that turn into Kenneth’s car, his desk, chair – even the soaring New York skyline – which work to greatest effect. A particularly effective ploy is the backdrop of a distorted mirror showing us, the audience, and inviting us to join Kenneth on his journey of reflection.The play comes  years after the curtain first came up in Dubblejoint’s Whiterock theatre space. It remains as dramatic, funny, poignant, worrying and challenging as it was when it burst into our consciousness all those years ago. The question is, how much has changed outside the theatre A Night in November runs at the Lyric Theatre until June  and will then go on tour.

Parishioners and well-wishers packed into Corpus Christi Church for am Mass as the Springhill congregation came together to give thanks for Fr Des’ dedicated service to the West Belfast community.Parish Priest of Corpus Christi Fr Paddy McCafferty, who celebrated the special service, praised Fr Des’ “immense strength and dedication” within and to the community and said the depths of gratitude felt towards him are “immeasurable.” “Fr Des is a champion of the people, Fr Des saw was needed to be done and did it, he is a man without equal.”“Fr Des co-ordinated, instigated and educated the community. I’m almost lost for words when it comes to describing him. I was looking up the meaning of the word ‘platinum’, it means hard wearing, hard, Fr Des was rock hard in his work for the community. What would people have done without him ”On celebrating his Platinum Jubilee Fr Des said: “I never thought I would get this far.“There were more than  priests ordained the same day as I was, most of them are gone from this world, a mere handful of us laughing about which of us will reach the th birthday first.“What I want to do now, most of all is to thank God for allowing me to live among such good family, friends and neighbours during those years. You taught me what le means you taught me that especially during the bad, sad times. I believe we are seeing the beginning of a renewed Ireland, a renewed Christianity, a renewed city of Belfast – and we are privileged to live in one of the most beautul parts of the city – between the beautul mountain that is full of surprises like the feast of bluebells in the beginning of summer to the snow topped hills in winter, between the sweeping magnicent valley of the Lough and the Lagan,” he said. “This must surely be one of the most beautul places for a city to be in.”Fr Des continued: “This is where I learned the best lessons about le and I am grateful to family, friends, neighbours who taught me and even had great patience when I learned so slowly. I learned how good people show their dignity even during the hardest of times, show it most of all during the hard times. “So I am grateful to God for being here, grateful, to all whom I have had the privilege of being family and neighbour to. And very, very hopeful for the future.“Coming out of the worst of times we could now be facing into the best of times. May God and good people make it so. Father Paddy, like our friend Father Aiden, you are with us all at the beginning of a newly awakened Church and a people refreshed by what they have suffered and achieved together. We have good reason to be thankful for that and for each other.#"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"from detroit to north belfast how a big name does a big job","story":"TO say the name Kronk Boxing Gym is iconic in the sport would be an understatement. Located in Detroit and once led by trainer Emanuel Steward, the name is a household word in the sport of boxing.But North Belfast has its a Kronk Boxing Gym, located in the Duncairn Centre on Duncairn Avenue.Formed as Belfast ABC over  years ago by Bobby McAllister, one of the best coaches in Ireland at the time, the club has come a long way since.In December , former secretary of the gym, Damien McCann, played a pivotal role in Limerick boxer Andy Lee turning pro. He then negotiated a lucrative financial management agreement for Lee to turn professional with Emanuel Steward from the world renowned Detroit Kronk Boxing GymLee was Ireland’s rising amateur boxing star and when he beat USA champion, Jesus Gonzales in the semi-finals of the World Junior Championship, a new relationship between Steward and Kronk in Detroit was born with Belfast ABC gym, hence its name today, Kronk ABC Belfast.Past professional coach Tony Dunlop has been a key figure throughout the history of Kronk ABC Belfast and spoke about the club’s illustrious time.“This place started over  years ago when Bobby McAllister walked past the building which was derelict at the time and thought it would be perfect place for a boxing gym,” he explained.“He asked people in the community who were very positive and said that it would be great for young people in the area.“After a period of time, a lot of kids came through the doors. Ryan Burnettt and Paddy Barnes both started off here.“Burnett was groomed from his early days in here to become a superstar. He left here at  fights undefeated and was one of the best in the world at just  years old.“The turning point I suppose was when Emanuel Steward from Kronk gym in Detroit, which is the best gym in the history of boxing, got in touch.“He saw some of the work we were doing and Belfast Kronk Boxing Gym was born –the rest is history as they say.“We have continued to bring through a lot of champions including professionals James Tennyson and Daniel McShane.“Tommy McCarthy is also here now fighting professional.”Today, the club is going from strength to strength under the stewardship of a new breed of coaches in the shape of Paddy Saunders and Martin McCullough.The duo have embarked on a new programme of coaching young people from North Belfast with the aim of using boxing to their benefit.Tony added: “Paddy Saunders and Martin McCullough are both fantastic coaches. They are flying the flag for Belfast Kronk Gym today.“They have started off a new programme with the youth of the area. They are both giving it a million per cent. I’ve never seen two coaches work as hard. Kronk Gym could not be in better hands.”Classes for - to -year-olds take place every Monday, Wednesday and Friday from .pm to .pm with classes for  years and older from .pm to pm on the same days.Paddy Saunders explained: “Many of the kids have behavioural problems and some suffer from autism.“These classes are an outlet and something to focus and concentrate on.“It is not all about boxing but something for them to do. They don’t miss classes.“If we get a few champions out of it, then brilliant, but it is for the kids.“Most boxing clubs don’t take kids at eight years old, but we do.“All the kids start off exercising and running about the big hall before they come into the boxing gym itself.“They are putting their energy into something positive instead of being on the street and engaging in vandalism and anti-social behaviour. I believe there is a bright future for boxing in North Belfast. We have a top-class facility and there are a lot of good kids in here.”To find out more about the club and to get involved, check out the new Kronk ABC Belfast Facebook page."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"local mla gets brexit safety alert","story":"POLICE have delivered an extraordinary advice list to the West Belfast home of a Sinn Féin MLA suggesting ways in which he can improve his and his family’s personal security post-Brexit.The document has already been delivered to the homes of all  MPs across the United Kingdom, but officers who called to the home of Máirtín Ó Muilleoir said they are widening distribution of the document to take in Brexit spokespersons of parties in the north. The leaflet – headlined ‘When It Goes Too Far’ – outlines steps that politicians should takethey are targeted by extremists in any wave of public unrest that may break out post-October , the latest deadline for the UK leaving the EU.The document – which Mr Ó Muilleoir yesterday branded “Brexit bollox – has been compiled by a number of UK agencies: the National Police Chiefs’ Council, the Crown Prosecution Service, the College of Policing and the Electoral Commission. Despite its wide experience in dealing with public unrest, the PSNI has not been involved in drawing up the guidelines. But local police officers have been tasked with distributing it to MLAs closely connected to the Brexit issue.To the fore in the security advice is what Mr Ó Muilleoir and his family should do in the event of being targeted with a hazardous substance. Police advice is to:• Leave the house and seek fresh air.• Treat itchy or painful skin with water.• Remove outer clothing – but not by pulling it over the head.• Remove any substance that may contact clothing or skin by using a dry absorbent material or brushing it off.Advice is also included on what signs may signal the presence of hazardous substances in the home.The leaflet also advises politicians not to engage with iniduals who may be “stalking harassing” them, either online or offline. It urges them to seek further advice on personal safety and building security from their local police force and to conduct a review of what personal information about them is available online.The leaflet explains that the advice is being forwarded for politicians to consultthey are subjected post-Brexit to “unacceptable levels of harassment and intimidation”. It continues: “In some cases, these behaviours and actions have reached the criminal threshold. The worst examples have led to violence and injury.”The most serious example of Brexit-inspired violence was the murder of Labour MP Jo Cox in June  in West Yorkshire by a gun- and kne-wieldingman holding extreme pro-Britain views. Mr Ó Muilleor said: “It seems preposterous to me that the PSNI is promoting Brexit security advice compiled at the behest of a UK government which for three years has shown itself so thoroughly inept in its handling of the issue. There’s little in this that isn’t already known to most people and no reason why it couldn’t have been emailed to me rather than dispatching a police patrol. There are Catholic families in my South Belfast constituency living under the jackboot of the UVF and the flegger bully-boys. The PSNI would be better advised to protect those folk rather than wasting their time and my time with this Brexit bollox.”"},{"url":null,"title":"expert panel appointed to advise uk government on alternative arrangements for irish border after brexit","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The time for that has long since passed.”Mr Varadkar had a meeting with the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier on Thursday morning, at which, the Taoiseach said, the pair agreed that the Withdrawal Agreement would not be reopened but that they were willing to consider amendments to the joint Political Declaration.And he warned: “There’s no Withdrawal Agreement without a backstop and there’s no implementation period without a Withdrawal Agreement.”Two years on after the first round of #Brexit negotiations: good discussion with An Taoiseach @LeoVaradkar, @HMcEntee and their team today on Brexit 🇪🇺🇮🇪 pic ybCkhoJUFV— Michel BarnierJune , Mr Barnier, writing on Twitter, said the pair had a “good discussion”.Of the remaining three Tory leadership hopefuls, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has said the EU “would be willing to renegotiate” a Brexit deal, and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has said he would delay Britain’s departurehe was on the cusp of deal.Front-runner Boris Johnson has said it is essential the UK leaves on October , and suggested the Irish backstop issues could be solved during the implementation period.Earlier, Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte said the next prime minister needs to realise a no-deal Brexit would be bad for the UK.He told BBC Radio ’s Today programme: “With a hard Brexit, even with a normal Brexit, the UK will be a dferent country.I would say a hard Brexit is a hard Brexit.

I don’t see how you can sweeten it.”Nigel Dodds claimed Mr Rutte’s remarks were “utterly uninformed and careless” and saidthe Dutch PM and other EU leaders want to protect the peace process in Northern Ireland “then they will not impose a deal which all unionists in Northern Ireland reject”.The DUP’s Westminster leader said: “The Republic of Ireland’s prime minister has been to the fore in feeding emotionally charged but inaccurate information to his fellow EU heads of government.The desire for murder is not driven by pro-EU sentiments or anti-Brexit sentiments but by a deep sectarian hatred of BritishnessNigel Dodds, DUP“From photocopying and distributing -year-old border bomb stories to repeatedly twisting the Belfast St Andrews Agreements for his own political ends, Leo Varadkar has painted a wildly inaccurate picture for the EU about Northern Ireland and theborder.“London, Brussels and Dublin have all confirmed that even in a no-deal scenario, there would be no hard border. Therefore the comments by Mark Rutte today were utterly uninformed and careless.“Mr Rutte may not realise, but only  days ago the same republican terrorist ideology which bombed the border checkpoints  years ago, attempted to murder a police officer in Belfast.“The desire for murder is not driven by pro-EU sentiments or anti-Brexit sentiments but by a deep sectarian hatred of Britishness.“If Mr Rutte and his fellow EU leaders really want to protect the peace process in Northern Ireland, then they will not impose a deal which all unionists in Northern Ireland reject.“They will work for a sensible deal which everyone can support.“Building a new border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom would run absolutely contrary to the Belfast Agreement.”"},{"url":null,"title":"julie leonard public and private sectors must now overhaul wages after landmark case","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Workers will now have to examine their own pay packets to see have they received any payment for time worked over and above their normal working hours.If not, they should take urgent legal advice as time limits are important, as generally claims need to be lodged within three months of the last payment which was received for holiday pay which did not account for any overtime worked.Employers in both the public and the private sector will have to re-examine their method of payments and, as directed by the Court of Appeal, where appropriate include a payment for overtime in holiday pay.As it has now been defined by the Court of Appeal that workers must be rewarded and recognised for the time worked over and above their contracted hours, the majority of employers, both in the public and private sectors, will now be facing some form of a bill for unpaid overtime.How much will depend on inidual circumstances.Julie Leonard is an employment partner at Edwards  Co Solicitors, Belfast"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37391119.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/road%20closed.jpg","title":"northern ireland traffic alerts railway line closed after security alert","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

This is to ensure that staff welfare is protected and that the delivery of front line services is not adversely affected.\"With overall absence levels at Northern Irelands councils at their highest in   for two consecutive years and consistently ranking as the highest in the United Kingdom, with no indication of improvement, I have decided that councils could benefit from a more detailed report in this area.\"She said the Audit Office would investigate the matter more extensively.Overall, councils are in a financially strong position and managed their finances well in  , the report continued. The £m spent providing services to the public works out at £ on average for every person here.Councils received income of £m, % of which was from district rates.As of March , councils had outstanding loans totalling £.m. In   councils paid almost £m towards the principal outstanding balance and £m in interest costs.Use of agency staff not giving value for moneySome councils are still too heavily reliant on agency staff, leading to warnings that using them is not delivering value for money.In  , total employee costs totalled £m — around % of operating expenditure — with agency staff accounting for a further % .The overall cost of agency staff has continued to increase year on year, rising by £.m last year.Most of this increase was attributed to Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council, and Lisburn and Castlereagh City Council.Agency costs at seven councils either reduced or remained relatively stable. That is an improvement on the previous year, when nine councils saw agency staff costs rise.Local government auditor Pamela McCreedy said: “In   some councils continued to be dependent on agency staff to deliver local services.“I will continue to keep the costs associated with agency staff under review across all councils, and I will also focus on the types of work they perform and theof time they have been working in the council.“There is a risk that over-reliance on agency staff over an extended period of time does not provide value for money.”Severance payouts cost £m from  to Almost £m was spent on council exit packages in the last year.Councils are required to disclose the number and costs of these payments.Expenditure includes compulsory and voluntary redundancy costs, pension contributions and other departure expenses.Over the four years from   to  ,  councils have paid a total of £.m in exit packages to staff. A total of  exit packages were agreed, with  exceeding £,.Many of the payments were linked to the reform of local government, which led to the creation of  super councils in .In   councils agreed  exit packages at a cost of £.m. The average cost was £, —  were greater than £,.The number and cost of exit packages has fallen signicantly since  .However, in the four years preceding  , the average number of exit packages was , with an average cost of £.m.Today’s report states: “The number and cost of exit packages in   remained high and is an indication that councils’ workforce plans had not stabilised.”Not one local authority ready for no-deal BrexitNo council is fully prepared for a no-deal Brexit, today’s report warns.It states the UK’s October  departure from the European Union presents a signicant risk to the operation of local government, and councils have been constrained in terms of planning.“The lack of clarity so far on the shape of an exit deal and a clear way forward, as well as the absence of additional funding, inevitably means that councils have been limited in terms of the practical preparations they can make,” the report states.“Exiting the European Union is a signicant risk to local government service delivery, in particular community planning, the economy and tourism.”Auditors found that Brexit preparations y across councils, with some establishing dedicated working groups or committees.It adds: “No council is fully ready, in operational terms, for a no-deal exit. The outworkings will have most impact on those councils which have a border with the Republic of Ireland.”The report also warns thatthe UK Government and EU fail to agree a withdrawal deal, there will be no transition period and councils will need to respond immediately."},{"url":null,"title":"we can sort out border after brexit says boris as rivals for pm lock horns","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Its the UK that has the border with the Republic of Ireland and its for us to come forward with a solution that would work.\"I think everyone here would agree that what we cant have is ato border infrastructure on the island of Ireland.\"Mr Hunt added that the UK needs to show that it can keep the border open. \"I think that through technology we can do that but we have to do that in a way that doesnt trap us in the customs union,\" he said.Home Secretary Sajid Javid said he was \"% committed to the Good Friday Agreement and keeping an open border\".\"In my department, Borderforce has looked at this issue and its perfectly possible to have an open border with two dferent customs arrangements on either side of the border using existing technology,\" he said - although Ms Maitlis pointed out that the existence of the technology to do so is in doubt. \"Obviously it will take time to put that in place and it will cost money. I would have a time limit on the backstop. There will have to be some sort of compromise.\"International Development Secretary Rory Stewart said that he had visited Enniskillen and Londonderry recently and argued that Mr Johnsons plans wouldnt deal with trade tarfs for farmers in border regions.Mr Johnson said that there would \"be no tarfs or quotas\" and that he wanted a \"standstill in current arrangements\" until a trade agreement was negotiated.Mr Stewart said that the Withdrawal Agreement was legally binding and would not be renegotiated before October , and accused the other candidates of not explaining how they would enact their Irish border plans.Following the answers, the questioner Mark said that there was \"a lot of fear and confusion in Northern Irelandwe come crashing out without a deal\", adding that he had been \"hoping for more\" from the candidates.The backstop aims to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland after Brexit, but opponents have claimed it could keep the UK aligned with the EU indefinitely and create a trade border in the Irish Sea.The backstop effectively ended Theresa Mays hopes of getting her Brexit deal through Parliament and its failure hastened her departure as Prime Minister.However, the EU has said it will not renegotiate the deal, which includes the backstop.Ballots of Conservative MPs will continue over the next few days to whittle the race down to the final two candidates. The final stage of the leadership race will begin and members will then vote on the next Party leader and Prime Minister, with the result expected on July ."},{"url":null,"title":"irish language to be taught through pe classes","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

However, he dropped his religious studies in favour of a career in journalism.However, prior to this he had gained a doctorate from Edinburgh University for his contribution to charting the history of the church. It was during this particular course of study that he submitted some articles to the Belfast News Letter that led to an invitation to become a member of its staff.He accepted this position and by  he was the paper’s editor.In , after a political dispute with the News Letter’s owner he resigned and briefly became editor of the Londonderry Standard.Then, between - McKnight was appointed editor of the Banner of Ulster and it was in this period, as a result of the tenant grievances that he witnessed, he became fearful that another rebellion in the mould of the  United Irishmen would erupt.When he ed as editor of the Londonderry Standard he further developed the campaign for tenant rights. Also upon histo the Standard he married the owner of the paper’s sister-Miss Catherine McPherson of Balloughry.At this time the majority of small farmers in Ulster relied on weaving to bolster their income as well as working the land.The coming campaign of agitation was a daunting one and its success depended upon defeating Tory landlords who held all the Parliamentary representation in the country.In effect, farmers were serfs who were obliged to pay rents regulated solely by landowners who also firmly held the reins of political power. As a result, tenant farmers lived in almost perpetual fear of increased tarfs and evictionthey failed to pay them.As Repeal of the Union agitation gathered strength in the south of Ireland, James McKnight simultaneously championed the cause of Presbyterian farmers in the north. The fight centred on the three F’s-fixity of tenure, fair rents and free sale.An example of Dr James McKnight’s famed oratory was captured in a speech he delivered whilst on the tenant rights campaign trail in Newtonards in this era.“I have no language sufficiently strong to convey my contempt for policies which, under the hypocrisy of religion, degrade Christianity to an engine of State intrigue,” he said.The journalist’s abilities seemed to be sufficiently feared by the English political hierarchy to the extent that after he had led a deputation to meet Prime Minister Robert Peel on the issues at hand, he was offered a Parliamentary seat in County Wexford in an obvious attempt to bring him ‘from the cold.’ James McKnight declined the offer.The Tenant Right League was established in August of  and was formed chiefly by Charles Gavan Duffy and Frederick Lucas.The movement was remarkable in that for a time it united Protestant and Catholic tenants. In fact, Duffy named his movement The League of North and South.The political battle was framed against the backdrop of the Encumbered Estates Act of . Essentially, this legislation enabled the sale after the Great Famine, of Irish estates whose owners could not meet their financial obligations.In the north of Ireland, Anglican and Presbyterian ministers feared these new landlords would destroy the established Ulster custom of compensating tenants who made improvements to the land.At the same time in the south, politically conscious Catholic priests wanted to adopt the compensation custom in the north as a measure of reform in their part of the island.The League was a conglomeration of the Tenant Protection Societies and the Ulster Tenant Rights Association led by William Sharman Crawford. Unity between the organisations was unfortunately short lived because of objections to the involvement of Catholic clergy in the south.Larger tenant farmers were primarily interested in securing Fixity of Tenure while the smaller farmers prioritised fair rents. To strengthen the campaign the leaders of the League sought the support of Irish MPs to oppose any government that would not back the ‘Ulster Custom.’In this respect, the Tenant Rights League achieved success through the efforts of its national organiser John Martin. It garnered the support of the surviving Repealers of the Union in the House of Commons as well as a number of radical English radical MPs.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshAnd, all of these supportive elements agreed that a Land Act incorporating the three F’s would be the overall objective of the political campaign.Then, at the  General Election some fty Tenant Rights candidates including Gavan Duffy, Frederick Lucas and John Sadlier all won seats at Westminster where they sat as the Independent Irish Party.The League’s success however proved short lived when it was first weakened and then ultimately destroyed by the resurfacing of old sectarian isions.Firstly, a number of prominent members broke away and formed the Catholic Defence Association-referred to as the ‘Pope’s Brass band’ by some in the organisation. Supporters of the League were also subjected to a campaign of intimidation by the landlords.However, the most serious blow came when Frederick Lucas came into conflict with the Archbishop of Dublin, Dr Paul Cullen. The high-ranking cleric had forbidden his priests from involvement in political issues causing Lucas took his complaint about Dr Cullen to Rome. This succeeded only in alienating the Catholic church in Ireland from the fight.Then, Frederick Lucas died in October  shortly after the failure of his plea to the Papacy. A month later, Gavan Duffy emigrated to Australia.The League finally fell apart in  with the Independent Irish Party following it into oblivion the following year.It was not however the end of the tenants rights campaign. The baton that had been dropped by the League and the Independent Irish Party was picked up again by Bishop Thomas Nulty of Meath. It was then spearheaded by the Land League in  and the three F’s became anchored in legislation under the Land LawAct in .In general, the cause of tenants rights was more successful in the south of Ireland. In the north, landlords were more firmly entrenched and the issue of the Repeal of the Union had caused many northern delegates in the League to walk away and fight the cause as unionists or Liberal Tenant Righters.However, almost  years before the Land LawAct enshrined the F’s in law, in the north Mr SM Greer had gained the County Derry seat against the power of landlordism.Thirteen years later in  when Gladstone introduced a Land Bill that embodied the principles of tenant rights, it was Dr James McKnight that the government of the day consulted. That same parliamentary term also saw the introduction of the Ballot Act which ended intimidation.This shows that the journalist had at the outset been for a period a lone voice advocating social reform in Ireland.Without doubt, Dr McKnight had been regarded as the leader and champion of the rights of the Presbyeterian farmers and for his efforts was presented with a testimonial and £ by them. He died on June ,  aged  at his house on East Wall in his adopted homeplace of Derry.A glimpse of the le of James McKnight and his we outside of the newspaper business and political campaigning came around  years after his passing when his former paper, the Derry Standard marked the death of his spouse Catherine on February , .The Standard said: “We greatly regret to record the death of Mrs McKnight, formerly of this city, which took place at College Square East, Belfast, on Monday after a somewhat protracted illness during which she was tenderly nursed by her sister, Miss Rebecca McPherson.“The deceased was the we of the former editor of this paper, James McKnight L.L.D and was well known in this city thirty years ago, when Dr McKnight’s house on the East Wall and subsequently at Warrenhill, was the rendezvous of a circle of congenial spirits, who often met to enjoy the refined society of Dr McKnight and his accomplished we.“Among the welcome guests were generally to be found the late Rev William McClure, Reverend Professor Wallace and Reverend Richard, afterwards Professor Smyth MP.“At an earlier period in their domestic history they had the honour of entertaining the late Thomas Carlyle, who met at their house all the leading Derry celebrities of the time and in the book which he afterwards published made some remarks on his fellow guests that were more plain than pleasant but he said all that was kind and complimentary of the host and his gentle helpmate and commended the quality of the doctors tobacco.“After the death of Dr McKnight, Mrs McKnight visited the principle cities on the Continent, and spent some time in Italy enjoying the beauty and art of that classic land, which she was so well able to appreciate.“Although highly cultivated, and possessing good literary abilities, she was not successful as a writer, and her only work, ‘The Friend of the Poor’, was not read beyond her personal circle of friends.“For some years past Mrs McKnight has lived in Belfast, and there she passed away on Monday morning last, after a lingering illness, which she bore with patient and cheerful resignation.“The interment will take place in the Cemtery at Derry today, the funeral leaving the terminus of the Northern Counties railway at ten o’clock.”Dr James and Mrs Catherine McKnight had no children.CAPTION: Dr James McKnight."},{"url":null,"title":"jeremys marathon effort raises","story":"Jeremy Lewis from Llanfair Caereinion ran the Edinburugh marathon on Sundayto raise as mltspan classtruncate-full-screengtuch money as possible for Teenage Cancer Trust! \" Jeremy#s marathon effort raises £,Jezza runs Jeremy Lewis and his son, Will.\" Skip to next photo Show caption  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\" href\" my account emailthispage \""},{"url":null,"title":"global wellness day 2019 celebrated at","story":"Children from the First Steps Nursery joined in the celebrations and walks at Llltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtandrindod Wells Lakeltspan classtruncate-full-screengtside after the renaming ceremony.Picture: Ernie Hussonlt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Pictures: From the day Llandrindod Wells changed its name to promote healthy livingThe launch of Llandrindod Wellness day at the Hotel pole.

They have also branded claims the mercury bath poses a health and safety risk as a ldquored herring and fear that replacing the existing mechanism could potentially damage the Fresnel lens.Described as a ldquoworkshop, the January meeting lasted over one hour with the official council record of the debate that ensued only amounting to a paltry two and a half lines.The Lecale Lightkeepers vehemently argued that they had a case for briefing councillors on the impact the loss of the beam would have but, surprisingly, the request was initially rejected.Instead, council officials insisted that officers from the the Commissioners of Irish Lights would be invited to future meetings of the districtrsquos respective DEA Forums to discuss the future of the lighthouse.The local authority said this was to ensure that information could be shared and that local stakeholders and communities were fully consulted on any proposals for the lighthouse in the immediate future, before any plans are finalised.Council officials also insisted that wide ranging public consultation on the future of the lighthouse would take place.Campaigners mdash who were at a complete loss to understand why they were initially refused an opportunity to meet directly with councillors over five months ago mdash have now been told they will get a chance to brief them and outline their case for the retention of the beam.The Lecale Lightkeepers have described the plan to remove the beam as ldquototally inadequate and unacceptable and are looking forward to outlining their case for its retention.They are also pleased that having heard from the Commissioners, politicians can now have face-to-face dialogue with campaigners.Campaigners have held several discussions with the Commissioners and frequently engage with the organisation as part of the bid to retain what they have described as a key facet of Lecalersquos heritage.ldquoWe welcome the opportunity to meet with councillors to demonstrate just how passionate people are about the retention of the beam, the spokeswoman declared. It is a symbol of unity in Lecale and has brought together all sides of our erse community. It must be retained.ldquoMeeting with councillors is particularly important for us. We have put together a detailed presentation on the lighthouse issue and will outline our concerns about the future of the beam which we cannot afford to lose for a whole host of reasons.The spokeswoman said that in the interests of fairness and given the sensitive nature of the beam issue, it was important that they meet with local politicians.ldquoCouncillors have had the opportunity to hear from the Commissioners and it is important that they hear what we have to say as the group representing those opposed to this controversial proposal, she continued.ldquoThe beam must be retained for future generations given that it is an intrinsic part of the maritime history and heritage of the area and is a stunning feature of the Lecale landscape.The spokeswoman added: ldquoNewry, Mourne and Down Council is backing the campaign to retain the sweeping beam and it is it important that councillors hear directly from campaigners. The beam must be retained we simply cannot afford to lose it from this area and see it consigned to the pages of history..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Curran steps down from government association position  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK councillor Dermot Curran is stepping down from his role as president of the Northern Ireland Local Government Association this Friday.The group is the representative body for the provincersquos  councils and Cllr Curran will leave his position at the grouprsquos annual conference which is taking place at Newcastlersquos Burrendale Hotel.The Ardglass man is Northern Irelandrsquos longest serving district councillor, having been elected to the former Down Council in , following the reorganisation of local government.He has served as NILGA president twice describing the accolade as both a ldquoprivilege and a challenge.While stepping down as the organisationrsquos president, Cllr Curran will remain a key member of the NILGA Executive.Cllr Curran mdash who was last month re-elected to Newry, Mourne and Down Council mdash has been a councillor for  years and while already Northern Irelandrsquos longest serving politician, some of his council colleagues believe that he is the longest serving in the British Isles.Dedicated to public service, Cllr Curran said he has ldquothoroughly enjoyed his second term at NILGArsquos helm and looks forward to continuing his work with the organisation.He also believes that local councils will continue to play increasingly important roles in their respective areas and that an opportunity exists to unlock the potential of local government as the hub of public services.Cllr Curran said that over recent years councils had changed dramatically, as had the political, financial and legal environment in which councillors operate.He said while local authorities had more responsibilities and power than before, they were also increasingly stretched in terms of finances and resources, an issue which has been compounded since the suspension of the Assembly.ldquoThe  councils are a key element of investment and public service delivery, but they control just % of the public purse.

However, I doubt many think that it is the cradle of horse racing, but it is.We do of course have a famous racecourse, which has just hosted a festival of racing as part of the DownTime Summerfest.Some of you, dear readers, may even know that there is an earlier racecourse in Downpatrick mdash at Old Course Road. So racing has been going on for centuries in our beautul corner of the world. And we have also played a vital role in the foundation of the Sport of Kings.The breed of horse associated with modern horse racing is the thoroughbred. A mere glance is enough to tell even the casual observer that the thoroughbred does not look like other horses.When compared to a pony or carthorse, the thoroughbred is leaner, taller and sleeker. In fact, these horses are perfectly designed for racing. They have big lungs, a big heart and long, slender legs that can move swtly.They also need special care when compared with native breeds. They have thin hair coats and so need to wear rugs or live in stables in bad weather. They need special food to give them energy to race. So these features tell you that the ancestor of the modern thoroughbred came from somewhere hot mdash from the desert, in fact. The ancestor of our racehorses is from Arabia.Back in the th century, horses were bred for work and war, not pleasure. Officers prized horses that were fast to get them in and out of battle and keep them alive. By this time, the medieval charger of knights mdash the destrier mdash was out of fashion. They were too slow and cumbersome, and soldiers no longer wore heavy suits of armour.So the horse evolved through selective breeding to become fleet of foot. There were no horses faster than the Arabian, which was specially bred to become bigger and faster than its wild cousin. The armies of the Ottoman Sultan developed special studs to create this new war machine.In , one of these fine stallions, known as the Byerley Turk, found himself outside the gates of Vienna. The Ottoman Sultan wanted to capture the imperial capital of the Holy Roman Empire, an objective he failed to achieve when the Polish King John III Sobieski led the greatest cavalry charge in history to defeat the Ottoman forces.The Byerley Turk was captured and eventually brought to England, finding himself in the ownership of one Captain Byerley.His adventures were not over though. Recognising a fine animal, Captain Byerley adopted the Turk as his war horse. In  hewas called to Ireland to fight for King William and in  he fought at the Battle of the Boyne. Indeed, Captain Byerley later attributed his surviving that battle to the swtness of his favourite war horse.After the battle, the Turk was entered in a horse race mdash in Downpatrick. Of course, he went on to win that race and go on to be one of the most famous horses in history. The Flying Horse housing development to the east of Downpatrick is named after this famous race.The remarkable career of the Turk continued mdash and now we come to his ultimate destiny. He was put out to stud in Yorkshire. His pedigree was highly prize and he became the first of only three foundation sires of the modern thoroughbred breed.Genetic testing has revealed it is his DNA that is the most common in all modern racehorses. His progeny are successful right to this day including names such as Dr Devious, Ahonoora and Indian Ridge.And it all started with a fateful race in Downpatrick over  years ago. Needless to say,Downe Vets had been around then and caring for his veterinary needs, we feel he could have achieved more..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Hurlers seeking big upset at Croke Park  ","story":"DOWN senior hurlers go into Saturdayrsquos Christy Ring Cup final at Croke Park against Meath as rank outsiders.Few pundits outside the Down camp expect anything other than a comfortable win for Meath, but say that quietly in and around Ronan Sheehanrsquos new kids on the block.The Newry man, who has close connections to several Cork hurling legends, has engendered a new-found enthusiasm and confidence in his charges.His young hurlers are a real surprise packet this season and getting to the Christy Ring Cup final is a major achievement for his fledgeling side.Sheehan has invested heavily in youth and has two schoolboys in his starting .Downpatrickrsquos Tim Prenter, who plays his club hurling for Ballygalget and Ballycranrsquos Phelilm Savage are both in their final year at St Patrickrsquos Grammar School and De La Salle, Downpatrick, respectively.Both lads were in the Down Schoolsrsquo side that lted the Mageean Cup earlier in the season and both hail from famous sporting families.Prenter, who also won a MacLarnon Cup medal with the Red High a few months back, is the son of former Antrim senior football defender Kieran Prenter and his grandfather Seamus Burns was a well known member of the all-conquering Belfast Celtics basketball team that swept all before them in the s and s.Savage, whose brother Liam is also in the team, is the son of former Ballycran and Ulster midfielder Gary lsquoGazarsquo Savage, who was also a noted centre half with Ballycam Celtic in the Newcastle League.There are also several other young players in the  with Portaferryrsquos Matthew Conlon, Ronan Blair, Darragh Mallon, Tom Murray, Caolan Taggart and Eoghan and Daithi Sands all in their early s.Throw in Liatroimrsquos Oisin McManus, P J Davidson and Ruairi McCrickard and Ballycranrsquos Stephen Keith, Gerard Hughes, Huw Flynn and Liam and Phelim Savage and you have the nucleus of squad that could dominate Ulster hurling for years.In addition to Prenter, Ballygalget provide the squad with, John McManus, Danny Toner, Marc Fisher and Cathal Coulter with Newry Shamrocks providing Paul Sheehan and Jordan Murphy.Helping Ronan Sheehan from the sidelines is Cork legend Diarmuid OrsquoSullivan and the Down manager believes his support has been critical in moving the side forward.ldquoDiarmuid has been doing a bit of defensive coaching for us and he has been there for all of the Christy Ring Cup games, he said.ldquoHe would know a lot of the boys from the development squads because he wouldrsquove come and done coaching sessions down through the years.

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them. This has been carried out in towns and cities across the UK to protect the local heritage.The petition can be found at www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-the-victorian-heritage-of-penarth u .I will continue to work with your local Labour councillors on these issues.

And under my leadership, a Conservative administration will proudly put the people of the Vale of Glamorgan first.ldquoNaturally, we are open to working with other councillors who share those ideals.ldquoOthers - including those who resigned from the Conservative party - will have to explain to voters where they stand on these issues - and I would urge them to back us, rather than propping up a Labour administration that was rejected by the Vale at the last election.Cllr Bailey said he had a six-point plan for the Vale.He pledged to deliver the Dinas Powys bypass stop inflation-busting council tax rises scrap proposed parking charges review the local development planto curb inappropriate development protect rural schools and oppose the Barry Biomass plant.Cllr Bailey said that he was also keen to improve engagement with the public, after a series of hugely unpopular decisions taken by the existing cabinet.He said: ldquoDuring the elections in , we promised to build a stronger relationship with local residents by consulting them on key decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, too many people feel that their views are simply being ignored and that Vale consultations are just tick box exercises. Take the proposals around car parking charges, or the closure of Llancarfan School. I donrsquot think anyone outside of the Civic Offices believes that those decisions werenrsquot already done deals, and thatrsquos simply unacceptable.ldquoAnother good example is the councilrsquos failure to listen to the public over Penarthrsquos original Victorian lamp posts.ldquoIrsquove been criticised for wanting to listen to the people who elected me, and I make no apologies for that. Under my leadership, thatrsquos exactly what would happen and whilst I do accept that there are dficult decisions to be taken, we have to take the public with us - not ignore their legitimate concerns. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

People should be able to disagree with each other without resorting to abuse.Devolution is a journey not a destination.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John. He really made an impact on our wards and with our patients who listened to his shows.ldquoItrsquos such a lovely way to mark not only Johnrsquos birthday but also to mark the contribution he made as a volunteer during Volunteersrsquo Week. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people. If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people. We have to say these are the facts and whether we like it or not we will have to do some things dferently or not at all.Cllr Burnett added. ldquoBut we have to be honest about the levels of pressure on local government.ldquoOur priority has to be services to the most vulnerable.The Labour-led coalition includes members of the former Conservative cabinet, which quit the party when former leader John Thomas was deposed as leader of the Vale Tories. The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for. It will be realistic and fair for everybody.School improvementsThe new cabinet says delivering on major new school buildings is a priority for the new administration.Developments in the pipeline include new builds forPencoedtre and Whitmore High Schools, and expansion and refurbishment of Ysgol Gymraeg Bro MorgannwgAgeing schools in the Vale are set to get a pound. million cash boost for repairs.Llancarfan Primary SchoolLlancarfan Primary School was set to be lsquoclosedrsquoand moved to a new pound million facility in Rhoose.The previous cabinet had approved the plans despite protests from parents and campaigners.Cllr Moore said Llancarfan School move was ldquopremature - but did not commit to scrapping the plan entirely.ldquoIf itrsquos justiable itrsquos justiable, he said. ldquoIf itrsquos not, we will look at alternatives.ldquoItrsquos not an easy decision to take. Itrsquos something we have to take some time about.ldquoWhat Irsquom not going to do is jump or kowtow to people who shout the loudest.Cllr Burnett has previously tweeted the closure of Llancarfan ldquowouldnrsquot be happeningLabour were running the council.New roadsWork continues on outline business cases for two major new roads being proposed ndash the A to M link around Pendoylan and Dinas Powys Bypass between Barry and Cardf ndash but no decision has been made whether either will actually go ahead.The future of both roads rests on whether Welsh Government and the council deem them viable, and whether ministers cough up the cash to fund them.But Cllr Moore said he doesnrsquot think Welsh Government will find the money required for the Dinas Powys Bypass.ldquoItrsquos out of our hands, he said.IncineratorCllr Moore said he believes Welsh Government will order the Barry Biomass incinerator to carry out an environmentalimpact assessment.Cllr Moore, who has previously attacked what he termed ldquoscaremongering and lies around the biomass plant, said he did not want the facility in Barry Docks.He said: ldquoWe opposed it vehemently, both as a council and as a party and personally. It shouldnrsquot be there.ldquoBut now it is there it has to operate within legal parameters.ldquoIf it does, therersquos nothing anyone can do about it.The council refused the original planning permission for the facility, but a planning inspector allowed it in  following an appeal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Abandoned - BlissThe first dog to arrive at the centre was -year-old Spaniel Grace, found by a member of the public at the side of the road. She was taken to the vet immediately, but after an owner didn’t come forward, she was brought to Dogs Trust.Two weeks ago, another Spaniel - aged eight and nicknamed Bliss by the team - was found tied to a fence not far from the rehoming centre. Like Grace, the Spaniel has not been microchipped, which has been a legal requirement for all dogs since  and the easiest way to identy a dog who has become separated from their owner. Shockingly just one week later, a Cairn Terrier - less than a year old, was found by a rehoming centre staff member at the very same spot where Bliss was left. Terrier Rizzo was lucky to be found as she is quite small and it would have been easy to miss her in the long grass.The most recent addition to the ranks of abandoned pooches is Sally, an eight-year-old Collie cross, who was found as a stray by a member of the public and brought to the rehoming centre.Abandoned - RizzoOonagh Philips, Rehoming Centre Manager said: “We want to remind anyone who no longer feels that they can care for their dog to contact their local rescue organisation for support. When a dog is abandoned on the road side, it not only puts them in danger, but also drivers. We are so thankful that all four of these dogs were found when they were.“Grace and Bliss were very shaken up by their ordeal when they came into our care and it took them a couple of days to build trust around people again. We could tell Rizzo hadn’t eaten in a while, which could have resulted in a deterioration of her physical health. Sally is incredibly sweet natured, and just like the others, will make a wonderful addition to the right home.“We are not sure why there has been a recent influx in dogs being abandoned. We always remind people that ‘A Dog is for Le®’ but we understand that le happens, and places like Dogs Trust are there to support any dog owner who experiences a bump in the road and needs our help. Sometimes the most responsible thing we can do as a dog owner is admit that we aren’t coping with our pets, but it is important to ensure they are kept safe and not left to fend for themselves.”If you are interested in adopting a dog please get in touch with the team at Dogs Trust Ballymena on  or visit www.dogstrust.org.uk our-centres ballymenaAbandoned - SallySix teenagers reported missing

offices in Portadown, Lurgan and Banbridge.Sinn Fein MLA John O’Dowd has written to the NIHE’s Chief Executive opposing any plans to close local offices.The NIHE admitted it is looking at the way customers access services. A spokesperson said: “We can confirm that in south region specically, we are looking at a number of options which include phased relocation and reduced hours given there are five offices within a short geographical distance of each other. But no decision has yet been taken.”Mr O’Dowd said: “I have been made aware that the Housing Executive is intending to a close a number of district housing offices including, Banbridge, Lurgan, and Portadown offices. Staff are being transferred to Marlborough House in Craigavon and other regional offices.“I am very concerned about the implications of this news for Executive tenants. They are losing a much valued local service and contact with Executive staff.“I am calling on the Housing Executive to carry out a full Equality Impact assessment and rural needs assessment before any final decisions are made about the future of the local offices.“The Housing Executive are a vital part of community infrastructure and should not be disappearing from local areas.“I have written to the Chief Executive of the Housing body to express concern and to request an urgent update on the future of local district offices.” A Housing Executive spokesperson said: “The Housing Executive is currently looking at how to best deliver its service and we are committed to maintaining services in local areas in line with customer demand.“Any proposals would be subject to a formal process to include consultation with union, staff, customers, the local community and political representatives. It will also assess the impact on equality and rural areas.“We would like to reassure customers that any decision taken by the Housing Executive will not affect the high quality service we deliver to them. We have also reassured our staff that there will not be job losses as a result of any changes to how we deliver services locally.”The spokesperson added: “The way in which our customers access services is rapidly changing. “We have seen a % reduction in footfall into our offices in the last four years, and a marked increase in telephone and online contact and we expect this trend to accelerate in the future.

develop our online services for our tenants within the next year and have already extended our phone service operating hours. “We have also changed the way in which we deliver services to our tenants and those who are seeking social housing by increasing the number of front line officer and having them call directly to customers’ homes rather than them having to visit our offices. “We are, of course, mindful that our customers are requiring our assistance now more than ever, and that is why we offer services online, on the phone and face to face across Northern Ireland. “We want to be able to respond to the needs of our customers and provide the services they require, while at the same time ensuring value for money and effective use of our offices.“Currently, we have offices in buildings which we either own or which we rent from private or public sector landlords. “We would prefer to spend money on services than unnecessarily on buildings. “If we have any proposals to alter services across Northern Ireland or in a local area, we will of course be consulting with the local community, staff, their unions and political representatives.”try catch  TrendingFriends urged to

The application area also stretches or borders on  Areas of Special Scientic Interest from the boundaries of Belfast Lough to the glacial peat deposits of Benburb.“We have serious concerns about the impact oil and gas exploration will have on bioersity, on intensying our reliance on carbon-heavy industry and on people and communities here. “We consider this a regionally signicant application and, as such, the decision is likely to be taken by the Department for the Economy. “It is important that the Department hears and understands the strength of opposition to these proposals,” they said calling for the restoration of an Executive.Cllr O’Hanlon said: “Where we dfered with Councillor Lavery is that he sought to form a Council view in a Council Committee when the correct prcedure is to formally bring a notion of motion to Full Council.We advised Councillor Lavery of the proper process and said we would support such a motion. “The SDLP are opposed to fracking, just as we are opposed

Thats signicantly higher than % of bosses globally. And according to the firm’s latest Global CEO Outlook, Northern Ireland’s bosses are leading the way when it comes to embracing the ‘fast fail’ culture in an effort to make their companies as innovative as possible. Of the Northern Ireland bosses surveyed, % said they want their employees to feel ‘empowered to innovate. On the issue of Brexit, around two thirds of business leaders see the UK’s exit from the EU as the greatest threat to growth. Looking at overall growth, all of those questioned said they expect ‘top line revenue growth over the next three years’. But just % of company bosses said they ‘expect to increase headcount in the next three years of more than %’. John Hansen, partner in charge of KPMG Northern Ireland, said: “Successful CEOs know they need their companies to be as innovative as possible and it’s clear that the right environment is being created in Northern Ireland to do just that. “Our leaders aren’t afraid to give their teams the scope to try new ideas which may have a risk of failure and that opens up a world of potential. This level of freedom will no doubt make sure that Northern Ireland companies are at the cutting edge of innovation in the years to come.” Angela McGowan, CBI director in Northern Ireland, said: “KPMG’s  Global CEO Outlook gives local business leaders some great insights into what is on the radar for chief executives across the globe and raises some important and interesting ideas around what leaders should doing to maintain competitive advantage despite the uncertainty.”  View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/glandore_web.jpg","title":"glandore the family flexible workspace on the rise","story":"Posted on Wednesday June  by Ulster Business High-end flexible office company Glandore has expanded rapidly into an all-island family business with further growth on the horizon. Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/tradeniiii.jpg","title":"new northern ireland trade alliance formed","story":"Posted on Wednesday  June  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s newest trade body alliance will take its message to Westminster later this year amid the ongoing political vacuum at home and with Brexit on the horizon. Trade NI is an alliance between Hospitality Ulster, headed by Colin Neill, Manufacturing NI, Stephen Kelly, and Retail NI, Glyn Roberts, and aims to represent a wider swathe of Northern Ireland’s private sector amid the “paralysis” surrounding a lack of Executive and therefore a lack of local political voice on the UK’s exit from the EU. The group will take its message to London on September , hosting an event to once again bring together politicians, businesses, stakeholders and the media to raise awareness of the issues and challenges facing companies here. The alliance, which has been supported by the likes of Heathrow Airport, Danske Bank and Flybe, outlined its aims at its launch in the Cathedral Quarter, Belfast, to an audience of business leaders from across Northern Ireland. “Northern Ireland is facing huge economic and political challenges ahead with Brexit, no Assembly, and a rapidly changing global economy,” the group said. “Trade NI will seek to give leadership on behalf of our three sectors and provide new policy solutions to creating a modern local economy.” “The paralysis that has been created with the lack of an Assembly and Executive has developed a situation where very little has been done to address the needs of our sectors or the economy at large. “The sht of power from Stormont to Westminster means that we must press decision makers there to implement policies and make legislative changes that will help grow Northern Ireland. Our local economy and businesses have taken a back seat and we simply cannot afford that situation any longer. “Our three organisations represent most of the businesses that make up private sector jobs in Northern Ireland. Therefore, a louder voice needs to be heard on their behalf so that they don’t suffer in the wake of the local political issues. We want a reboot of the economic policy of Northern Ireland, in order to benefit our economy and safeguard our growing business community.” “Last year we held a NI business reception with over  people that brought together the Northern Ireland Secretary of State, MPs, lords, ministers and key political influencers in Westminster to bring focus to Northern Ireland issues.” “This was a great opportunity to be able to discuss the key concerns of the business community with national political decision makers and help them understand the priorities needed for Northern Ireland, and to promote Northern Ireland as a great place in the United Kingdom to locate or start a business.” Kevin Kingston, chief executive of Danske Bank, the main sponsor of Trade NI’s forthcoming Westminster reception, said that “Northern Ireland has a strong business community and should be considered across the United Kingdom as a thriving business hub for the global market”. “The vitality of the private sector is imperative to the strength of the Northern Ireland economy. We must ensure Northern Ireland businesses are well positioned to be able to compete in the post-Brexit environment. We will continue to work alongside the Trade NI alliance and other key influencers to make sure that Northern Ireland, as a constituent part of the United Kingdom, remains a key priority at Westminster.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
