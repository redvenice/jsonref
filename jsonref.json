I love the stark nature of the Icelandic landscape and its contrasts. Deltas form from glacial meltwater running down towards the shoreline, picking up silt and different materials along the way to create these ribbon patterns. There’s all sorts of wildlife too – birds, beautiful wild horses, seals.So a few years ago after a lot of research, cross-referencing Google Earth with books and photography by others, I took a red eye from New York to Reykjavik. It was kind of funny to take a jumbo jet, have three hours upon landing to rent a car, check into my hotel and nap for 20 minutes and then turn around to meet a pilot and spend the day up in the air again in his homemade plane.You can do all the research you want for these projects, but nothing compares to actually seeing things in person. Being in an airplane above that landscape was really magical. Emotional, even.At first, when you’re flying around in a tiny plane, opening the door and hanging out to take pictures, it’s a little nerve-wracking. You see your life flash before your eyes. But I’ve become quite comfortable doing it and am able to be extremely focused.We were looking for the birds – they are Arctic tern, or sea swallows. They are small and quite difficult to spot. But we found this flock circling very fast. We were flying above them at a safe distance. I’ve come to realise animals are actually not that intimidated by planes. There have been countless times we have been flying over flamingos or buck, seals, turtles, 100 feet above them – which is really quite low – and they just could not have cared less. .I knew exactly which terrain I wanted to capture the tern flying over: that patterning of white pebbles against the black sand. We circled several times until finally they lined up as perfectly as I could have asked for and I was able to get several shots.I started working in this way in 2009. I had just finished a two-week commercial job in Botswana and had a couple of extra days to kick around the area. Somebody knew a bush pilot who had his own plane and said: “This guy wants something to do.” On a whim, I said, “Sure, that’d be fun.” I had seen the world from 30,000 feet up, but this was completely different – we were in this ultra light aircraft, flying low over a vast mud flat. When it rained, the water would pick up dirt and silt. And when it dried it created really interesting patterns, things I wouldn’t have been able to see if we’d been flying even just a couple of thousand feet higher. It was an incredible experience and set me off on this path.What attracts me to aerial photography is that point, at a certain elevation, where the line between abstraction and reality blurs. I never show the horizon because it’s an obvious giveaway, a point of reference. I want to create an image that works on multiple levels and at multiple distances. Some aerial photography looks like it could be a landscape, or something that you’re seeing under a microscope. I want you to know this was taken from the air.Animals are a good focal point. They’re recognisable, although I’m often showing them from a point of view people aren’t familiar with. Here, it’s a bit like a layer cake, you have the flat earth, the birds flying above it, and you’re above it all. I like playing with the way the lens flattens this multi-level, three-dimensional space – the sense of scale, the textures, the distance.The fact that I’m moving through the same space as the birds is one part of the story that the image doesn’t tell,. But it is important for me. Everything is at play, the movement of the ocean, the implied movement of the birds.

They are joined on the list, which celebrates innovation in British architecture, by a new visitor centre for the Yorkshire Sculpture Park, an opera house inserted into a 17th-century stable block in Leicestershire and an exemplary development of low-energy council housing in Norwich.Energy efficiency rightfully looms large on this years’s list, following the recent launch of Architects Declare, a call to arms from a large group of previous Stirling prize winners for an urgent “paradigm shift” to ditch carbon-hungry practices. The Cork House in Berkshire, designed by Matthew Barnett Howland with Dido Milne and Oliver Wilton, offers one such alternative. Built from expanded cork blocks, made using waste from the cork stopper industry, the structure is carbon negative and will emit next to zero carbon over its life it is also designed for disassembly and reuse. The exposed cork walls and engineered timber create a cosy interior space that feels burrowed from the ground, lit from above by a row of funnel-shaped roof lights. It was described by RIBA judges as “a noble, momentous model to aspire to”, and its innovations could be scaled up.The house has a raw material beauty shared by the Weston, an earthy jewel of a visitor centre for the Yorkshire Sculpture Park, designed by the young practice Feilden Fowles. Presenting a rugged monolithic wall that looks as if it was sliced out of the soil, the defensive enclosure houses an expansive light-washed building, hosting a new gallery, restaurant and shop in a carefully judged sequence of spaces. A long, slightly inward-curving glass wall frames a stunning view of the park from the cafe, while the gallery is topped with board-marked concrete roof lights that plunge down from the ceiling. Once again, there is clever environmental innovation: temperature and humidity are regulated by a hidden labyrinth of 10,000 unfired bricks, avoiding the need for air conditioning while still allowing the gallery to display precious loans.The Weston’s quiet restrain is shared by the Nevill Holt Opera, a project that offers further proof of Witherford Watson Mann’s talent for inserting new things inside old shells, following their Stirling prize win for the transformation of the ruined Astley Castle into a Landmark Trust house in 2013. This time they have applied their meticulous skills to a former stable block in the grounds of Nevill Holt Hall near Market Harborough in Leicestershire, erecting an elegant 400-seat venue that preserves the rough-and-ready exterior quality of the space. A horseshoe-shaped balcony is raised on slender steel columns above a rugged concrete floor, while douglas fir panelling creates a sense of continuity between stage and seats. “The modesty, craftsmanship, care and attention that have been applied here are exceptional,” said the judges.A more high-octane kind of drama can be found further north, in the form of Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners’ billowing distillery and visitor experience for the Macallan whisky empire in Moray, on the northern coast of Scotland. The undisputed masters of exposed pipes have conjured a theatrical spectacle from the seething network of tubes, mash tuns, condensers and copper stills that go into making the amber liquor. With their usual hi-tech precision, the architects have transformed the prosaic production process into a series of set-piece stage sets with the glamour of scenes that Ken Adam might have dreamed up for James Bond or Dr Strangelove. It is all swept beneath a roof of grassy mounds that looks like the Teletubbies went hard on the scotch. It is an appropriately outre temple for a brand that produced the world’s most expensive bottle of whisky, which sold last year for £848,000.While RSH+P have made an elaborate spectacle out of the simple process of distilling grain, Grimshaw architects have succeeded in unravelling the fiendishly complex knot of London Bridge station into something remarkably clear and straightforward. By scooping out the underbelly of Victorian railway vaults, they have created an airy open concourse, where the tracks bridge the space overhead, allowing natural light to flood down in between them. It is a refreshingly legible space, with pairs of long escalators rising to the platforms, while a new arcade of concrete vaults leads through to the Underground station. From the outside it is less successful, resorting to a weird kind of flattened Victorian pastiche, topped with the practice’s trademark swoopy metal canopies, but with edges and junctions that don’t quite glide as gracefully as they should.In its 23-year history, the Stirling prize has never been awarded to social housing – in part, because there hasn’t been any to celebrate. But now, as local authorities across the country are busy building their own homes again for the first time in a generation, there couldn’t be a better time to recognise the value of thoughtful design for those that need it most, and the bravery of councils that are leading the way."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2f43bf89989ed97632e6668367e124dc6620dc15/354_2678_3390_2034/master/3390.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca4e359b53c71711d30eda7487d057c6","title":"goodbye alan moore the king of comics bows out","story":"The pioneer of serious superheroes – who is retiring – has transformed the genre over 40 years of rebellious inventionOne of the most significant fiction writers in English is retiring, to the greatest fanfare of his singular and titanically influential career. Alan Moore has promised that the (extremely late) final issue of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen will be his last comic, and his final contribution to an art form he utterly transformed, sometimes to his chagrin. His work in the 1980s on Miracleman, a deconstruction of the superhero myth, inspired so many imitators to darken formerly kid-friendly heroes that Moore has apologised more than once for it.This dystopian graphic novel continues to be relevant even 30 years after it ended. With its warnings against fascism, white supremacy and the horrors of a police state, V for Vendetta follows one woman and a revolutionary anarchist on a campaign to challenge and change the world.\u0026nbspMoore\u0027s quintessential Superman story. Though it has not aged as well as some of his work, this comic is still one of the best Man of Steel stories ever written, and one of the most memorable comics in DC\u0027s canon.This introspective, stream-of-consciousness comic follows a successful ad man who begins to have a midlife crisis after realising the moral failings of his life and work.A love letter to the silver age of comics that nods to Buck Rogers and other classics of pulp fiction. Tom Strong embodies all of the ideals Moore holds for what a superhero should be.One of Moore\u0027s best known comic series, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen is the ultimate in crossover works, drawing on characters from all across the literary world who are on a mission to save it.\u0026nbspMoore draws very rarely, instead he writes comics scripts, and at punishing length. Those can run to hundreds of pages, describing every layer of background and every tertiary character. The scripts themselves, occasionally enclosed in deluxe editions of his work, are as detailed as David Foster Wallace novels. Describing Batman’s home city to artist Brian Bolland in the script for The Killing Joke, Moore wrote: “The lower and seedier levels of Gotham are more inclined towards a territory somewhere between David Lynch and The Cabinet of Dr Caligari, all patches of rust and mould and hissing steam and damp, glistening alleyways. I imagine this strip as having an oppressively dark film noir feel to it, with a lot of unpleasantly tangible textures, such as you habitually render so delightfully, to give the whole thing a really intense feeling of palpable unease and craziness.” And Moore’s collaborators have always risen to his challenges, turning this overwriting into eye-popping set pieces.Before Moore, and the likes of Frank Miller, Dave Sim and the Hernandez brothers, the idea that serialised comics could amount to literature was laughable, and that adults could enjoy them without irony creepy. But Moore has had a preternatural grasp of the intricacies of a genre – superheroes – widely considered to be devoid of them.He asked troubling questions of superheroes, who had always appeared in stories that retroactively rewrote themselves and seemed to go on forever. Where was the end of these stories? Had we fully understood their beginnings? Was heroism even possible? The fates of silly costumed heroes became urgent in his hands: Krypto the Super-Dog, the shambling bog-monster Swamp Thing, a kid flying ace named Jetlad – each of these characters has moved me to tears.Moore can be tiresome – his digressions into the minutiae of Kabbalah in his Wonder Woman-style fantasy comic Promethea are insufferable – but he could also be delightful. Top 10, his affectionate send-up of cop shows, was a riot of sight gags, rendered by artists Gene Ha and Zander Cannon. Parody and melodrama keep close company in his work, especially in what is arguably his masterpiece: The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, created with the brilliant artist Kevin O’Neill. One character murders another with his magic penis at one point. It’s quite moving.This lurid streak can make Moore a tough sell. One Swamp Thing features an issue-length sex scene in which one participant is a plant yet the books’ central relationship hinges on the idea that Swamp Thing is the best man a woman could hope for, despite – or perhaps because of – his plant-ness.Moore as the saviour of superheroes is ironic in many ways. For one, his work suggests that they are at best feckless and at worst possibly fascis. For another, the process of working with DC Comics, which published his work during his two great fertile periods in the mid-80s and late 90s, so embittered him to the industry that he has often repudiated his own work on corporate superheroes, just as it acquired pop cultural success: video games, action figures, spin-offs. Recently asked about the real-world political influence of V for Vendetta, he was characteristically blunt: “From my position, if I have had one of my ideas stolen from me and turned into yet another cash-generator for some abhuman corporation, then if it has at least escaped into the wild sufficiently to be of some symbolic use to today’s protest movements, that makes me feel a lot better about having written it in the first place.”At the heart of this antipathy is DC’s hold on the legal rights to his co-creations Watchmen and V for Vendetta. Moore and Gibbons were promised that all rights would return to them when Watchmen went out of print, but it never did. Gibbons accidentally predicted what would happen in this arrangement back in 1986. “What would be horrendous, and DC could legally do it, would be to have Rorschach crossing over with Batman or something like that, but I’ve got enough faith in them that I don’t think they’d do that,” he told Neil Gaiman in a public interview preserved by the Comics Journal. Moore never got his rights back and DC has spent many years revisiting Watchmen with lucrative anniversary editions, prequels, a movie, the forthcoming TV series and indeed Watchmen II, called Doomsday Clock, a work in progress with script and art by a different creative team. This will merge the fictional world Gibbons and Moore created with the universe shared by Wonder Woman, Superman and Green Lantern. Moore’s efforts outside superheroics, such as From Hell, Lost Girls and A Small Killing, are often cited as proof of his literary worth. But his greatest contribution to English letters isn’t found in his additions to the growing canon of respectable graphic novels – a term Moore has said was invented to allow adults to “validate their continued love of Green Lantern or Spider-Man without appearing in some way emotionally subnormal”. It’s in his dazzling, quixotic overwriting, applied to trashy genre fiction with an ironic, but never cynical quality. This worked wonders on uncomplicated planet-tossers like Superman and Captain Marvel. And when he leaves behind the superhero hijinks, a lot of the fun leaves the writing along with them. Don’t get me wrong, the highbrow books are still brilliant they’re simply not as enjoyable as the pulpy stuff.Moore would be the first to tell you that seriousness isn’t always a virtue, but his was thoroughly transformative. And for many readers, myself among them, it was a great relief to be taken seriously as a reader of something supposedly sub-literate and stupid, to be treated with intelligence and care, and to be introduced to Moore’s rebellious brand of morality: his passionate feminism, his suspicion of authority and wealth, his love of normal people and veneration of togetherness, especially in the face of the hopelessness of the real world. His gifts for cruelty and horror inspired undistinguished competitors to enter the field, but his unexpected gentleness was what kept readers coming back to him."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/922db83363405cb92d382df4bf851f539d91dc13/0_91_1080_648/master/1080.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fbdd1dcce15935a1af2f395d9e14734c","title":"tips links and suggestions what are you reading this week","story":"Your space to discuss the books you are reading and what you think of them Welcome to this week’s blogpost. Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.Good news from Kemster, who is “thoroughly enjoying” Frank Herbert’s Dune:World-building and story telling of the highest order and not the “hard” sci-fi tome I was expecting at all. It does require a certain level of concentration but that is a small price to pay (if any at all) for such a good book.It’s a rare book that moves me deeply, but even rarer than makes me cry, I’m ancient and male. Jokha Alharthi’s Celestial Bodies did just that. If the idea of a book about three sisters in practically medieval Oman in the 1970s sounds oppressive, it’s the opposite. Think of it more like an Ursula le Guin novel set in a dusty planet, it is that remote. The people are instantly recognisable, as they pursue love within a country in transition, one where slavery still exists. There is also a possible murder within the tale, a subtle strand amongst many. Plus an ideal beach read!I recently read and loved Emilia Pine’s Notes to Self, gobbled down in one sitting on a flight from London to Marseille. It made me realise that I very rarely read non-fiction these days, but I used to enjoy essay collections.Meanwhile, greenmill has just finished The Spy And The Traitor by Ben McIntyre:… having bought it on impulse during an airport departure lounge wait. Ripped through it in no time and even though I knew in advance how it turned out, the true story which is a jaw-dropping mix of narrowly avoided Armageddon, double dealing, death defying escapes and almost comical incompetence (mostly by the KGB) kept me turning the pages. Not my usual thing but thoroughly enjoyed it.Where the Sun Shines Out by Kevin Catalano has engrossed and challenged writeronthestorm:I’ve almost finished Where the Sun Shines Out by Kevin Catalano - this is one of the bleakest fiction books I’ve read for quite some time. Yet, it is strangely engrossing. The story centres on what happens to people involved with, or connected to, the abduction of two young boys. The immediate aftermath and also the years upon years that follow. It’s a heartbreaking and deeply uncomfortable read not for the faint of heart. This is challenging stuff!This Body’s Not Big Enough for Both Of Us by Edgar Cantero provides some good niche reading, according to pubbore:It’s a comedy thriller starring a private investigator who is actually two siblings in the same body, each controlling one hemisphere of the brain. I’m not sure if Cantero carries off the conceit entirely convincingly, but if you like gleefully tasteless violence and funny one-liners I can recommend it.Finally, Swelter has some tasty provocations from QD Leavis’ Fiction and the Reading Public:I’m enjoying it immensely. Leavis is a militant and unapologetic champion of the “highbrow”: ‘Those novels which have some pretensions to literary merit and can be criticised by serious standards (it is common even in literary circles to fling the epithet ‘highbrow’ at it).’In order to demonstrate the universality of the belief that, in the 1920s and 1930s, the most popular literature is invariably the worst, she quotes Arnold Bennett (Evening Standard July 19th, 1928):‘Nearly all bookish people are snobs, and especially the more enlightened among them. They are apt to assume that if a writer has immense circulation, if he is enjoyed by plain persons, and if he can fill several theatres at once, he cannot possibly be worth reading and merits only indifference and disdain.’Elsewhere she accuses Bennett’s literary column of being one of the forces, along with book-of-the-month clubs, that perpetuate and codify “middlebrow” literature.Nearly all bookish people are snobs? What kind of know-nothing would write that?If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

They are talking about a much harder version which would cause much more disruption to our economy and the OBR is clear that in that less benign version of no deal the hit would be much greater, the impact would be much harder, the recession would be bigger. So I greatly fear the impact on our economy and our public finances of the kind of no-deal Brexit that is realistically being discussed now.”The OBR estimated that the recession – caused by the impact of increased uncertainty and falling confidence on investment and trade – would be as bad as that suffered in the 1990s but only a third as bad as the slump at the time of the financial crisis of the late 2000s.However, the OBR – established in 2010 to provide independent forecasts for growth and the public finances – said the outcome would be worse if a no-deal, no-transition Brexit also resulted in chaos at the border.The Office for Budget Responsibility is the government’s independent forecaster, which gives its verdict on the outlook for growth and the public finances twice a year.The forecasts are published to coincide with the chancellor’s two big set pieces of the year – the autumn budget and the spring statement – and takes into account the impact of any tax and spending measures announced in those statements.It was established in 2010 by the then chancellor George Osborne with the aim of improving the credibility of the government’s official forecasts for growth. The forecasts were previously produced by the Treasury itself and often criticised for being unrealistic.The OBR is led by three members of the budget responsibility committee, including chairman Robert Chote, a former director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, with support from the OBR’s permanent staff of 27 civil servants.“A more disruptive or disorderly scenario could hit the public finances much harder,” the OBR added.Speaking at a press conference to launch the report, the OBR chairman, Robert Chote, said: “The big picture is that heightened uncertainty and declining confidence deter investment, higher trade barriers with the EU weigh on domestic and foreign demand, while the pound and other asset prices fall sharply.“These factors combine to push the economy into recession.”Until now the OBR had been assuming there would be a smooth Brexit when coming up with its forecasts but it said the willingness of Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt to contemplate a no-deal departure meant it was stress-testing alternative scenarios.Chote also warned Johnson and Hunt that the spending pledges made during their campaigns to be prime minister came at a cost. He said the two contenders to replace Theresa May had made a series of uncosted proposals for tax cuts and spending increases that would be likely to raise government borrowing by tens of billions of pounds. “There is no war chest that would make them a free lunch,” he said.Nicky Morgan, the chair of the House of Commons Treasury committee, has written to the Treasury and the Bank of England asking for updated analysis of Brexit under different scenarios. “This will ensure that parliament is as informed as possible as it considers key decisions about the future of our country,” she said.John McDonnell, Labour’s shadow chancellor, said: “It’s obvious the Conservative party constitutes a clear and present danger to the economy and the wellbeing of everyone in the UK.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/10c311bb3e26eab86c94e02aa1dd8d6d52928a29/0_227_5410_3247/master/5410.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=67166374281320e0a5509d735969f102","title":"vanished neighbourhoods the areas lost to urban renewal","story":"Some of the world’s most fascinating neighbourhoods from Chicago to Shanghai have been razed by regeneration – and it’s not just the buildings that goThe wave of urban renewal that swept the world in the 20th century gave us inner-city highways, modernist downtown malls and high-rise housing projects. It destroyed countless fine-grained, human-scaled neighbourhoods.We lost more than just physical buildings. Each of these communities contained something less tangible – neighbourhoods like these are ecosystems. They incubate communities and cultures that do not and could not exist elsewhere.Sometimes, as in these 10 that follow, a neighbourhood lives in the memory of the displaced and their descendants, as powerful in death as in life.In 1914, the author Gustav Meyrink wrote a vivid depiction of 16th-century life in Prague’s Jewish quarter, Josefov. His novel Der Golem describes an oppressive labyrinth of ancient, looming houses in which “something malicious seemed to permeate the very bricks”.That was pretty close to the perspective of Prague’s city government at the end of the 19th century. By then, Josefov’s medieval streets had become a dense, erse hub of poor Czechs, immigrants and artisans whose trades had been devastated by factory manufacturing. City authorities, inspired by Georges-Eugène, Baron Haussmann’s recent “renovation” of Paris, saw it as a blight. In December 1896, the Finis Ghetto urban-renewal scheme kicked off with a literal bang, as 45 houses were destroyed by dynamite. With the exception of few religious sites, the entire neighbourhood was destroyed.The razing faced little opposition from Prague’s Jewish residents, many of whom returned after redevelopment – fuelling resentment among the displaced, and contributing to the antisemitic atmosphere that prevailed in the years before the first world war.A neighbourhood within a building, Mecca Flats was built for Chicago’s 1893 World’s Columbian Exposition and by 1910 was home to artists, musicians, white-collar workers and labourers, mostly black, many arrivals in the great migration. The building was one of America’s first luxury apartment houses, oriented around a central atrium that brought the street life of the neighbourhood indoors.By the great depression, it housed more than 1,000 people. The poet Gwendolyn Brooks worked in the building as a peddler in the 1930s, and immortalised it in her 1968 epic poem, In the Mecca, conceiving of it as a cross-section of black American life: “To touch every note in the life of this block-long block-wide building, would be to capsulize the gist of black humanity in general.”The Mecca was acquired by the Illinois Institute of Technology in 1941 tenants, activists and preservationists rallied to save it, but it was replaced with the school’s Crown Hall – a bright slice of modernism, designed in direct opposition to the perceived darkness and decrepitude of the Mecca.St John’s Ward was an aberration in uptight, homogenous 20th-century Toronto. A erse polyglot with a population density approaching that of contemporary central Hong Kong, it was a prototypical arrival city, with Irish, Italian, Jewish, African, Chinese and others establishing their first Canadian beachheads. A 1922 dispatch in the city’s Globe newspaper reported: “Chinese restaurants are filled with negro customers, many of them women, while here and there an occasional white girl can be seen partaking of a meal with either a brown or yellow skinned partner.” Sanitation and overcrowding were the ostensible targets of the reformers who sought to eradicate the Ward, but that nascent multiculturalism was probably as much a target.Redevelopment began in 1946 and continued for decades today, the district is an imposing institutional corridor separating the city’s downtown from the fine-grained neighbourhoods to the west – a few of which, especially Kensington Market and Chinatown, still bear traces of the old Ward.Born in Alabama, Coleman Young’s family moved to Detroit’s Black Bottom in 1923. The future mayor found himself at five years old amid a community of Jewish, Greek, Italian and Irish residents – and a burgeoning black population arriving, as his family did, from the south. (Boxers Joe Louis and Sugar Ray Robinson, both southerners by birth, lived a few doors from one another here in the 1930s.)Young was politicised as a teenager, listening to union workers talk leftist politics in a local barbershop. He found entertainment along the neighbourhood’s commercial spine, Hastings Street, where John Lee Hooker, Della Reese and others found their musical footing in small clubs.As with other renewal projects nationally, the funds to raze the community were in part provided by the federal Housing Act of 1949, which extended broad powers of expropriation to cities. By 1956 much of Hastings Street had been destroyed and replaced by the Chrysler Freeway. Bisected, what remained of the community quickly fell into decline.Late in life, Young would remember the neighbourhood as “a thrilling convergence of people, a wonderfully versatile and self-contained society”.Philip Payton Jr is sometimes referred to as the “father of Harlem” for his work buying properties in Upper Manhattan and renting them to black tenants. In 1905, he began to do the same on West 99th and 98th streets, purchasing several blocks of buildings between Central Park West and Amsterdam Avenue.A Harlem-in-miniature took root here, and half a decade later, it was a tight-knit community that included the composer Will Marion Cook, opera singer Abbie Mitchell, activist James Weldon Johnson, historian Arturo Schomburg and singer Billie Holiday. In 1951, empowered as Detroit was by 1949’s Housing Act, the city declared the district a slum and evicted residents. More than 500 buildings were demolished, replaced by a luxury housing project called Park West Village.The community became one of the lesser known victims of US slum clearance, though no less mourned by its former residents. “There’s a space in my life that’s missing right now because of that move,” former resident Jim Torain told a documentary film crew in 2008.In 1844, Los Angeles councilman and rancher Julian Chavez petitioned for 83 acres (33.5 hectares) of land in what was than a semi-rural district near today’s Echo Park. He got it, and over the following decades three neighbourhood, Palo Verde, La Loma and Bishop, developed in the verdant hills north of the city. The mostly Mexican-American residents practised subsistence agriculture and raised livestock, ran their own schools, and lived a semi-agrarian lifestyle – in the shadow of one of the nation’s ascendant boomtowns.By the 1940s, urban renewal made the community a target for redevelopment. Residents’ homes were expropriated, and while they were promised relocation to new public housing, those plans fell apart after Norris Poulson, who believed public housing to be a communist plot, won 1953’s Los Angeles mayoral race.A handful of stragglers waged the years-long Battle of Chavez Ravine against city authorities, but by 1959 the community was destroyed. In 1962, Dodger Stadium was erected on the site.Sophiatown was the Victorian-era brainchild of a real estate investor who in 1897 bought 237 acres of land near Johannesburg, laid out a few tidy streets, and named them after his children and wife. After the city located a sewage disposal plant nearby, his white homebuyers fled, and black residents found an opportunity denied them elsewhere: property ownership.By the 1950s, Sophiatown was the “Chicago of South Africa”, filled with shebeens (speakeasies), incubating musicians and artists. It was a focal point of activity for the African National Congress and a young Nelson Mandela, and a hub of anti-apartheid activism. In Sophiatown Speaks, the poet and former resident Don Mattera declared: “Sophiatown was the antithesis of what they wanted for this country. Sophiatown had the black people – meaning Coloured, Indians, Blacks of all tribes – and the whites living together.”In 1955, its residents were mostly relocated to the township of Soweto, out of the city. The community was bulldozed, reconstructed as a district of tidy bungalows, and renamed, in Afrikaans, Triomf, eventually reverting in 2006 to its original name.The de facto capital of Canada’s eastern provinces, Halifax is proof that urban renewal often exacted as great a toll on small cities as on large ones. In 1969, local planners were aiming to replicate the slum clearance policies of bigger metropolises, and devised a scheme to raze the city’s historic waterfront for an expressway to the suburbs.Protests halted the expressway, but not a massive downtown interchange that wiped out almost 15 blocks and 400 buildings in the city centre. It displaced thousands of mostly poor residents, and severed the city’s working-class North End from its downtown, exacerbating its decline. Many of the displaced were African-Nova Scotian, descendants of some of Canada’s oldest black communities. (The displacement came just a few years after the destruction of Africville, a historic black community at the city’s northern tip.)The interchange was considered a blight almost as soon as it was erected, and will soon be torn down itself, to be replaced by a mixed-use neighbourhood.In the 1950s, a group of itinerant puppeteers settled on the outskirts of Delhi, establishing this vital community of performers. Memorably described in Salman Rushdie’s Midnight’s Children, its thousands of small homes, called jhuggis, were crammed daily with magic shows, music, storytelling, puppetry and performance.But like similar communities, Kathputli lacked sanitation and other amenities by the 2000s, it was targeted by the Delhi Development Authority, which planned an “in-situ rehabilitation” programme. This involved moving residents to a “transit camp”, razing the neighbourhood, and developing a new high-rise district. Nearly 3,000 350-square-foot apartments were to house former residents, with the rest of the land given to market-rate development.Few residents willingly moved, arguing that the community’s survival depended – like Seoul’s Euljiro district – on the irreplaceable particulars of its built environment. The tension came to a head in October 2017 when demolition began, leaving residents fleeing their homes with little notice. Some residents remained, living in the ruins.A visitor to Shanghai in the late 19th century would have found the city dominated by narrow, winding lanes of shikumen, the local equivalent of Britain’s Victorian terraced workers’ housing, or Philadelphia’s miles of rowhouse neighbourhoods. Laoximen is among the most famous of these neighbourhoods, the product of an earlier population boom that saw the city swell with rural residents coming to the fast-growing city, a hub of regional trade.Today, as the city struggles to house its 26.3 million residents, many old neighbourhoods are being targeted. Part of Laoximen has been destroyed, and demolition is imminent for what remains. Shanghai has a better reputation for preservation than many Chinese cities, however, and a few buildings in Laoximen may be retained.“It still breaks your heart every time you see something like Laoximen,” Tina Kanagaratnam of advocacy group Historic Shanghai told the South China Morning Post last year. “You know this whole way of life is not going to continue. But every time we go somewhere else in China and come back, we think, ‘Oh thank God we live in Shanghai’, because there is so much more of this than there is anywhere else.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f3c18304db6b10ad7da03485de3d6e53bcd49ec7/0_176_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e556ebb263e30119f2575cfa52176e18","title":"disability benefit reforms tests pip","story":"Can you be lucky if you get something you deserve? I felt lucky last week as I read the letter informing me I’d been awarded personal independence payments (Pip). Like a couple of million other disabled people, for years I’d received Pip’s predecessor, disability living allowance, without any problems in order to pay for the extra costs of my disability – but it was recently reassessed in the name of “welfare reform”.It’s the oddest of things, “welfare reform”. You sit there, opposite a stranger, asked to detail the sort of intimacies you’d be reluctant to share with a lifelong friend. “Are there parts of your body you can’t reach to wash? Which ones?” “How do you put your bra on?” You wonder why exactly such lines of questioning are necessary, or how the tens of pages you filled out for hours beforehand weren’t enough, and then explain, as politely as you can, the extra painkillers it took in order to get dressed for this assessment this morning.The assessor tries – because she is polite and you are lucky she is kind – complimenting you on your nice home, even though you both know you’d like her to leave it as soon as possible. You also know that you are “lucky” that you were granted permission to be assessed at home you could just as easily have been forced to travel miles, exhausted, or sent in your wheelchair to a centre with steps and no ramp. You consider how exactly the employee of a private company is in a better place to judge your health needs than your own consultant who has provided evidence, and whether putting foundation on was a mistake in case you look “too well”.Throughout it all, there sits the elephant in the room: that this is all pointless. That by virtue of genetics, it is scientifically impossible that you have been cured since your last assessment. And yet you sit there, going through the motions, because non-disabled cabinet ministers told the rightwing media that people like you shouldn’t be “allowed to fester” on benefits.Pip is, of course, just one part of sweeping disability benefit “reform” in recent years, in which “reform” has become a euphemism for savage cuts. This week research by the Disability Benefits Consortium (DBC), a coalition of more than 80 UK disability organisations, showed changes to the social security system over the past 10 years have left disabled adults four times worse off financially than those without a disability. It has long been understood that disabled people have borne the brunt of austerity, but this is the first time a comprehensive study has laid it bare.The details of the report paint a picture of the government running a cruel game: the more health problems you have, the more you actually lose out – people with six or more disabilities are losing more than £2,100 each year on average, compared with someone with one disability, who loses £700 – while disabled children have been targeted too. Households with one disabled adult and one disabled child have had their support cut most, with average losses of more than £4,300 a year. This is a nation of distorted priorities, in which prospective prime ministers flex tax cuts for the healthy and wealthy, and the already poor and sick are pushed further into hardship.The DBC study details the way in which many disabled and chronically ill people put through “reforms” feel “highly stressed, distrusted, and constantly challenged”. One woman with multiple sclerosis told the researchers that she had had her Pip cut and was about to lose the Motability car she needed to get to work. The anguish brought on a severe MS relapse. She’s now lost all feeling in her left leg.I was “lucky”. Unlike some, I didn’t have to skip meals because my disability benefits had been removed. I wasn’t forced to go through a lengthy and exhausting appeal. I wasn’t, like the late Stephen Smith, forced to discharge myself from hospital in order to attend the tribunal to fight my case. But it is surely a sign of a broken system when disabled people relying on Britain’s safety net are grateful if it catches them without too much pain.In this way, “welfare reform” reinforces the narrative drilled into members of marginalised groups – that while for many the state is a vehicle to support them in times of need, for others it offers little more than abuse and disbelief.The DBC report offers conclusive proof of what disabled people have long known: benefit cuts are unjust, harmful, and widespread. Ministers may one day begin to care – if we are lucky.• Frances Ryan is a  columnist and author of Crippled: Austerity and the Demonization of Disabled People"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f4c904a31b9f12da1f912e71d1e0b34eb4161e8e/0_191_3004_1803/master/3004.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ecc23a0b20777459d32184c3defa60ee","title":"jeremy corbyn weak leadership labour poverty john mcdonnell","story":"With dexterity, decisiveness and a thwack of firm leadership, Jeremy Corbyn sacked Dianne Hayter last night as shadow Brexit minister. (She can’t be fired from her elected role as deputy leader of the Lords.) With just that same speed, he expelled Alastair Campbell from the Labour party in May, as a dead-cat distraction following Labour’s disastrous European election results.What had Hayter done? She had deployed a somewhat tired old political metaphor, “the bunker mentality”, comparing Corbyn’s inner circle to the paranoid denial of disastrous reality that defined Hitler’s last days. The same was said of Thatcher’s final hours in power, in denial over her poll tax calamity. It was said of Gordon Brown in his telephone-hurling phase, of Tony Blair’s secretive sofa government and of Harold Wilson’s kitchen cabinet. It’s never a good idea to use Hitler as a metaphor for anything else, but the claim by Corbyn’s spokesman that her words were “grossly insensitive to Jewish staff” would be laughable if it didn’t look like such a pathetic attempt to ert criticism from the party’s failure to deal with antisemitism, which Corbyn should have scotched more than a year ago.The incestuously tight little McCluskeyite group who run Corbyn’s office is responsible for fatally dilatory foot-dragging on this far-left Jew-baiting bile. Panorama’s evidence of their interference was dismissed out of hand, with no pause for reflection. This cabal is to blame for Labour’s catastrophic Brexit non-position. The only time the cabal acts fast is when their own position is personally threatened by critics: any new leader would dispense with their unhelpful services. Hayter may have taken the drop in revenge for the advert in yesterday’s  published by 64 Labour peers (whose number did not include Hayter), which attacked Corbyn over antisemitism.The result of these fatal errors on Brexit and antisemitism has been a flight of members: you find grieving ex-Labour people everywhere. But they make a great mistake in leaving, as their votes and voices will be needed to haul Labour back from this exceptionally weak leadership: they should rejoin.There it is, in a nutshell, the reason why people vote Labour. Anything that gets in the way of that objective, anything making Labour less electable, betrays that primal mission.With eloquence, he expounded why “social mobility” is the wrong target, rejecting the idea that “poverty is OK as long as some people are given the opportunity to climb out of it”. That punctures what I heard one Tory minister at a conference fringe meeting calling for: the need to “pick the diamonds from the rough”. Social mobility is what happens in more equal societies, as in Scandinavia: it’s a useless goal, just one measurement of a society’s social success or failure.His tough new poverty-abolition is no impossibility: it was strongly backed yesterday by Claire Ainsley, executive director of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. She said: “This significant ambition to eliminate in-work poverty is the right thing to do.”Is it possible? Setting the highest targets is the best way: Tony Blair astounded a room full of poverty researchers in 1999 when he pledged to end child poverty by 2020: at every budget that pledge forced the pace, adding to tax credits that eventually lifted a million children out of poverty. Would Labour have hit that target? Without doubt, had Labour been in power for the last decade, that progress would have continued, instead of going into screeching reverse. As with the BlairBrown child poverty target, McDonnell has chosen a target with cunning political calculation: just as poor children touch the hearts, so poverty among the “hard-working” arouses indignation, without the fear of the “moral hazard” of rewarding the feckless.Other aspects of Labour’s cleverly popular 2017 manifesto have rattled the government. Would Ofwat be delivering its severe punishment today to the greedy, profit-sucking water companies without Labour’s good commitment to take back the utilities? Yesterday Chris Grayling grovelled in front of the transport committee, promising to rescind Northern Rail’s franchise, amid more radical talk of franchising “reform”. Would student fees be up for cutting, without Labour’s pledge? Or would Nigel Farage’s Brexit party be pledging £200bn to regenerate desolate towns without Labour’s promise for an even larger regeneration bank for similar investment? Even without power, Labour still has an impact.But being in power is what really matters. If Labour arrives in office McDonnell will have to choose between competing spending needs: what comes first, the urgent need to raise benefits, or abolition of fees mainly benefiting better-off students? Socialism is the language of priorities.But first comes actually winning an election. The strong sense is that McDonnell, along with much of the shadow cabinet, is infuriated by everything that gets in the way of that. Imagine the despair of losing an election to Boris Johnson and facing another five years of social destruction. Day after day it gets clearer that Corbyn is the chief obstacle: weak, vacillating, glum and scoring the lowest ever poll ratings for an opposition leader as he fails to grasp the severity of Labour’s crisis over antisemitism and Brexit."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/67ca43af20277eb9999b252cf238f4176f05874d/341_133_3311_1988/master/3311.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e254eeb5601813a02cadec0a31aaa66d","title":"love island fast fashion sustainable new outfit bikini","story":"The ITV show is fast fashion’s biggest advocate, but the planet can’t take any more £1 bikinisLike millions of viewers, I’m hopelessly addicted to Love Island in a way I never thought I would be. But my biggest problem is not so much with the show per se, it’s with fast fashion.\u0027Fast fashion\u0027 is a phrase coined to describe inexpensive clothing produced rapidly by mass-market retailers in response to the latest trends. Critics say that the industry has a large carbon footprint,\u0026nbspand creates water and air pollution. Clothes are often manufactured in poor working conditions.Garments are manufactured cheaply, and are expected to have a short life. One in three young women, the biggest segment of consumers,\u0026nbspconsider garments worn once or twice to be\u0026nbspold. UK consumers sent 300,000 tonnes of textiles to be burned or dumped in landfill in 2018.Without rapid reform, the fashion industry - of which fast fashion is the dominant player – could be responsible for\u0026nbspa quarter of the Earth’s carbon budget by 2050.Through omnipresent product placements and advertising, Love Island has turned into fast fashion’s biggest advocate. Every day, girls in the villa wear a new outfit, promoting the insidious idea that you cannot be seen in the same clothes twice. You can even shop for what the islanders wear in real time through the show’s app or via its partner I Saw It First, encouraging impulsive purchases. When Britons are already expected to buy 50m single-use outfits this summer, the show only adds fuel to the fire, or rather to the truckload of clothes that ends up in the landfill every second.The problem is our planet cannot take more £1 bikinis. When clothes are so cheap, they are usually made out of materials derived from plastic, such as polyester or nylon. These materials can take hundreds of years to decompose in a landfill, and release thousands of microfibres during each wash, which end up in our oceans.To keep costs down, the fast fashion industry has also been known for manufacturing in some of the lowest-wage countries, where labour and safety standards are particularly poor. Despite pledges for better working conditions in supply chains following the Rana Plaza collapse in Bangladesh in 2013, this model remains prevalent today.Love Island has an incredible platform and the potential to influence millions of people. I wish the show used it to be a force for good, starting with fashion. The good news is there are a number of opportunities to get on the sustainable fashion path.Reducing our consumption of virgin fibres by reusing garments is essential to tackle the throwaway culture fast fashion promotes. More and more influencers are embracing the slow fashion movement, turning to what’s already in their wardrobe rather than buying new. If Emma Watson and Livia Firth proudly re-wear outfits on the most coveted red carpets, surely islanders could do the same in the villa.Far from the stigma it was once associated with, thrifting and upcycling are also becoming fashion statements. With the comeback of crafting, doing new with old is no longer seen as an odd thing to do. Wearing clothes that have had a previous life is an opportunity to look fashionable with one-of-a-kind pieces while reducing the need for new resources. Rather than a hundredth kissing challenge, what about harnessing the creative potential of our islanders behind a sewing machine?After taxis and hotels, the sharing economy is on its way to disrupt the fashion industry. New business models have arisen in the past 10 years making it possible to rent, borrow or swap clothes. Their success in the market shows that clothes do not need to be brand new to feel new to consumers. When new is the only option, alternatives to fast fashion do exist. A number of ethical and sustainable fashion brands have emerged, shedding a new light on the importance of better materials and fair working conditions in the supply chain. Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, has subtly turned into a sustainable fashion champion. It only takes one wear from her to make the sales of brands such as Veja or Reformation skyrocket. Could you imagine what would happen if Love Island did the same?It’s no secret that brand partnerships generate significant revenue for reality TV. But the climate crisis we are facing is very real too, and we know for a fact that fashion plays a key role in it. So now may be a good time for Love Island to embrace its corporate social responsibility, and rethink its partnership strategy in the light of the emergency."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb7563f4ce81535c726a2f3fa54ceeb39ed39306/1768_0_2072_1244/master/2072.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=64d187e240f77ad582e161f95b2f5886","title":"the guardian view on ebola in the drc help needed and dialogue too","story":"Are we able to learn the right lessons when disaster strikes? Five years ago, a devastating outbreak of Ebola in west Africa claimed more than 11,000 lives, and sparked an international panic as it reached the US and Europe. The experience led to the vaccine and experimental treatments now being used in the Democratic Republic of Congo. But this outbreak has become the second most deadly despite efforts to combat it over the last year. More than 1,600 people in the north-east of the country have died. Now, with the virus flaring up again in places where it had been contained, reaching the major city of Goma on the border with Rwanda, and spreading over 500km, with cases identified in Uganda, the World Health Organization has declared it an emergency of international concern.This is a very different challenge from 2014’s. It is not only a public health but a humanitarian crisis, taking place in a conflict zone, with widespread malnutrition, a struggling health system, and deep suspicion hampering efforts to control the disease: this year has seen 174 attacks on health workers fighting the outbreak. The fear and distrust of outsiders has been compounded by Ebola’s high fatality rates. Vaccines cannot protect those who have already contracted the disease, and though people are more likely to survive with proper treatment, many delay because they do not trust those offering help: by the time they are finally seen, it is far harder to help them. Those around them may wrongly conclude that vaccines or health workers are the problem and not the cure. They see more international groups at work, and more deaths.The need for community understanding and engagement – made clear by the 2014 outbreak – is more critical than ever. That means dialogue, not instruction: “We need to listen with the ferocity with which we want to be heard,” says an emergency coordinator for Médecins Sans Frontières. With their most basic health needs unmet, a rapidly spreading measles outbreak, and ongoing problems with cholera, people may not see Ebola as a priority, particularly if their other concerns are not even acknowledged. Some experts believe that community leaders and local staff must take the lead in the response, and that supporting home care as an interim, if far from ideal, measure may be necessary.But if solutions must be implemented on the ground, they require proper support. WHO hopes that the designation of an emergency will push governments to respond. Its director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has warned that hundreds of millions of dollars are needed to fight this outbreak only half of the money pledged has been delivered. Jim Yong Kim, when president of the World Bank, said the west African outbreak could have been snuffed out in months with sufficient funding. But help only trickled in when western countries began to worry about the potential danger to their own citizens.The risk is that neighbours may close their borders – crippling the economy, increasing hostility and suspicion, and driving transmission chains further underground as people take unmonitored routes or mask their symptoms at crossings. In 2014, WHO’s advice against travel restrictions was ignored by governments and airlines. As the WHO chief said, the decision to call this an emergency should not be used to stigmatise or penalise the very people who most need help. The humanitarian case for backing the fight against Ebola is simple and undeniable. Mothers, fathers, siblings and children are dying, in communities that have already suffered so much. If that is not enough to compel greater action, perhaps self-interest will help. One lesson from the 2014 outbreak was that real international commitment can bring the disease under control. Another was that without such efforts it poses a far broader risk."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9ea86c9989077ec1ffcec8501e143d56e06a2ac/0_164_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f4caa6eb279d044b4e26e20b9bffd677","title":"iucn red list reveals wildlife destruction from treetop to ocean floor","story":"Latest list shows extinction now threatens a third of all assessed species, from monkeys to rhino raysFrom the tops of trees to the depths of the oceans, humanity’s destruction of wildlife is continuing to drive many species towards extinction, with the latest “red list” showing that a third of all species assessed are under threat.The razing of habitats and hunting for bushmeat has now driven seven primates into decline, while overfishing has pushed two families of extraordinary rays to the brink. Pollution, dams and over-abstraction of freshwater are responsible for serious declines in river wildlife from Mexico to Japan, while illegal logging is ravaging Madagascar’s rosewoods, and disease is decimating the American elm.The red list, produced by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), is the most authoritative assessment of the status of species. The list published on Thursday adds almost 9,000 new species, bringing the total to 105,732, though this is a fraction of the millions of species thought to live on Earth. Not a single species was recorded as having improved in status.“Nature is declining at rates unprecedented in human history,” said Jane Smart, director of the IUCN bioersity conservation group. She said decisive action was needed to halt the decline, with next year’s UN bioersity convention summit in China seen as crucial.The red list highlights the plight of wedgefishes and giant guitarfishes, known as rhino rays because of their elongated snouts. They are now the most imperilled marine fish families in the world, with all but one of the 16 species critically endangered – meaning they are one step from extinction. Intensified and unregulated fishing is to blame, with the rays usually snared as bycatch.Among the seven primate species pushed closer to extinction, six are in west Africa where deforestation and bushmeat hunting is rife. There are now just 2,000 Roloway monkeys left in Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana, meaning their population is precariously small. Their relatively large body size and the value of their meat and skin have made them a preferred target for hunters.Humanity’s thirst for fresh water, particularly for farming, is having an especially big impact on river and lake wildlife. The red list update reveals that more than half of the freshwater fish in Japan and over a third in Mexico are now threatened with extinction. Recent research found two-thirds of the world’s great rivers no longer flow freely.“The loss of these freshwater fish species would deprive billions of people of a critical source of food and income, and could have knock-on effects on entire ecosystems,” said William Darwall, head of the IUCN freshwater bioersity unit.The red list update also added 500 deep-sea bony fish species, such as bioluminescent lanternfishes, which face potential threats from deep-fishing, oil and gas drilling and seabed mining. The scaly-foot snail is the first mollusc that lives on deep-sea hydrothermal vents to be added to the list and is assessed as endangered.“Invasive diseases, together with air pollution and climate change, have decimated populations of numerous North American tree species that once provided abundant food for native wildlife, as well scenic beauty,” said Healy Hamilton, at NatureServe, a network of bioersity scientists.Fungi are a growing feature of the list, with the update revealing that at least 15 species that grow in the traditional countryside of many European countries are now threatened with extinction. The bright red splendid waxcap, found in the UK and Germany, is one which has suffered as semi-natural grasslands have been converted to intensive agriculture.“Loss of species and climate change are the two great challenges facing humanity this century,” said Lee Hannah at Conservation International. The red list addresses both, he said, by including the threat of global heating in the assessment of extinction risk. “The results are clear, we must act now on both.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d011b9ba4b7dcd235cf95b4a48e98fb1272157de/0_88_1300_780/master/1300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=30c23d29cf5ead749878286378b79b80","title":"the impact is tremendous readers on wildflower verges","story":"Readers share how wildflowers are bringing colour and life to previously sterile green spacesCatastrophic news for insect life has inspired communities and councils around the UK to take action, generating splashes of summer colour which hope to have a lasting impact.After reporting a campaign by the conservation charity Plantlife to encourage the growth and planting of flowers on UK roadside verges, we asked you to share stories from where you are.Below, readers share some of their local successes, including thoughts about how leaving nature to run its course by standing back rather than taking action can help – and explain how they have been getting involved in community projects big and small.“Hengrove Way is a 1960s dual carriageway in the south of Bristol. The wide central verge was originally reserved for a tram system but was planted a few years ago with an avenue of purple beech trees. The meadow here is sown annually by the Bristol city council parks. Budgets are tight and so they try and make a little spread a long way – in this case there are over 300 metres of flowers: as a resident they give me much enjoyment.” Richard, Bristol“Three neighbouring families with five children grouped together to care for three unloved grass verges adjacent to our homes in Flackwell Heath, Buckinghamshire. We planted yellow rattle to compete with the grass annuals to provide colour in year one, and perennials from year two onwards. We lovingly named our patch Flack Wild Heath.“I was mowing the verges myself each week anyway, and over a beer with our neighbours, we decided we should give it a go. We’ve had lots of interest and look forward to new friends in the village extending the Heath from next year. More of us should do the same it’s easy to sit back and wait for the council or someone else. Actually though, there’s way more pleasure in seeing our own patch develop. Very rewarding. In fact, it’s ace arriving home each day to see what’s popped up.” Marcus Firmin, Buckinghamshire“I planted this wildflower bank earlier this year on the edge of a path which overlooks a meadow outside my home. The idea is to develop areas that give colour to the meadow as well as attracting different types of wildlife, while trying just to manage small areas and keeping things as natural as possible.” David Warr, Jersey“It seems that council cuts have resulted in random scalping of verges and open spaces, with what appears to be no real plan, but they seem happy when community groups such as ours, with some skill, take on their sites. We’re sure we can save them money, improve the environment, spread beauty and pollen – there are so many advantages there seems no reason not to!” Diana Cusack, Totnes“Taken this week whilst on my way into the town centre. One of many small urban spaces that have been planted by the local council.” James, Newport“As a gardener, I know the work involved in preparing and maintaining verges. As long as vehicle sight lines are maintained where necessary, I feel this verge on the Kegworth bypass is a superb example of how the natural environment is so much more attractive than the sterile, known alternative. I am a gardener at a nearby university where the campus has initiated a bioersity scheme to encourage wildlife within its grounds. A number of areas are being left unmown poorer ground is being seeded with suitable wildflower mixes. The study will try to identify any change in the number of plants animals and insects within campus.” Dave Bicker, Loughborough“This verge on both sides of a wide dual carriageway and on the central reservation was planted by nature. Each year, Surrey county council mows it all flat when the flowers are in bloom, citing safety, although the extent is clearly excessive by common sense standards. This deprives stressed motorists of an uplifting and soothing experience on their journey, as well as disrupting or terminating the lives of countless amphibians, reptiles and invertebrates. Planting verges is good: but don’t forget nature did it first, and all we have to do is respect and wonder.” Jenny Desoutter, Dorking“These are not planted – they’re wild native plants! I monitor two of our local verges for the Yorkshire Dales national park’s Orton Special Verges project: we don’t plant verges and do not think we need to do it.“We need to educate people about what we already have as our native flora. It’s better to conserve the flora that will naturally grow in meadows and verges, for example by not mowing too soon (apart from a safety strip if needed for visibility). Late mowing, to let grassland plants set seed, and taking off the mowings to keep fertility low will allow native plants to regenerate as well as being cheaper for the councils than year round mowing or trying to seed verges with plants that want arable conditions.” Sue Millard, Cumbria“Burleys, Lewes district council and Wildflower Lewes have been planting up verges across Lewes District for three years. There are several different types of meadows, those that are more bioersity rich – which are perennial wildflowers – are sown once and then left to get on with it, year on year. The other meadows are the annual wildflower seeds chosen for our pollinators – these are much prettier and have to be sown yearly. These mini-meadows are scattered across roadside verges, recreation fields, housing estates and cemeteries. This year all the meadows were teeming with butterflies, bees, grasshopper and crickets. It’s amazing just how many insects benefit from such small areas.“We want to improve the bioersity of our district, educate and inspire others to do the same and hopefully they will get closer to nature by visiting more green spaces. We plant chalk-loving plug plants in some areas to create mini-downland areas in the hope that residents will get out more, reducing social isolation and improving health and wellbeing. We receive many compliments about how the wildflower verges have make them happy on their way to work and school – the wider impact a small patch of ground can have on people is tremendous and shouldn’t be underestimated.” Karen Rigby-Faux, Lewes"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a3b58b41417920fcd5a10b938111cda5d3083ffb/0_30_3824_2294/master/3824.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b20e79393a8bc38c36858b3cd8643089","title":"foundation set up by alexander sokurov to close after claims of government hostility","story":"The director of Russian Ark has accused Russia’s culture ministry of “unfriendliness and aggressiveness” Russian film director Alexander Sokurov has shut down his film foundation citing hostility from Russia’s ministry of culture.In comments reported by Russian news agency Interfax (via the Hollywood Reporter), Sokurov said the ministry’s “unfriendliness and aggressiveness” was behind his decision to close Primer Inotnatsii (Example of Intonation).Police previously opened an investigation into Primer Inotnatsii in December 2018 after allegations of embezzlement the probe ended with a police statement that “no wrongdoing was discovered”.

Which is fundamentally unfair, since knowing what is what on an open flame that you use twice a year is far more technically demanding than using an oven. Maybe you don’t care about credit. But if you do, here are a few suggestions.Try interesting cuts of meat. Classic barbecue fare tends towards the banal (chicken breasts) or at best workaday (the sausage). What you want is meat round a complicated bone, to give it some structure and slow-release flavour against the suddenness of the heat, and what you get is a load of steaks that have very few defences. I would never barbecue steaks again, having discovered that you can cook them in an air fryer, which locks in flavour without leeching out moisture. The best barbie cut, meanwhile, flash-fried, perfect unadorned, is the Barnsley chop. The nubbly central bone that gives it that butterfly shape makes it unusually juicy, while the fat turns to lamb crackling, which you almost never see in domestic life.Better still, try an unusual meat. In an unassuming yet peerless book, My Bombay Kitchen, Niloufer Ichaporia King has a recipe for shoulder of kid, in which you poach it first, marinate it for two hours in a marsala mix that includes chilli, cumin, hoisin, ginger and garlic, then stick it on coals for a quarter of an hour until it has a reddish crust that could charm a hyena out of a rage. You can use the poaching liquor for some rice on the side, and if anybody doesn’t congratulate you on this, it will be because they’re vegetarian and they hate you for it.Arguably, a sweet-fleshed piece of fish is even more of a showstopper, since it has a curious alchemy with the charcoal that underlines rather than obliterates its delicacy. It is fragile, though: unless it’s mackerel, big clumps can go through the bars, and the better it tastes, the more you resent the waste. Plus it is expensive: at the weekend I was so resistant to barbecuing a turbot – it was 24 quid it would have been like feeding pound coins into a grabber at the arcade – that Mr Z made it a cage out of coat hangers. You can only do one side this way you have to put a lid on the barbecue and let the other side cook by convection. Also, do not make the mistake of thinking the handles won’t be red hot, even when they are not red. Otherwise, it is a brilliant fish fix, and also works for a skate wing.Or else, cook regular meat in an unusual fashion. Get a can of cider, open it, put it on the grill. Get a chicken – you’ll need to poach it for 20 minutes beforehand if you don’t like to live life on the wild side – and wedge it, by its butt cavity, over the can. This works best on a barbecue that is already cooling a little, because the chicken will be here a while. Put the lid down cook for 40 minutes. Basically what happens is that the can heats up insanely and cooks the bird from the inside, while the outside cooks on the grill. The cider evaporates into the meat and keeps it moist (you can try it with lager, too), and the whole thing looks quite tickling, like a tiny gangster being taught a lesson.Mr Z does a few things for vegetarians, including chalcots, a cross between a spring onion and a leek, which you char, then wrap in newspaper. The scorched outer skin slips effortlessly off, leaving them beautifully silky inside. And deconstructed ratatouille: grill aubergine, courgette, tomato and garlic chop or mash them as they come off, then season very liberally in the bowl, as if you are making the French classic backwards, and much faster. If I’m honest, if someone asked what you were eating, you wouldn’t immediately say “ratatouille”. But you would say: “This is an innovative and delightful gesture towards the typically uncatered-to vegetarian in these circumstances.”If you think people praising you doesn’t actually matter alfresco then, of course, don’t bother with any of this and go ahead with your burgers. But I sometimes think the reason everyone eats so much off a grill is that you don’t savour things unless you can taste the effort. What I want from food is the taking of infinite pains."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/918b4870072044b3ab29e4a17f5150f09d34819a/1_0_3023_1814/master/3023.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=982d92453b8ab5ae41e64b1298a5a06a","title":"africa cup of nations algeria senegal football","story":"Champigny-sur-Marne is a banlieue about eight miles south-east of the centre of Paris. Algeria’s coach, Djamel Belmadi, was born there Senegal’s coach, Aliou Cissé, moved there from Ziguinchor at the age of nine (Cissé is one day older). Since then they have performed an awkward dance, always threatening to meet and very rarely doing so.They played against each other at youth level. They came head-to-head in a league game between Marseille and Paris Saint-Germain in February 2001, and then with their national teams two months later. Belmadi was at Southampton when Cissé was at Portsmouth but they never played against each other in England. And on Friday, on the greatest stage either has yet trod, their sides will meet in the final of the Africa Cup of Nations.Such are the complexities of nationality, though, that this is also the first time since 1998, and only the sixth time in the tournament’s history, that both finalists will be managed by a “home” coach. Both Cissé and Belmadi are in charge of squads made up of players whose experiences have been similar, who understand the life of a footballer who plays his club football in one country but plays international football often on another continent. There is no guarantee there will be another Cissé or Belmadi ready to replace them, but equally their achievements, and the fact that, with varying degrees of success, Ivory Coast, Ghana and DR Congo have eschewed the familiar list of itinerant Europeans (in total 14 of the 24 nations in Egypt were managed by foreigners) feels as if it is a step in the right direction.Algeria beat Senegal 1-0 in the group stage and, as the Nigeria manager, Gernot Rohr, acknowledged, they have been the most impressive side in the tournament. Given they finished bottom of their qualifying group for the 2018 World Cup, well-beaten by a Nigeria side they beat in the semi-final, that represents a remarkable improvement.For the Nottingham Forest midfielder Adlène Guédioura, the development is primarily attributable to Belmadi, who took over last August. “He really knows the players and really knows what he wants, and the good thing as well is he knows how to pass that on to the players,” he said. “It’s important because if you don’t have a good cook you won’t have a good meal.”Rohr has spoken enthusiastically of the tactical progress made by les Fennecs.Algeria in recent years had developed a reputation for attractive football undermined by indiscipline, a lack of steel, and, at times, the absence of a tactical plan. “We used to have good iniduals but now we feel very strong as a team,” Guédioura said. His inclusion in the side after almost two years in the wilderness is one of Belmadi’s triumphs as he has revelled in a conservative role protecting the back four.“He was really unfairly criticised – irrationally,” Belmadi said. “I insisted he’s at the press conference today, because I wanted to credit him in front of everyone. We spoke like men before the Cup of Nations. I would even say he’s undroppable now.”In their way stand a Senegal side who are undeniably talented, but talented in one particular area: pace out wide. That was a problem for them in the quarter-final two years ago, when Cameroon sat deep, denied them space, frustrated them and eventually won on penalties, and it is likely to be a problem on Friday given how efficiently Algeria closed down the space available to Nigeria’s wingers in the semi-final.Sadio Mané will operate on one flank but through the tournament Cissé has not settled on who plays on the other wing: it could be Keita Baldé, it could be Ismaïla Sarr, it could be Krépin Diatta. Or he may do what he did at times in qualifying, seek to sidestep whatever plans Belmadi has put in place for his wide men and abandon the 4-3-3 for a more direct 4-4-2.A bigger issue than who plays wide, though, is what Cissé does at the heart of his defence. Already without Salif Sané who was injured in Senegal’s first game, he must now also find cover for the Napoli centre-back Kalidou Koulibaly who is suspended after collecting an extremely harsh yellow card in the semi-final, after he failed to get his arm out of the way of a shot in conceding the penalty Tunisia missed. The centre-forward Baghdad Bounedjah, another surprise Belmadi selection who has thrived at this tournament, has just the sort of streetwise awkwardness to take advantage of a makeshift back four.Belmadi and Cissé feel like part of a new generation of coaches, African with significant European experience, who represent the future. Both have had a significant impact on their sides, sufficient that this feels like a battle between them more than it does between, say, Sadio Mané and Riyad Mahrez, or Guédioura and Idrissa Gueye.History looms for both sides – Senegal have never won the Cup of Nations Algeria have not won it for 29 years Champigny will win either way."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd7b3a9b87f080dbff1a147c534c7b557bd55ce0/245_270_4683_2811/master/4683.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a84dcb2d0ebb74da7120f09456b8ca47","title":"steve bruce prove doubters wrong newcastle","story":"Steve Bruce has vowed to win over the doubters at Newcastle after admitting he has always regretted turning down the manager’s job the first time he was offered it.The 58-year-old was installed as Rafael Benítez’s replacement on Wednesday as angry fans vented their displeasure at owner Mike Ashley’s running of the club.Bruce never played for the club he supported as a boy and said the chance to take charge was one he could not refuse a second time.Speaking to the club’s in-house TV channel in Shanghai, where he will oversee his first game against West Ham in the Premier League Asia Trophy on Saturday, he said: “I’m like every other Geordie, I’ve lived the dream. If you can’t play for them, then of course if you’re a Geordie, what better thing than to take the number one seat?

To be given the opportunity again, it was simply something I had to take, I had to grasp it.“I knew it was going to be difficult – as I said, the easy thing would have been to say no. I just hope that people will show the respect, which obviously you only gain by getting a few results and doing the job, but hopefully that will go hand in hand.”The club are understood to be in advanced talks with Hoffenheim over signing the 22-year-old Brazilian striker Joelinton."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f3ff73086336535c6e036d8780decd843614aef/0_104_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9cc60e031e387a32b228d3ec75ca6309","title":"we just clicked why i set out to find a new group of friends online","story":"Can a friendship app, a digital neighbourhood noticeboard or Facebook really help me discover a new bestie?This year started with a bang. It burst into life with fireworks and kisses, and then came the sound of a spoon tapping on a wine glass. “Since we’re all together,” said my friend, “I wanted to say it’s been an honour knowing you while I’ve been in London.”Another leaving speech. I have heard many over the past few years, watching loved ones leave in search of job opportunities or housing security, or as a cure for homesickness. Later, as I lay in bed, I thought about my rate of friend attrition. How long until I found myself totally alone? Five years? Ten? My new year resolution was a no-brainer: I must try to make new friends.To help me on my journey, I contact Kate Leaver, author of The Friendship Cure, a book exploring modern friendship. She was inspired to write it by an article in the Atlantic, in which journalist Julie Beck argued that we shed friendships as we age because our spouses (to whom we are legally bound) and our family (to whom we are biologically bound) fill our worlds. When that happens, friendships are the first to go. “That article essentially frightened me into a year-long research binge so I could make the case for reviving our interest and our investment in friendship,” says Leaver.She says we have “organised our modern lives so that we’re more isolated than we think we are”. Social media makes us believe we are surrounded by people, and we may mistake likes and comments for intimacy. Offline, meanwhile, we have been brought up to believe it is unacceptable to speak to strangers, even as traditional public spaces – libraries, sports centres – are being closed down. In the few spaces that remain, she says: “We’re left with all these grown adults not knowing how to make new friends or get close to people.”This rings painfully true. I go to the gym two or three times a week, yet my visits are silent. I don’t enjoy the gym I do it so I don’t drop dead in 30 years. I pass through, barely making eye contact, let alone exchanging words. Can the internet help me make friends there? I decide to follow my gym on Instagram, commenting on its posts alongside other members. Mostly, these are health fanatics and their comments are just fire emojis (a symbol that means exciting or excellent) – so I’m not sure how I could build intimacy. I try to get involved anyway, heaping praise and asking questions. Later, at the gym, I approach another user, a man who looks as if he is in his late 20s, and ask if he was the person I saw on Instagram winning a fitness challenge. He was. We swap names and talk about where we live. If we have lots in common, it is not immediately apparent. Perhaps it is our millennial inability to carry on a conversation, or perhaps we are both tired after exercise, but the chat dwindles. We don’t speak when our paths cross again, but I do get a wave now and then.I also download a friend-making app – Bumble BFF. I am already using Bumble for dating and it is easy enough to toggle between the friends and romance platforms. I even use the same bio: “lefty journalist from London, climbing the ladder of success wrong by wrong”. I think it is charming, but other women do not. My rate of matches in the friend setting is significantly lower than in the romance section. I initiate a conversation with every match I receive, but notice that potential friendships are not tended with the same energy as possible romances. Perhaps Beck is right – in the choice between love and friendship, pals always lose.The swipe functionality of Bumble BFF also makes me uncomfortable. Like the romance portion, you swipe right to say you like the profile, left to say you don’t. And you can make this decision based on one picture, rather than needing to take in the whole profile before you give your verdict. You cannot move on to another profile until you have cast your judgment, so you are primed to decide within seconds in order to sate your curiousity about who is next. Inevitably, I find myself judging other women based on their looks – on what I think their clothes communicate about their personality, or what the set up of their shots says about their interests – and no doubt I am being judged similarly. It hurts to be reduced to this, and more so than it does when it is by the opposite sex.Using an app for friendship rather than romance also drives home how chatting online with strangers is not a patch on talking face to face, when communication comes through many mediums – tone, body language, expression – all processed in an instant. Even a few words tell you so much. Perhaps we put up with it in our love lives because the “prize” of romance is put on such a high pedestal. Using the same tools to search for a friend reveals how truly blunt they are. I struggle to create any intimacy, or puncture the polite veneer of the chat box (“How are you today?” “I am fine. How are you?”). It makes sense: I am ultimately a stranger, no matter how many laughs we share, or how much we agree on Brexit. We all keep our guard up for strangers. They could be anyone, and so could I. Each conversation is taking a punt. And we may be more likely to do it for love than friendship.In the end, I manage to have proper conversations with a couple of women. They seem very nice, but live a bit too far away to meet. I lose momentum and feel frustrated with the app. I say my goodbyes and delete it.However, there is another number that Dunbar says is important to friendships: 30. One of the biggest barriers to meaningful friendships is distance, with 30 minutes being the longest time we would spend travelling to meet up. “It doesn’t matter whether it’s on foot, by bicycle or car, 30 minutes’ travel time is the tipping point. It is not our observation, but something that sociologists have commented on.”With this in mind, I prioritise making friends near home. I download a community app, Nextdoor, which is regularly listed as one of the best apps through which to make friends. It effectively acts as a digital noticeboard for your local area, including adverts for evening classes and book clubs, which both seem like prime buddy-making opportunities. But nobody is idly chatting on Nextdoor. It is not obvious how you can build online relationships when replying to posts about parking permits or moths giving people a rash. However, on another community website, the hyper-local Harringay Online, I notice a post from my neighbour – to whom I have never spoken, despite living next to her for several years. When I see her in the local pub, I strike up a conversation about her post. Success! We get on. We have a drink and become Facebook friends.It may seem daft to view nurturing an acquaintanceship with someone who lives next to you as an accomplishment. But it has forced me to challenge my own strict belief that people – above anything else, even above my desire to chat – have a right to be left alone. It simply feels rude to “bother” people I need a suitable reason. Even using an app such as Bumble BFF, which is designed to introduce people, does not help. After all, just because someone uses the same app as me does not mean they want to speak to me.However, research suggests we have a warped impression of other people’s reluctance to talk to us. The average person consistently underestimates how much a stranger has enjoyed speaking to them. This has been termed “the liking gap”, although, it is worth noting that it applies to real-life interactions, not digital ones.Still, I wonder if my existing social media connections may be the most fruitful source of friends. They have already expressed an interest in me as an inidual, and I should have some sense of them as people and be confident that we have something in common. Indeed, I met one of my closest friends on my favourite platform, Twitter.I return to the chasm of hyperbole and scroll through the lists of people I follow and who follow me, looking out for those I regularly engage with. I send direct messages to a few. Every single person replies. Shared interests spring up easily and conversation comes naturally, as does an offer to catch up in person.I also take to Facebook searching for something similar, but as I barely use the platform, it instead acts as a time capsule for a past version of me. I joined Facebook in 2006 and used it actively (pointless statuses, pokes, and all), but from 2011 my interaction with it slowed. Now I check in periodically, but barely engage. With a large proportion of Facebook friends being people I met more than 10 years ago, I am not sure I still have anything in common with many of them. But perhaps Facebook’s supposed aim – to keep us connected with people we might otherwise lose contact with – will come in handy. Jeffrey Hall, a researcher from the University of Kansas, found that you need 80-100 hours to become friends with someone, or 200 hours to become close friends. But what if you have already racked up those hours? This is why one of the easiest ways to make friends is to reconnect with old ones. And there are plenty of old friends on Facebook.I contact Paul, my BFF from sixth-form college. He went to a different university and, although we tried to stay in touch, our paths erged over time. We chat briefly online, opting to meet for dinner right away. The dinner is like old times and there is no distance between us even though so much has changed. We discuss our respective new partners and what happened to the old ones, our new jobs and where we hope to go, as well as our old hobbies, which remain the same (writing and film-watching). The shared sense of humour and curiosity about the world makes for a joyful meal. We arrange to meet again, and remain in touch.In some ways, it is comforting to assume we lose touch with people because we grow apart. The alternative is that our own idleness or inattention slowly separates us from those we once connected with. Perhaps friendships are more elusive than we think, and so delicate they will die unless actively nurtured. The internet is not a silver bullet for loneliness – indeed, it may distort our natural behaviour and our understanding of what friendship is. But it can at least signpost where meaningful meetings may happen, and it can keep you in the loop of existing relationships.Leaver tells me about the twentysomethings she interviewed for her book. “One of them said she felt like the TV show Friends had lied to her because she grew up expecting to get this neat group of friends. I think loneliness in young people is partly explained by the gap between their expectations and the reality.”As for me, my search for new friends brings me back to old friends, to friendly faces I see each day and those I already know, but have not given enough attention to. I count up all the messages I regularly forget to reply to, and the old work colleagues I adored, but lost touch with. And I send an overdue text using three, magic words: “Fancy a catchup?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/50407bad9513c7f2c1a0846ab2858617f08592da/0_374_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d40cb837ff856a35f1e397d16b3aa965","title":"let down by natwest new cheque scanning system","story":"Reader who runs small business is out of pocket because of NatWest’s software updateI run a small manufacturing business in Devon.

They began life as a minor psychedelic alt-rock band with seemingly zero mainstream commercial potential beyond hand-to-mouth survival, on the same US post-punk gig circuit that supported umpteen bands with zero mainstream commercial potential in the mid-80s. When they were signed to a major label in 1991, it looked like one of the grandest acts of folly yet in the crazed search to find the next Nirvana: their debut release under their new deal was an EP called Yeah I Know It’s a Drag, But Wastin’ Pigs Is Still Radical. Like a number of bands signed in the post-grunge goldrush, they had a minor novelty hit – 1994’s She Don’t Use Jelly – and that appeared to be that.And then the damnedest thing happened: the Flaming Lips released the extraordinary 1999 album The Soft Bulletin, developed an equally extraordinary live show and became something like a mainstream success. Its successor, 2002’s Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots, sold half a million copies in the US alone and won a Grammy, which the Flaming Lips seemed to take as a signal to let their imaginations run riot in the most confounding way. They released unwatchable Christmas films, 24-hour long songs, experimental double albums that frontman Wayne Coyne promoted with the suggestion that it “would have made a better single album if only the artist could have focused themselves”, a series of releases on which they covered The Dark Side of the Moon, Sgt Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band and the Stone Roses’ eponymous debut in their entirety, a collaboration with Ke$ha that was pressed on vinyl containing Ke$ha’s menstrual blood, etc.On the one hand, hooray for a band resolutely refusing to cave in to commercial pressure. On the other, a lot of this stuff has definitely muddied the water between “fearless and unbridled artistic experimentation” and “apparently just testing everyone’s patience for the sake of it”.It says something about their releases in the intervening years that King’s Mouth has been greeted as a concise return to form: a concept album accompanied by an immersive art exhibition and a children’s book, about a monarch with a giant head that contains galaxies and weather systems, narrated by former Clash guitarist Mick Jones. The latter’s contributions are very much in the vein of Stanley Unwin’s appearances on the Small Faces’ 1968 psychedelic opus Ogdens’ Nut Gone Flake, and, it has to be said, don’t make much more sense than the inventor of Basic Engly Twenty Fido enquiring if you’re sitting comfortabold two square on your botty. It’s a moot point as to whether Jones sounds either rapt with innocent wonder as he reads, or like a man who hasn’t got a clue what he’s supposed to be going on about.Still, after pausing for a moment to reflect on the reaction of the spittle-flecked audience at the Roxy in 1977, had they been informed that the Clash’s guitarist was going to end up narrating a psychedelic concept album about a monarch with a head that contained galaxies, it’s hard not to concede that the advance publicity on King’s Mouth (initially released in a limited vinyl-only edition on Record Store Day) is correct. Despite the concept and accompanying folderol, what lies at its heart are a succession of songs more straightforwardly appealing than anything the Flaming Lips have come up with in years. Only the brief instrumental Mother Universe speaks of the kind of self-indulgence that’s marked out their recent releases. It’s nothing as craven as a direct return to the sound of The Soft Bulletin and Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots – it’s comparatively stripped-down, less widescreen in its musical ambitions, more obviously reliant on electronics that sound like electronics rather than a dense patchwork of samples – but it shares with those albums the sense of a band marshalling their energies and abundance of outre ideas into relatively short, honed, lushly melodic bursts.At their best – Mouth of the King, All For the Life of the City – the songs here are a total joy, reacquainting you with certain strengths the Flaming Lips have tended to obfuscate on recent releases. Multi-instrumentalist Steven Drozd has the ability to mould a wildly varied set of musical backdrops into a cohesive whole – the album goes from the fidgety distorted funk of Feedaloodum Beedle Dot to the 10cc-ish AOR of The Sparrow to the cinematic, choral sample-bedecked instrumental Funeral Parade without seeming disjointed, largely because whatever style they’re essaying, it somehow always sounds like the Flaming Lips. Wayne Coyne can still project childlike wonder and homespun wisdom without sounding cloying. From Do You Realize? to Waitin’ for Superman, Flaming Lips’ biggest songs have frequently hinged on presenting lyrical ideas that look a bit trite on paper, but gain a peculiar, affecting emotional heft when delivered in Coyne’s wayward, fragile voice. It’s a trick much in evidence here: Giant Baby finds him reflecting on his mother’s death and concluding that “life is sometimes sad” on the concluding How Can a Head, he’s gawping in wonder at the powers of the human brain.How Can a Head is the album’s highlight, blessed with as lovely a melody as the band have ever written. Luxuriating in it, you’re struck by the sense that you should probably enjoy it while it lasts. If the Flaming Lips’ recent history has taught us anything, it’s that their next album will probably be confounding: abnormal service resumed.William Doyle: Nobody Else Will Tell YouThe artist formerly known as East India Youth continues down his own idiosyncratic singer-songwriter path on a psychedelic exploration of suburban living."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fcfe59549992952d27c14827702c2b324bac4ff1/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1004c36ecf49815729edcbe6d936ff83","title":"a sneaker peek behind the scenes at new balance","story":"Since 1982, New Balance has produced its flagship 990s at one of two US factories.

She’s been sewing at New Balance for 31 years, and first put needle to thread when she was a nine-year-old girl under the watchful eye of her mother, who was a seamstress in the Dominican Republic, where Tejada grew up.“I have sewn all my life. This is my pride,” she says. “When I’m sewing, I am happy – I am doing what I learned, with high quality. No run-off. Clean lines, everything where it needs to be.”Eric Vassall, the senior product manager at New Balance in charge of the 990 series, believes the craftsmanship and experience that workers such as Tejada bring to bear is part of what has made the shoe appeal to so many distinct markets.“I’ve been here 19 years and you see generation after generation after generation. So you have the mother who has been here that taught the daughter, who had taught the son,” he says.And at New Balance, the workers don’t just make the shoes – they are also integrated into the design process. This is only possible because, unlike most of its competitors, New Balance both manufactures and designs the bulk of its trainers in the same offices. This means that instead of emails going back and forth across different time zones, workers can give designers and engineers direct feedback in person.For Vassall, the fact that his team only works a few floors above the production line has been crucial. It allows them to make quick adjustments and, ultimately, produce a better product.“I would say for the latest version of the 990, the 990v5, we always would come downstairs and talk to the craftspeople and say: ‘Hey, what’s working, what’s not working?’”Jesse Plouffe, the product developer who worked on the 990v5, says workers like Tejada have made him better at his job.“They’re experts. I can’t tell them how to stitch the shoe. I have no idea how to stitch it. I know what I want to do, but they are experts and the value they add is incredible,” he says.And the atmosphere on the line embodies that spirit of collaboration. The workers move quickly – they each have just 22.5 seconds to complete their task – but still find moments to greet each other warmly.Luis Puello, a 51-year-old leather cutter, carefully runs his hands across a sheet of pig’s hide, looking for defects that he marks with a laser before a machine makes a cut. Over the years, he says, he has developed a better feel for the leather, quickly sensing which parts will function best in different areas of the shoe.He smiles when asked what he thinks about the 990s that he helps make every day. “When the job is done, you see what you’ve done, and you feel proud,” he says.New Balance’s 990v5s are available at the New Balance London flagship store or newbalance"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e45c4c0421651847b2fb3c89c779c96825af739a/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f9104a8fbe287510bd6c4115b3bfdbaa","title":"the evolution of the new balance 99x series in pictures","story":"The New Balance 990v5 – which was released in the UK in May this year – is the latest trainer in a 37-year footwear dynasty.

This is in addition to the revelation last month that it had paid out £1m in performance-related awards for April 2017 to March 2018.It made the late disclosure on its first-year bonuses on Thursday in a bid for full transparency, it said.The department paid £343,650 to delegated graded civil servants, in amounts ranging from £700 to £2,500, for the year 2016 to 2017.In its annual report for 2018-19 also published on Thursday, it revealed that the highest-paid official was the recently retired permanent secretary, Philip Rycroft, who earned between £225,000 and £230,000 including benefits in kind of £17,900 and a pension of £46,000. His benefits in kind included travel costs between home and work.About 16,000 civil servants have been working on Brexit at an estimated cost of £1.5bn to date under the codename Operation Yellowhammer.They were stood down in April when article 50 was extended until Halloween, after an estimated £1.5bn had been spent including on recruits from the private sector.But departments are expected to be ordered to ramp up no-deal planning immediately after the new prime minister, expected to be Boris Johnson, gets into No 10 next Wednesday. It is not known who is going to be on his Brexit team but the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, is being tipped, as is the pro-Brexit trade consultant Shanker Singham as an adviser.He is the leading force at the privately funded Alternative Arrangements Commission, which has sought to find solutions to the Irish border question. It is understood he has not been approached but would be willing to work on a Johnson or Hunt team.It is thought all big Whitehall departments have made Brexit bonuses but virtually all have refused  freedom of information requests for disclosure.So far the House of Commons is the only other department to disclose its payments.Last month, it revealed it had made £700,000 in extra payments involving a £250 bonus to all 2,800 Commons administration and parliamentary Digital Service staff in recognition of their hard work sitting additional days and working into the night.The departments that did respond to freedom of information requests include the Ministry of Defence, which said it paid 19 staff “a reward” or gave them a “thank you” voucher for their work on Brexit up to April 2019.In March, the armed forces mobilised a special team in a 24-hour cover in a nuclear-proof bunker under their headquarters as part of the military’s crisis management operation, dubbed Operation Redfold.They were due to direct 3,500 military personnel on standby if required in the case of chaos on the streets, which could have included congestion on the roads to Dover, disruption to medical supplies and aviation.The MoD said it had paid out a total of £8,250: the highest award was £2,000 and the smallest £100.The Food Standards Agency paid out almost £30,000 to 64 staff in bonuses ranging from £250 per person to £1,000, while the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency paid seven staff between £500 and £800 in a Brexit bonus.It is responsible for the safety of medicines and medical devices, many of which come from the EU.While virtually all the big departments refused to disclose Brexit bonus data, some did reveal what they had spent on Brexit so far.DExEU spent £101.6m in the year 2017-18.Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs spent £308m on Brexit: £47m in 2017-18 and £261m for the financial year 2018-19.The Home Office, which was responsible for developing the settled status scheme for EU citizens, spent £70m in the year 2017-18.The Ministry of Justice revealed it had spent £9.7m on Brexit-related work in 2018-19.The Cabinet Office, the Environment Agency, and the Department for Infrastructure in Northern Ireland said they did not award bonuses.The National Police Chiefs’ Council revealed that the International Crime Coordination Centre, which was set up to provide continuity for UK law enforcement following Brexit, said it spent £18,000 in 2017-18 and £1.75m in the year 2018-19."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/782d26ebf909827cf7aa4e31020e8a551df24ee6/0_505_3633_2180/master/3633.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2e11df9ad0e67bc4f69da428938c9d0a","title":"we had 15 seconds of fuel left buzz aldrin on the nervy moon landing","story":"Astronaut’s newly released video interview describes final moments before ‘the Eagle’ landed on the moonTime was running out. The Apollo 11 lunar module was on its historic descent to the moon’s crater-pocked surface on 20 July 1969 when a fuel light blinked on. Still 100ft (30 metres) above the ground, it was not what the astronauts needed. The Eagle’s tank was nearly dry.In a new video interview about the momentous first landing on the moon, Buzz Aldrin, the mission’s lunar module pilot, describes how he held his tongue when the warning light appeared and Charlie Duke, Nasa’s capsule communicator, came on the line from Houston to inform Aldrin and Neil Armstrong they had only 60 seconds left to make it down.“OK. One hundred feet. Sixty seconds. We’d better ease down,” Aldrin recalls thinking. But he thought better of telling Armstrong to get a move on. Dressed in a jacket and “Destination Mars” T-shirt, his fingers adazzle with rings, Aldrin’s contorted face conveys how dicey the moment was. “But I don’t want to disturb Neil by saying: ‘Hurry up, hurry up!’” he says, leaning in and dropping his voice.Armstrong had enough on his mind. From an altitude of about 500 ft he had taken control of the lunar module and was carefully steering the craft down. Nobody knew how the module would handle and there in front of the descending craft loomed a large crater that would have spelled disaster for the men and the mission.The astronauts had already had to contend with program alarms going off in the module, which themselves could have forced the mission to abort. The glitch was eventually resolved, leading to a “go” from Houston, but as Aldrin concedes: “it tended to distract a little bit.”The Eagle dropped 90 ft over the next 30 seconds, leaving the crew a further half minute of fuel to navigate the final 10 ft to the lunar surface. In the interview recorded at the Science Museum in London in 2016, but released on Thursday for the first time, Aldrin says it was only at that late stage that he felt more confident about the landing. “I figured, ah, we got it made,” he recalls.It was a feat that succeeded by the finest of margins. “We touched down, and I think the estimate, not because somebody put a dipstick in the fuel to see how much was left, but it was calculations and information onboard, we probably had about 15 seconds of fuel left.”The museum is marking the 50th anniversary of the Apollo missions with a Summer of Space, featuring the Soyuz capsule from Tim Peake’s mission to the International Space Station and the original Apollo 10 command module simulator console. The latter will go on display alongside the Apollo 10 command module, “Charlie Brown”. The mission served as a dress rehearsal for the moon landing and the module holds the record for the fastest crewed vehicle in history, having reached a speed of 24,790 miles per hour as it fell back to Earth on 26 May 1969. Aldrin’s interview will appear on the Science Museum’s YouTube channel.For those of a certain age, the museum will celebrate the touchdown of Apollo 11 on Saturday with a special screening of The Clangers introduced by Sir Michael Palin."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ded44a7429b986ae9ea877f9fe7481a3145c0e1b/0_357_2966_1779/master/2966.jpg?width=1140\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=826095771438455255607e463ebc2b1d 1140w","title":"cricket world cup 10 fans countries review action","story":"Readers from around the world reflect on seven weeks of cricket and one astounding finalEngland’s run to the semi-finals, and indeed final, could not have been more quintessentially English. The team came into the tournament on a great run and hope was lifted to even greater heights with a few high-quality performances, only to be met with a crash back to traditional English cynicism when we almost inevitably lost to two tournament underdogs. From this point on though, they were exceptional, rising to the challenge of what essentially became four consecutive knockout games.What else can be said about the final? It was the best game of cricket I’ve witnessed and quite possibly the best of all time. The match had it all and England finally proved that they can stand up in those pressure moments in a knockout tournament. They had no small degree of luck and there was plenty of tension, but how else would you want to win your first Cricket World Cup?Let’s hope this group stays together for one more World Cup under the cool head of Eoin Morgan and a coach who will further develop this exciting brand of cricket. It would be easy to see this as the pinnacle, but how incredible would it be to push for an Australia-esque World Cup dynasty? Matt LeechWe delivered the greatest of World Cup finals. No other countries would have produced such a game. New Zealand always get stuck into games and regularly deliver some of the greatest cricketing spectacles. It’s such a shame we remain financially uninteresting for cricketing schedulers. Winning the World Cup might have changed that, but we are worthy runners-up.Jimmy Neesham was my player of the tournament. He plays hard and fearless, keeps going and has a mental toughness and mature outlook on life. He will have plenty of big moments in his career. Malcolm EddingtonIndia were like a critically acclaimed television show. After power-packed leading performances from neo-noir legend Rohit Sharma and the experimental yet highly engaging directorship from Jasprit Bumrah, most expected that pair, along with a strong supporting cast, to help India execute a stunning finale. But, despite bringing in the biggest viewing figures, the show was cancelled at the last moment by the executives at the World Cup – the notorious Kiwis.MS Dhoni was a fan favourite, but his personal style did not suit the overall tone of the crew. Rishabh Pant, a cult hero on the local soap opera, Indian Premier League, wasn’t ready for the biggest stage just yet. Surely, by the time the next big show comes around, he will be in the spotlight. Scriptwriter Virat Kohli was excellent but still did not meet his lofty standards and fluffed the ending. Cameos from Sir Ravindra Jadeja grabbed bits and pieces of the public imagination and an unexpected starring role during India’s final moments justified calls for his regular introduction to the set-up in the future. Abhijato SensarmaDespite the horrible thrashing in the semi-final, we performed above expectations. Six months ago I didn’t think we’d make it to the last four in some respects we got through because other sides failed to deliver.Mitchell Starc was our best performer. It was a shame he went AWOL in the last two matches. Alex Carey looked a class above most in his ball-striking and attitude. He was a real find. To play a great knock after being cleaned up by Jofra Archer really showed he has what it takes. The performances of Glenn Maxwell and Marcus Stoinis were really disappointing. The one innings where Maxwell looked really like to kick into gear was the one where Usman Khawaja ran him out horribly.The semi-final revealed all our weaknesses at once, which was a shame. Unfortunately our domestic one-day competition is now contained in a short period at the start of our season. It’s not enough for players to improve their skills in this format on the biggest international stage. Scott MeehanPakistan did well. Our performance would be viewed much more positively had we reached the semi-finals, but that’s how fine the margins are. The game against West Indies was very costly and some fans think the Sri Lanka washout was a missed opportunity. Although we have no one to blame but ourselves for not reaching the last four.After beating both the finalists in the group stage, it’s a shame we weren’t consistent enough elsewhere. We have a few special players coming through and they will surely help. Although fielding remains a problem. Awais AhmedWe were hot favourites to finish in the bottom two, yet finished sixth and may have qualified for the semis had we won our two washed-out matches. We have a bright talent in Avishka Fernando. In fact, we could have a fearsome batting unit in 2023. The bowling will be the real concern. We have to search hard for the next Malingas and Muralis. Malinga still has a role to play in four years’ time. We need his personality and experience in the team. And our former cricketers need to take part in building cricket from scratch. The current administration is useless. Akesh SamudithaIt took us four games to get a point on the board and we had to thank the English summer weather for that. South Africa paid the price for a terribly slow start, and highlights were few and far between. The AB De Villiers debate before the tournament obviously didn’t help.I’m hugely disappointed that we were so poor early on. The late wins against Sri Lanka and and Australia, were spoiled by the fact that there was so very little to play for. Wasting a successful 300+ run chase against Australia in a dead rubber hurts. Nils LouwAfter a great start to the tournament – beating South Africa and almost forcing a win against the Kiwis – the Tigers threatened to be the story of the World Cup, but it never quite happened. Instead the campaign ended in a whimper with damaging losses against both south Asian neighbours. The defeat to Pakistan was particularly disappointing given the historical context and the fact they were playing in front of a packed house at Lord’s. It was easily their worst performance of the tournament.In contrast, the stunning run chase against the Windies on the postage stamp-sized Taunton ground was the tournament highlight, reaching the target of 322 with such ease and with so many overs to spare. It gave fans genuine hope for a top-four finish. Had fine margins gone their way, a semi-final place would have been a reality.The team didn’t quite live up to its billing for the emotional Tiger fans. A feeling of the wheels coming off was compounded by the swift dismissal of coach Steve Rhodes long before England lifted the trophy.Giving player of the tournament to Kane Williamson was obviously a sympathy vote. Shakib Al Hasan was the true star of the World Cup. After spending a decade being the most underrated international cricketer in the most underrated international team, Shakib finally became a household name – for those households with Sky TV anyway. His consistency batting at No 3, often arriving at the crease early in the innings, and scoring at nearly a run a ball was staggering. Add to that tidy reliable off-spin and you have the complete package. Tawhid QureshiWe were terrible for most of it. Bowling Pakistan out for 105 in the first game got our hopes up, but there wasn’t enough thought into anything after that and we played out the tournament as a Chris Gayle testimonial tour. At least we beat a plucky Afghanistan side.The authorities must begin planning for the next World Cup immediately by investing in players who will be available solely for the longer version of the game. We have become champions of the T20 game, but the same players struggle in longer formats. T20 is hurting the quality of players in the longer versions. The problem remains that we have a very small pool of players. Glen DucreayIt was always going to be tough. Always. I’m disappointed we didn’t take any points but there were some competitive performances. Falling 11 runs short of beating India, and two balls from shocking Pakistan, were the best memories.Captain Mohammad Nabi had plenty to say before the tournament, but his inexperience showed in the field. I’ll be happy if we can progress tactically and learn from the experience of playing against the very best.

OK, we laughed about it then too – here are some of the most humiliating World Cup moments endured by the England men’s cricket team. In the 1987 World Cup final, they were doing so well that Allan Border brought himself on to bowl, which was, of course, the perfect moment for Mike Gatting to deploy his fabled reverse-sweep. In 1996, Neil Smith discharged his guts on to the pitch and then Sri Lanka knocked his team out in the quarter-finals, chasing down 236 with nearly 10 overs to spare. In 1999, the last time the competition was held in the green and pleasants, the opening ceremony had to be cut short because of rain and England were eliminated before the official song came out, dismissed for 103 by South Africa and 169 by India. Here they are in 2007, struggling to beat Canada in the aftermath of the Fredalo jaunt and here they are losing to Ireland in 2011, a moment greatly appreciated by the people of Pune. And, because we can’t help ourselves, a bit of 2019: the ICC’s montage of the staggering denouement.2) It’s that time of year again when we begin preparing for the World Chase Tag championships, to be held at London’s York Hall on 24 August.

Playing Hungary in their home World Aquatics Championships, they were beaten 64-0 to smash the previous record defeat of 33-0, set earlier that day when Netherlands pipped South Africa. However, things have looked up a bit for them since then …5) With the key match of 2000 Bledisloe Cup reaching its conclusion, Australia trailed New Zealand 23-21 and won a potentially decisive penalty … except the regular goal-kicker, Stirling Mortlock, was off the pitch. So Australia captain John Eales – 6ft 7in, 18 stone-plus, nicknamed Nobody, “because Nobody’s Perfect” – assumed responsibility. Here he is, telling us all about it.6) To the unbridled joy of no one you would dream of speaking to, pre-season football is under way.

Some Breaking News courtesy of both twitter and OBO’s very own twitter: Abhijato.  Zimbabwe have been suspended by the ICC with immediate effect.  A very happy Meg Lanning is talking: “We thought that the wicket would play as it did. England didn’t make it easy for us, they bowled straight lines and to still have two good batters in at the end of the day is crucial. “It was nice to be able t0 build partnerships in the innings, England bowled well at times. We feel in a really strong position. “It’s a different style, you need to be able to absorb periods of pressure, and I had to fight my instincts today. It was a different innings from me today but I really enjoyed it. I was keen to have pride in my defence. I really enjoyed the adjustment - it is not a format I’ve had a lot of success in before. “ In the morning we will carry on for a little bit, there is a bit of weather around but we’ll have to consolidate, first-innings runs are going to be crucial in this match.”100th over: Australia 265-3 (Haynes 54, Perry 84) England indulge in a bit of time-wasting to ensure they don’t have to bowl another over. Anyway, this one from Ecclestone is smart and on the money. Australia scamper through for three and that’s stumps! The Aussies look happy, and England, who never gave up, look relieved.

She bats away four more balls before at last pulling Ecclestone for one. Well played! Off 145 balls, it started quickly but turned into a bit of a dirge. She’s delighted, a huge smile under the helmet.Ecclestone hasn’t been at her best today, but neither has she been jeered. If she was, we would call her Hecklestone! Okay, I’ll show myself out ...Through the back door and down the garden path Tuvic - and keep your hands off the strawberries at the end of the garden.95th over: Australia 258-3 (Haynes 49, Perry 82) A four, a four, a palpable four! A flick off the hips by Perry from Marsh. We see Tammy Beaumont looking through the dressing-room glass darkly - that injured thumb is the last thing England need. And Haynes sits once more on 49. 94th over: Australia 251-3 (Haynes 49, Perry 76) The tireless Ecclestone reels in, pony tail swinging. And Haynes is stranded on 49 once more!OB has evidence of sandwich eating. If the players can eat sandwiches in the field Tanya, so can the umpires!93rd over: Australia 251-3 (Haynes 49, Perry 76) Perry watches carefully through the bars of her helmet and turns Marsh off her hip for a single. Oh! And totally against the run of play, Perry is nearly run out as Haynes changes her mind mid-run after Brunt picks up and throws in the covers. If she’d hit, it would have been close. I’ll just leave this here:92nd over: Australia 250-3 (Haynes 48, Perry 75) Knight calls it a day on the seamers from both ends - and calls up Ecclestone from the pavilion end. Haynes’ eyes light up and she tip-toes down the pitch and lofts her over mid wicket for four. OB Jato knows what umpires carry in their pockets. The umpires carry a clipper (for seam-cutting purposes), a handkerchief, a bandage, a DLS sheet and a cheese sandwich in their backpocket. No, don’t ask me why they need the DLS sheet .OB - are you sure? Surely, back in day, a packet of fags. And some mints.91st over: Australia 244-3 (Haynes 42, Perry 75) I didn’t see a ball of Marsh’s over I’m afraid. But four runs came from it. Australia - unleashed!90th over: Australia 240-3 (Haynes 42, Perry 71) The Sky swingometer says that Shrubsole is getting more swing in this spell than she did in her last. Perhaps that is why Perry and Haynes are being so watchful. Perhaps it’s the rain that is forecast over the next two days. Perhaps England’s accuracy has dimmed their confidence for the bigger, more audacious strokes. Perry is getting close to the record number of runs scored in a Test before a dismissalTat Wood, stretches, and taps on the keyboard:It’s just gone noon in New England and, after the trouble I had on Sunday explaining why I was reading updates about a game I didn’t entirely understand, I hope nobody asks why I’m so on edge about an hour of not-much-happeningness. If anyone asks you can draw them into our web....but you’re very loyal to be watching this at lunchtime in New England. I hope there is a pastrami on rye on hand?89th over: Australia 240-3 (Haynes 42, Perry 71)  Haynes scores her first run for 25 balls as Brunt keeps on the money. Is it ungallant to wish they’d get on with it a bit?88th over: Australia 239-3 (Haynes 41, Perry 71) Shrubsole has located her swing. The umpire cuts a bit of spare thread off the seam. I wonder what other tools an umpire carries in his back pocket?JP adds to my inbox’s excitement. He has been thinking about the World Cup.Just some thoughts on the strange failure of England cricket to capitalise on the Women’s World Cup win. My then 8 year old daughter was completely enthused by the whole tournament and signed up with a local club. We watched Australia play in the tournament, and all the Aussie players were unfailingly brilliant to all the kids who came to watch - signing autographs all day, while Meg Lanning came over to my daughter when she was looking a little glum and had a nice little chat. But there has never been so much as a highlights package of the final or any kind of souvenir publication released. Meanwhile, the KIA superleague team that my daughter started supporting on the back of the world cup is now to be folded in favour of the Hundred. Inexplicable. And such opportunities missed. JP I think there are lots of female county cricketers and fans who would agree with you. I guess we won’t be able to judge properly on the folly or otherwise of the Hundred for a few years. The good thing is the investment - but I too wonder about the wisdom of doing away with the blossoming Super League. Interesting thoughts about the Final - was there really no glossy publication or DVD released? And I’m so glad your daughter is a fan!87th over: Australia 239-3 (Haynes 41, Perry 71) Brunt is cheesed off. Sarah Taylor enthuses from behind the stumps “Come on girls”- but it turns out Perry and Haynes, despite the lack of long-form cricket, have concentration to die for. Block. Block. Block. Block. 86th over: Australia 238-3 (Haynes 41, Perry 70) One run off Shrubsole’s over. I do admire her effort. That’s drinks.And another email - two in ten minutes! Thanks Andrew!Hi Tanya –after the frantic and emotional World Cup (even once I know South Africa were eliminated), it is nice to have about two months of test cricket to watchfollow OBO where I can be completely neutral and a bit more relaxed- although what price another men’s Ashes classic. I do wish there were more Women’s tests as I do see it as the ultimate in cricket – is there any way that will happen give the numbers of women’s tests seems to be in permanent decline? Hi Andrew, I agree that it is the pinnacle. And I feel for the players who are desperate to have more of a crack at the longer game. The boards seem to have bet the silver on short-form cricket working for the women and attracting the fans. A very interesting column by Megan Schutt (below) discusses the issues if you fancy a read. I didn’t actually realise that only English and Australian women played Test cricket. 85th over: Australia 237-3 (Haynes 41, Perry 69) Brunt bustles in, but though no runs come off the over, Australia’s batters are untroubled. England have nearly bowled their requisite overs but I’m afraid they’ve still got an hour left to play. I‘ve heard excellent things about Robin Smith’s autobiography and will buy it as soon as it reaches the shelves in Kolkata. If what you say about his father is true, my mind turns to a recently-retired legend’s father who behaved similarly - Yograj Singh, father of Yuvraj Singh. He was an international cricketer himself. Legend has it that he threw away Yuvi’s medals and skates because he wanted his son to solely pursue and excel in cricket. ‘Inhumane’ is the only word which comes to my mind to describe his father’s treatment, but Yuvraj did become the white-ball great for India. When it comes between what he achieved and what was the main well-documented torturous driving force which got him there, I can’t humanely justify anyone suffering like he did irrespective of the results. Alas, this is another moral dilemma when it comes to maximising excellence in sports!Thanks Abhijato, I didn’t know that about Yuvraj. I think there are many similar stories behind sporting excellence sadly - all the efforts make for very talented players, but perhaps not very happy human beings. 84th over: Australia 237-3 (Haynes 41, Perry 69)  The shackles have broken! Perry hits two consecutive boundaries: a cut then a charming cover drive. Shrubsole strays slightly off target. Knight is still very enthusiastic, extolling her fielders with hand claps and bounces at cover. 83rd over: Australia 229-3 (Haynes 41, Perry 61) Brunt is Shrubsole’s new ball partner the other end. Brunt is so fun to watch, every emotion she feels flashes across her face. And she has a wonderful fast bowler’s physique, all powerful shoulders and backside. Haynes has slowed down markedly at the crease - she now has 41 off 108 balls, and she started off in some style. 82nd over: Australia 228-3 (Haynes 41, Perry 60) And now we take the new ball! England have a slip and Shrubsole is on target. No runs, no wickets. And that’s the fifth maiden in the last seven over. 81st over: Australia 228-3 (Haynes 41, Perry 60) But England don’t take it... Knight preferring to keep the pressure building with Laura Marsh. Haynes breaks her run-less hiatus via a misfield. The good news is that there are over 2000 at Taunton today! Hoping to get down there too before the end of the season, maybe (say it quietly) to see Somerset lift the Championship.80th over: Australia 226-3 (Haynes 40, Perry 59) Elwiss’ red heels flirt with the spectators as she starts her run-up. It’s another maiden but the drama, could be about to start as the new ball is now available. 79th over: Australia 226-3 (Haynes 40, Perry 59) The pitch, last used on June 8 during that very wet spell during the world Cup, is sloooow. Australia waiting to pounce on the loose balls, happy to watch the others go by. 78th over: Australia 226-3 (Haynes 40, Perry 59) Elswiss again. Hallelujah! A boundary! Perry pulls a short ball and it beats the chasing fielder. Australia building ominously, if slowly.77th over: Australia 220-3 (Haynes 40, Perry 54) Marsh rolls her arm over. Perry looks calms but cautious. Textbook defensive shot to finish the over - and that’s another maiden. Time to go and make a cuppa if you can. 76th over: Australia 220-3 (Haynes 40, Perry 54) Elwiss gives Ecclestone a rest and we see a most gorgeous dog sitting on a bench in the sun. That’s the lovely thing about Women’s games - it is so relaxed you can bring your dog, your book, your toddler. A good over by Elwiss - a maiden. 75th over: Australia 220-3 (Haynes 37, Perry 53) Marsh replaces Gordon - four off the over. The new ball can be taken in five overs. I think Knight will bite the umpires’ hands off!74th over: Australia 216-3 (Haynes 37, Perry 53) Ecclestone starts her 21st over of the game. Haynes finds the gap and they knock off four. In other matters, has anyone read Rob Smyth’s biography of Robin Smith yet? I’ve read the first two chapters which are eye-opening to say the least about Smith’s relationship with his father, whose desire to see his son succeed turn him into a bit of a monster. 73rd over: Australia 212-3 (Haynes 33, Perry 53) A slight breeze ruffles the trousers of Gordon as she skips in from the River End. Plenty of air and the Aussies knock just two from the overs. Soporific scones anyone?Brunt whirls her arms around, look at me Skip! 72nd over: Australia 210-3 (Haynes 32, Perry 52) Knight is still attacking, Ecclestone is bowling with a slip, a short leg and a backward short leg. And Australia watchfully play the ball back. Another maiden. 71st over: Australia 210-3 (Haynes 32, Perry 52) Haynes spots the chance of easy runs and totters down the pitch to thwack Gordon over mid-wicket for four. That eases the pressure. 70th over: Australia 203-3 (Haynes 26, Perry 512 Perry tips Ecclestone for the first runs of the session, Just two off the over including a bit of a misfield from Brunt who ends up flat on her belly.  Katravath, you sent me an email, but it was blank! Do write again if you had things to say. 69th over: Australia 203-3 (Haynes 26, Perry 51)  Gordon switches to over the wicket and Haynes swats a bit frustratedly, and then Gordon gets some turn out of the footholes that hits Haynes awkwardly on the pads. What powers of concentration do the Australians have, can they fight against the frustration of this stranglehold England are building? Two maidens in a row to start the evening session. 68th over: Australia 203-3 (Haynes 26, Perry 51)  The first ball of the session produces an invigorated appeal from Ecclestone against Perry, but the umpire isn’t interested - the replay shows that it was umpires’s call. The cameras pan back and we see the hills of the Mendips rolling away behind. A maiden.67th over: Australia 203-3 (Haynes 26, Perry 51) Gordon’s action is quite distinctive. Her arm is high and wide, and she gives it a visible tweak. A maiden, and that’s tea! Australia’s session, with both Lanning and Perry reaching fifty and Haynes looking in no bother at all since she arrived. No great acceleration though... yet. My son has just brought me a cuppa, I’m going to have a quick drink - see you all in twenty minutes. 66th over: Australia 203-3 (Haynes 26, Perry 51) Shrubsole again, bowling quite wide of the crease. Perry swivels and pulls her to the boundary and that’s her fifty! She raises her bat, little white-blong ponytail poking out of the back of her helmet. It’s her second fifty in her eighth Test. She’s converted one of those to a hundred. A fifty per cent conversion rate, if that makes England feel any better....65th over: Australia 199-3 (Haynes 26, Perry 42) Knight gambles, and throws the ball to Gordon, on Test debut today. Her first ball is a full toss and Perry drives her through the covers for four to tip-toe on the edge of fifty. 64th over: Australia 194-3 (Haynes 26, Perry 42) The brains trust gather at the top of the over - England could do with another breakthrough if possible before tea. But Shrubsole’s first ball is a bit of a loosener and Haynes drives her for four. But the run-rate this session is only just over two and a half. 63rd over: Australia 190-3 (Haynes 22, Perry 42) I wonder if the ground will be deluged with school kids tomorrow afternoon when the state schools break up for summer? Not a bad crowd even today - at least as far as the TV cameras are showing. Marsh again - Perry and Marsh watch carefully, play defensively. 62nd over: Australia 189-3 (Haynes 21, Perry 42) Shrubsole again, a better over. Perry plays and misses as Shrubsole keeps on a good length. Good bowling. A maiden. We watch all the Australian coaching in their matching green and gold enjoying the Somerset sunshine. 61st over: Australia 189-3 (Haynes 21, Perry 42) Haynes spots a legside ball from Marsh, gets down one knee and sweeps her behind short leg. The next ball drifts again, this time the other way, and Haynes drives, for another four. Haynes not having to work too hard for her runs at the moment.60th over: Australia 180-3 (Haynes 13, Perry 41) Knight and Shrubsole have a good chat at the top of her mark. She charges in, Taylor, lithe behind the stumps, helmet on, is standing close. A tidy over from Shrubsole, no dramas. In case you were wondering the last time the first three wickets in a Women’s Test series were bowled was India v New Zealand in 1995!59th over: Australia 179-3 (Haynes 13, Perry 40) They’ve just flashed up England’s bowling figures on the telly - Shrubsole has only bowled five overs today - perhaps time for her to come out of pasture - actually here she goes, half-heartedly rolling her arms over in the outfield. Just one run off Marsh’s over.58th over: Australia 178-3 (Haynes 13, Perry 39) Ecclestone can’t quire work out what the weather’s doing. She’s in long sleeves, a sleeve-less sweater and sunglasses. Long ponytail flowing characteristically down her back. An uncharacteristic misfield there from Blunt off Perry. And then Haynes tucks in to a shorter ball from Ecclestone, pulling it, hard, to the boundary. 57th over: Australia 171-3 (Haynes 8, Perry 37) Haynes has a high backlift and her bat looks heavy, but it flows smoothly. Just one off Marsh’s over. 56th over: Australia 170-3 (Haynes 8, Perry 36)  Haynes sweeps through an empty leg-side field for four, then as Knight rearranges her fielders, has another look around. Ecclestone causing trouble every over at the moment. Oooh, now we get a close-up of the pitch- all sorts of dips and ditches by left-handed Haynes’s feet. 55th over: Australia 165-3 (Haynes 4, Perry 35) The long legged Marsh again. Perry uses her feet, chassez, plie, to drive Marsh for one. That LBW decision last over? It was umpires’s call. 54th over: Australia 158-3 (Haynes 4, Perry 34) A vital wicket for England - Lanning had looked in lovely touch - and so deserved for Ecclestone who has caused lots of trouble since lunch, without reward. Haynes adds to the drama with a four off her first ball, and then Ecclestone roars an lbw appeal. The umpire shakes his head.Lanning is furious, turning on her heel. Ecclestone delighted! Lanning misreads a ball which she tries to cut, misses and it clips the top of off-stump. 53rd over: Australia 158-2 (Lanning 56, Perry 33) The Taunton sky is cornflower blue with little fluffy clouds resting their heads temporarily above the ground. A careful over from Marsh - just two off it. Do drop me a line and tell me what you’re up to. 52nd over: Australia 158-2 (Lanning 56, Perry 33) And back to young Sophie Ecclestone, who doesn’t seem to be feeling too much pain from the shoulder injury that knocked her off the field this morning. Perry’s bat is lovely and straight, pushing, pushing, forward. A huge appeal for lbw off the last ball but it was outside the line. 51st over: Australia 156-2 (Lanning 55, Perry 32)Thank you Adam and welcome to the second half of the first day of the only Test of the Ashes. Laura Marsh pulls her hair into a bun and takes the ball. Lanning clocks the first, but pulls the second behind square just missing short leg. Eeek!50th over: Australia 150-2 (Lanning 50, Perry 32) “Cakes” and “Shetland” seem to be Ecclestone’s nicknames, both making sense given her surname and pony tail. Perry cuts the spinner for one, breaking the run of dots that spread over four overs from her end. Lanning’s turn, taking one to cover to raise her half-century. 122 balls it has taken her to raise her bat for the first time in a Test Match. That dropped catch by Knight before lunch is going to hurt an awful lot, I suspect. Drinks!Thanks for your company throughout the first half of this opening day. I’ll leave you with Tanya Aldred, who will take it from here. Bye for now! 49th over: Australia 147-2 (Lanning 48, Perry 30) Edge! Not to hand! Gordon does everything right but it flies wide of Taylor, moving Lanning to within a stroke of a half-century. She adds a couple around the corner before keeping out the rest.48th over: Australia 141-2 (Lanning 42, Perry 30) “My word!” says Sarah Taylor from behind the stumps when Ecclestone, for the umpteenth time since lunch, nearly gets through the gate. It is Perry this time around playing out a maiden, the interrogation including another shout for leg before on the front foot. So close.47th over: Australia 141-2 (Lanning 42, Perry 30) The 50 stand is raised between the Aussie engine room pair via a Perry single to deep point, the first run for 21 balls. But it’s another over where Gordon is asking all the right questions.

The slip sends him back into a tie for the lead at -4 with Shane Lowry and JB Holmes. Meanwhile the 2015 PGA champion Jason Day - who came within a shot of making the play-off at St Andrews that same year - has been going along nicely, without fuss or fanfare. Birdies at 5 and 9 saw him hit the turn in 34 it’s been pars all the way since. He’s -2 through 13.An update on David Duval. Turns out his octuple-bogey 13 on 7 wasn’t a 13 after all. It was a 14. A nonuple bogey, then. And that’s a round of 91. Still not quite as bad as Ian Baker-Finch’s effort at Troon in 1997, but that’s a low bar for a former champion to clear. So here’s what happened: he lost his first two tee shots, then sent his third into deep rough. At which point he played the wrong ball, a mistake only discovered up on the green. So he had to go back to the tee having been hit with three penalties for lost balls, plus a two-stroke penalty for playing the wrong ball. He teed off for the fourth time, and took six from there. All of which adds up to 14. JB Holmes continues his slow climb up the rankings. He joins clubhouse leader Shane Lowry in second place, following his birdie at 12 with another at 14. This one’s the reward for rolling in a 30-footer.A garden-variety par for Brooks Koepka coming up the last, and he signs for a 68. He’s the tenth player to do so today. Chances are he won’t be the last. Bogey for Louis Oosthuizen, though, and the 2010 champ settles for a slightly disappointing 70. Shots gone at 16 and 18. And par for great young Indian hope Shubhankar Sharma the 22-year-old cards an almost-Faldoesque card of 17 pars and a birdie at 13. He’s -1, and looks happy enough with his day’s work.Tommy Fleetwood isn’t far away from draining a 60-footer across 18 to finish like Kiradech Aphibarnrat. But he’s happy enough with par, and that’s a blemish-free round of 68. He’s in the big group at -3. Meanwhile Justin Rose keeps pootling along in steady fashion, with a birdie at 12. He’s -1.Many thanks to David. So before we concentrate on the live action, another quick word on Ryan Fox’s record-breaking back nine at the Open of 29. He birdied every hole from 12 to 18, with the exception of Calamity, the par-three 16th. The previous record of 30 was set by Eric Brown at Lythan in 1958, and has since been matched by Tommy Nakajima (1986 Troon), Ross Drummond (Muirfield 1987), Mark Brooks (Turnberry 1994), Phil Mickelson (St Andrews 2000), Stuart Appelby (Muirfield 2002), Kenichi Kuboya (Turnberry 2009), Rory McIlroy (St Andrews 2010) and Justin Rose (last year at Carnoustie). He’s -3 ... which is now two off the lead, because Jon Rahm has made it three birdies in a row, at 9. He turns in 31 (which seeing we’re on the subject, is three shots shy of the Open front-nine record, 28, set by Denis Durnian at Birkdale in 1983).While Tyrrell Hatton’s team tell him it was a great day really, Tiger continues to leak oil. He’s reached the turn in +6 and that’s so bad it’s one worse than Rory managed on the front nine. Back to the top and Rahm sets up another birdie chance, this one from about 20 feet at 9. It must definitely be getting chillier as Rahm has boosted his outerware with a gilet.Righty, on that note I shall hand you back to a refreshed Scott Murray.In a blink of an eye, the four-way tie for the lead is halved. Hatton’s bogey at 18 is expected but Koepka’s at 17 is not. Par putts from four feet in majors are gimmes for the American but he pushes this one right and it doesn’t even touch the hole. His first mistake of the day leaves Lowry and Rahm - both Irish Open winners - in tied first.Tyrrell Hatton nearly got through 18 holes without blowing a fuse but the lid has come off at the last. He hacks out of the rough, looks furious and we’re just grateful there’s not a big branch and a red mini in the vicinity. After clearing his head and possibly counting to ten, Hatton plays a solid approach to 20 feet so could still escape with a par. Ryan Fox, so cruelly beaten by two monster putts from Russell Knox (Knox sinks Fox) in the Irish Open two years ago, has come home in 29! What a response from the Kiwi after a 3-over 39 on the front nine. Back at 7 and Rahm completes the job by rolling in his birdie putt to join Lowry, Hatton and Koepka in a tie for first place on -4.Rahm’s charge continues. The Spaniard has his tail up, flighting an approach to 8 which grabs and sucks back to about four feet. Some real action on that ball which highlights the soft conditions. Another squally shower passes through but it’s a brief appearance with minimal inconvenience.Tyrrell Hatton joins the lead! The Englishman makes it a three-way tie at the top by draining a 20-footer across the green at 17. A birdie at 18 will give him the new clubhouse lead although that’s a big ask given how it’s playing. With the weather calming again, more and more afternoon starters are infiltrating the leaderboard and among those at -3 now is double Irish Open champion Jon Rahm thanks to a birdie at 7.The sweet-swinging Louis Oosthuizen cruises to -3 and just one off the pace. The South African won the Open at St Andrews in 2010 and lost a play-off at the Old Course in 2015 but he’s not managed another top 15 in his other seven starts in this event. Favourite Oosthuizen fact: he celebrated his 2010 Open win by buying a tractor for his farm. I’m sure many of us would have done the same.With a quadruple-bogey at 1, Rory found a spectacular way to get to +4 but Tiger Woods has arrived there more by slow death. He looks cold, weary and out of synch. Tiger opened steadily enough but has slid down to tied 120th with a run of bogey, double bogey, bogey at 5, 6 and 7. Tiger can still strut his stuff at Augusta National on a Sunday but can he do it on rainy evening in Ireland on a Thursday, asked the critics? Not so far it would seem. Tyrrell Hatton comes within a whisker of joining Lowry and Koepka at the top of the charts. His pitch over a valley checks up on its second bounce and does a little dance around the hole, just failing to topple in. The Englishman is a two-time winner of the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship and has been showing signs of a return to form in recent weeks. He stays one back and in a big tie for third which includes Tommy Fleetwood. Tyrrell and Tommy, a pair of cheeky scamps, possibly from the 1940s. Koepka hits a lovely second into the 15th and has a 15-footer to take the lead on his own. In theory, this is the stretch of the course where Royal Portrush bites back. Looking at the hardest holes on the course today, the 18th is ranked second (4.37) while 15, 16 and 17 are sixth, fourth and third respectively. Not that Koepka will be bothered. Brooks Koepka shares the lead in another major. Wow. The guy is so serene he must have a TV in every room. One for Monkees fans there. Yep, Koepka is at it again, sauntering along and, before you know, hitting top spot without appearing to do that much. For the first time in many an hour, Shane Lowry has company at the top.Hello again from Royal Portrush just as one of those pesky squally showers passes through. It’s been t-shirt weather for a while but caddies are reaching into bags for raingear. The good thing is these little bursts don’t last long and the weather looks pretty decent for the rest of the day.Jordan Spieth made bogey at 11. Coming hot off the heels of that double at 8, he’d wiped out all his early gains and was back at level par. But the chap from Dallas is made of strong stuff, and he’s instantly bounced back with birdie at 12 to move back into red figures. Incidentally, apologies for mistakenly referring to Spieth as simply “he” when reporting that double on 8. Fixed that now. Many thanks to a couple of friendly eagle-eyed readers for spotting the error, including blood pressure’s Alan Hardy, who spluttered: “It would have been nice if you’d told us who the ‘he’ you were referring to is at 15.38 actually was. Yes, I know it’s Jordan Spieth, but I wish I didn’t have to do the research for you highly paid ‘journalists’.” Blimey. That’s me told. I haven’t seen anyone get so hot under the collar about the use of a pronoun since the emergence of Jordan Peterson.And with that, I’m going to sit on the naughty step in my hairshirt for a while. David Tindall will be your loving guide while I repent.Patrick Cantlay posted top-ten finishes at the Masters and the PGA. His quest for another high finish at a major looks to be starting well, with birdies at 2 and 5. He’s -2. Matt Kuchar is gong round with him, and he’s done exactly the same thing, step by step. And birdie for Justin Thomas, who has responded to slipping to three over through 4 with birdies at 5, 9, 10 and now 14. He’s -1 and just three off the lead!Even the greatest can thin a chip straight through the green. And that’s what Tiger’s just done from the bottom of the hill to the side of 6. The ball initially threatens to snag on a hairy hillock, before toppling back down another swale. He does extremely well to bump up to six feet, but he can’t knock in the bogey putt. A double, and that’s three shots shed in two holes. He’s +3.Brooks Koepka spurns a fine chance to grab himself a share of the lead at 13, having knocked his tee shot to six feet. That was always heading left, most uncharacteristically. He stays at -3. Erik van Rooyen meanwhile tugs at a short one on 15, and he slips back to -2.Another birdie for Tyrrell Hatton! This one comes at 14, and he’s the latest of the later starters to join the ever-growing group a shot behind the leader Shane Lowry at -3. Back on the par-three 6th, Tiger pulls his tee shot into the deep swale to the left of the green. That’ll be a testing up and down. The 15-time major winner’s post-Augusta malaise continues ... for now, anyway. There’s always time.Dustin finally gets his flat stick going! A lovely tee shot at 6, over the flag to eight feet, and he guides in the putt. He returns to level par. Tiger however makes a terrible error with the putter on 5, leaving a 40-foot birdie effort 12 feet short. The greens are running at around 10 on the stimp, not exactly PGA Tour speeds, but there’s no excuse for that. The mistake costs Tiger a shot, and he slips to +1.A couple of big rakes. Erik van Rooyen tickles in a long downhill effort on 14, while Tommy Fleetwood converts from distance at 13. Birdies that take both men to -3. They’re alongside Brooks Koepka, who nearly drains an eagle putt on 12. Instead he taps in to calmly rise up an increasingly exciting leaderboard.Lee Westwood has finished second at the Open on one occasion (2010), third twice (2009 and 2013) and fourth once (2004). Throw in a tie for tenth back in 1997, and there are a lot of what-ifs in a Montgomeriesque career. If he wants to land that elusive major, his time is running out: he’s 46 years old. That might explain the zeal with which he’s begun his round today. Responding to bogey at 4, he’s carded three birdies in a row, at 5, 6 and 7. He’s -2!When Dustin Johnson putts well, he’s practically unstoppable. But he’s not putting well. Having fired a long putt miles past the hole at 4, leading to a three-putt bogey, he leaves an eagle putt ten feet short at 5, having driven the green. The par putt inevitably drifts by the left of the cup. He remains at +1. Meanwhile back to back birdies for Thomas Pieters, at 12 and 13. The big Belgian is -2.A cool start to the week for everyone’s favourite entertaining hothead Tyrrell Hatton. Birdies at 5 and now 12 have whisked him up the standings to -2. The 27-year-old Ryder Cup hero from High Wycombe already has a top-five finish at the Open to his name. He’d have been just two off winner JB Holmes at Troon in 2016, if you factor out Henrik Stenson and Phil Mickelson, that is, on account of their playing another tournament. Anyway, he takes his good form from last week’s Scottish Open to the Antrim coast.Justin Rose drops back to level par after a wild tee shot at 4 forces him to take a drop. Dustin Johnson also finds himself heading the wrong way: after opening with three pars, he trundles a heavy handed putt 15 feet past the flag, and can’t save himself coming back. He’s +1.Birdie for Jon Rahm at 2. He’s -1, as is Tony Finau , who makes one at 4. Tiger sticks his tee shot at 3 to eight feet, but can’t make his birdie putt and that’s three pars in a row. Birdies at 8, 9 and 10 for the former Masters champion Danny Willett! He’s -3 already, just one off Shane Lowry’s lead. Willett has a decent if not spectacular record at the Open: a tie for sixth in 2015, and a tie for 15th in 2013. It’d be lovely to see him finish high this week, putting an end to his elongated post-Augusta comedown.More from a downcast Rory McIlroy. “I didn’t hit it well enough, I didn’t put it in the right positions. I put myself behind the eight-ball from the start. I thought if I could have got home and shot, maybe, two over par for the day, I could have still been in the tournament. But obviously the finish derailed that a little bit. I’ve always said I always get nervous on the first tee, whether it’s the Open at Portrush or any other tournament. I’m always anxious to get going. But it almost settled me down: I can’t get off to a worse start, so you may as well get your head down and keep trying. The support was fantastic, I really appreciated it. A rough start and a rough finish, and it adds up to a pretty dreadful score.” Hats off to him for coming out and answering those questions - there are many sports stars who wouldn’t - especially as he looked utterly dejected, his dream of winning the Open on home soil up in smoke. A thoroughly depressing watch. Ah well, he’ll always have Hoylake.Say what you like about Rory McIlroy, he always comes out to talk to his public. Here he is, talking to Sky after that horror-show 79. “Obviously when you play the first and last holes in a combined seven over par, you’re making life tough for yourself! I was understandably nervous on the first tee. I hit a bad tee shot OB. Got a bad lie with the second and had to take an unplayable, obviously it wasn’t the ideal start. But after that I felt I battled back and showed some resilience. A couple of birdies, then held it together in some difficult conditions at the start of the back nine. But I lost concentration a bit after the missed par putt on 16, and then hit a tee shot a couple of yards offline on 18 and got a dreadful lie. So it was one of those days.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aec97e9e3d06571577d025708275647326617b56/0_2761_2320_1390/master/2320.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=70a4f392b0a7337c58c0b1c3dea4ba40","title":"whats the best mini laptop for youtube and writing reports","story":"Peter wants a mini-laptop to go with his old BlackBerry phone. What are his options? I’m old-school now at 71, but I’m still designing and working as a consultant. I had nothing but BlackBerry smartphones for years. Then it all went wrong. My boring Samsung J-something does most things but I miss my BlackBerry. I found an old one in a drawer, and it fits nicely in my pocket when off out. However, when I’m in a coffee place or relaxing, I’d like a big screen for YouTube, WhatsApp links, and writing reports. I’m thinking of rebooting my nice small BlackBerry and putting a smallish mini-laptop in my bag. Any thoughts? PeterBlackBerry lost its premier position in the market – when its phones were used by everyone from Paris Hilton to then US president Barack Obama – but you can still buy BlackBerry phones. The company licensed its name and technology to China’s TCL Communication Technology Holdings Limited (TCT), which sells phones under the TCL, BlackBerry Mobile and Alcatel brand names. It also makes TV sets, soundbars, headphones, air conditioners and dehumidifiers. (The BlackBerry name has also been used by Optiemus Infracom, selling phones as BlackBerry Mobile India, and BB Merah Putih, which briefly served the Indonesian market.)In 2013, BlackBerry tried to replace its original operating system with a new version, BlackBerry 10, based on the QNX operating system it bought in 2010. This is used in the BlackBerry Classic and BlackBerry Passport smartphones. However, in 2015, it started to move to Google Android with the Priv and DTEK50 models.You can still buy BlackBerry Mobile phones in the UK, including ones with physical keyboards, but they all run Android. While they have security and other features that could appeal to businesses, consumers can buy faster Android phones with bigger screens for less money.In the good old days, many of us carried Palm and Compaq iPaq PDAs (personal digital assistants) that enabled us to work on the move. The Psion Series 5 was a classic because it had such a good keyboard. The last one I had was, I think, an HP Jornada 720 with a 6.5in colour screen. It was great for writing, and much less cumbersome than my old Filofax.I don’t think PDAs will ever retake the mass market, because large smartphones and small tablets have filled that hole. However, there is still some interest in mini-laptops, which can now reach enthusiasts via Kickstarter and Indiegogo campaigns.The Gemini PDA, from UK-based Planet Computers, is an attempt to recreate something like the Psion Series 5. The basic machine does the same job for £499 – you can type while on the move – but there’s a £599 version that also works as a 4G smartphone.The Gemini has a 6in screen and runs Android, so it could be a good alternative to a standard Android phone with a 6in to 6.5in screen and a Bluetooth keyboard. It also dual-boots to Linux, so you can run full web browsers and productivity software such as LibreOffice. Unfortunately for those of us who live in Microsoft Office, it doesn’t run Windows 10, which is a bit of a shame as Microsoft’s operating system is free on small-screen devices.All of these mini-laptops have a screen resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels, so they can run Windows 10 properly. (Old-style 7in netbooks – popular between 2007 and 2011 – had 1024 x 768-pixel screens.) But you would have to use scaling to make text comfortable to read.Netbooks succeeded because the versions with 7in screens, 1GB of memory and a cut-price version of Windows XP were familiar enough to be accessible, and they were cheap. However, most people wanted bigger screens – they quickly increased to about 10in – more memory and more storage. This closed the price gap to “proper” laptops, and the netbook market collapsed.Most of today’s mini-laptops and convertibles now have even bigger screens, typically from 11.6in to 14in. I have 10.1in, 11.6in and 12in convertibles, and I’ve found that the combination of the extra screen area and higher resolution makes a worthwhile difference to usability. However, at 12in and above, you start to lose portability.Any of these would slip in your bag, while also being capable of doing real work writing reports.Have you got a question?

We have it now. Yet the mobile phone operators are going to pick off the low-hanging fruit, the middle class,” she said. “They are not going to go the extra mile to help the poor or women. We are already seeing these gaps that are going to set back women’s empowerment.“We know from good research that when a woman has her own digital financial bank account, she often moves from the informal farming sector to the formal entrepreneurial sector. When they have assets in their hands, women often invest differently from their husbands. They invest in health and their kids’ education. When women are empowered, economies are lifted out of poverty.“Yet too many women are stuck in the era of the moneylender and the forced chicken sale.”The Gates Foundation argues that as the technology revolution is only just taking root in Africa, the opportunity still exists to shape a modern financial system from its foundations to include and empower everyone.“The old financial system was built to exclude. It excluded the poor, whose transactions were too small to matter. It excluded the rural, who lived too far away from bank branches. It excluded women, whose husbands were supposed to make the decisions,” Gates wrote in the paper to the G7. “It is very hard to retrofit an exclusive system to be inclusive.”Barriers that need addressing include the extent of mobile phone coverage, the inter-operability of technology, proof of identity, regulation and laws that exclude women.Bruno Le Maire, the French finance minister and host of the G7, said all these reforms needed backing. “Giving women access to a bank account is key to faster growth in the poorest countries. Our theme at the G7 is addressing inequalities, and this helps,” he said.Although by the end of 2018 nearly 250 million Africans subscribe to the mobile internet, more than three-quarters – 750 million – were still offline, including more than 400 million people for whom there is no mobile broadband.One of the key historic barriers to financial inclusion identified in the report is the relatively primitive type of mobile banking system that only allows money to be transferred between users of the same mobile service.As a result, the majority of digital transactions are still peer-to-peer money transfers within the same network.This means, the report says, “a healthcare worker who receives her wages in a closed-loop mobile money account is likely to withdraw funds in cash – often travelling long distances and incurring fees – to buy food for her family, pay her bills, and send money to her son who lives in a neighbouring country”.The report also suggests difficulties need to be overcome to ensure secure proof of identification, an issue the UK chancellor, Philip Hammond, will highlight at the G7 by offering £15m to help fund a World Bank initiative on secure ID systems.Cultural or religious resistance to women’s financial independence is a further barrier, the report says. In Cameroon, Chad, Gabon and Niger formal regulations exist that prevent women from opening a bank account in the same way as men. “All countries have reasons culturally or historically to hold women back,” Gates said. “It takes forward-thinking people at the top and at the grassroots to lead change.”The Gates team believes the digital revolution is not so advanced in Africa that the emerging inequalities are irreversible. Nearly half of people in sub-Saharan Africa who are paid a salary receive their wages in cash, and less than a third pay utility bills through an account.The potential future scale of the transformation is startling. The consultants McKinsey estimate that by 2025 digital financial services could allow 1.6 billion people worldwide to enter the formal economy and could add $3.7tn to the annual GDP of emerging markets.Digital financial inclusion could create nearly 95m new jobs and provide up to $2.1tn in loans for iniduals to start businesses."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f920d21b987483d07d38dbe149142b116c9a03d/0_0_6570_3942/master/6570.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b1a5050d8db31daaee014920db23d605","title":"british football fan ali issa ahmad detained in uae lodges un human rights complaint","story":"Ali Issa Ahmad brings case to UN alleging he was tortured after wearing Qatar T-shirt to matchA British football fan who says he was detained and tortured while on holiday in the United Arab Emirates because he wore a Qatar shirt has lodged a legal complaint with the UN about his treatment.In the 27-page complaint, Ali Issa Ahmad, 26, from Wolverhampton, documents his alleged torture at the hands of the UAE authorities in January and February of this year while he was visiting the country to watch Asian Cup matches.He alleges that the ill-treatment included electric shocks during interrogation, stabbings, deprivation of food, water and sleep, and racist abuse. He claims he was called “fucking black”, “donkey” and “dog”. Ahmad also alleges he was punched in the face, knocking out one of his teeth, and had a plastic bag placed over his head for several minutes.In a letter to the UN human rights high commissioner, his lawyer Rodney Dixon QC said Ahmad’s treatment in the UAE breached his human rights including freedom of expression, the right not to be tortured and the right not to be arbitrarily arrested and detained, the  understands.The UN has been asked to intervene in previous cases involving prisoners of conscience. But it is highly unusual for an ordinary football fan to approach the UN and ask it to intervene with a national government in this way.Ahmad has called on the UN to ensure that the UAE provides an effective remedy for his suffering, including compensation.Last week he lodged a complaint with Fifa claiming it had breached its human rights policy by failing to protect him while he was watching a match. Ahmad has also asked the UK Foreign Office to investigate his case.Ahmad’s problems began after a match between Iraq and Qatar on 22 January 2019 at the Al Nahyan stadium in Abu Dhabi. Ahmad says he was approached by UAE security officials because he was wearing a T-shirt with a Qatari logo on it.He says he was unaware that in June 2017, after UAE formally severed links with Qatar, UAE’s attorney general had announced that showing sympathy for Qatar was punishable with three to 15 years in jail.Ahmad said: “Nobody should ever have to suffer what I did simply for wearing a T-shirt with a flag of a country on it.”Dixon, the head of Ahmad’s legal team, said: “It is a disgrace that Ali was tortured so cruelly and gratuitously while attending an international football tournament in the UAE. No football fan should have to endure this kind of inhuman and racist treatment.”The UAE denies Ahmad’s claims of being tortured. A UAE official accused him of lying and “attention-seeking” and said Ahmad had been charged with wasting police time and giving false statements.The official said: “He was categorically not arrested for wearing a Qatar football shirt. This is instead an instance of a person seeking media attention and wasting police time.”Ahmad is not the only British citizen to have experienced arrest and detention in the UAE.

Iran did confirm on Tuesday, without naming Riah, that it had helped tow an unidentified ship in distress, but gave no further details.The Revolutionary Guards said in the latest statement that the vessel had been impounded “with an order from the court as we found out that it was smuggling fuel” to foreign ships. The ship is capable of carrying 2m litres and had 12 crew on board. It said it had not impounded any other ship.It is possible that the seizure of the ship is nothing more than a routine piece of Iranian maritime intelligence work, but in the current heightened tensions, western diplomats will fear it is Iranian diplomatic pressure.Giorgos Beleris, Oil Research Manager for Refinitiv, said that although Riah was small for a tanker and could dock easily, it had been recently operating at anchorages. “This could hint at something potentially shady - we can’t be certain,” he said.The UK Foreign Office said it was seeking further information on the ship and insisted that freedom of navigation was paramount.The Iranian seizure could be seen as a tit-for-tat reaction to the seizure of the Iranian-owned and Indian-crewed Grace 1 tanker a fortnight ago by Royal Marines off Gibraltar.The British foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, is holding talks on Thursday with Gibraltar’s first minister, Fabian Picardo, to discuss what to do about the ship.In telephone talks at the weekend with the Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, Hunt offered to release the ship if there was an undertaking that the ship’s oil would not be taken to Syria, a country that is subject to EU sanctions.The Iranians have said the ship was not bound for Syria, but has refused to name its planned destination..Tensions between the US and Iran have soared, with Washington dispatching warships to the Gulf, and Tehran threatening to resume higher uranium enrichment.John Bolton announces the deployment of the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group and a bomber task force in response to \u0027a number of troubling and escalatory indications and warnings\u0027.Iran vows to enrich its uranium stockpile closer to weapons-grade levels if world powers fail to negotiate new terms for its nuclear deal. The US responds by imposing sanctions on Iran\u0027s metals industry. A day later the EU urges Iran to respect the nuclear deal and says it plans to continue trading with the country despite US sanctions.\u0026nbspThe UAE says four commercial ships off its eastern coast \u0027were subjected to sabotage operations\u0027.Yemen\u0027s Houthi rebels launch a drone attack on Saudi Arabia, striking a major oil pipeline and taking it out of service.Saudi Arabia blames Iran for the drone attack on its pipeline.A rocket lands near the US embassy in the Iraqi capital, Baghdad, without harming anyone. It\u0027s not clear who is behind the attack, but after the initial reports, Donald Trump tweets: \u0027If Iran wants to fight, that will be the official end of Iran. Never threaten the United States again!\u0027Senior Pentagon officer Vice-admiral Michael Gilday says the US has a high degree of confidence that Iran\u0027s Revolutionary Guards were responsible for the explosions on the four tankers in the Gulf of Oman.Saudi Arabia says 26 people were wounded in an attack by Yemen\u0027s Houthi rebels on an airport in the kingdom\u0027s south-western town of Abha.Two oil tankers near the strategic strait of Hormuz were reportedly attacked in an assault that left one ablaze and adrift as 44 sailors were evacuated from both vessels and the US navy assisted.Iran’s Revolutionary Guards say they have shot down what they called a US \u0027spy\u0027 drone they claim was flying in in the country’s airspace. The US military confirm one of its drones has been taken down, but say it was in international airspace.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspDonald Trump reportedly gives approval for the US military to launch strikes on Iran in retaliation for the loss of the drone, before pulling back at the last minute.The Iranian and US presidents trade insults, with Hassan Rouhani suggesting that Donald Trump suffered from a “mental disorder” and Trump once more threatening Iran with “obliteration”.Iran summons UK ambassador over an incident off Gibraltar as Royal Marines seize a tanker the UK suspects of carrying oil to Syria.The UK government says three Iranian boats were warned off by the frigate HMS Montrose after Iranian boats \u0027attempted to impede\u0027 a British oil tanker in strait of Hormuz. Tehran denies involvement.Iran says it has seized a foreign oil tanker in the Gulf. A report on state TV says the ship was smuggling oil but does not say which country crew are from.The UK is deeply sceptical of the Iranian explanation and is awaiting a clear undertaking that the ship will not be sailing to Syria.Unlike the US, the UK has no general policy of trying to block Iranian oil sales, but Tehran regards the British action as part of an attempt to support the US campaign to reduce Iranian oil exports to zero.The disputes over the ships are all part of wider manoeuvring between Iran, Europe and the US over the future of the Iran nuclear deal signed in 2015 and known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPoA).Donald Trump pulled the US out of the deal a year ago, saying its terms did not restrict Iran from acquiring a nuclear bomb, but the Europeans have continued to back the deal.Iran has started to lessen its commitments to JCPOA in the past month in protest at what it regards as Europe’s failure to set up an effective trading mechanism between Iran and Europe to maintain trade. An increase in trade with Europe was always seen by Iran as a central benefit of signing up to the restrictions imposed in the nuclear deal.The seizure of the latest ship, following a series of attacks and interruptions of shipping over the last fortnight in the Gulf, will put the issue of maritime security in the strait of Hormuz back at the heart of international discussions.In the last months there have been six unattributed attacks on Gulf shipping as well as an attempt to intercept a British ship in the Gulf a fortnight ago.The US has sent advanced fighter jets and thousands of extra troops into the Middle East, while attacks on oil tankers and the shooting down of a US military surveillance drone by Iran have added to the fears of armed conflict.The US has been pushing for an internationally coordinated maritime force to accompany cargo through the strait, and Bahrain has agreed to hold a conference to develop these plans. The Bahrain conference is not due to be held until October and as many as 60 nations are due to attend.Referring to the US plans to install surveillance and protection for ships passing through the Gulf, Brian Hook, the US special representative on Iran, said that Washington has already sent an aircraft carrier and B-52 bombers to the region, adding, “the move has disrupted and deterred much of what we feared” with Iranian plots in the area.Hook said he would meet ambassadors on Friday to promote the US plan to build a maritime coalition to deter further attacks on oil tankers in the Gulf."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2658c1306250cb4d6744ccf77a81dc0604e838d1/0_76_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0e5474835f04a302303277e767c3b9af","title":"ursula von der leyen no deal brexit would be massive blow for both sides","story":"Exclusive: newly elected EU chief suggests there could be emergency help for IrelandThe European commission’s new president has said a hard Brexit would have “massively negative consequences” for both Britain and the EU, and said Brussels could provide emergency help for nations such as Ireland that bear the brunt of such an outcome.In her first interview since narrowly being approved for the post by the European parliament on Tuesday, Ursula von der Leyen said the withdrawal deal concluded between Theresa May and the commission’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michael Barnier, would remain the basis of any future talks.“We don’t want a hard Brexit, it’s a bad outcome for both sides. We have a good withdrawal agreement,” she said in an exclusive interview with the  and four other European newspapers.Both of the contenders to succeed May, Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt, have vowed to renegotiate the exit deal with the EU, declaring that the most controversial component, the Northern Ireland backstop, is unacceptable.When asked about their position, Von der Leyen said the withdrawal agreement was “not dead”. She said: “No, it is a good agreement, which was negotiated properly in accordance with the red lines drawn by the British government.”She reiterated her view that the EU should consider extending the current Brexit deadline of 31 October if there were “good reasons” to do so. “A Brexit without a deal comes with massively negative consequences for both sides, not to mention what it means for Ireland. That’s why we need to do everything to strive for an orderly Brexit. And that’s why if there are good reasons for an extension coming from our British friends, I am open to listening to them.”She added: “It would be wrong to see Brexit only as the end of something. The way in which we carry out Brexit will determine our future relationship to our neighbour the United Kingdom. For both sides it is of the highest interest that there is an orderly and good beginning to our future relationships.”In a wide-ranging interview conducted inside the defence ministry in Berlin that she presided over for six years, Von der Leyen told the Europa group of newspapers that the EU would show solidarity with member states hardest hit by a disorderly British exit.In 2012, six major European newspapers came together to launch joint editorial projects to dig deeper into pan-European issues, understand the EU better and investigative the good and bad things emerging from the continent. Since then, we have jointly investigated the environment, youth unemployment, Brexit, immigration, euroscepticism, the eurozone the Brussels bureaucracy - and even the legacies of the first world war. We have interviewed prime ministers and presidents, as well as a host of EU leaders, and will continue our efforts long after Britain has left the EU.The six papers are , Le Monde, Süddeutsche Zeitung, La Vanguardia, La Stampa and Gazeta WyborczaShe said a European unemployment benefit reinsurance scheme, modelled on measures put in place in Germany to cushion the blow of the world financial downturn a decade ago, could be rolled out across the bloc of 27 nations.In 2008 the German government prevented massive job cuts through a state-subsidised programme to finance reduced working hours. “We can apply this idea to the whole of Europe,” said Von der Leyen. “Should an external shock such as a disorderly Brexit hit two or three countries particularly hard, for example, the unemployment reinsurance scheme could come into force.”One recent report said a no-deal Brexit could do massive harm, especially to the economy in Ireland where it could cost £6bn and lead to an estimated increase in unemployment of 50,000 to 55,000.Asked whether Ireland could be one of the countries to benefit from such emergency help in the case of a no-deal Brexit, Von der Leyen said: “I can’t predict that. But it is right for Europe to help the member states who are hit hardest.”A mother of seven who has held ministerial posts under the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, since 2005, Von der Leyen became the commission’s first female president-elect on Tuesday, winning a vote in the European parliament with the support of 383 MEPs, only nine votes more than required to secure an absolute majority. Critics say the vote has left her at the mercy of nationalists and populists in Poland and Italy who supported her candidacy.“The work is only about to begin,” she said. “In my debates with the political groups and national delegations I came across a lot of openness for constructive collaboration, also from the Green parties. Climate change, digitalisation, the economy, Brexit, security, trade, migration – we have work to do.”Von der Leyen, a Christian Democrat, said she believed action on climate to be of the utmost urgency. “The worst-case scenario will come about if we don’t act with determination, namely rapidly intensifying climate change with all its consequences. The clock is ticking, and we have to act.”She added: “Polluting the environment has to come at a price, which will bring about a change in our behaviour and a lowering of CO2 emissions. If you compare it to the rest of the world, then our industry is already doing well at climate-friendly technology, but we have to get better.“But if industry modernises, we also have to protect it from cheap imports produced in environmentally harmful ways outside Europe’s borders. In coal-heavy regions, especially in central and eastern Europe, we have to support the transition to new clean branches of the economy and protect jobs.”Ursula von der Leyen, born in 1958, is the daughter of Heidi and Ernst Albrecht, the latter having been a senior politician in the centre-right Christian Democratic Union who rose to be governor of the state of Lower Saxony.She spent the first 12 years of her life in Brussels, where her father was serving as a commission official. She studied economics at the universities of Göttingen and Münster before attending the London School of Economics where she used the pseudonym Rose Ladson because she was seen as a potential target for West German leftwing extremists.Von der Leyen then read for a medical degree, becoming a gynaecologist, and only entered politics at 42. A mother of seven, she has held government positions as labour and family affairs minister, driving forward key policies on gender quotas for company boards and improved maternity and paternity pay and rights – policies that initially won her considerable popularity.In 2011, Von der Leyen spoke of her desire for a “United States of Europe along the lines of federal states like Switzerland,\u0026nbspGermany\u0026nbspor the US”. She has since claimed that Brexit, and the loss of the “pragmatism” of the British in the EU, should propel the bloc towards further integration, and has voiced support for a European army.She is a key ally of Angela Merkel, with whom she has worked since 2005. Like Merkel, she has championed the idea of a close relationship between the EU and UK after Brexit.Von der Leyen, though, has been withering about those who campaigned for Brexit, Describing events since the referendum as a “burst bubble of hollow promises … inflated by populists”. She has cautioned that a no-deal Brexit would be the “worst possible start” to the close long-term EU-UK relationship that Berlin holds desirable.The nicknames she has acquired over the course of her 29-year career in German politics tell their own story. During her time in charge of the family ministry, she was first called\u0026nbspKrippen-Ursel\u0026nbsp(“crèche Ursel”), a conservative closet feminist set on expanding nursery places, and then\u0026nbspZensursula, a control freak who wanted to shield German youth from the dark sides of the internet.When she became Germany’s first female defence minister in 2013, her (mostly male) detractors referred to her as\u0026nbspFlinten-Uschi\u0026nbsp(“shotgun Uschi”), a caricature of the bossy career woman.As commission president, Von der Leyen will represent the EU on the world stage, and a key task will be building a working relationship with Donald Trump’s White House. She has previously criticised a lack of strategy in Trump’s approach to Vladimir Putin’s Russia and has suggested the US president’s frosty relationship with Merkel is based on his outdated view of women.She indicated a more nuanced approach towards states such as Poland and Hungary, which have been brazenly challenging the EU consensus on issues such as migration, the rule of law and press freedom.“I think we have to properly listen to the arguments. For example, the Poles make the justified point that they have taken in 1.5 million people from the Ukraine – a country that has for years been the site of a hybrid war in which people are still dying. We must not ignore that. Among Brexiters, Von der Leyen has been characterised as a cartoon Eurocrat intent on building “a centralised, undemocratic, updated form of communism”, as the Brexit party leader, Nigel Farage, said in the parliament. She once told an interviewer that her dream was “a united states of Europe – run along the lines of the federal states of Switzerland, Germany or the USA”.Asked whether her dream had changed since then, she said: “It has become more mature and more realistic. In the European Union we have unity in ersity. That is something different to federalism. I think that is the right path.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Gifts included \u0026lsquohis much travelled hat\u0026rsquo and an LP \u0026lsquobecause of his love of music\u0026rsquoParaic O\u0026rsquoBrien is disappointed by the Minister\u0026rsquos decision to abandon plans for August hedge-cuttingTeenager says her \u0026lsquoinnocence and childhood were taken away\u0026rsquo by her abuserKBC seeking orders requiring McGann siblings to vacate family home in RoscommonCourt of Appeal finds trial judge failed to instruct jury on presumption of innocenceEugenie Houston was \u0026lsquocompletely unjustified\u0026rsquo in description of professional body, judge saysProject will replace older traffic control station in Connolly Station, which is currently at capacityFive-year-old fractured his leg after car park incident with noiseless vehicleEx-member of Irish military went to Syria in 2015, where she is being held with her childNorthern Ireland Affairs Committee of MPs at Westminster to examine criminalityTaoiseach says temporary structures set up at Dublin Airport and Dublin and Rosslare seaportsSides seek adjournment for one week to consider whether to appeal judge\u0026rsquos rulingSince 2009, MEPs can no longer employ close relatives for parliamentary roles\u0026lsquoWe are currently massively unprepared for the climate-driven movement of species\u0026rsquoIreland likely to miss out on temperature extremes but conditions should be warmVaradkar pledge to raise highest tax band would cost \u0026euro2.3bn in a yearOpening of motorway section costing nearly \u0026euro350 million set to end long tailbacks in Co Wexford townUtility will notify customers who appear to be consuming water services excessivelyFianna F\u0026aacuteil leader says next British prime minister must deal with existing Brexit deal"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3960470.1563458592!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit mps pass amendment to prevent suspension of parliament","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMembers of parliament convening for the announcement of voting on the ‘Benn Amendment’ in the House of Commons. Photograph: UK Parliamentary Recording UnitMPs have easily passed a backbench amendment which seeks to block any attempt by a future government to prorogue parliament to ensure a no-deal Brexit, in what is likely to be seen as a pre-emptive strike against Boris Johnson’s authority.The amendment, tabled by a cross-party group led by Labour’s Hilary Benn and the Conservatives’ Alistair Burt, passed by an unexpectedly high margin of 41 votes, with 315 MPs backing it and 274 opposed.One of those to support the measure was culture, media and sport minister Margot James, who resigned from her post to do so. Philip Hammond, the chancellor, was among a reported series of ministers who abstained, despite a maximum three-line whip.Mr Johnson, the clear favourite to be declared winner of the Conservative leadership contest against Jeremy Hunt next week, and thus replace Theresa May as prime minister, has repeatedly refused to rule out using prorogation to ensure a no-deal Brexit on October 31st.The scale of the victory highlights the struggle he will have to impose his will over Brexit, or other subjects, on a Commons without a Tory majority, and where much Conservative internal discipline has broken down.The Benn-Burt plan beefs up earlier amendments made to an otherwise-technical Northern Ireland Bill designed to thwart prorogation, though experts remain split over whether MPs can definitively block this.When the Bill was first considered by the Commons, MPs passed by a single vote an earlier amendment by Tory MP Dominic Grieve intended to make it more difficult for a future government to prorogue, or suspend, parliament to prevent MPs blocking no deal.Mr Grieve’s first amendment would require a minister to report to the Commons every two weeks until December on the progress of talks on restoring the Northern Ireland Assembly – though it remained unclear whether this could be done as a written report, meaning the chamber would not necessarily have to sit.This was later changed via another amendment in the Lords, tabled by David Anderson, a former independent reviewer of terror legislation, with support from Labour and the Liberal Democrats.The new Lords amendment would ensure that the fortnightly reports demanded by Grieve’s amendments would have to be debated within five calendar days of being produced, thus necessitating that the Commons sat.When the Bill returned to the Commons Mr Grieve then added another tweak via a last-minute amendment, intending to increase the power to block prorogation even more.It specified that if ministers could not meet the obligation to update the Commons because it is prorogued or adjourned, parliament must meet on the day necessary to comply with the obligation, and for the following five weekdays.The Bill to which all these were attached was initially a simple one intended to delay elections and budgets for the long-suspended Northern Ireland Assembly and Executive.When it was first in the Commons last week, MPs overwhelmingly passed amendments to it extending the rights of same-sex marriage and abortion to Northern Ireland, the only places in the UK where they are not allowed. New dealMeanwhile, David Lidington, the de facto deputy prime minister, told an instalment of BBC’s Panorama that the EU offered to put Brexit on hold in 2018 for five years and proposed a “new deal for Europe”.The EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, told the same programme that Theresa May and her ministers “never” threatened during negotiations with the EU to take the UK out of the bloc without a deal.Mr Barnier, who insisted the withdrawal agreement was the only way to leave in an “orderly manner”, said the UK would have to “face the consequences” if it crashed out.In the interview with Panorama – recorded in May, before the start of the Conservative leadership contest – Mr Barnier was asked if the prime minister or her negotiators ever mentioned or threatened a no-deal exit.He replied: “No, no, I never listened to such a sentence. Never.”“That is the point.”Downing Street appeared to refute the remarks, saying: “The prime minister was clear both in public and in private that the UK was prepared to leave without a deal.”Mr Selmayr told the same programme the UK was unprepared to leave the EU without a deal.“We have followed the British debate and the British preparations very, very closely and we have seen what has been prepared on our side of the border for a hard Brexit – we don’t see the same level of preparation on the other side of the border.“You would have to establish a lot of authorities in the United Kingdom that you don’t have at this moment in time so I think the European Union have been very well-prepared for that – we could live with a hard Brexit.“We don’t think the same level of preparation is there on the UK side.” – PA"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed really goes recycling rubbish behind scenes","story":"The chaos of Britain’s recycling system is exposed today with hundreds of thousands of tons of waste being redirected to landfill or incinerators.Despite residents sorting their household waste into separate bins, up to half of “recyclable” material is not being recycled in some areas of England, government data shows.It comes as an undercover investigation by The  and Unearthed reveals staff at a recycling centre in London are sending recyclable plastic and paper to be incinerated.Today, The  launches a Zero Waste campaign calling on the Government, local councils and private companies to do more to boost the country’s lacklustre recycling rates.It is backed by Boris Johnson...To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Tory leadership latest: Nearly 50 MPs rebel against Government to stop suspension of parliament Morocco court condemns three to death for killing Scandinavian hikersComment: How the Russians seduced me into handing over my facial fingerprintCyprus detains 12 Israeli men over allegations of gang rape of British teenagerMan finds own amputated leg on cigarette packets without consentMystery surrounds Iran\u0026#39s seizure of oil tanker in Strait of HormuzComment: Betrayed by Chuka the cad, Anna Soubry wallows in self-pity.

She appears to have changed management several times in the last few months. The last known company, KBR Petrochem, could not be reached for comment.The MT Riah, which began her journey on July 5 near a port off the coast of Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, went missing on July 14. The UAE, where Riah is based, has denied she was their vessel, as did the UK.She was then tracked near the coast of Ras al-Khaimah before changing course and travelling north towards Iranian waters, after which it stopped transmitting its signal on Sunday at about 4.30am local time.Around 30 per cent of global seaborne crude passes through the Strait of HormuzIran claimed it came to the assistance of the disabled tanker after detecting a distress call. But no other nation has reported receiving a call.It was also not clear where the oil had come from, or where it was ultimately heading. Tracker MarineTraffic did not have a destination port for the Riah.According to Lloyd’s List Intelligence data the tanker made no port calls over the past year, had 27 days of dark activities and met 55 times with another vessel, and had trading patterns characteristic of clandestine ship-to-ship transfers.It said turning off the automatic identification system, known as “going dark”, is frequently done by tankers loaded with Iranian crude, in order to avoid detection and evade US sanctions.The Riah appeared to be receiving fuel from an unknown source offshore of the UAE, and then transhipping it to other tankers which usually carried it to Somalia or war-torn Yemen.Experts suggested the amount of cargo on board was so insignificant that it was likely Tehran only towed the vessel to put on a show of strength after Britain impounded an Iranian supertanker off Gibraltar earlier this month.Others even suggested it was hoax. “Our analysis right now is that nothing has actually happened,” tweeted TankerTrackers, a company that uses satellite imagery to identify tankers. “This seems to be an attempt to boost the price of oil after the recent news (which Iran denied) that US was in talks with Iran. There is no visual or data evidence to support a vessel being apprehended.”The UK accused Iran of carrying oil meant for the sanctioned Syrian regime, claims Tehran has denied.Days after threatening a response, Revolutionary Guards harassed a British Navy ship in the Strait which had been shadowing a UK oil tanker. The UK Foreign Office said it was seeking further information on the Riah and insisted that freedom of navigation was paramount.Jeremy Hunt, Foreign Secretary, appeared to be attempting to de-escalate tensions by suggesting last weekend that the Grace 1 supertanker could be released if the Islamic Republic could prove it would not end up in Syria.Mr Hunt was in talks with Fabian Picardo, Gibraltar’s first minister, on Thursday to discuss what should be done.President Donald Trump, who has surrounded himself with hawkish advisers on Iran, also looked to be trying to defuse growing tensions.Mr Trump appointed Senator Rand Paul, who is known for his opposition to US interventions abroad, as an emissary to Tehran and asked him to sit down with Mohamed Javid Zarif, Iran’s Foreign Minister in an attempt to reduce tensions.Mr Paul opposed the withdrawal of Washington from the nuclear agreement, while John Bolton, Mr Trump’s national security adviser, has long wanted regime change in Tehran and has urged Mr Trump to keep up “maximum pressure”.Want the best of The  direct to your email and WhatsApp?

It was a miracle, and one made so powerful because it was so very unlikely.It was hailed as an incredible success.\u0026nbspBut the chance of failure was such that authorities had to prepare for the possibility of losing the astronauts.Those preparations offer a humbling insight into how risky that mission was, and how high the stakes were.Probably the most potent document from those preparations is the speech that would have been used to hail the bravery of the astronauts as they were left to their death on the Moon.It was written to announce to the world that the astronauts had been lost, and that the Moon mission was a failure. After it was read, the two astronauts would be given a ceremony something like the burial at sea, but one entirely without precedent.Created with Sketch.

But over time it became public, after being revealed by the man who wrote it, and is now available for the public to read.It was prepared in the case that the astronauts and their moon lander failed to get back to the main craft that was floating around in the Moon\u0027s orbit ready to bring them home, and contained Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin\u0027s\u0026nbspcolleague Michael Collins.Everything you need to know about the Apollo 11 Moon landingIn that case, it was most likely that those pioneering explorers would not lose their lives in a single spectacular moment. Instead, they would most likely be stranded, stuck 250,000 miles from Earth with no way of getting back home.In the end, and despite some very anxious moments, the crew would explore the lunar surface and come back down safely. That meant that, instead of announcing their loss, Nixon could instead share in the astronaut\u0027s success.In one of the most famous moments of the mission, he spoke to them in a phone call that was beamed around the world. He recognised the triumph of their achievement, and wished them safety for their return.Hello, Neil and Buzz, he said during that phone call.\u0026nbspI\u0027m talking to you by telephone from the Oval Room at the White House.And this certainly has to be the most historic telephone call ever made.

Together, these push the economy into recession, with asset prices and the pound falling sharply.The stress test is by no means a worst-case scenario under a no-deal Brexit, it added.\u0026nbspSpeaking at a meeting of G7 finance ministers in Chantilly, France, Chancellor Philip Hammond said: “The report that the OBR have published this morning shows that even in the most benign version of a no-deal exit there would be a very significant hit to the UK economy, a very significant reduction in tax revenues and a big increase in our national debt –\u0026nbspa recession caused by a no-deal Brexit.Created with Sketch.Tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit  Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.There will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersBut that most benign version is not the version that is being talked about by prominent Brexiteers. They are talking about a much harder version which would cause much more disruption to our economy. The OBR is clear that in that less benign version of no-deal, the hit would be much greater, the impact would be much harder, the recession would be bigger. So I greatly fear the impact on our economy and our public finances of the kind of no-deal Brexit that is realistically being discussed now.”Detailing the less drastic IMF scenario it examined, the OBR said the possible recession would start in the fourth quarter of 2019 and last a year.\u0026nbspGDP adjusted for inflation would decline by 2.1 per cent by late 2020, around the same as in the\u0026nbspearly-1990s\u0026nbspeconomic slump and about a third of the fall during\u0026nbspthe financial crisis.The effects of the recession would be long-lasting, with real GDP 4 per cent lower by the middle of 2021 compared with the\u0026nbspOBR\u0027s\u0026nbsplatest economic forecasts released in mid-March, before the last Brexit deadline. Despite a recovery, it would still be\u0026nbsp1.6 per cent smaller by early 2024.Government debt would rise relative to GDP over the next three years and the budget deficit would widen by around £30bn from 2020-21 onwards, the report said.The economy is heading towards the 31 October Brexit deadline already weakened.The latest data and surveys suggest the economy flatlined at best in the second quarter, the OBR said.\u0026nbspSome of this is likely to be a ‘pay-back’ after Brexit-related stock building in the first quarter. But surveys were particularly weak in June, suggesting that the pace of growth is likely to remain weak. This raises the risk that the economy may be entering a full-blown recession.Fears of a no-deal Brexit have risen in the last few days after the two contenders to become Britain\u0027s next prime minister promised to scrap the Irish backstop, deemed indispensable by the EU. Their comments on Tuesday sent the pound to its lowest level against the dollar in more than two years.Additional reporting by Andrew WoodcockOffice for Budget Responsibility\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Alternatives\u0026nbspmust scale up to meet demandClick to followThe IndependentEmma Back has spent three years developing her idea for the\u0026nbspsocial care platform the Equal Care Co-op (or eccoo) and growing the business to a size where it can attract major funding. But unlike other startups vying for the attention of venture capitalists, Back and her co-founders are raising money through community shares on Ethex, which calls itself an ethical crowdfunding platform, and shunning venture capital that would force them to grow as fast as possible to generate returns.“There’s definitely such a thing as having too much money,” Back says. Rather than raising money to employ salespeople, the Equal Care Co-op is raising money to train and employ people within communities to organise and manage care.\u0026nbsp“Other care platforms have massive advertising budgets, so instead of community relationships it’s all about customer conversion,” Back says. “It gives people a transactional perception of their work in the world. We’re not going to be employing salespeople, we will be employing carers and people who understand their community from the ground up. That will make us resilient, not sitting there with a VP of marketing for our community campaign.”Startups are increasingly looking for alternatives to venture capital funding that leads them to choose between selling up, going public\u0026nbspor going bust. Stefano Bernardi, a founder and investor working as an angel scout for Atomico, says there has been some experimentation in alternative models, but nowhere near the scale needed to meet demand from startups. \u0026nbspHow to protect your freedom in the stupid game of capitalismVenture capitalists invested more than £1.19bn in UK startups in the first three months of 2019, according to\u0026nbspKPMG. The money was invested across 161 deals, including £150m for iwoca, a financial technology company, and £58m for\u0026nbspGoCardless, a direct-debit payment company, to expand the company overseas. “Late stage” companies like these two find it much easier to attract investment because they are generally considered to be beyond their startup-phase and have a better-established business model.This means that entrepreneurs who want to grow a business fast and then exit at a profit have a harder time attracting early investment. It can put greater pressure on founders to squeeze margins at the expense of wages, company culture and even the vision that they set out with. The ultimate goal for many – just like Facebook,\u0026nbspUber\u0026nbspand Google before them – is to grow to a size that when they sell or go public, early investors cash out with huge profits.\u0026nbspBut if a company realises it does not have this kind of potential, it cannot back out of a venture capital deal,\u0026nbspBernardi\u0026nbspsays: “If they find that they have a good business but not monopoly-like, they can either close shop or try to scale anyway and then go bust. Not really a great situation.”In June 2018, Guy Singh-Watson, the founder of vegetable box producer Riverford,\u0026nbspsold 74\u0026nbspper cent of his company to employees. The transition\u0026nbspmeans that idends will be\u0026nbsppassed on to staff rather than to external shareholders, giving them an incentive to make the company more productive.\u0026nbspBut it also makes Riverford practically impossible to sell, because it has so many owners – a fact that many young entrepreneurs, eager for venture capitalist funding to grow fast and then cash out, might find shocking.“When I go to London to meet the bright young food brands of the future, before they have even sold their first smoothie or whatever, they are thinking about how they will exit,” Singh-Watson says. “It makes me really depressed and angry. They are just going to build it and sell it. When I started my business, I did it because I wanted to make something worthwhile.”Lisa Ashford, chief executive of\u0026nbspEthex, says younger founders, in particular, are interested in doing business differently. “They want to access capital that can support them in their mission and many of them are shunning the traditional models of raising finance in favour of models where everyone benefits,” Ashford says.Ethex works with organisations that have a social mission. The platform gives them access to 15,000 investors and several investment structures including ISAs, charity bonds and equity. Ashford says: “Venture capital funding can often be about financial performance and short term returns and exit strategies, sometimes to the detriment of the other impact aspirations of an organisation. That’s not what our investors are about.”In the US, Indie.vc is offering startups a route to profitability without venture capital funding. The platform gives entrepreneurs access to revenue-based loans with the option to start buying back shares out of a percentage of their monthly sales after one to three years. Bryce Roberts\u0026nbspsaid that when he founded Indie.vc three years ago, it received two or three applications a week, mostly from venture capital rejects. Now it can get as many as 10 applications a week from companies that have decided not to go down the venture capital route.\u0026nbspRobots are taking over farming faster than expected“We think there is going to be a tsunami of entrepreneurs who have experienced the one-size-fits-all venture model and want to cherry-pick the pieces of it that work for them,” Roberts said in an\u0026nbspinterview\u0026nbspwith\u0026nbspThe New York Times.Forty per cent of millennial consumers polled by Deloitte in 2018 said the goal of business should be to “improve society”. Singh-Watson believes that it’s going to take businesses embracing alternatives to put a stop to the overconsumption associated with capitalism.“Capitalism is destroying our world,” he says. “It’s 25 years since I did my first conference on corporate social responsibility and I don’t think much has happened since. We need something different and we need it fast.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Together, these push the economy into recession, with asset prices and the pound falling sharply.The stress test is by no means a worst-case scenario under a no-deal Brexit, it added.\u0026nbspSpeaking at a meeting of G7 finance ministers in Chantilly, France, Chancellor Philip Hammond said: “The report that the OBR have published this morning shows that even in the most benign version of a no-deal exit there would be a very significant hit to the UK economy, a very significant reduction in tax revenues and a big increase in our national debt –\u0026nbspa recession caused by a no-deal Brexit.Created with Sketch.Tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit  Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.There will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersBut that most benign version is not the version that is being talked about by prominent Brexiteers. They are talking about a much harder version which would cause much more disruption to our economy. The OBR is clear that in that less benign version of no-deal, the hit would be much greater, the impact would be much harder, the recession would be bigger. So I greatly fear the impact on our economy and our public finances of the kind of no-deal Brexit that is realistically being discussed now.”Detailing the less drastic IMF scenario it examined, the OBR said the possible recession would start in the fourth quarter of 2019 and last a year.\u0026nbspGDP adjusted for inflation would decline by 2.1 per cent by late 2020, around the same as in the\u0026nbspearly-1990s\u0026nbspeconomic slump and about a third of the fall during\u0026nbspthe financial crisis.The effects of the recession would be long-lasting, with real GDP 4 per cent lower by the middle of 2021 compared with the\u0026nbspOBR\u0027s\u0026nbsplatest economic forecasts released in mid-March, before the last Brexit deadline. Despite a recovery, it would still be\u0026nbsp1.6 per cent smaller by early 2024.Government debt would rise relative to GDP over the next three years and the budget deficit would widen by around £30bn from 2020-21 onwards, the report said.The economy is heading towards the 31 October Brexit deadline already weakened.The latest data and surveys suggest the economy flatlined at best in the second quarter, the OBR said.\u0026nbspSome of this is likely to be a ‘pay-back’ after Brexit-related stock building in the first quarter. But surveys were particularly weak in June, suggesting that the pace of growth is likely to remain weak. This raises the risk that the economy may be entering a full-blown recession.Fears of a no-deal Brexit have risen in the last few days after the two contenders to become Britain\u0027s next prime minister promised to scrap the Irish backstop, deemed indispensable by the EU. Their comments on Tuesday sent the pound to its lowest level against the dollar in more than two years.Additional reporting by Andrew WoodcockOffice for Budget Responsibility\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don’t let that, or the show’s bland English-language title, put you off – creator Álex Pina has made something special. The heist here, led by a mysterious man known only as The Professor, involves breaking into the Royal Mint of Spain and printing off €2.4 billion. There are even more twists in the show’s 15 episodes than there are hostages. 220 American Vandal (TV series, two seasons, 2017–2018)Part satire of true crime documentaries such as Making a Murderer, part carefully observed portrayal of teenage life, American Vandal was criminally underappreciated during its two season run. It’s been cancelled now, but that doesn’t mean you can’t catch up with it, and then write Netflix a strongly worded email.320 One Day at a Time (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)In stark contrast to the off-beat, low-key comedy that currently rules TV – the kind that provokes a wry smirk rather than a hearty laugh – One Day at a Time is a big, bright sitcom filmed in front of an interminably enthusiastic studio audience. You wouldn’t have thought that the story of a Cuban-American army veteran  nurse  single mother – who suffers from PTSD and depression – would fit into this format, but it does so beautifully, tackling issues of sexuality, racism and sexism in the process.  Based on writer  director Tamara Jenkins’s own fertility struggles, Private Life stars Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti (both giving brilliant performances) as a spiky, loving middle-aged couple desperate to have a baby. They even rope their enthusiastic but irresponsible niece Sadie (Kayli Carter) into the mix, much to the horror of Sadie’s mother (Molly Shannon, turning a potentially repellent character into one worthy of empathy). It’s subtle, restrained and beautifully realised.520 Big Mouth (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Crude, rude, and rife with surprise emissions and bodily functions, animated sitcom Big Mouth is also a sensitive, nuanced deep e into the various horrors of teenagehood. When 12-year-old Andrew Glouberman (John Mulaney) is visited by the hormone monster (Nick Kroll, who voices many of the show’s best characters), he finds his life irreversibly – and seemingly disastrously – changed. Unlike many other puberty-centred comedies, Big Mouth makes as much time for its confused female protagonists as its male ones Maya Rudolph is a delight as the female hormone monster, and look out for Kristen Wiig’s wonderful turn as a talking vagina.  620 Easy (TV series, two seasons, 2016–)Joe Swanberg’s style of defiantly undramatic mumblecore isn’t for everyone, but if you enjoyed his earlier films, Drinking Buddies and Happy Christmas, you’ll find plenty to admire in this anthology comedy-drama series. Big-name stars such as Orlando Bloom and Aubrey Plaza crop up, but Jane Adams – who you might remember from Todd Solondz’s chronically depressing 1998 film Happiness – is the show’s heart, and Marc Maron is its jaded soul.Community’s Gillian Jacobs is brilliant as the prickly, magnetic recovering addict Mickey, who forms an unlikely – and arguably deeply unwise – relationship with her nerdy neighbour Gus (Paul Rust). Despite Gus’s pathological need to be the nice guy, we’re never quite sure who or what we’re rooting for – which is what makes Love such complex, compelling viewing.  In 2016, comedian Patton Oswalt’s wife, the true crime writer Michelle McNamara, died suddenly in her sleep. That subject matter doesn’t exactly scream “stand-up special”, but out of his devastating loss, Oswalt managed to craft something funny and profound. Over the course of an hour, he processes his grief onstage, managing to find humour in the struggle to raise his grieving six-year-old daughter alone.920 Santa Clarita Diet (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Granted, this horror-comedy – which stars Drew Barrymore as a neurotic real estate agent who suddenly develops a taste for human flesh – is really silly, and really, really disgusting. But it’s also strangely charming, and funny. Timothy Olyphant is excellent as Sheila’s frazzled husband Joel, and the pair’s idiosyncratic but respectful relationship with their smart teenage daughter Abby (Liv Hewson) isn’t quite like anything else on TV right now.1020 Dark Tourist (TV series, one season, 2018–)New Zealand journalist David Farrier is an unlikely TV presenter in the same way that Louis Theroux is – in just about every scenario in which he finds himself, he’s a little bit awkward. But as with Theroux, Farrier’s weakness is actually his strength, allowing him to endear himself to the many unusual people he meets on his journey through the world’s most questionable tourist destinations. Farrier’s stops include the site of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the road where JFK was assassinated, and the Milwaukee suburbs where serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer murdered his victims.1120 Sacred Games (TV series, one season, 2018–)Based on Vikram Chandra’s epic 2006 novel, Netflix’s first Indian original series is a slowly unfolding gem. The first season of Sacred Games – which follows a troubled police officer (Saif Ali Khan) who has 25 days to save his city thanks to a tip-off from a presumed dead gangster – only covered one quarter of Chandra’s 1,000-page novel. As the show itself declared when it announced the forthcoming second season, “the worst is yet to come”.When the trailer for Dumplin’ first landed, it seemed all the ingredients were in place for a film that was at worst tone-deaf, and at best vaguely patronising. Thank heavens, then, that the trailer did Dumplin’ such a disservice. Starring Danielle Macdonald (who broke out in the excellent 2017 film Patti Cake$) as Willowdean, a self-described “fat girl” who enters a local pageant to annoy her former beauty queen mother (Jennifer Aniston), Dumplin’ is as funny, warm and sensitive as its protagonist – and with a killer Dolly Parton-laden soundtrack to boot.1320 Dark (TV series, one season, 2017–)This sci-fi thriller – which features disappearing children, a mysterious local power plant, and scenes set in the Eighties – has, for obvious reasons, drawn comparisons to Stranger Things. But Dark is even more beguiling and (true to its name) less family-friendly than Stranger Things.1420 The Death and Life of Marsha P Johnson (Film, 2017)Though it’s been somewhat tarnished by claims that director David France appropriated the work and research of trans film-maker Reina Gossett, this documentary is nonetheless a loving, respectful tribute to gay rights activist Marsha P Johnson. One of the key figures in the Stonewall uprising (though her involvement was almost entirely eradicated in 2015’s critically hated Stonewall), Johnson modelled for Andy Warhol, performed onstage with drag group Hot Peaches, helped found the Gay Liberation Front, and then died under suspicious circumstances in 1992.1520 On My Block (TV series, one season, 2018–)This coming-of-age series might not have found as many eyeballs as it deserved last year, but those it did find were glued to the screen. In fact, it was the most-binged show of 2018 – meaning that it had the highest watch-time-per-viewing session of any Netflix original. Created by Awkward’s Lauren Iungerich, On My Block follows a group of Los Angeles teens as they navigate both the drama of high school and the danger of inner-city life.Two beleaguered assistants (Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell) conspire to get their over-demanding bosses (Taye Diggs and Lucy Liu) together in order to get their lives back in this winning romantic comedy. Set It Up is responsible not only for coining the term “over-dicking” (it’s much more innocent than it sounds), but for rejuvenating a tired genre.Martin Freeman stars as the father struggling to protect his young daughter from a zombie epidemic spreading across Australia. So far, so overdone. But this drama thriller, directed by Ben Howling and Yolanda Ramke and based on their 2013 short of the same name, throws a handful of unpredictable ners in the works.    1920 Godless (TV series, one season, 2017–)With shades of John Ford\u0027s The Searchers, this languorous western was critically acclaimed but swiftly forgotten after it landed on Netflix in 2016. Set in 1884, it\u0027s about Frank Griffin (Jeff Daniels) and his notoriously ruthless gang of outlaws’ pursuit of their injured former ally Roy Goode (Jack O’Connell), who is hiding out in a small town populated solely by women after a mining accident killed off all its men. A gun-toting Michelle Dockery, clearly relishing the change of scenery after years of Downton Abbey, and a taciturn Jack O’Connell, are on brilliant form.2020 Atypical (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)This coming-of-age series about a teenage boy with autism was sweet and well-intentioned from the start, but its first season was criticised for a handful of inaccuracies, and for its lack of autistic actors. Rather than drowning in a sea of defensiveness – as too many shows tend to do – it listened, and brought in autistic actors and writers for its excellent second season.120 Money Heist (TV series, one season, 2017–)Known as La Casa de Papel (House of Paper) in its native Spanish, Money Heist is Netflix’s most streamed non-English language show. The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don’t let that, or the show’s bland English-language title, put you off – creator Álex Pina has made something special.

Timothy Olyphant is excellent as Sheila’s frazzled husband Joel, and the pair’s idiosyncratic but respectful relationship with their smart teenage daughter Abby (Liv Hewson) isn’t quite like anything else on TV right now.1020 Dark Tourist (TV series, one season, 2018–)New Zealand journalist David Farrier is an unlikely TV presenter in the same way that Louis Theroux is – in just about every scenario in which he finds himself, he’s a little bit awkward. But as with Theroux, Farrier’s weakness is actually his strength, allowing him to endear himself to the many unusual people he meets on his journey through the world’s most questionable tourist destinations. Farrier’s stops include the site of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the road where JFK was assassinated, and the Milwaukee suburbs where serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer murdered his victims.1120 Sacred Games (TV series, one season, 2018–)Based on Vikram Chandra’s epic 2006 novel, Netflix’s first Indian original series is a slowly unfolding gem. The first season of Sacred Games – which follows a troubled police officer (Saif Ali Khan) who has 25 days to save his city thanks to a tip-off from a presumed dead gangster – only covered one quarter of Chandra’s 1,000-page novel. As the show itself declared when it announced the forthcoming second season, “the worst is yet to come”.When the trailer for Dumplin’ first landed, it seemed all the ingredients were in place for a film that was at worst tone-deaf, and at best vaguely patronising. Thank heavens, then, that the trailer did Dumplin’ such a disservice. Starring Danielle Macdonald (who broke out in the excellent 2017 film Patti Cake$) as Willowdean, a self-described “fat girl” who enters a local pageant to annoy her former beauty queen mother (Jennifer Aniston), Dumplin’ is as funny, warm and sensitive as its protagonist – and with a killer Dolly Parton-laden soundtrack to boot.1320 Dark (TV series, one season, 2017–)This sci-fi thriller – which features disappearing children, a mysterious local power plant, and scenes set in the Eighties – has, for obvious reasons, drawn comparisons to Stranger Things. But Dark is even more beguiling and (true to its name) less family-friendly than Stranger Things.1420 The Death and Life of Marsha P Johnson (Film, 2017)Though it’s been somewhat tarnished by claims that director David France appropriated the work and research of trans film-maker Reina Gossett, this documentary is nonetheless a loving, respectful tribute to gay rights activist Marsha P Johnson. One of the key figures in the Stonewall uprising (though her involvement was almost entirely eradicated in 2015’s critically hated Stonewall), Johnson modelled for Andy Warhol, performed onstage with drag group Hot Peaches, helped found the Gay Liberation Front, and then died under suspicious circumstances in 1992.1520 On My Block (TV series, one season, 2018–)This coming-of-age series might not have found as many eyeballs as it deserved last year, but those it did find were glued to the screen. In fact, it was the most-binged show of 2018 – meaning that it had the highest watch-time-per-viewing session of any Netflix original. Created by Awkward’s Lauren Iungerich, On My Block follows a group of Los Angeles teens as they navigate both the drama of high school and the danger of inner-city life.Two beleaguered assistants (Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell) conspire to get their over-demanding bosses (Taye Diggs and Lucy Liu) together in order to get their lives back in this winning romantic comedy. Set It Up is responsible not only for coining the term “over-dicking” (it’s much more innocent than it sounds), but for rejuvenating a tired genre.Martin Freeman stars as the father struggling to protect his young daughter from a zombie epidemic spreading across Australia. So far, so overdone. But this drama thriller, directed by Ben Howling and Yolanda Ramke and based on their 2013 short of the same name, throws a handful of unpredictable ners in the works.    1920 Godless (TV series, one season, 2017–)With shades of John Ford\u0027s The Searchers, this languorous western was critically acclaimed but swiftly forgotten after it landed on Netflix in 2016. Set in 1884, it\u0027s about Frank Griffin (Jeff Daniels) and his notoriously ruthless gang of outlaws’ pursuit of their injured former ally Roy Goode (Jack O’Connell), who is hiding out in a small town populated solely by women after a mining accident killed off all its men. A gun-toting Michelle Dockery, clearly relishing the change of scenery after years of Downton Abbey, and a taciturn Jack O’Connell, are on brilliant form.2020 Atypical (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)This coming-of-age series about a teenage boy with autism was sweet and well-intentioned from the start, but its first season was criticised for a handful of inaccuracies, and for its lack of autistic actors. Rather than drowning in a sea of defensiveness – as too many shows tend to do – it listened, and brought in autistic actors and writers for its excellent second season.Netflix blamed the drop-off in growth on price rises in the US where\u0026nbspconsumers had to stomach price hikes of between 13 per cent and 18 per cent, depending on which package they have, with the most popular plan now $13 per month.Disney plans to offer its new service, Disney Plus, for just $7 and has deep pockets to fund its expansion.Netflix is banking on a number of hit shows to be released in the second half of 2019 – most notably series three of the immensely popular Stranger Things – to lure more customers.Chief executive Reed Hastings was sanguine about the results. “Sometimes we forecast low, sometimes we forecast high—this is one where we forecasted high,” he said in the company’s video earnings interview. He said it was “easy to over-interpret” the significance of quarterly membership numbers.By traditional measures of company performance Netflix is still growing fast. Price rises helped boost revenue by 26 per cent compared to the same quarter last year while profits exceeded expectations at £709m.Mihir Haria-Shah, head of broadcast at media planning agency Total Media said: “Netflix’s head start means it remains in reasonable health whilst the new services such as Disney Plus get over any early teething issues.\u0026nbsp“The bigger concern for Netflix is what happens further down the line once these new entrants have established themselves. It has essentially built its business on the back of leasing content from other companies and has had great success doing so.\u0026nbsp“Now its content providers are becoming competitors it will have to invest even more into original content as existing deals expire and content is taken off the platform.”\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

On the filters page, scroll to the end, tap Manage, then drag and drop the ones you want to reorder, and un-check the ones you want to hide.

Instagram unfortunately doesn’t let you tinker with filters and effects, but you can change your original caption, tag people and update the location.  But Instagram seems unlikely to reverse its decision and may even roll it out to even more locations.\u0026nbspWho is affected and why did Instagram do it?Instagram first began trialling the feature in Canada earlier this year, saying it wanted people to worry a little bit less about how many likes they\u0027re getting.The trial has now extended to Australia, Brazil, Ireland, Italy, Japan and New Zealand, meaning all users in those countries will no longer be able to see the number of likes and video views a post receives.Senator accuses Facebook of ‘flagrant displays of bulls***\u0027We want your friends to focus on the photos and videos you share, not how many likes they get, Instagram wrote in a post.The move comes in response to various studies that have found a link between mental health issues and the pressures brought about by social media use.Can you still find out who liked a post?Instagram says the feature is mandatory for all account holders in the seven countries, but even those users will have ways of seeing who likes their own posts.The firm explained: You can still see your own likes by tapping on the list of people who\u0027ve liked it, but your friends will not be able to see how many likes your post has received.arttributed to use of their platforms (Getty Images)If you are not in one of the affected countries, then it is still possible to see the number of likes posts receive from users within those countries.Also, Instagram says it does not mean the era of influencers is over, nor that brands and companies should worry about customer engagement.For businesses and creators on Instagram, this test will not affect measurement tools like Insights or Ads Manager, a spokesperson said.Will the feature spread to other countries?Key markets for Instagram, like the UK and US, remain unaffected but the spread may appear ominous to users in these countries.Despite the trial extending beyond Canada to six other countries, Instagram refuses to confirm the feature is permanent or that it will roll out further.Instead, Instagram said hiding the likes and video views\u0026nbspis a temporary trial and that it will seek feedback before making any further decisions.​Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The move follows several studies that appeared to link social media pressures with mental health issues.Instagram unveils new anti-bullying feature to discourage trolls“We want Instagram to be a place where people feel comfortable expressing themselves,” said Mia Garlick, Facebook’s head of policy in Australia and New Zealand.“We hope this test will remove the pressure of how many likes a post will receive, so you can focus on sharing the things you love.”Not all users are happy with the move, with many taking to social media to complain about how it could affect the income opportunities of influencers.“What about the people using it for income?” one user wrote on Twitter. “The people who work hard creating content, to then have their hard work not praisednot shown how successful it was to others?”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But humanity has been bewitched by our nearest neighbour for far longer than that. David Barnett delves into lunar myth, legend and folkloreClick to followThe IndependentEven a man who is pure in heart and says his prayers by night, may become a wolf when the wolfbane blooms and the autumn moon is bright.”\u0026nbspSo long have we been fascinated by the moon, that bright, progressively changing, ever-present fixture of our night sky, that we could easily believe those lines are some ancient folkish portent, their origins lost in the mists of time.In actual fact they were written by Curt Siodmak, the screenwriter of the 1941 movie The Wolf Man, which terrified audiences as Lon Chaney Jr, attacked by a wolf in darkest Wales, transforms in the silvery light of the full moon into a half-human, half-lupine beast.Even by the time that movie came out, almost three decades before man would walk on the moon, our fascination with Earth’s satellite was already deep-rooted. And why wouldn’t it be? Even to the earliest people, the moon must have been a troubling thing, hanging there in the sky, its face pocked by craters and ridged with mountains, mirroring and echoing the earth, impossibly distant yet close enough to make out its contoured surface. Of the Earth, and yet beyond it, further than mankind could dream of travelling.And yet, if you have no concept of the Earth on which you’re standing, the moon must have seemed stranger still. It’s little wonder that people have always conjured stories about the moon, deified it, given it the characteristics of a living thing.In Romania, they believed that the sun and the moon were siblings, but despite this, the sun desired his sister. To avoid her brother, the moon decided she would only go out at night, when the sun could not bother her.To some of the indigenous peoples of the Arctic circle, the moon was male, and the sun a woman, and they were lovers. Among some Inuit peoples, the moon was a benevolent spirit who welcomed the souls of the dead to other tribes, he was a vengeful being whose wrath was terrible to behold.Created with Sketch.Super snow moon: pictures of 2019\u0027s largest full moon around the world Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A plane flies past the snow moon in Nuremberg, GermanyThe moon lights up the sky behind One World Trade Center in New YorkThe moon setting over Burrow Mump at Burrowbridge in Somerset this morning The snow moon rises over the Plaza Hotel and Casino in downtown Las VegasThe moon sets behind Les Jumelles in the Swiss AlpsThe snow moon rises over the banks of the River Loire at Lavau-sur-LoireEmirates Air Line cable cars are silhouetted against the backdrop of a snow moon in Greenwich, LondonThe snow moon rises between columns of the Floesser Bridge in Frankfurt, GermanyThe snow moon in MilanBuddhist monks carry lit candles as the moon rises over the Wat Phra Dhammakaya temple, near BangkokThe snow moon rises over Marina Beach in Chennai, India The snow moon is pictured against street lights of Piazza del Duomo in MilanThe snow moon rises above a construction site in IndiaA ferris wheel is in the foreground as the snow moon rises above Malaga, SpainThe snow moon rises between statues of Alexander the Great and Diogenes of Sinope in Corinth, GreeceThe snow moon rises in Skopje, North MacedoniaThe snow moon rises behind a statue of the Virgin Maty in Skopje, North MacedoniaEmirates Air Line cable cars are silhouetted against the backdrop of a snow moon in Greenwich, LondonThe snow moon rises over the French Mediterranean island of CorsicaThe snow moon rises by the Parthenon in AthensA plane flies in front of the snow moon above LondonThe snow moon rises above the Camlica Mosque in IstanbulThe Madonnina statue of the Virgin Mary atop Milan\u0027s Cathedral is pictured against the snow moon A plane flies past the snow moon in Nuremberg, GermanyThe moon lights up the sky behind One World Trade Center in New YorkThe moon setting over Burrow Mump at Burrowbridge in Somerset this morning The snow moon rises over the Plaza Hotel and Casino in downtown Las VegasThe moon sets behind Les Jumelles in the Swiss AlpsThe snow moon rises over the banks of the River Loire at Lavau-sur-LoireEmirates Air Line cable cars are silhouetted against the backdrop of a snow moon in Greenwich, LondonThe snow moon rises between columns of the Floesser Bridge in Frankfurt, GermanyThe snow moon in MilanBuddhist monks carry lit candles as the moon rises over the Wat Phra Dhammakaya temple, near BangkokThe snow moon rises over Marina Beach in Chennai, India The snow moon is pictured against street lights of Piazza del Duomo in MilanThe snow moon rises above a construction site in IndiaA ferris wheel is in the foreground as the snow moon rises above Malaga, SpainThe snow moon rises between statues of Alexander the Great and Diogenes of Sinope in Corinth, GreeceThe snow moon rises in Skopje, North MacedoniaThe snow moon rises behind a statue of the Virgin Maty in Skopje, North MacedoniaEmirates Air Line cable cars are silhouetted against the backdrop of a snow moon in Greenwich, LondonThe snow moon rises over the French Mediterranean island of CorsicaThe snow moon rises by the Parthenon in AthensA plane flies in front of the snow moon above LondonThe snow moon rises above the Camlica Mosque in IstanbulThe Madonnina statue of the Virgin Mary atop Milan\u0027s Cathedral is pictured against the snow moon One time, a Japanese fisherman found a robe made of white feathers on the beach. It belonged to a beautiful woman swimming in the sea. She said she would sing him a song if he returned her robe, for without it she could not go home. He did so and she sang him a hymn to the moon, where she lived, and as she sang her feathered robe became vast white wings, which carried her to her lunar palace.The moon is often considered female, as are the gods who represented it in ancient times. According to the astrologer and occultist Bruce King, who was born in Chicago in 1897 and wrote under the name Zolar:\u0026nbsp“In mythologies worldwide, rulers of the moon are female deities.”Huge, unexplained ‘mass’ spotted under the MoonIn his Encyclopedia of Signs, Omens and Superstitions he lists many of them: “For the Canaanites, the name of the moon goddess was Jerah (for who the city of Jericho was named). For Egyptians, Isis and Hathor were associated with the moon. For the Babylonians, the goddess Ishtar was given similar honours.For the Greeks, Artemis\u0026nbspand Diana\u0026nbsp(hunting goddesses), were both\u0026nbspconnected with the moon as well. Hence, it was not surprising that in medieval Europe, Diana became the patroness of witches, since she already ruled “horned”\u0026nbspanimals such as the stag and goat.Witches, of course, meet by moonlight. Shakespeare’s three witches, or weird sisters, in Macbeth, when cooking up their cooking up their “toil and trouble” in their boiling cauldron, throw in “slips of yew silver’d in the moon’s eclipse”. They are visited by Hecate, the goddess of witchcraft, associated with the moon.Brewer’s Book of Myth and Legend, edited by JC Cooper, tells us that Hecate was the name the Greeks gave to the moon before she had fully risen and after she had set hidden, occult. A crescent moon was identified as Astarte, as Diana or Cynthia when full. The\u0026nbspancients personified the moon as Selene, who fell in love with Endymion, a shepherd, who was put into an immortal sleep by a jealous Zeus.The moon is for lovers, immortalised as such in song:\u0026nbsp“Blue Moon”\u0026nbsp“Give Me The Moonlight”\u0026nbspBeethoven’s Moonlight Sonata. The moon has illuminated lovers’ trysts and in Brazil they say you are only truly in love if you can easily make out the rabbit in the moon, a piece of Chinese-originated folklore that identifies the markings on the face of the full moon as a rabbit.Just as the moon controls the tides of the sea, so it is connected to the bodies of women. In many folk legends, says Zolar:\u0026nbsp“Girls are warned not to stare at the moon or lay in moonlight, or they will be impregnated by the moon and give birth to some kind of monster.”Is there any truth in the old stories that women’s menstrual cycles are linked directly to the moon? The Uaupe tribe of the Amazon refer to a girl’s first menstruation as “defloration by the moon”. The word menstruation is derived from the Latin word menses, meaning “monthly”, and the Greek “mene”, referring to the moon. Science perhaps doesn’t back that up, other than through coincidence the average menstrual cycle is 29 days, the lunar cycle is 29.5 days.Nasa to send spacecraft to Saturn’s moon TitanNasa to open moon rock samples sealed since Apollo missionsElon Musk tweets ‘Occupy Mars’ alongside photo of the MoonAliens could be living on other moons, scientists sayThe moon, of course, only comes out at night...\u0026nbspexcept when it doesn’t. Sometimes we see the pale ghost of the moon in the bright blue sky, because of the passage of the moon around the Earth and, as it gets closer to being a new moon, and at its nearest relative point to the sun, we sometimes see the solar reflection off\u0026nbspthe moon’s surface in broad daylight.But it is generally the dark velvet of the night sky the moon inhabits, which gives it its associations with the occult, and secret things. Charles Walker, in his Encyclopedia of Secret Knowledge, says:\u0026nbsp“The moon is the symbol of the imaginative, reflective, interiorising power in our world. In astrology and alchemy, the moon is an index of the withdrawal principle, and of the subconscious or hidden side of life.”Moonlight is for lovers, but dark deeds are carried out by the silvery glow, as well. The term moonraker is from an old Wiltshire folk tale, about locals who were dredging a pond for kegs of smuggled alcohol. When confronted by the excise men, they played the dumb yokels and said they were trying to rake out the moon’s reflection in the water.\u0026nbspIf you are planning a robbery, then don’t do it on the third day of a new moon, or the enterprise will end in disaster, according to an old proverb. If you fall ill on the eighth day of a new moon, it’s likely death will follow. Should someone die at the time of a new moon, three more deaths are said to be on the horizon. And sleeping with the moon shining on your face will result in distortion of your features, or insanity.Ah, the moon and the mind. The insane were called called “lunatics” for a reason...\u0026nbsptheir state of mind was said to be directly influenced by the phases of the moon. The Lunacy Act of 1845 defined a lunatic as a person who exhibited lucidity in the first two phases of the moon but grew demented during the full moon phase. In 1940 a soldier, charged with murder, pleaded “moon madness” in mitigation in court.Lunacy, and the changes it wrought in humans, brings us back to the man who is pure of heart, and says his prayers by night, yet becomes a wolf. The ditty might have been penned by Curt Siodmak for The Wolf Man, but he was building on a dark tradition that has its roots in classical mythology.Zolar has little truck with the modern portrayal of lycanthropy, commenting somewhat huffily:\u0026nbsp“Just like vampires, the werewolf has been glorified by Hollywood and the motion pictures. For the ancients, a werewolf was a person transformed into a wolf by magical means. It is said that werewolves roamed the country at night and would attack babies and humans.”Murder case where man ‘thought victim was werewolf’ ends in mistrialThere are defences, of course, and ways to spot a werewolf in human form. They have flat fingers, so they used to say, and hair covering the palms of their\u0026nbsphands. And, of course, though werewolves were said to be immune to normal ordnance, a silver bullet, especially if blessed by a priest, would kill one. If that seems extreme –\u0026nbspfor example if the werewolf is a loved one –\u0026nbspsaying their Christian name three times would effect a transformation back into human form.It is said that the first man-to-wolf transformation was at the hands of Zeus, who was somewhat appalled that Lycaon of Arcadia\u0026nbspsacrificed his own child to the ruler of Olympus. Zeus turned Lycaon into a wolf for his crime, which is where we get the term lycanthrope from to denote a werewolf.According to John and Caitlin Matthews’\u0026nbspElement Encyclopedia of Magical Creatures, there was a wolf-cult built around Zeus after this, which survived until at least the first century AD. They write:\u0026nbsp“A member of the Antaeus family told Pliny the Elder that he had been a lycanthrope for nine years, having drawn lots with the rest of his clan to partake in these secret rites.”A werewolf could be created through being cursed, perhaps by a Hecate-worshipping witch, or sleeping in the light of the moon, or being conceived under a new moon. Or, as in the movies, from The Wolf Man to An American Werewolf in London (in which bluff rural Yorkshireman Brian Glover exhorts a couple of naive American tourists to “Beware the moon!”, to no avail), being bitten by another werewolf.Werewolf mania perhaps reached its height in 16th-century France, when dozens of people were tried and executed for being werewolves in a frenzy that spread across Europe, a full\u0026nbspcentury before the Salem witch trials in the United States.Michel Verdun is thought to be the first man to be tried for lycanthropy, in Poligny in 1521. Authorities investigating a wolf attack followed a trail of evidence and supposition that led them to Verdun’s home. He was arrested and under torture confessed to being a werewolf, pointing the finger at two other men, Pierre Bourgot and Philibert Montot.Bourgot told the authorities that he had been approached by three men dressed in black who urged him to reject God, and in return he was promised protection for his flock of sheep and given an ointment which, when applied, allowed him to transform into a wolf by the light of the moon. All three men were executed. Similar trials were carried out across Germany, the Netherlands and Estonia.We now know, of course, that the moon is not imbued with any magical powers, nor can exert any kind of influence over us. It is a lump of rock, about 2,000 miles in diameter.\u0026nbspIt is about\u0026nbsp4.5 billion years old, and is 250,000 miles away from the Earth. It has little atmosphere, and no weather no erosion means that the footprints left by the crew of Apollo 11 half a century ago will endure, untouched, for millions of years.And yet… the moon fascinates us beyond the fact of us actually getting there in 1969. The full moon carries with it far more weight than a mere satellite reflecting the light of the sun, it shoulders mythology, legend and folklore that dates back almost as far as mankind itself.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don’t let that, or the show’s bland English-language title, put you off – creator Álex Pina has made something special. The heist here, led by a mysterious man known only as The Professor, involves breaking into the Royal Mint of Spain and printing off €2.4 billion. There are even more twists in the show’s 15 episodes than there are hostages. 220 American Vandal (TV series, two seasons, 2017–2018)Part satire of true crime documentaries such as Making a Murderer, part carefully observed portrayal of teenage life, American Vandal was criminally underappreciated during its two season run. It’s been cancelled now, but that doesn’t mean you can’t catch up with it, and then write Netflix a strongly worded email.320 One Day at a Time (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)In stark contrast to the off-beat, low-key comedy that currently rules TV – the kind that provokes a wry smirk rather than a hearty laugh – One Day at a Time is a big, bright sitcom filmed in front of an interminably enthusiastic studio audience. You wouldn’t have thought that the story of a Cuban-American army veteran  nurse  single mother – who suffers from PTSD and depression – would fit into this format, but it does so beautifully, tackling issues of sexuality, racism and sexism in the process.  Based on writer  director Tamara Jenkins’s own fertility struggles, Private Life stars Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti (both giving brilliant performances) as a spiky, loving middle-aged couple desperate to have a baby. They even rope their enthusiastic but irresponsible niece Sadie (Kayli Carter) into the mix, much to the horror of Sadie’s mother (Molly Shannon, turning a potentially repellent character into one worthy of empathy). It’s subtle, restrained and beautifully realised.520 Big Mouth (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Crude, rude, and rife with surprise emissions and bodily functions, animated sitcom Big Mouth is also a sensitive, nuanced deep e into the various horrors of teenagehood. When 12-year-old Andrew Glouberman (John Mulaney) is visited by the hormone monster (Nick Kroll, who voices many of the show’s best characters), he finds his life irreversibly – and seemingly disastrously – changed. Unlike many other puberty-centred comedies, Big Mouth makes as much time for its confused female protagonists as its male ones Maya Rudolph is a delight as the female hormone monster, and look out for Kristen Wiig’s wonderful turn as a talking vagina.  620 Easy (TV series, two seasons, 2016–)Joe Swanberg’s style of defiantly undramatic mumblecore isn’t for everyone, but if you enjoyed his earlier films, Drinking Buddies and Happy Christmas, you’ll find plenty to admire in this anthology comedy-drama series. Big-name stars such as Orlando Bloom and Aubrey Plaza crop up, but Jane Adams – who you might remember from Todd Solondz’s chronically depressing 1998 film Happiness – is the show’s heart, and Marc Maron is its jaded soul.Community’s Gillian Jacobs is brilliant as the prickly, magnetic recovering addict Mickey, who forms an unlikely – and arguably deeply unwise – relationship with her nerdy neighbour Gus (Paul Rust). Despite Gus’s pathological need to be the nice guy, we’re never quite sure who or what we’re rooting for – which is what makes Love such complex, compelling viewing.  In 2016, comedian Patton Oswalt’s wife, the true crime writer Michelle McNamara, died suddenly in her sleep. That subject matter doesn’t exactly scream “stand-up special”, but out of his devastating loss, Oswalt managed to craft something funny and profound. Over the course of an hour, he processes his grief onstage, managing to find humour in the struggle to raise his grieving six-year-old daughter alone.920 Santa Clarita Diet (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Granted, this horror-comedy – which stars Drew Barrymore as a neurotic real estate agent who suddenly develops a taste for human flesh – is really silly, and really, really disgusting. But it’s also strangely charming, and funny. Timothy Olyphant is excellent as Sheila’s frazzled husband Joel, and the pair’s idiosyncratic but respectful relationship with their smart teenage daughter Abby (Liv Hewson) isn’t quite like anything else on TV right now.1020 Dark Tourist (TV series, one season, 2018–)New Zealand journalist David Farrier is an unlikely TV presenter in the same way that Louis Theroux is – in just about every scenario in which he finds himself, he’s a little bit awkward. But as with Theroux, Farrier’s weakness is actually his strength, allowing him to endear himself to the many unusual people he meets on his journey through the world’s most questionable tourist destinations. Farrier’s stops include the site of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the road where JFK was assassinated, and the Milwaukee suburbs where serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer murdered his victims.1120 Sacred Games (TV series, one season, 2018–)Based on Vikram Chandra’s epic 2006 novel, Netflix’s first Indian original series is a slowly unfolding gem. The first season of Sacred Games – which follows a troubled police officer (Saif Ali Khan) who has 25 days to save his city thanks to a tip-off from a presumed dead gangster – only covered one quarter of Chandra’s 1,000-page novel. As the show itself declared when it announced the forthcoming second season, “the worst is yet to come”.When the trailer for Dumplin’ first landed, it seemed all the ingredients were in place for a film that was at worst tone-deaf, and at best vaguely patronising. Thank heavens, then, that the trailer did Dumplin’ such a disservice. Starring Danielle Macdonald (who broke out in the excellent 2017 film Patti Cake$) as Willowdean, a self-described “fat girl” who enters a local pageant to annoy her former beauty queen mother (Jennifer Aniston), Dumplin’ is as funny, warm and sensitive as its protagonist – and with a killer Dolly Parton-laden soundtrack to boot.1320 Dark (TV series, one season, 2017–)This sci-fi thriller – which features disappearing children, a mysterious local power plant, and scenes set in the Eighties – has, for obvious reasons, drawn comparisons to Stranger Things. But Dark is even more beguiling and (true to its name) less family-friendly than Stranger Things.1420 The Death and Life of Marsha P Johnson (Film, 2017)Though it’s been somewhat tarnished by claims that director David France appropriated the work and research of trans film-maker Reina Gossett, this documentary is nonetheless a loving, respectful tribute to gay rights activist Marsha P Johnson. One of the key figures in the Stonewall uprising (though her involvement was almost entirely eradicated in 2015’s critically hated Stonewall), Johnson modelled for Andy Warhol, performed onstage with drag group Hot Peaches, helped found the Gay Liberation Front, and then died under suspicious circumstances in 1992.1520 On My Block (TV series, one season, 2018–)This coming-of-age series might not have found as many eyeballs as it deserved last year, but those it did find were glued to the screen. In fact, it was the most-binged show of 2018 – meaning that it had the highest watch-time-per-viewing session of any Netflix original. Created by Awkward’s Lauren Iungerich, On My Block follows a group of Los Angeles teens as they navigate both the drama of high school and the danger of inner-city life.Two beleaguered assistants (Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell) conspire to get their over-demanding bosses (Taye Diggs and Lucy Liu) together in order to get their lives back in this winning romantic comedy. Set It Up is responsible not only for coining the term “over-dicking” (it’s much more innocent than it sounds), but for rejuvenating a tired genre.Martin Freeman stars as the father struggling to protect his young daughter from a zombie epidemic spreading across Australia. So far, so overdone. But this drama thriller, directed by Ben Howling and Yolanda Ramke and based on their 2013 short of the same name, throws a handful of unpredictable ners in the works.    1920 Godless (TV series, one season, 2017–)With shades of John Ford\u0027s The Searchers, this languorous western was critically acclaimed but swiftly forgotten after it landed on Netflix in 2016. Set in 1884, it\u0027s about Frank Griffin (Jeff Daniels) and his notoriously ruthless gang of outlaws’ pursuit of their injured former ally Roy Goode (Jack O’Connell), who is hiding out in a small town populated solely by women after a mining accident killed off all its men. A gun-toting Michelle Dockery, clearly relishing the change of scenery after years of Downton Abbey, and a taciturn Jack O’Connell, are on brilliant form.2020 Atypical (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)This coming-of-age series about a teenage boy with autism was sweet and well-intentioned from the start, but its first season was criticised for a handful of inaccuracies, and for its lack of autistic actors. Rather than drowning in a sea of defensiveness – as too many shows tend to do – it listened, and brought in autistic actors and writers for its excellent second season.120 Money Heist (TV series, one season, 2017–)Known as La Casa de Papel (House of Paper) in its native Spanish, Money Heist is Netflix’s most streamed non-English language show. The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don’t let that, or the show’s bland English-language title, put you off – creator Álex Pina has made something special.

Rather than drowning in a sea of defensiveness – as too many shows tend to do – it listened, and brought in autistic actors and writers for its excellent second season.Netflix blamed the drop-off in growth on price rises in the US where\u0026nbspconsumers had to stomach price hikes of between 13 per cent and 18 per cent, depending on which package they have, with the most popular plan now $13 per month.Disney plans to offer its new service, Disney Plus, for just $7 and has deep pockets to fund its expansion.Netflix is banking on a number of hit shows to be released in the second half of 2019 – most notably series three of the immensely popular Stranger Things – to lure more customers.Chief executive Reed Hastings was sanguine about the results. “Sometimes we forecast low, sometimes we forecast high—this is one where we forecasted high,” he said in the company’s video earnings interview. He said it was “easy to over-interpret” the significance of quarterly membership numbers.By traditional measures of company performance Netflix is still growing fast. Price rises helped boost revenue by 26 per cent compared to the same quarter last year while profits exceeded expectations at £709m.Mihir Haria-Shah, head of broadcast at media planning agency Total Media said: “Netflix’s head start means it remains in reasonable health whilst the new services such as Disney Plus get over any early teething issues.\u0026nbsp“The bigger concern for Netflix is what happens further down the line once these new entrants have established themselves. It has essentially built its business on the back of leasing content from other companies and has had great success doing so.\u0026nbsp“Now its content providers are becoming competitors it will have to invest even more into original content as existing deals expire and content is taken off the platform.”\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Anything that is hidden in such a way suggests that the person leaving it behind is most definitely aware that it is not the correct way to dispose of their rubbish.“You don’t actually see people just dropping litter these days, they all know better.\u0026nbspSome have suggested adding bins to the hills, but this does encourage folk\u0026nbspto empty their pockets, and leave even more behind.“Pistachio shells make a regular appearance on the Ben, as well as cigarette ends. All litter is bad, but has different impacts. Plastic will never go away, foodstuff\u0026nbspcan poison the wildlife, and tissuesfaeces spread bacteria.”First-time climbers\u0026nbspcan be the worst offenders, Mr Pyne said, likely through ignorance regarding how long organic material takes to break down in a mountain environment a banana skin may take between two and three years to disappear.However, following the Real3Peaks organised litter-picks and the long-term work of other volunteers, “the noticeable volume has gone down, and the place is looking much better for it”, he said.A more pressing problem is walkers going to the toilet because the desire for privacy leads them to pick the same spots over and over again, he said. “Most or all of the accessible and obvious hiding places\u0026nbspare open, unflushed toilets, smelling very bad, often draped in used tissues, a vibrant green algae present, and black coloured soil, which has been tainted by the concentrated urine.”Staying well away from water courses while doing one’s business is important, Mr Pyne said.He added: “The best thing that anyone outdoors can do, whether in the park, down by the canal, or in the mountains, is to pick up litter they see, and be considerate of where they will ‘go’.”The next Real3Peaks Challenge is due to take place on 12 October.Mountaineering Scotland runs a #TakItHame campaign designed to encourage walkers to pick up any litter they see.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I thought: ‘Oh my God they haven’t got a plan’.“That was really shocking frankly because the damage if you don\u0027t have a plan … it’s like Lance Corporal Jones you know, ‘Don’t panic, don’t panic’, running around like idiots.”\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

It’s not useful to use it.”However, Ms May\u0027s official spokesman later insisted: The Prime Minister was clear in her discussions in public or in private that the UK could leave without a deal.The European Commission’s top official\u0026nbspMartin Selmayr, meanwhile, said he thought the UK was still unprepared to leave without a deal.“We have seen what has been prepared on our side of the border for a hard Brexit. We don’t see the same level of preparation on the other side of the border.”The EU secretly offered to put Brexit “on ice” for five years in order to come up with a new deal for Europe, Ms May’s de facto deputy David Lidington told Panorama.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A group from the National Marine Mammal Foundation monitored the whales by boat.“We’re cautiously optimistic that the group dodged a bullet, and that they’re now on their way to deeper water,” said Clay George, a biologist for the Georgia Wildlife Resources Division.Crews had also flown a helicopter above the area, which is about 90 miles south of Savannah, and determined no other whales were stranded.Pilot whales are essentially large dolphins, and can grow to 24 feet in length and weigh 6,600 pounds.Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Dr George said they were still investigating why the animals rushed to shore, an event he called “exceedingly rare in Georgia”.Dr George described the whales as “one to three-tonne dolphins”.“They’re so social that if one animal in the group gets injured or sick, all the other animals in the group can follow them great distances into shore,” he said, “and then they can strand.”Normally these creatures swim 100 miles offshore, he said, which means “something went wrong”, possibly days or weeks ago.In the necropsy, Dr George said researchers will be looking for ingested plastic, evidence of plastic netting or signs of an acoustic disturbance, like bombs or sonars, that could have caused one or more of the animals to swim towards land.“Tomorrow will be the beginning of a process that could go on for potentially weeks,” he said.Normally, added Dr George, he would not advise humans to intervene with pilot whales, but in this case, “it was the right thing to do”.Dr\u0026nbspErin Fougeres, who administers the marine mammal stranding program for the Fisheries ision of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the Southeast, said that “mass strandings of pilot whales aren’t entirely uncommon for us.”There have been about 23 mass strandings in southeastern states since 1991, mostly along the Gulf of Mexico, but never in Georgia, she said.“This event, so far, and fingers crossed, has had the best possible outcome,” she said. “We don’t often have happy endings.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It has threatened journalists, too, that they face prosecutionthey dare to publish the content of the cables.Trying to justy his threats, the Met’s Assistant Commissioner, Neil Basu, said he was sure the leaks had “damaged UK international relations” and on that basis no one publishing the leaks could plead a public interest defence.What a ludicrous over-reaction to what is really no more than a diplomatic spat over the Ferrero Rochers.Sure, it doesn’t exactly help UK US relations when our Ambassador calls the President of the United States “inept” and his administration “uniquely dysal”.But I would say it is mildly less damaging than some of the things that the Leader of Opposition, the Mayor of London and Scotland’s First Minister have said about Donald Trump. I can’t see Mr Basu dangling his handcuffs in front of them — and neither should he.Obviously, Sir Kim has reason to feel aggrieved that someone — presumably in the diplomatic service or the Foreign Office, because there is no evidence of computers being hacked — has leaked information he intended to be private. But it is a matter for the Government to investigate, not the police.How ridiculous Basu has said of the leaker: “You are now also responsible for erting busy detectives from under-taking their core mission.”No, Mr Basu — it is only thanks to your decision that officers have been taken off front-line duties to undertake this investigation.You could have told officials what police officers are forever telling the rest of us when we report our houses broken into or our bikes stolen: Sorry, but we’ve got too much  to do.It would be a dferent mattersomeone had leaked material that really did harm national security.The sort of information leaked by Kim Philby and his Soviet-sympathising accomplices in the s put British lives at risk.But leaking and publishing a diplomat’s private thoughts hardly comes into that category. Mr Basu’s attack on the principles of the free Press echoes Operation Elveden, the failed attempt by the Met to criminalise journalists who had obtained information from police officers, in some cases for money.The Met switched more than  police officers from other duties and arrested  people. The police probe cost taxpayers £.million and yet of  journalists charged, only one was convicted at trial — and that was quashed on appeal. Just one journalist, Dan Evans, pleaded guilty to an Elveden offence and was given a suspended sentence.The prosecutions relied on an ancient offence, Misconduct in Public Office, which was only ever supposed to apply to public servants, not journalists.As many lawyers, including the Lord Chief Justice, pointed out, it simply isn’t a criminal offence for someone to receive or to publish most forms of state information — only for a public official to sell it.There is a very good reason for this. Leaks, and the freedom to put their contents into the public domain, are an essential ingredient of our democracy. It is what helps the Press to keep in check corrupt or over-bearing politicians and public officials.Without the freedom to publish leaked information, for example, we would never have known the extent to which MPs and Lords were abusing their expenses regime.That required a newspaper to publish information gleaned from a computer disk which had been stolen — but thankfully in that case the Met decided that the public interest over-rode a possible offence of handling stolen goods.Without the Panama Papers we would never have known the extent to which wealthy iniduals and corporations have gone into keeping their wealth out of the taxman’s grasp. Without the “climategate” leaks we would not have known how some climate scientists were prepared to manipulate past temperature records to support their theories.It took a leak, too, to establish that the Blair government knew it was unlikely that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, but that George W Bush had resolved to overthrow Saddam regardless.Then there was “Plebgate”, when a leaked police log revealed a bust-up between government chief whip Andrew Mitchell and police manning the gates at Downing Street — and led an officer to be jailed when it was revealed he had invented his witness statement.There are, of course, plenty of other countries in the world where journalists would be locked up for publishing information that has leaked from the government, but they are not countries in which most of us would want to live.By over-reacting to what is an embarrassment to the Foreign Office, the Met has taken a leaf out of the book of President Erdogan of Turkey, who has locked up dozens of journalists as he attempts to suppress all opposition to his regime.Neil Basu and other senior Met Police officers should back off and accept that the Press is quite within its rights to publish leaked information that does not threaten national security.We are, after all, one of the world’s oldest ing democracies — not a tinpot state where people get led off in chains for daring to reveal the truth. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

His English was fairly limited and my Spanish went no further than: “Paella, mucho gracias.”So when, after several minutes of discussing the musical inspiration for his new single album , I went in for the killer question.“How many women have you slept with ”He shrugged.“ ” I ventured.He pulled an expression to suggest I had woefully misjudged his pulling power with the opposite sex. So I aimed higher.“, ”“Ooo knows ” he drawled with a lazy smile. “A gentleman  . . .  he never tell.”“Shall we go with , then ” I suggested, aswe were making a joint entry to one of those “guess how many sweets” attractions at the local fete. He shrugged again, a gesture I took as implicit confirmation. Well, he didn’t deny it.The interview appeared the following day and shortly afterwards the figure went global when the US-based National Enquirer ran with it.Julio, who is charm personied, made no complaint when his legendary Lothario-ism went stratospheric, though many years later he mitigated to another interviewer who broached the subject: “Me, I don’t have numbers. I respect women very much.”Like Mick Jagger, who is said to have bedded around , women, the Spanish crooner joined the ranks of Warren Beatty, Errol Flynn, Jack Nicholson and the notorious lover Casanova as one of history’s great seducers.Back then, such, ahem, swordsmanship was admired. The majority of women swooned at the mere thought of a sacred moment in their seductive gaze, while young men felt both inspired and intimidated by such a dizzyingly high number of sexual conquests.But now  Thanks to the #metoo and #timesup campaigns, men with more notches on their bedposts than the rest of us have had hot dinners are regarded with certain distaste. Last week, Julio’s tongue-in-cheek statistic popped up again, when a -year-old man finally won recognition as the star’s son — the product of a brief affair in the s.Suddenly, the legendary “,” was being viewed through the modern-day, more puritanical prism, where such behaviour might be regarded as “sex addiction”.Whatever the truth , he’s now been with we Miranda Rijnsburger for more than  years and they have five children.So it’s fair to say that his womanising days are long gone. Just as well, perhaps. Because,the Love Island men are anything to go by, old roues are now old hat and it’s romantic and wholly faithful young men like Tommy Fury who, quite rightly, earn the nation’s admiration. Long may it go on.Though it seems there are still some lotharios refusing to go quietly. Last year, Italian playboy Maurizio Zanfanti,  — dubbed the “Romeo of Rimini” after claiming to have slept with , women — died while having sex with a -year-old tourist in his car. It’s what he would have wanted.JOBLESS Daniel Eyers and his pregnant partner Lucrezia Worrell say they have been evicted from their Kent council house for spending their rent money on takeaways.The couple, who have four children, are now living with Daniel’s mum. Daniel, , says: “I can’t get a job as it would mean my children would miss out on school, as I have to drive them there every day.”Oh let me count the ways.A flexible, part-time job perhaps  How about your partner taking them to school, or asking other parents for a lt  Or perhaps desisting from having a fth childyou can’t afford to keep the other four Meanwhile, let us compare and contrast this “can’t do” attitude with that of this father in Vietnam who drags his son across a raging, muddy river in a plastic bag so he can get to school, before ing to his remote village to work.A couple of years ago, we cowered inside a friend’s French holiday home as hailstones the size of golf balls rained down outside.Oh how we laughed . . . until I remembered our hire car parked outside.It was peppered with more dents than a Swiss cheese and, because we hadn’t taken out the “full insurance”, left us with a bill that cost more than the actual holiday.A BRIEF chat in front of the assembled cameras at Wimbledon was all it took for the Duchesses of Cambridgeand Sussexto dispel the long-standing rumours of a spat.Several weeks ago, it was also reported that the Duchess of Cambridge had fallen out with Rose Hanbury, one of her closest friends in the “Norfolk set”.The story has been dismissed as “unsubstantiated rumours” by sources within the Palace but it flared up again when Rose attended the recent Trump banquet without her husbandand was seated in practically a separate postcode to her old chum. Of course, they could kill those rumours stone dead too by being photographed together while out shopping or having lunch.That it hasn’t happened perhaps speaks volumes.AMAL CLOONEY is a well-regarded human rights lawyer who, together with husband George, uses her  to highlight ious liberal causes.So I was rather perplexed to hear – via a -page leaked document – that in  she reportedly gave legal advice to Wikileaks founder Julian Assange on how to potentially sabotage the British government’s bid to arrest him.Whether you think Assange’s role in leaking , classied US documents was espionage or heroism, it remains that he was also trying to avoid extradition to Sweden where he faced charges of sexual assault.How, pray tell, does that fit in with liberal values JENNIFER Lopez is  later this month and credits her youthfulness to daily “self-affirmations”.“I tell myself ‘I am youthful and timeless’ every day a few times a day,” she says. It sounds like cliched bull****, but it’s not. Age is all in your mind.”Hmmm. Quite frankly, I could chant her mantra on a loop and never look like this.One suspects that regular exercise, healthy eating and an expensive skincare regime have played their part too.A SMALL number of residents currently living in the swanky London area of Hampstead are up in arms at proposed boundary changes that would place their homes in nearby Gospel Oak.“By severing political ties, you’re disenfranchising many residents,” says one.What they actually mean is: The price of our houses will plummet.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The British boozer is in crisis.More than a quarter of all pubs have closed in the past two decades, from , in  to ,, according to the Office for National Statistics. We are losing three pubs a day. At this rate we will see the end of the British pub within our letime.So I got together with two friends who, like me, had never been in the licensed trade, to rescue this wonderful, warm, welcoming, Grade II listed building so everyone can continue to enjoy it. And I am not alone.I know of whole communities that have got together through crowd funding to save their local, with £.million being raised through internet donations for ious establishments last year.People are coming to realise that we can’t afford to lose these treasured spaces. There is no social network that can beat the pub, particularly in a world so insular where people have their noses in a mobile phone the whole time.It is so important people sit up and have a good chat, whether it is with a stranger at the bar or one of the staff. Workers come in after grafting and want to speak to the barmaid about what a hard day they’ve had, about the van breaking down or the tractor engine blowing up.Pubs often have football teams, darts, dominoes, quiz nights and are a venue where many great bands played their first gigs. In other places you will find a small shop at the local, because the village one has closed.At The Half Moon we sponsor the village cricket team, have Women’s Institute meetings with tea and cake in the morning, charity events and people come to celebrate weddings, birthdays and anniversaries.And no, nanny state meddlers, this isn’t about encouraging drinking, it’s about popping down to the local for a pint once or twice a week, which isn’t going to do any harm.The pub is now a place that families visit and I want everyone to treat it as their home.  My mum is in the garden, my dad helps out and my son Indio comes in to ask our head barman: “Can I have the usual please” — by which he means an apple juice and a packet of crisps.I had noticed pubs closing, but I hadn’t realised the reason until I became a landlady myself. Someone needs to give this industry a break. Landlords and land–ladies can only make tiny margins on the beer they sell, due to the high taxes they have to pay.That’s why I got involved with the Long Live The Local campaign last year to help pressure the Government into freezing beer duty. Everything is trying to kill this incredible part of British culture, whether it’s business rates, beer tax or sugar tax.Our rates are three times the European average and we pay almost  per cent of all beer duty across the EU, while drinking only  per cent of the beer. But the industry employs around , — many of them young people — and puts £BILLION into the economy.I can’t thank The Sun enough for its support in helping our campaign. I don’t think we would have received as many signatures without the help of you, the readers. Thankfully, the Chancellor listened to our case, agreeing in the last budget not to raise duty on beer.Sin taxes are high enough already and I hope the next Prime Minister will give us a break. It was an honour to be named  Beer Drinker Of The Year by the All-Party Parliamentary Beer Group, which promotes the unique role of the pub in our society.Certainly there is hope that this great institution can survive by changing with the times and adapting to new tastes.  It is amazing seeing all the microbreweries and gin distilleries starting up, with a new generation enthusiastic about real ingredients.The gastro pub movement also offers customers the quality food they desire. We were proud that our restaurant received two AA rosettes for culinary excellence in the first six months.But there is also a need for a pub to be a pub, where customers can come in with their wellies or work boots. At The Half Moon we have good dining on one side and an old-fashioned fireplace that drinkers can gather round on the other.For the first year I was there all the time, but now it’s wiping its own nose, so I go in two or three times a week — it’s my other jobs that pay the mortgage. It’s a great place to wind down, particularly on a Sunday, and it brings me a lot of joy.When I got the lease for the pub, a friend advised me to make sure I stood back once in a while to peer through the windows to see people having a good time. That’s why Britain’s pubs have to be saved.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

OBR chairman Robert Chote said it “illustrates the dangers of unintended consequences when governments come up with clever ways to save money”. Its fiscal risks report says: “DWP estimates there were around , people aged  or over who were entitled to the guarantee element of pension credit in - but who did not receive it, almost  per cent of the total number entitled. “These had an average entitlement of £ a week, resulting in around £.billion of unclaimed benefit among this age group. So around half of that group would need to start claiming to wipe out the expected savings from transferring responsibility to the BBC and the BBC cutting its domestic spending by a corresponding amount.”    While “very large increases in take-up are unlikely”, the Corporation’s plan to publicise the availability of Pension Credit will lead to more people taking it up. It adds: “It is relatively unusual for a government to delegate parameters of welfare policy to a broadcasting company in an attempt to save money, and it is perhaps not surprising that this may have unintended consequences. “The BBC’s decision to means-test free TV licences via a link to pension credit receipt may well raise welfare spending by more than it reduces BBC spending ... The net effect on the public finances would therefore be to push the budget deficit up not down.” Stressing the move posed a fresh risk to public coffers, the OBR goes on: “The likely cost of the BBC’s recent decision to means-test free TV licences for the over-s by linking it to pension credit – thereby potentially prompting a material number of those currently not taking it up to do so – poses a fiscal risk that we had not previously envisaged.

Someone who denies what they appear to be, who professes to be one of the good guys working for a better world in which there just happens to be fewer of one sort of person, is harder still, because they simply refuse to be diagnosed.  Weaposre living in a world where absolutely everyone is racist. Donald Trump is a white racist. He says his critics are black racists. Jeremy Corbyn is called an anti-Semite. His supporters say Jews are Islamophobes. The comfortable, globe-spanning civilisation we lived in about  years ago has become a place filled with tribes who tell everyone  theyaposre in the wrong tribe.Thing is, the rest of the world has always been like that. Where the white enslaved the black, where those left behind warred with neighbours, where the Chinese now fight for control with Russians, where Nigerians or Australians or Venezuelans or Hutus or Tutsis are blamed for the remainder of problems. Itaposs just that now, everyone on the planet has the same madness. The Westaposs problem is not racism. It is that its tribe has shrunk - the us is no longer NATO, the United Nations, Europe, or the special relationship. Every tie that bound us into a larger group has been severed in a funding row of some sort, and the only tribes we have left are the ones we were born into.So a Jew who found a home in the Labour Party is now just a Jew. A Muslim whose values chimed with the Tories is now talking at mosque, not the constituency association. And a white Briton, like a white American, is ing to the past.Everyoneaposs going back to where they came from, and hates it.  Racism won when Donald Trump was elected leader of the Free World, that loose tribe we used to be members of. A man who said Mexicans were all rapists, who refused to let apartments to blacks  years ago, shouted at us until we were numbed. Like a patient whoaposs had too much electro-shock therapy, weaposre dazedly asking ourselves whether racism is really that racist.Because Trump says it, the same question is asked on radio phone-ins, on TV talk shows, in newspaper columns, pubs, workplaces, family dinners. The rest of the world is awful, says a tribe that doesnapost notice its own failings. Why donapost the awful people fix their awfulness  Thataposs pretty awful too, butyouaposre offended at that theyaposll be offended right back. For once, there really ARE good people on both sides, taking offence at the suggestion their tribe is less than perfect and the other might just be right.And now all of them are asking, out loud, what your ethnicity is, and comparing it to their own.   If tribalism was a good idea, weaposd all be happier right now. Africa would have been the most cheerful place on the planet for centuries, and the Labour Party would be thriving on its splits.But tribes make us smaller. Smaller in the head, in ambition, in influence and in power. A single building block cannot build a damned thing, and reducing ourselves to a unit of our birth is like evolution in reverse.We are at the edge of the swamp, looking at a place filled with things that slither and crawl, where there are no alliances and lots of death. A place where four legal citizens of a nation are called disloyal for wanting it to be a better place, where there are more guns than there are people, and where nutjobs call themselves a well-regulated militia able to gun down any target they choose.They forget that those who were dferent were the ones who survived the swamp. They grew fins and gills, then legs and lungs, and decided to live somewhere better.   If you are asked your ethnicity, there is only one answer. We are all % African. Thereaposs not a human on the planet who is indigenous aside from those who live in the Great Rt Valley of East Africa, and thereaposs no room for us all to go back there. Yet we introduce domestic abuse legislation that does not apply to migrants, and we free victims of human trafficking and send them right back to the places where they were enslaved. Trump is not responsible for the tribalism which has infected our race. Heaposs just ridden a wave which started in the  financial crisis, a wave similar to the one which started in the Great Depression and brought us the Nazis.But his praise of Nazis, his uttering of Nazi tropes, his constant ision of humans into smaller units, has enabled the same things to be discussed and done where in the world. Get rid of him, and America will have enabled the rest of the world to straighten its tie and tell the Nazis to shut up. Trumpaposs tribalism is useful. It will, one day soon, cause the USA to question its founding principles, reinvent its dream, correct the religious fundamentalism, slavery and narrow-mindedness with which it has been cursed for  years, and rebuild. That cannot, and will not, happen without Trump to kick against - evolution requires an existential threat.    When America unites, others will follow. Perhaps because tribalism just had its day, and perhaps because of coincidental global economic growth. But itaposs a matter of when, not , because innovation and improvement is inevitable in everything, except minds of hardliners in ISIS and the Republican Party.Death will come to Trump, one day, and maybe even the taxman. The voters will probably take him first, along with the financial realities of trade wars. If you ide your enemies, all you get is more enemies. Brexit is a dead end. Corbyn has nothing to do but fail. Putin, Duterte, Salvini, all aposstrong menapos rely upon tribes that do not question them, because they cannot withstand a question.When this tribalism dies - and it will - you must make sure to kill it everywhere. It lived on in Africa, Asia and the Pacic Rim because you left them behind, last time. Progressive is not an insult. Itaposs the only way forward, and everyone needs to move. We are not racist. We are the human race, a team of billions who all want to live somewhere better.

Technically the government won on a limited point in the case, brought by a -year-old man known as aposMMapos. But five judges, led by Supreme Court President Lady Hale, also said benefit chiefs should interpret a key rule on qualying for PIP more broadly than they currently do. Mind said this detail of the ruling is crucial, and could help thousands of people who struggle in social situations.  MM was rejected for PIP because assessors said he didnapost need social support to engage with other people. Instead assessors said he only needed prompting to engage with people - a definition that carries fewer points under the scoring system for PIP. The Department for Work and Pensionsdefended the decision on two counts. First, the DWP said social support meant someone trained and experienced in assisting people - not just a friend.And secondly, the DWP said the supporter has to bepresent at the timesomeone is trying to engage socially.But the five Supreme Court judges said this second part of the definition was too narrow.    They wrote: Social support is likely to take many dferent forms, depending on the inidual needs of the claimant,. It is undesirable to attempt to prescribe, in the abstract, which other forms of support will be sufficient. It will be a question of fact and degree, and is something that will have to be worked out on a case by case basis. Mind spokeswoman Sophie Corlett said: This is a landmark moment in the ongoing battle to make sure disabled people are supported through our benefits system to live well. Far too many are struggling to claim benefits they need because of draconian assessments, which often fail to take fully into account the impact a mental health problem can have. Mind hopes, that, with this ruling, thousands more will be able to benefit from much needed help.

And the bride-to-be - who had previously changed her surname by deed poll during a relationship with the Statue of Liberty - has decided to seek a commitment ceremony to her chandelier known as Lumiere.    Whilst the Leeds native acknowledges that she canapost marry her love in the traditional way later this year, she is determined to prove her love exists - and is worth just as much as marriage between humans. Amanda said: Iaposm determined to have this commitment ceremony, to prove that Iaposm here for Lumiere and that my love is going to last. I restore the chandeliers in my spare time so they can continue to interest people as they like to be the centre of attention, thataposs what they like and its the energy I get from them. Iaposm not sure what dress Iaposll wear and will invite those closest to us. Iaposll also be buying matching wedding rings for Lumiere and myself. I know a lot of people think my attraction to chandeliers is strange, but Iaposm not crazy. I have been polishing Lumiere most nights to ensure she looks her best too.    When in a relationship with aposLibbyapos otherwise known as the Statue of Liberty, Amanda struggled with the long distance and turned to her chandeliers. And whilst Lumiere is now the true light of her le, Amanda still holds a candle for Libby, having adorned her house with memorabilia celebrating the New York native. After buying Lumiere online from Germany, she re-assembled the  year old chandelier, and claims that their relationship went from strength to strength - despite the  year age gap. Amanda said: Lumiere was originally aposbornapos in Germany  years ago, and is in wide. She first caught my eye when I stumbled across her on Ebay - I had no idea she was my soon-to-be we. I spent £ shipping her over from Europe and it really was love at first sight.    As soon as Iaposd seen her, I couldnapost stop thinking about her and how beautul she was - she has such a beautul shape, and I could feel really amazing energy coming from her. I knew there and then she had to be mine. Lumiere and all of my chandeliers have their own special personalities. Lumiere is too big to take to bed with me, but she doesnapost mind when I spend time with the others. Some objectum sexual people believe that their partners talk to them, but I know that Lumiere communicates dferently. She doesnapost exist or live in the way we do they give off energy to show me how theyaposre feeling.

In her former le as a TV actress, thereaposs a good chance Meghan would have responded to the rumours personally, possibly by posting a comment on social media or her popular blog The Tig.

Speaking to Nine News Australia, she said: “I think really she [Meghan] is doing incredibly well. “It’s very dficult when you come from a celebrity background where a publicist can stand up for you or come out and say ‘no, that report is categorically untrue.’ “But, generally speaking, members of the public follow the Queen Mother’s well-worn mantra: ‘Never complain, never explain.’ “And so you have to sit back while the world’s media and social media just comment.

The coupleaposs builders planned to do further extensive work in the garden of Frogmore Cottage .But the Duke and Duchess of Sussex changed their mind about the design of the garden after they were granted planning permission by their local council. Newly released documents show that the couple are now seeking retrospective planning consent for external landscaping works’’ after opting for a dferent design. They could be forced to reverse the work at their padplanning consent is refused.      The royal couple moved into the Grade II listed Frogmore Cottage on the Windsor Estate in April ahead of the birth of their first child Archie. The cottage received an extensive £. million renovation funded by £.m from the taxpayer and £, from themselves, according to sources. The cottage was gted to the Duke and Duchess by the Queen last year, with Kensington Palace confirming the move in November, saying Windsor was a very special place for the couple. Frogmore Cottage is located near of Windsor Castle, the Queenaposs summer residence, and St Georgeaposs Chapel, where Harry and Meghan tied the knot in May as millions around the world watched on TV. Ian Ratclfe, project manager at the Royal Household said in an email to the council’s planning enforcement team: “This application has been submitted following a material change to elements to the granting of planning consent.” Under planning law, a retrospective planning application is submitted to the councila change is made to a property that requires planning permission and approval has not been sought.    A local authority can also request that a retrospective planning application is submitted for the work that has already carried out. However, it does not mean that planning permission will automatically be granted and the application will be treated in the usual way. If the retrospective application is refused, the local authority can issue an enforcement notice which could require the couple to reverse any changes made to Frogmore Cottage. Under the plans revealed by a well-placed royal source last month, the plans include provision for a tennis or badminton court at the coupleaposs Windsor home. There are also said to be plans for exterior painting and landscaping, the installation of security lights and the planting of £,-worth of fast-growing shrubs and trees.  Several baby friendly features for the couple’s child Archie as well as a vegetable garden so the couple can grow their own produce are also included.

I’ve been here before and won - with a last-minute winner, so you just take it, you take the win and get up the road.”Robbie was pleased to see winning goal scorer Butcher back in the starting line-up for the first time since he tore a groin muscle during May’s play-off games.Having handed starts to Louis Appereand Logan Chalmers , he was pleased with their contributions as well.“Calum gives us that stability we’re looking for in there. I thought Ian Harkes did well there as well and Sam Stanton did very well when he came on.“I thought the kids did well. Like many kids, their decision-making is something they can get better at, but both had good moments in the game.“They have worked hard during the close season, so they deserved the chance to come in and there are a couple of other young ones in the background who will get game time in the coming weeks. The future is bright for the place.”After drawing at Hearts in their opener, United are now sitting on four points in Group A, a point behind the Jambos.With home ties against Cowdenbeath on Friday and East Fe next Tuesday to come, they are looking good to progress as one of the second-placed teams with the best record.“All in all it’s been good. Three points from this one and we’re sitting with four points after the draw at Tynecastle and a hard game here. We now go into two home games and we know what we have to do.”"},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-memories-of-happy-days-gone-by-in-glasgow","story":"Images from the archives of the Herald and Evening Times."},{"url":null,"title":"irn-bru-cancel-noel-gallagher-branded-scotland-third-world-country-lewis-capaldi-spat","story":"Irn-Bru have CANCELLED Oasis legend Noel Gallagher after the singer took another pop at Lewis Capaldi in the pairs bizarre rivalry."},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-recognise-old-pictures-glasgow","story":"Images from the archives of the Herald and Times Group."},{"url":null,"title":"barras-founder-maggie-mciver-greatest-glaswegian","story":"WHO do you think is the greatest Glaswegian of all time  The summer we are showcasing the top  men and woman who have put the city on the map.

consultation","story":"Calls have been made to halt a consultation on options for dualling a major north-east road.North-east Labour MSP Lewis Macdonald has written to Transport Secretary Michael Matheson urging him to put the brakes on a consultation into the project to dual the A between Huntly and Aberdeen.He has also made repeated calls for transport bosses to reconsider ruling out dualling the road along its existing route.Mr Macdonald said: “At a recent meeting in Inverurie, representatives from the local A Action Group were able to put forward their case for putting the option back on the table to representatives from Transport Scotland and Amey Arup.“Neither Transport Scotland nor Amey Arup have yet been able to provide a clear explanation of why this option was deselected so early and failed during the meeting to answer the Action Group’s compelling arguments.“I have now written to Michael Matheson making this clear, and urging him to bring a halt to the consultation so it can be reopened with Online Inverurie as an option, which the public can be invited to comment on.”Transport Scotland has faced repeated calls to justy why dualling the existing A Aberdeen to Inverness road at Inverurie has not been included in proposals to widen the route.Campaigners have claimed the option has been “rejected prematurely” on “flawed and incomplete” information.However, Mr Matheson previously claimed the dropped option would result in the loss of some properties and gardens of residents along the existing route.But Mr Macdonald said the option would only have an impact on neighbouring propertiesthey built the road to a higher standard than the AWPR – meaning it would be a wider road.He added: “If you dual the existing route at the current standard then you don’t have the impact on properties.”A Transport Scotland spokesman said: “Re-use of the existing route between East of Huntly and Aberdeen has been investigated thoroughly as part of the design and assessment process.“Due to a number of factors, such as the existing trunk road alignment and the impact on existing roadside properties, as well as the high number of junctions and accesses, the assessment concluded it would be more suitable to develop the new dual carriageway offline from the existing trunk road at Inverurie, with the existing A retained for use as part of the local road network.“However, some of the options under consideration do include sections of online upgrade on other parts of the route where this is feasible.“The consultation is now closed and all feedback received is vital and will be taken into consideration as we look to identy a preferred option for the scheme later this year.”"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 25","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowFiona McCuish of Ardrishaig captured the VIC puffer wending its way up the Crinan Canal.Fiona used her camera phone as the vessel passed through West Bank, Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 28 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat is it with recruiting #professionals# to Argyll We seem to be a distinctly unattractive prospect, as witnessed by the problems with recruiting a dentist in Lochgilphead.What people fail to appreciate is that they stand to gain so much more than they would lose by coming to Argyll.The scenery is unrivalled the pace of le is civilised we are not that far from the central belt and a sense of community remains.Just turn to our front page story for proof.Disappointment at losing out on council grant funding has turned into joy in Tarbert.But only because the people of the village have such big hearts, as they have demonstrated in the past.The council may argue that this vindicates its decision to refuse funding.

Peter O#Neil edged out Penrice in race one, but Penrice would take his revenge in race two and it was all to play for in the final encounter. Peter O#Neil was up to the task and would take the overall, with Penrice a deserved second and  Damian Carter would third.The four stroke class was enthralling, with Sam Sibbald thundering around the Kilmartin track, big Andy Malloch and his Armstrong chasing him all the way to the flag and winning the final race but not the overall. Sam would be the victor followed by Andy and a consistent Keith Stanford third.For the youth class it was a day of mixed fortunes and consistency would be the key, with Jordan Graham coming out on top ahead of James Forrest and picking up a superb third overall was Rhys Brown.Pre- action would see committee man and track builder Grant McClure and his Maico, with three decades of riding under his belt, become the overall winner ahead of Callum Wilson on the superbly prepared Honda.The Twinshock under cc event would be a three race win for the flying Calum Kilgour and his cc Yamaha ahead of Jim Grieve, who would have some bike issues but would bring home his Honda in second fighting off a very persistent David Lawson and Gordon Peterson but it would be Gordon that would hold the third place trophy with some consistent riding.The Twinshock open class event would be a spectacular sight as cc Hondas and Maicos battled their way around the bracken.In race one there was a very small gap between first and second place and a similarly small gap between third. Brian Alexander would take the win from Craig ‘Smitch’ Smith, and John Crawford would come home in third with a notable mention to the very unlucky Paul Chiappa who had his fair share of misfortunes throughout the day, as his seat was torn from his bike at the top of one of the steep climbs. The overall would end up the same as the first race with Brian, taking the win from Craig Smith and John Crawford bringing the big Honda home in third.In the over s class it was a triumphant day for John Lamont with three resounding victories. Johnny Rutherford was second, a great result for the club sponsor, with David Watson bringing home the Honda with some consistent rides.For the group three races Robert Bell took the honours from Allan Shields and Bryan Colligan, all of these riders deserving a notable mention and with some very similar lap times and some quick racing in trying conditions.The clubman class was great to watch, with some fast up-and-coming riders such as Peter Rennie, Callum Laird and Stuart Wilson all angling for the win. Rennie would take the overall from Laird in second and  Wilson in third.The evolution class was again the Paul and Tom show. In what must have been the fastest racing all day, it would be Paul #PJ# Johnston who would take overall honours with three wins and Tom Grant would take the runner-up slot followed home ably by a consistent Roy Potts taking the third place.In the final block of racing it would be a win apiece for Jordan McDonald, Shaun Robertson, and John Kenny, but it would be the ever improving Shaun Robertson, ing from injury, who would take overall honours from a rapidly improving John Kenny in second and #Mr Consistent# Karl Livingstone in third.Results:Group Pre- class:  Grant McClure  Callum Wilson.

Apart from the cones on the street, we never had any issues with bad parking or disturbance from people attending the event.ldquoI could hear some music on the evenings but I liked the atmosphere and it certainly wasnrsquot a nuisance.

Most people are excited about the prospects and possible future developments here, and Irsquod hate people to get the wrong impression of the overall community support based on the reported views of a few people who were disturbed in the eventrsquos first year.ldquoHaving said that, I hope the organisers take on board the negative feedback and incorporate improvements into any future events.

The day after the crash, Superintendent Jim Guy of Strathclyde Police said there had been no evidence from the crew of any problems before the tragedy.He said the evidence available suggested an accident rather than terrorist attack. The scene of the crash was sealed off almost immediately and an air exclusion zone was imposed.Although most of the wreckage was left for accident investigators to examine, it is understood Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch officers removed boxes and cases containing secret papers on Friday morning.On Saturday,  personnel from RAF Machrihanish were drafted in to help find and catalogue debris from the crash.FIFTY YEARS AGOKintyre could be surfers# MeccaKintyre could become the major centre in Britain for surfingthe enthusiasm of two young men gets the encouragement it deserves.One of them, George Raynes, of Bishopbriggs in Lanarkshire, is secretary of the Scottish Surf Club, and with his treasurer, James Short of Glasgow, has just completed a preliminary survey of several of the Kintyre beaches with a view to exploiting them for the sport of surfing.George has surfed on beaches all over Britain and also in the Channel Isles and in Europe and he thinks that the beaches at Machrihanish and Southend could become the Mecca for British surfers and the venue for the British Championships.He was particularly impressed with the waves at Machrihanish but thinks Southend has great potential as well.He told the Courier: #The possibilities here are tremendous. These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area. In the winter one would have to wear a wetsuit, of course, but the conditions are ideal and the wave forms have great potential # after all, they are coming straight in from the Atlantic over the north of Ireland.#What I#d like to see is a surf club established in Campbeltown. It could become a great asset from a tourist and amenity point of view.#And any Kintyre people who really took up the sport would have a great advantage over other surfers when it comes to competition because they have the benefit of readily available beaches all year round.#If this club gets going, the chances are that the British surf champions in the years to come will be Kintyre people.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOOrr Ewing CupFootballers were favoured with beautul weather last Saturday and the games played on Kinloch Park in the Orr Ewing Cup competition brought together very large gatherings of spectators.The match in the afternoon was brought to a sudden termination by an unfortunate dispute over the award of a goal. The opposing teams were Kintyre and HMS Thames.Kintyre opened strongly and after  minutes# play had scored twice. The dispute arose over the award of the second goal, which Thames claimed to be offside.The referee, Mr Duncan McCallum, an old Hearts player, was of a dferent opinion, and on his allowing Kintyre the goal, the naval team without more do walked off the field.It is understood that the Thames team intimated to the league at the weekly meeting on Monday night their withdrawal from the competition.The teams were: Kintyre # Jas McKinlay: James Black and Archd Sharp: M Muir, A McCrank and T Cameron: R McGeachy and D Brown: Dan McNaughton: N Scally and J Donaldson.HMS Thames # Meese: Jesseman and Love: McCloud, Hirst and Fernie: Dunnell and Weekes: McGeachy: Slynn and Segrott.Referee # Mr D McCallum.In the evening, the opposing teams were Campbeltown and Kilbrannan. A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"letter open letter to dog owners","story":"While responsible dog owners take care to ensure their dogs are under control at all times, there are still a number who do not # and seem unaware of the potential consequences of their actions.There has been a disturbing rise in the number of sheep and other livestock attacks, and we are hoping to enlist your help in raising awareness of dog #worrying# which will, in turn, assist the authorities, farmers and land-users.If a dog worries livestock on any agricultural land the owner, or person in charge of the animal at the time, is guilty of a criminal offence.Section  of the DogsAct  defines #worrying# as:Such incidents cause distress to the animals and often lead to them being injured and or killed.

It is better than some human beings are treated ndash that is the sad truth.Mr Farnsworth was presenting an annual report on the racecoursersquos performance over the last financial year.The Beast from the East snow storm, an outbreak of equine influenza, and a long spell of dry weather all contributed to what he described as one of the worst years the course had been through in his memory.A number of key fixtures were cancelled and profits fell.In December, four horses died during one day of racing at the course but a subsequent review by the British Horseracing Authority ruled that the course and race organisers were not at fault.Councillor Gordon Mackett asked Mr Farnsworththe racecourse had been affected by animal welfare concerns.The course manager said: ldquoWe did have a horrible day when there were four fatalities however, these were all completely separate incidents.ldquoIn a sport like this you will get injuries and fatalities from time to time.

History is the way we view and see things that happened in the past. That view is limited by a number of factors. The availability of surviving records and evidence is one.The vast majority of what happened in the past is inevitably lost to us. This is true even for our own personal memories. So history is the small tip of the iceberg of events and times gone by, brought to the surface by the survival of some accounts more than others.And these records are never unbiased. Often historical records and evidence are purposely partial, influenced by ideology and personal allegiances. But all are biased in some way, as the limited viewpoint and interests of those recording events is based on their experience or motives.As a result, we can only see historical events through a narrow keyhole, with most characters and goings on out of view. Itrsquos the common people who are most always invisible in history. Our own ideological preference and belief in what is important will then affect how we interpret the limited evidence we have.This is why history is often subject to furious debate, and rightly so. Irsquod say itrsquos almost impossible not to allow our own perspectives, interests and values to influence the way we interpret the broader meaning of historical events and their signicance for contemporary society.Such a debate is being had in East Lothian just now, as to the name of the new town to be built on the Blindwells site, between Prestonpans and Longniddry and just to the north of Gladsmuir and Tranent.The name can be romantically translated to mean lsquohidden springsrsquo and it was across this once-marshy ground that the Jacobites crept stealthily at night to mount a surprise attack on the Redcoats on September , . That famous battle lasted  minutes and was a victory for the Jacobites, and the launchpad of Bonnie Prince Charliersquos march into England.Consequently, the Scottish Battlefields Trust has submitted a petition, as reported in the Courier last week, to name the new community Charlestoun and build a statue of Charles.When I was at school, he seemed a dashing and heroic figure. The songs and stories about him are infectious and I totally understand how the stories told about him have created a romantic and thrilling image.But then I studied the topic in more depth, at both university and afterwards. The period has suffered from the romantic treatment but there are fascinating stories of loyalty and sacrice to a man who, in reality, saw the common people chiefly as cannon fodder for his personal and family ambitions.It is for this reason I feel there are enough name places and statues to aristocratic and powerful men whose main historical role was to make and wage war, evenhe has a famous and romantic reputation.This is not to say we shouldnrsquot remember the fascinating history of the area, including that fateful day of battle when the Jacobites crossed the land.But itrsquos how we commemorate it and who we include. What makes the Jacobite period truly fascinating is the tapestry of stories of the many people involved, on both sides. It was a brutal time, in which there was certainly deep loyalty on both sides, but there were many other reasons why people found themselves on one side or the other. It was a brutal civil war, brought on by the aspirations of the exiled Stuarts.Do we commemorate the memory of the man who caused that war or do we commemorate those who were caught up in it  Is it really the case thatwe do the former we do the latter  Irsquom not convinced.There are other stories to consider of course for the site. There was coal mining there for generations. The lives of mining families, men, women and children who toiled in horric conditions, still remains mostly unheralded by history. Maybe itrsquos not lsquoromanticrsquo enough. Likewise with farming, which was a constant economic activity in the area for generations.There was also another unusual underground activity on the site after the early mine closed. Smugglers made an illegal whisky still deep down in the mine shaft once it was disused. It took a while for the customs men to realise East Lothian had an illicit whisky-making enterprise deep below ground in the old mine workings. When they finally raided the mine, they found the still, but no sign of the makers of the whisky. It kind of gives new meaning to the name lsquohidden springsrsquo!It is suggested the children in schools should have the final say in the new name, which is a great idea. But let our children be introduced to all aspects of our local history and allow them to understand how the way history is taught influences what we believe is important in contemporary society as well, and that there is no lsquocorrectrsquo view on this.Irsquod love to be part of that discussion and debate."},{"url":null,"title":"parents-launch-petition-school-bus-operator-change","story":"Families whose children attend two secondary schools in East Lothian were stunned to discover that local firm PrenticeCoaches would no longer be used to transport the youngsters when schoolsafter the summer.The news was broken to them by Prentice, which is based in Haddington, last week, sparking a furious reaction from a number of parents.Now a petition has been launched calling for Prentice to have the contract, which has allegedly been awarded to a rival firm, given back.One mother whose children attend Knox Academy in Haddingtonand are bussed in from Gford said that she was shocked by the news.She said: ldquoPrentice have been looking after our children for  years and they are being replaced with no consultation or discussion.ldquoParents know the drivers and trust them to look after their children.ldquoIt is beyond belief that the council would simply put a dferent company in place without even consulting with the families affected.A petition calling for theof Prentice has collected more than  signatures since it was launched online.It says: ldquoPrentice provide a community service where parents feel reassured and comfortable putting their children on the buses.ldquoWe believe East Lothian [Council] has chosen to put cost over service and safety.ldquoThere is absolutely nothing wrong with the current service.ldquoThis is simply a cost-cutting exercise which could potentially put our children at risk.Prentice provided bus services for Knox Academy and North Berwick High School but has now lost the contract for those services.Ross Prentice, the company boss, admitted that he was ldquodisappointed by the councilrsquos decision.The company said: ldquoIt is a sad day.

by its current pharmacies.The committee also stated that there was too long a wait between the Consultation Analyst Reportand the hearing as over a year had passed, which it felt rendered the findings out of date.Representatives from the current Tranent pharmacies ndash Lloyds Pharmacy and Well Tranent, both on High Street ndash were present at the committee hearing and both claimed that they had already addressed any issues that were raised in the consultation and therefore problems raised by the CAR were no longer applicable.There was also a question over whether the premises planned for the new pharmacy at  Bridge Street would be large enough to support the planned two consultation rooms and dispensary area, which the committee felt raised the issue of whether appropriate confidentiality was possible.Letters of support for the pharmacy were submitted by Tranent and Elphinstone Community Council and ward councillor Kenny McLeod among others however, the committee felt that none of these letters ldquospecied needs which were currently not being met.Pharmacy applicant Niamh Morrison visited the community council to thank members for their support over the process and to assure them that she would be launching an appeal.She said: ldquoI am of course very disappointed.ldquoI really believe that this community needs this, and I have developed a real soft spot for the area.ldquoThe appeal process unfortunately wonrsquot be quick, it could take years.ldquoI just wanted to thank you all for the support that you have given us.The rejection comes not long after Tranent Medical Practice announced that it would be suspending advanced appointments due to a shortage of GPrsquos.Robert McNeill, a member of the community council, said: ldquoFrom a personal point of view, Irsquom very disappointed.ldquoTranent surgery is not unique in its problems and the pharmacy could have added extra services within the community.David Forrest, chairman of the community council added with regards the letter that the group had drafted to support the application: ldquoThe letters that we wrote came from the heart, we really feel that this was what was best for our community.ldquoWe are incredibly disappointed with the decision, and fully support Niamh in her appeal.ldquoWe will be writing to our local MP and MSP to register our frustration at the situation.ldquoThe decision is very short-sighted.The decision comes as planning permission in principle has been approved for  houses at Windygoul South, though the committee determined that both Lloyds and Well Tranent were able to increase capacity should ldquoproposed housebuilding occur locally.Ward councillor Kenny McLeod said: ldquoWith the new houses on their way, the town will need extra pharmacies and more GPs.ldquoIrsquom so disappointed that the pharmacy has been rejected, I really think we need

You could call it cowardice, the reluctance to see the player I wanted to win, but suspected would not, brought low. Such was the fight Federer put up, however, that by the fourth set I had rediscovered my nerve, and was back on the sofa, strapped in safely to prevent me hitting the ceiling whenever he won a rally.When Djokovic finally prevailed, the cameras politely kept off Federer for a few moments. Not that it would have made much dference. Unlike the French player who had sobbed uncontrollably after conceding the menrsquos doubles final, the Swiss maestro is made of sterner stuff. Of course being worsted must have been hard. The ferocity of the game spoke to how much each player wanted to win. As the football pundits like to say, this pair left nothing in the changing room, throwing their hearts and souls into combat, and playing through a level of exhaustion only marathon runners can fully comprehend.In a previous age, a duel of this signicance would have resulted in one contestant being carried, mortally wounded, off the field. From that perspective, Federerrsquos defeat ndash a silver salver and a substantial cheque ndash is still victory of a sort. In a gracious speech, he acknowledged Djokovicrsquos brilliance. The new Wimbledon champion was equally sporting, talking of the inspiration he took from Federer, not just for playing so well at , but throughout his remarkable career.Whatever encouragement thirty-something athletes take from the Swissrsquos astonishing performance, there is inspiration also in his acceptance of the result. To read and listen to sports coverage ndash indeed discussion of all competitive realms of le ndash such is the lionising of those who do well, defeat has become a dirty word.

We donrsquot expect to be first in everything ndash some of us donrsquot expect to be first in anything. From the offset, nature seems to train us to accept a hierarchy of ability. First-class cricketers are not necessarily so adept at maths or art or baking a sponge.

In whatever area you name, publicly falling short of a goal is something all of us will experience. Whether itrsquos not getting a job, or losing an election, getting on to a prize shortlist but tripping at the last hurdle, there is only room for one victor in every competitive situation. Since statistically we are likely to fall short more often than we win, we should be given guidance in how to cope. I donrsquot mean we should expect failure ndash though Presbyterianism offers a first-class DIY course in defeatism ndash but that we should be taught how to handle it. And by that I donrsquot mean denial.Listening to sports figures, politicians, or business leaders finding positives even when theyrsquove been trounced, is almost a sport in itself. It seems the very thought of not being the best has been brainwashed out of all competitors lest it influence their performance. Surely, though, we need to embrace coming in second place, or lower, in a healthy way  Defeat is to victory what day is to night, but to live in perpetual sunshine is unsustainable and, frankly, unthinkable.Phil Neville, coach of the England womenrsquos football squad, was refreshingly unafraid to discuss the f-word. He did not want an open-top bus parade when the team ed home after coming fourth in the World Cup. That, he said, would be to celebrate failure. He now wants the team to focus on learning how to win. Hersquos absolutely right, yet one hopes that this process will include a dose of realism, a cushioning of expectations, that allows for coming up short without a crisis of self-belief or losing face.Federerrsquos reactions after the final were a lesson in precisely that. He acknowledged that he and Djokovic had both had their chances to win, and he had blown his.

Mr Hunt thought it was not helpful to use that kind of language about the US President. In other words, donrsquot say what you see. Wrap your measured, liberal response in pretty paper and tie it up with a silky ribbon. That will show him.: Why Iain Macwhirter is lookingforward to a Johnson premiershipThe House of Representatives did the necessary, prompting the President to double down by declaring he did not have a racist bone in his body. If only an X-ray could pick up such things. Even then there would be some running shy of the diagnosis. It was left to George Conway, husband of Trump aide Kellyanne Conway no less, to say it like he saw it. In a piece for the Washington Post, Mr Conway, a lawyer, wrote that he had thought the President boorish, dim-witted, inarticulate, incoherent, narcissistic and insensitive. ldquoNo matter how much I found him ultimately unfit, he added, ldquoI still gave him the benefit of the doubt about being a racist. But Sunday left no doubt. Naivete, resentment and outright racism, roiled in a toxic mix, have given us a racist president.

As for the aftermath, a country even more ided than it currently is, donrsquot worry about that for now,you ever do.

Inyesterday,  Labour peers laid the same charge at Jeremy Corbynrsquos door for his negligence in tackling anti-Semitism within the party.ldquoYou have failed to defend our partyrsquos anti-racist values, said the advertisement paid for by the peers. ldquoYou have therefore failed the test of leadership. Quite the eyebrow scorcher. No wonder Theresa May brandished it at the Labour leader during PMQs yesterday.: Suspension of parliament being consideredIt was notable that the signatories to the letter mentioned the Panorama whistleblowers, the former party staff who defied non-disclosure agreements to speak out. Almost all of them were young and at the beginning of their careers. They were risking a lot, and the strain of dealing with so much hate, and seeing accusations filed away with zero action taken, took its toll. Several found their mental health suffering. One contemplated suicide.It was left to these youngsters, as it was left to the four congresswomen in the US, to make a stand against, and to suffer the consequences of, other peoplersquos failure to lead. The older, the wiser, the more experienced and powerful, might come along in time, but they could not be counted on.Accepted wisdom has it that we are living in the era of the populist strongmen. The Trump, the Orban, the Putin, the Duterte. How did it happen  Because as societies we were seduced by the notion of simplicity. Le was busy and stressful, the political problems we faced were complex and seemingly intractable, the pace of change was unrelenting. Along came people who said they had the answers. Who said donrsquot listen to those so-called ldquoexperts who tell you things cannot be done. Who promised to sort things out because it was all very simple, really.: Easier to believe lie than seek truthThe phenomenon was not the sole preserve of the seemingly strong, or men. It was Theresa May, after all, who coined the phrase ldquoBrexit means Brexit and look at the chaos she unleashed. Nor is it only to be seen on the right. Mr Corbyn, or rather his closest aides, operate like a collective strongman, treating any criticism as an attack that must be crushed.There are indeed answers to societyrsquos ills, and at heart we know what they are. Homelessness  Build more houses, and tackle the deep rooted problems that brought the person to sleep on the streets. Itrsquoll cost you, and it wonrsquot be easy. End child poverty  Not cheap, and it will take time. No NHS waiting lists  Open your purse and expect a wait. Save the planet  Extremely expensive, as well as a pain in the backside. So much easier to believe in the simple answer or turn the other way.One would like to think the pendulum was about to swing back, as people began to see that this drive for simplicity was exacting its own price, whether it be in ever widening inequality or worsening social stre. But then this time next week, barring an upset, we will witness Boris Johnson becoming PM. Mr Johnson is a king among Simple Simons. This is a man whose answers to problems are so snappy they can fit on the side of a bus. A man who oozes laziness, who reeks of the quick fix that turns out to be the bodge job, who changes his position to please whoever he is speaking to at the time.The irony is that far from being strong, what all these leaders have in common is their weakness, and that will begin to show itself when their fortunes change.

A rainbow highland cow. His Ayr company went into liquidation this week, however. It had a turnover of pound.million and employed  staff. Cash flow and creditor pressure were blamed. Last year, Brown sold his Oor Wullie and Big Tam McCoo painting for pound,.The loss of  jobs is a personal tragedy for everyone affected, and Brown is a man hard not to admire. He found fame and wealth after overcoming two heart attacks and battled depression to build an instantly recognisable brand. Brown and his staff deserve every success ndash you can only hope they rise again.However, itrsquos the use of the word lsquoartrsquo when it comes to Brown and his business which troubles me. Is this really Scottish art  If so, what does it say about Scotland  In fact, what does it say about the west  Therersquos little dference substantively when it comes to the cultures of Scotland, England, America, Australia and the rest of the anglophone countries. Culturally wersquore synced.:Steven Brown Art firm goes into liquidation with loss of  jobsArt should affect your soul. Art, in all its forms ndash music, literature, painting, sculpture, dance, cinema ndash should make you see the world in a new way, should illuminate some thought or feeling inside you that yoursquove never experienced before, art should let you look through another personrsquos eyes, art should change you. Art should make you angry, scared, elated, aroused ndash it should grab hold of your heart and mind and shake up the emotional world in which you live. Art should tell you truths you didnrsquot know or were too scared to learn. Art should make you feel awe, pity, wonderment. It should renew you and nourish you. Art should inspire and humble you.Does Brown do any of that  I feel his work is for people who neither like nor trust the idea of art. To me, Brownrsquos paintings are comfy. Brown provides prettiness and safety. Itrsquos a warm bath, and thatrsquos not art. Brownrsquos work is home decor, interior design. Itrsquos meant to make your living room attractive, not to touch your soul or change you.The irony is that while Brown may not be creating lsquoartrsquo, hersquos certainly reflecting culture. Our culture has become lsquocomfy-cosyrsquo, safe and unthreatening when it comes to art, literature and music. In that sense, Brown is entirely in keeping with a culture that doesnrsquot really value ideas.Therersquos a unormity about Brownrsquos art. Itrsquos there to fill a space ndash not in your heart, or soul, or mind ndash but on your wall. Therersquos also a grating ubiquity to Brownrsquos art, at least in Scotland. It fits with our mass-produced, mass-consumed culture. It sits easily alongside tribal tattoos, European city breaks, mindfulness, Love Island, Med holidays, Netflix and chill, retro breakfast cereal, breakfast for dinner, Ed Sheeran wedding songs, banter not a conversation, Sunday at the shopping mall, and arguments in Ikea. Itrsquos safe. Everyone does it. Itrsquos moribund.Itrsquos also understandable. Itrsquos not hard to work out why so many now chose cultural comfort rather than a cultural challenge. Our world is horrible. The news frightening. Bank accounts depleting. Hate festering. Progress offers only pain. Why not chose the equivalent of easy-listening when it comes to culture, rather than something which unsettles or questions you.:Neil Mackay: Why the Plan B path to independence reveals a world of pain for the SNPHowever,we wrap ourselves in a cultural comfort blanket wersquoll stagnate, calcy. Art is the hard abrasive necessary to keep culture on its toes, to fend off entropy.Wersquove ceased to exist lsquoinsidersquo culture. Now we lsquoconsumersquo culture from without. For something to be consumed it must be easily digestible. No wonder that bland art is called pablum ndash gruel made for weaning infants. And our lsquoartrsquo is infantilising us.Think of music. The common theme in so much mainstream music is \"yoursquore great, you can do it, the world will love you, success waits around the corner\". Le is a constant summer festival and sooner or later yoursquore going to take to the main stage. Literature has been reduced to what supermarket buyers think a good book is ndash a -page pitch for a B movie thatrsquoll never get made. Cinema is a repeating rhythm of superheroes.Mattel is creating a Barbie dressed as David Bowiersquos Ziggy Stardust for the adult market. Grown-ups queue to see Toy Story. No wonder. Wersquove made children of ourselves. Wersquore all guilty of it.Of course, great music, literature and cinema is still being made, but itrsquos increasingly pushed to the fringes, while the centre-ground keeps growing. Irsquom not saying therersquos no place for mere entertainment, and everything should be high art. Irsquom saying that the middle of the road is now the only path to travel.So much of culture is now like a recurring meme, reflecting how the digital rather than the artistic is now the great cultural driver. Perhaps, the meme is the biggest cultural development of late. Brownrsquos art is meme-like ndash he repeats the same images over and over. The simpler it is, the more wersquoll buy it.Our lsquocomfyrsquo culture makes even discussing such issues dficult. To subject Brown to scrutiny as his company fails will be seen by many as cruel instead of what it is: a timely assessment of someone with a position in Scottish culture. To wonder what people see in paintings like McCoo ndash to suggest money may be better spent on a good print from an art store ndash is to risk being labelled an elitist snob. What could be worse in our cosy anti-intellectual society But Brown should be subjected to scrutiny as he affects Scottish culture and how itrsquos perceived. His images of cows with Saltires on their horns are seen by the world as saying something about Scotland. To me, it risks saying that wersquore a sentimental and frivolous people. That we remain in our tartan shortbread tin. Itrsquos art for the kailyard.Our country brims with great artists of all disciplines. Our problem is that we pretend to care for them ndash when we really donrsquot.

Desertication, famine ndash all of it was there, all of it looped back to the environment and the way the climate was changing. It made sense to me that it was all linked.Fast forward a decade and Nyberg is studying law at the University of Aberdeen. ldquoI watched a video about a man who turned an Eritrean desert green by flooding it with sea water, he explains. ldquoThat was the lsquojumping off pointrsquo for me. It was a simple idea that solved so many problems at once ndash it helps carbon capture, fights climate change, creates valuable wetland eco systems from degraded land on our coasts, creates jobs and provides food.The -year-old, who lives in Glasgow, adds: ldquoI knew right away it was what I wanted to do.Nyberg is the founder of Seawater Solutions, a multi-award-winning Scottish start-up company. By developing a number of ways to grow salt-tolerant cropson degraded coastal land for food and bio-energy production, he is revolutionising farming here in Scotland and abroad.Modern agriculture and climate change have resulted in farmland being degraded and made useless. ldquoAround the world, more than % of land has been degraded. If we grow salt-tolerant plants in these areas, we can produce enough food to feed the world and can produce substantial amounts of bio-fuels.The companyrsquos first projects are erse: the UKrsquos first salt water farm in Ayrshire and an integrated aquaculture pilot farm in the Mekong Delta of Vietnam, which has introduced saline crops into existing shrimp farms, mitigating pollution.Projects in Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Senegal are next and Nyberg hopes more will follow. ldquoThe Ayrshire farm is our flagship UK project, he explains. ldquoWe are using renewable solar irrigation systems that irrigate coastal farms with nutrient-rich seawater, naturally fertilising saline crops without the need for chemical fertilisers or pesticides.Introducing saline agriculture for a greener futureldquoSo instead of potatoes, our partners introduce high-value crops such as samphire and sea lavender by replicating the wetland environments where they naturally occur. This creates natural defences along Scotlandrsquos coastlines that tackle erosion, storm surges, marine pollution, and threats from rising sea-levels.The company is also working with Scottish Natural Heritage and local wildle trusts to introduce plants which can lsquotake awayrsquo pollution and create places for insects, birds and sea creatures to thrive.Nyberg adds: ldquoI wanted to look at how this could be applied to dferent areas around the world. In Vietnam, for example, the shrimp industry is hugely polluting and I wanted to negate the need for chemicals. The plants we are using bioremediate, they filter out the waste and chemicals themselves. ldquoWersquore conducting market research into other uses for our plants, such as animal fodder, oils for cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries, and vegetarian food supplements for a growing market in South Asia.The company has launched a pilot trial in Sri Lanka, where hundreds of thousands of hectares of arable land have been destroyed because of rising sea-levels and the lasting impacts of the destructive tsunami that affected many countries in South Asia.Nyberg spent a year planning to launch the company during his Masters degree in environmental engineering at Strathclyde University. ldquoI wanted to look at how we could apply this to areas around the world, he explains. ldquoThat year at Strathclyde was perfect as it helped me to understand how I was going to do it. Irsquom very grateful for the support Irsquove had from Strathclyde and from the Royal Bank of Scotlandrsquos Entrepreneur Accelerator programme, which was invaluable.The programme, funded by RBS, provides benefits such as : coaching, access to business mentors and legal and technical advice from members. Nyberg is growing his staff ndash currently, there are four, supported by a team of interns working on research and development. ldquoWe all grew up together, mainly in Vietnam and somehow found each other again, he smiles.ldquoWe will be recruiting over the next few months and I am keen to collaborate with other like-minded start-ups too, for example in aquaculture.

They provide the grid with information to add more capacity when needed, change our electricity consumption patterns and make it easier to add electric vehicles , solar , wind turbines and heat pumps to the energy system.We all want an energy grid that is geared to the future, not to the past and to achieve big changes sometimes we have to start with small ones.

That is a price that Scotland must not - and will not ndash pay.The Commons vote came after the Lords strongly backed a bid to block Parliament being suspended to facilitate a no-deal exit by a margin of  votes on Wednesday.The change to the bill will require progress reports on restoring devolved government in Northern Ireland to be debated regularly in Parliament, effectively preventing it from being prorogued.Downing Street said forcing a report and debate every two weeks risks being \"counter-productive\" to the aim to restore the Stormont executive.The PMrsquos spokesman explained: \"We have been very clear that the purpose of this bill is to ensure the continuation of vital public services and effective governance for the people of Northern Ireland.\"In the light of the ongoing talks to restore the Executive our view is that forcing a report and debate every two weeks on the progress of those talks risks being counter-productive to this overarching aim.\"DUP MP Ian Paisley said: \"What is the outrage today is this is supposed to be a debate on the Northern Ireland Executive formation and has now been hijacked and turned into something to do with Brexit and every issue under the sun except the formation of the Executive, which now looks more unlikely as a result of this piece of legislation.\"On Wednesday at the Tory leadershiprsquos final hustings, Mr Johnson again refused to rule out proroguing Parliament to meet his red line of getting the UK out of the EU by October . By contrast, Mr Hunt has insisted he would not use such a constitutional manoeuvre.The amendment to the bill builds on an amendment passed in the Commons last week when MPs backed a proposal from the pro-European Tory Dominic Grieve calling for fortnightly reports from the Government on the efforts to restore the power-sharing executive.The new Lords amendment would ensure these have to be debated in the weeks before the Brexit deadline, thus making it theoretically illegal for the Government to prorogue Parliament in the autumnthe power-sharing executive in Northern Ireland had not been restored."},{"url":null,"title":"garioch sports centre serves up an ace with new tennis plans","story":"With the nation currently hooked on Wimbledon, it#s a fitting time for Garioch Sports Centre to unveil its new tennis-focused proposals.Inverurie Community Council has submitted fresh expansion plans to Aberdeenshire Council on behalf of Garioch Sports Holdings.Full planning permission was secured last year for a major extension of the Inverurie facility, but changes in the community’s requirements and pressures on funding have prompted a reduced development.Initially the plans would have seen the Burghmuir Drive centre expanding into one of the largest amenities of its kind in Scotland, incorporating tennis courts, a multi-sports arena, fitness suites and an all-weather G pitch for Inverurie Loco Works FC which has now been dropped.But while the scale of the expansion might not be as ambitious, the new plans do reveal tennis courts and improvements for fitness along with an Early Learning Centre for younger children.Thanks to signicant input from Judy Murray – mother of tennis stars Andy and Jamie – the plans feature three dedicated tennis courts and the centre has committed to a three-year partnership with the JM Foundation, highlighting the commitment of the centre to develop the sport across Garioch.The centre and JM Foundation will work in partnership in upskilling their workforce and identying potential coaches while funding coach education.In a supporting statement the centre writes: “The matter of securing the appropriate funding for the ious options which have been considered over the last couple of years has impacted upon how the plans have altered with the focus very much now being on the new tennis provision.“The most recent plans reflect the discussions with the Lawn Tennis Association and also Tennis Scotland.“The advice and guidance of Judy Murray has also been pivotal in how the plans particularly for the tennis courts have progressed.”The applicants also believe that despite the downturn in oil and gas and other industries, there is still a demand for its facilities.It reports: “As many of the activities and programmes now carry waiting lists, there is proof that despite a downturn in many industries the timing is now right to expand in tandem with the growth in participation and the increase in the town and rural residency.“An expansion of the present facility and delivery of its sporting, health and wellbeing activities has many positive additions as the market town itself strives to increase its provision to its residents.”data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.fetoday webimage ..!

This was a substantial commitment but was vital for Scotland’s long term interests, preparing ourselves for the challenges of an ageing population. We’ve recently extended free personal care to cover all those who are assessed as needing it, no matter their age.MSPs also charted a dferent course when, following a change of administration in , parliament voted to scrap tuition fees in Scotland, restoring Scotland’s long and proud tradition of free education.Similarly, the decision to abolish prescription charges brought to an end what was little more than a tax on ill health. The NHS of course is the greatest, and most valued, example of a universal service where care is provided on the basis of need and not ability to pay. Our health service, like others across the world, faces challenges. But it is a real achievement of the Scottish Parliament that we have resisted the marketization moves south of the border while ensuring that under the current government Scotland’s AE departments are the best performing in theUK.On other occasions, the Parliament has led the UK in making bold policy choices, such as the ban on smoking in public places. Our Climate Change Act includedthe most ambitious emissions reduction targets of any legislature in the world and, as Health Secretary, I was heavily involved in the campaign to introduce a minimum unit price for alcohol, which we knew would play a key role in tackling Scotland’s unhealthy relationship with drink – another world leading measure.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"As the Scottish Parliament prepares to celebrate its th anniversary, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reflects on both its journey and her own.\"  First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reflects on  years of the Scottish Parliament viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"It took a decade of hard work to make this policy a reality and I am personally very proud of the campaign, working with stakeholders, to persuade MSPs to back minimum pricing, as well as overcoming a legal challenge that went all the way to the Supreme Court.I am personally committed to making sure every child and young person in Scotland gets the best possible start in le. We have already delivered an increase in free, high quality childcare for all three and four year olds and extending entitlement to eligible two year olds and will increase it further before the end of this parliament.Scotland has also become a much safer society under devolution. Recorded crime has fallen to some of the lowest levels seen since the s. In particular, non-sexual violent crime has fallen substantially, thanks in no small part to the excellent work of the Violence Reduction Unit, which was established over a decade ago with cross-party support and is now being copied across the UK.In recent years, new powers have come to the Scottish Parliament and with those powers come increased responsibilities for MSPs to deliver for the people ofScotland.Income tax policy is now a key feature of the annual Scottish budget. We’ve used these new powers to introduce a fairer income tax policy, with most people paying less tax than they would south of the border – while continuing to raise revenue to support investment in the economy and public services.Last year Parliament passed the wide-ranging Social Security Act, paving the way for devolution of a number of benefits, as well as creating a number of newbenefits such as increased carers’ support allowance and best start grants for families with young children – and a new social security agency to deliver them. This new agency has a culture of dignity and respect at its heart and early feedback from service users has been overwhelmingly positive.I also appointed the first gender balanced Scottish cabinet and we are encouraging more women to stand for parliament, and bring a better balance to ourpublic le.Over the course of the Scottish Parliament consistent action has been taken to ensure communities have the opportunity to own the land they live and work on.Many communities have benefited from the right to buy that now covers rural and urban communities.Of course, the foundation of our country is a strong and resilient economy. That’s why we have slashed or abolished business rates for , premises –saving almost £. billion for our small businesses.We have invested in our infrastructure with all governments building new schools and hospitals and, of course, the iconic Queensferry Crossing.And, to help make sure we have the workforce we need for years to come, we have delivered just over a quarter of a million Modern Apprenticeships in the lastdecade.In April this year, new legislation to tackle controlling and coercive behaviour came into effect, giving Scotland some of the most robust domesticabuse legislation in the world.I’m also proud of the many steps we’ve taken to make Scotland a fairer society, including the introduction of equal marriage rights – attending one of the first same-sex weddings in Scotland is a memory that will stay with me for a long time.And we all worked together over many years to help Glasgow successfully host the  Commonwealth Games. This helped to inspire Scots to get more active,delivered new facilities and put Scotland on the world stage. It was a sight to behold.My final achievement is perhaps harder to quanty. There is no doubt that the re-establishment of Scotland’s parliament has profoundly changed our political culture for the better, with our nation’s lawmakers much more accessible to those they represent. It has also enabled us to have conversations we wouldn’t have had and to debate our own future, with the  independence referendum generating an increase in democratic engagement.Looking ahead, we now face the signicant challenges posed by Brexit which, of course, Scotland’s people and parliament overwhelmingly oppose. Given the long-term damage that Brexit will cause to Scotland, and the material change in circumstances this represents, I believe it is only fair that people are given the choice of whether to become an independent country. Indeed, the current SNP Government was elected on a clear manesto commitment that people should be offered that choice should Scotland be taken out of the EU against its will. Polls consistently show that people living here believe the decision on whether to hold a referendum should be a matter for Holyrood and not Westminster. Twenty years after it came into being, that is an important measure of the way people in Scotland view the Parliament and one that the new UK Prime Minister would do well to heed."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"July ,  at : pmViews are being sought on a strategy for the development of hydrogen projects in the county.

And I understand that it is very unfortunate that this problem, while unrelated to the air traffic controllers’ industrial action, has coincided with it. However, that is not much consolation to frustrated users of the service.“The issue here is that this is a leline service and there are no alternatives for people who simply have to fly. Local people and businesses in the Northern Isles need a reliable service, and we simply cannot afford local service-levels to be reduced. We accept that we have to live with unavoidable weather events, but the recent disruptions have been workforce-related.“HIAL is a Scottish Government-owned organisation and one of the reasons for that is a recognition that it provides a strategically critical part of our transport infrastructure in the Highlands and Islands. It’s way past time for ministers to take a long hard look at the situation and reassure us that they are prepared to intervene on behalf of the travelling public.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The schemes are designed to protect electricity consumers in the North of Scotland from high costs of distribution in their area. In   this was done by providing an annual assistance amount of £ million to consumers in the area, which Ofgem estimates is worth around £ per household.Mr McArthur said: “It is simply unfair for islanders to be surcharged when so many households in our island communities already experience the highest levels of fuel poverty anywhere in the country.“If these plans are implemented, it will be good news for consumers across the highlands and islands.

The move is a result of a partnership with the organisation PAMISwhich campaigns for these facilities, and has been supported by Transport Scotland.The move comes as a result of research highlighting that , people in the UK need such special assistance and facilities. Users include people with profound and multiple learning disabilities and people with a range of other disabilities including Cerebral Palsy, Motor Neurone disease, Multiple Sclerosis, stroke, some older people and other specic disabilities.The requirements are set out in British Standards, and include:The new toilets are already open on deck six of MV Hjaltland and MV Hrossey, and will be available on board MV Hamnavoe by the end of the year.“This investment is another sign of our commitment to making our facilities as welcoming as possible to everyone in the community,# said Stuart Garrett, managing director at Serco NorthLink Ferries.#It will open up opportunities for many people with disabilities and their familes to visit some of the most beautul parts of Scotland. It also supports those living on the islands when travelling to and from the mainland for leisure and essential healthcare.”The move is the latest in a series of measures aimed at improving journeys for all travelers. Earlier this month the company became the first Scottish transport operator to introduce the pioneering Neatebox support service. This followed improvements to the NorthLink website, disability awareness training for staff, and a new partnership with a sign language interpreting agency.Mum and carer Jenny Whinnet, who helped to start the PAMIS campaign  years ago, said: #This is an exciting development for families and carers.#It permits people who need these facilities to travel further afield confidently and with dignity. This is very dferent to the early years of this campaign, when it was so dficult for me to travel with my son Craig because there were no Changing Places toilets available.”Jenny Miller, Chief Executive Officer of PAMIS added: “We’ve been very impressed with the commitment and consideration shown by Serco NorthLink Ferries in developing changing places toilets on their ferries.#They have really listened to the stories from the families and people we work with and who feel excluded from so many activities that we all take for granted. We’re delighted that the Orkney and Shetland ferries will be the first in the country, and possibly the world, to have a Changing Places toilet.”Paul Wheelhouse, minister for energy, connectivity and the islands is pleased to see the new facilities up and running.He said: #This type of improvement is exactly why we set up the Ferries Accessibility Fund.#We know accessible travel not only enables people to enjoy equal access to our beautul country, but it also enables people to fully participate in society and improve the quality of their lives, so we want to continue to identy and remove any disabling barriers which prevent people from making journeys or lead to them having an unpleasant time on board.#It’s very important that Scotland’s ferry services are fully accessible, offering the best passenger experience possible to everyone and this targeted investment marks very welcome progress on that journey.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It is they, after all, who made history as ambassadors of humankind, setting foot onto a ­­\u2028far-flung celestial body. Michael Collins, Apollo ’s ­command module pilot, who watched on, fearful that catastrophe would intervene to ensure he would make theto Earth alone, played an integral part in the mission. So too did the many pioneers whose names occupy a mere footnote of history, despite the fact that without their expertise and composure, the disaster Collins feared – or much worse – would have almost inevitably come to pass. The semicentennial celebrations of the Moon landing is an occasion to remember those who occupy the foothills of the credits. One of the statistics surrounding Project Apollo, which seems to me both remarkable and entirely rational, is that around , people were involved in rendering the impossible possible.This army of engineers, scientists, programmers, mathematicians, and technicians defied technological limitations and bureaucratic wrangling to produce approximately five-and-a-half million parts which, working in unison, spirited Apollo’s crew to the Moon and back. : How moon landing conspiracy theories began and why they persist today – Professor Peter Knight:  years since the moon landing: why Scotland is the true home of astronaut Neil ArmstrongIn any other corporate environment, the prospect of workers on the ground feeling disconnected from the mission’s overall goal would barely warrant concern. But Project Apollo’s programme ­manager, George Müller, knew fine well the risks of letting such apathy go unchecked. He ensured the astronauts toured factories across America tasked with manufacturing the spacecraft components. This was no mere public relations exercise. It reminded workers that a single oversight on their part could kill the men standing before them, and it forged a sense of collective responsibility. Nowhere was this esprit de corps more evident than Building  of Nasa’s Johnson Space Centre in Houston, Texas, home to the Apollo mission operations control centre , where the spacecraft’s ­navigation, propulsion, le support, and communications systems were monitored with unflinching ­scrutiny.At any given time, between  and  men – and one trailblazing woman, JoAnn Morgan, the instrumentation controller – held in their hands the lives of three men a ­quarter of a million miles away. Their number included Stephen Bales, the son of a janitor and a ­beautician, who less than five years previously had moved from the farming community of Fremont, Iowa, to join Nasa as an intern, responsible for guided tours. In an interview with  Minutes to the Moon, a superb BBC World Service podcast detailing the graft, ingenuity, and composure which underpinned the final descent to the lunar surface, Bales recently reflected on the mission that would define his career. Without him, it would have probably ended in failure. As the Eagle craft neared the Moon, an alarm code known as  flashed on its on-board computer display. It was the only moment in the entire mission when a degree of urgency,not fear, could be heard in Armstrong’s voice.Bales, by then one of Apollo ’s guidance officers, saw the alarm four seconds later. Initially unsure of its signicance, he remembered the last simulation he and the flight controllers had carried out before the landing proper. Back then a similar code, known as , had appeared, prompting Bales to call an abort. In the subsequent debriefing, he immersed himself in the myriad alarms that could be triggered, working with Jack Garman, a computer specialist, to understand their meaning.In doing so, they realised a  referred to a software reboot which cancelled all the processes that the computer was running crucially, it happened so fast, no vital guidance or navigation data would be lost. So when the code appeared for real, Bales knew the mission could continue. It was a decision made in the space of  seconds – “an eternity,” said Bales – but it saved Apollo . There are countless other stories like his. Take that of John Aaron from Oklahoma, the son of a cattle rancher and a minister, recruited by Nasa at  without an interview. He felt ashe had walked into a foreign country where people spoke another language, on account of the dizzying number of acronyms being hurled around. After just six weeks, he contemplated jacking it all in. Fortunately for him, and the Apollo programme, he knuckled down. Only a few months later, his split-second decision making was credited with saving Apollo  after its rocket was struck by lightning. It is dficult to conceive of the pressure these men worked under, as they analysed the spaceflight while listening to three,not four conversations simultaneously on communication channels known as ‘loops’.The average age of those inside MOCR was just , and as Gerry Grfin, the flight director during Apollo ’s fraught re-entry into the Earth’s atmosphere, has pointed out, their youth counted in their favour. “It was the lack of fear,” he explained. “It wasn’t the lack of knowing it was risky.”It also means that, half a century on, many of them are still with us, able to reflect on an epoch-defining moment and receive our thanks for the part they played in it.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"brexit mps vote to block suspension of parliament to force through no deal","story":"MPs have defeated the Government on an amendment which could thwart efforts by the next prime minister to force through a no-deal Brexit.The Commons backed the move by  votes to , majority , which could stop the next PM suspending Parliament in order to allow the UK to crash out of the EU.A number of ministers who have been critical of a no-deal Brexit are thought to have abstained in the vote.Margot James, minister for digital and the creative industries, rebelled by supporting the amendment.The vote came after the Lords strongly backed a bid to block Parliament being suspended in order to facilitate a no-deal exit by a margin of  votes on Wednesday.The change to the Northern IrelandBill will require progress reports on restoring devolved government in Northern Ireland to be debated regularly in Parliament, effectively preventing it being prorogued.Justice Secretary David Gauke said before the vote that proroguing Parliament would be \"outrageous\" - but he did not confirm whether he would back the measures to block it.: Boris Johnson could end Union, warns Gordon Brown He told BBC Radio s Today programme: \"At a crucial point in this countrys history,you like - that Parliament should not be able to sit, should not be able to express its opinion and its will, I think would be outrageous.\"I very much doubt that any prime minister would in fact suspend Parliament in these circumstances, but I can understand the concerns that a lot of my colleagues have.\"Downing Street said forcing a report and debate every two weeks risks being \"counter-productive\" to the aim to restore the executive in Northern Ireland.The Prime Ministers official spokesman told a Westminster briefing: \"We have been very clear that the purpose of this Bill is to ensure the continuation of vital public services and effective governance for the people of Northern Ireland.: Anti-Boris operation arse ends in surrender \"In the light of the ongoing talks to restore the Executive, our view is that forcing a report and debate every two weeks on the progress of those talks risks being counter-productive to this overarching aim.\"Front-runner for the Tory leadership Boris Johnson again refused at the final campaign hustings on Wednesday to rule out proroguing Parliament in order to meet his red line of getting the UK out of the EU by October .His rival for Number  Jeremy Hunt has insisted he would not use such a constitutional manoeuvre.The amendment to the Northern IrelandBill builds on an amendment passed in the Commons last week, when MPs backed a proposal from the pro-European Tory Dominic Grieve calling for fortnightly reports from the Government on the efforts to restore the powersharing executive.The new Lords amendment would ensure these have to be debated in the weeks before the Brexit deadline.The Bill could theoretically make it illegal for the Government to prorogue Parliament in the autumnthe powersharing executive in Northern Ireland has not been restored.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"div","story":"A DIVE vessel with  women on board was escorted into port after she began taking in water off Shetland on Sunday. issued a mayday call in bad weather soon after midday when she was approximately eight miles east of Sumburgh Head.

This industry produces more green house gases than the all of transportation. In fact, it is several times greater than transportation. The catch  scenario is this industry has had no regulation or legislation is regard to reducing greenhouse gases, infact, due to population growth, the pollution created by agriculture is vastly on the increase. Technology has played its part, but it is a situation where reducing pollution is very, very dficult to achieve given the nature of the industry itself. As the population increases, this will become more relevant in terms of the overall pollution created, and no doubt, something will have to be done. Whether sea based farming of certain foods may reduce the pollution, but much of agriculture is still based on land and the production of meat will still create problems related to greenhouse gases in terms of land used for meat production and or crop production as well. It is a dilemma which will become more relevant as the population increases.I can assure you these bairns weren#t pushed into anything. They were toldthey wanted to go they had to complete a form. One of mine wanted to go, the other didn#t. One asked a question at the Town Hall and I am very proud # not that she had to protest # but that she had the courage to do so, and silence many there.Well done young folk # out of the mouths of babes as they say.It hardly takes any courage to join a protest, especially one being encouraged and congratulated onby so many folk! The courage comes from not following the crowd herd and forming an independent and educated view. Jumping headlong onto the bandwagon is easy, understanding the science and striving to do something about it the hard bit. Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid.Especially a meaningless strike from school, what child would not love a day off among mates  No doubt the pig ignorant and stupid will be so impressed. A bit like supergluing yourself tp a bus or train, outstanding!!!I didnt say it took courage to join a protest, I said it takes courage to speak at the Town Hall. Andit was about time off school, they all would have gone. Please have more respect for our bairns and young folk.And these bairns are, for your information, studying the stem subjects at school.It is not a case of having respect for the bairns, Johan Adamson. It is just a case of having absolutely no respect whatsoever for those who politicise them and drive them like sheep. Primary children used in a political strike!! Repulsive behaviour, you should be ashamed, so socialist, child exploitation is the words that come to mind.They had to complete a form, primary children! What next, form a political Union and become militant  Little Orwellian sheep bleating for the Pigs.These were AHS pupils Ian, not primary pupils, and no one has politicised them.Educated them yes, but then I forgot you have the monopoly on climate change education and stem subjects.The organisers were I think over , so young adults.The fact is I will always criticise revolting behaviourand ignorance and I am not referring to the children.Yes I do believe sixth year pupils are capable of organising thisWhy do you assume Ian that these bairns are not studying stem subjects and that only you know about climate change then Ian Infantile comments  Pot kettle springs to mind.Now just who printed these forms the children had to fill in  Which teachers OKed the strike and arrange for Brae and Aith schools also took part, as well as bairns from the Sound Primary School and organised and paid for transport  I do not believe that was AHS sixteen-year-olds for one second.Whether by accident or design this provides a very convenient fig leaf for the council#s lamentable performance on child poverty.Much was made of the #children#s march# at the SIC#s education committee meeting today however in a news report about the part of the same meeting that dealt with the council#s child poverty action report, it was clear that the council have done next to nothing since the Shetland Inequalities Commission reported in March .know. All these admirable young citizens are guilty of is taking a stand based on commonly accepted information.

Gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included! Learners on this path can also become alert to common logical fallacies. Even those who like Ian, with a preference for physical sciences, can benefit. Happily don’t need to be much of a scholar to spot an ad hominem attack. With all due respect for Ian’s past achievements in the physical sciences, it would be nicehe could make his points without belittling others #kids included. That’s a normal standard “of decency and tolerance” btw.I so agree with these word #gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included!#. You do so hold yourself in such regard high Peter, now go glue yourself to a train or bus to prove your point!But just at that moment, as though at a signal, all the sheep burst out into a tremendous bleating of- #Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better!# It went on for five minutes without stopping. And by the time the sheep had quieted down, the chance to utter any protest had passed, for the pigs had marched back into the farmhouse ”.And what are you doing Ian to save the planet And what would you suggest the AHS and the SIC do Ad Hominem attacks # playing the man not the ball # are often used by those who don’t have much of an argument to begin with. Instead of dealing with whether the young people have a point or not, generous-spirited Ian opted to have a go instead.Logical fallacies show lazy thinking, masking an absence of creativity and independent thought. Ian’s trollswipe above looks Ad Hominem in approach st first, but he is also using the Tu Quoque Fallacy. This is where you accuse the opponent of hypocrisy to avoid answering their charge. Self-effacing Ian thus avoids addressing the possibility of his own hubris or lack of self-knowledge.Should I have made things easier for him and asked what his actual beef with the climate protestors was  He says “Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid”and demands that everyone should be able to answer “how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age ” before taking a view. Perhaps he will educate us by answering his own question # sticking to terms that demonstrate tolerance and decency of course.

Especially stop allowing political activists to exploit our children.I put forward the question : Is nuclear power the only solution to stop greenhouse gas emissions and the only way to stop climate change progressing further  It may be the worse case scenario in terms of our power demand solution, but what are the alternatives to our demand for energy without causing further environmental and ecological damage to the planet by in using fossil fuels or cleaner alternatives like wind or solar   It has been suggested the Sahara Desert could be used for solar energy to power Europe, but how much land would be required and could this be expanded  The alternatives to fossil fuels may be cleaner, but how would this affect global weather patterns or the depletion of species due to the destruction of natural habitats being replaced for energy production Very sadly the SG SNP has committed to wind energy with its catastrophic environmental damage and only intermittent supply, but that is the policy of the scientically ignorant and utterly stupid.Thank you for your comments, Ian. I fear humanity will have no choice but to go nuclear for its energy production in the future.Alternative resources, like wind or solar, may be the short term answer, but as mentioned, the downside to this is the large amount of land which will be required with the ability to vastly expand as demand increases. What would be the environmental damage and the destabilization of le on the planet have in the long term with such technologies  There is also the issue of economics dictating progress on future energy production, and would this be counter-productive due profits taking priority over progress and the reduction of the pollution into the environment  I agree with your comments Ian, in regard to nuclear based energy production. However, like many issues to do with progress, something catastrophic will have to take place before we realize we should have acted sooner.There it is again, the abusive and arguably ignorant use of that word “stupid”. Having reread all contributions above it seems Ali denies there’s a problem by saying there are dangerously low CO levels, John distracts by arguing the council should care more for child poverty, and Ian disparages, disparages and disparages again. Are all three attempting to harmonise from the same alt-right reactionary hymn-sheet Ian’s singular approach is getting between him and his key message. I’ve long been puzzling as to what makes the good doctorso determined to overuse petty insult so freely, but it would be helpful to know just whathis specic problem with climate change protests is. If he could but answer his own Ice Age question to Brian , his motive might become a little clearer. And apologies in advance to Ianhe has already made his point and I’ve missed it, but it wasn’t me who thought it smart to surround it with invective. Wouldn’t it be just lovelyIan could contribute tolerantly without using putdowns  It’s almost as though he needs them to build himself up# Oh. Hold on# Eureka!#Are all three attempting to harmonise from the same alt-right reactionary hymn-sheet # What a plonker, Peter, just cannot resist going political. Is thisLabour or SNP talking, he often points in both directions or is he now Green Maybe the characters on here who hate the idea of young people protesting about climate change should head down to the school and start shouting some of this stuff over the wall.But, then again, that might make them see . . . well . . . insane.Folk writing to the paper to have a go at the protesters is one of the most depressing contributions to local public debate imaginable.Hopefully, though, the usual naysayerswill only encourage them to do it more.There#s nothing wrong with anyone, of any age, having an opinion on whatever they like, and expressing it. But in their own time, only.The problem with this is that participation in this protest was permitted and facilitated,not encouraged by the education authority, which by default is an endorsement of the opinion being expressed in the protest and the timing method by which the protest was made, by the education authority.Education authorities and schools are supposed to be impartial, by granting #authorised absence# status to a politically motivated protest, that impartiality is now seriously called in to question and a dangerous precedent has been set.There was no reason other than a cynical publicity stunt for this protest to take place during the school day. If those still at school feel strongly enough to organise a protest like adults do, that#s fine, let them, but also like adults, it#ll have to happen in their own time, or they suffer the consequences of #unauthorised absence#, for it to be taken seriously.If they want to play in the big bad world, they play by the big bad world#s rules, not by special favours like this was.Only a few nutters are #impartial# about climate change these days.Do you mean that civil disobedience would have been better Well said Mark! The evident concern trollingis intended to deligitimise the voice of young people who, lets remember, are meant by right to have a say in matters that concern them. Scotland’s national curriculum intends younger learners become active and responsible global citizens. Therefore no one involved in supporting the reported protest has done any wrong, other than in the eyes of seemingly knee-jerk reactionaries who may well be hiding their true motives. Artfully comparing these identiable young people to Orwell’s unthinking farm animals, in order to subvert their point# well it more than lacks sensitivity and compassion. It is desperate, pitul and contemptible in equal measure. It may well also fall foul of observing normal standards of decency and tolerance that contributors to these pagesare meant to adhere to. Those joining the protest were not “stupid”, as has been claimed above. The overuse of that intolerant word may be though. I note you mention #Scotland’s national curriculum intends younger learners become active and responsible global citizens.# now could you explain how taking time off school and striking for the declaration of aclimate emergency makes the child an active and responsible global citizen  I rather feel they are being played by our Greeny ignoramuses and SNP political propagandists! Never mind, I am sure they enjoyed their day off school.Nuclear power  Thatgreat physicistRobert Oppenheimer , on seeing the first atomic bomb explode said with horror—-“ I am become death , the destroyer of worlds.”. The people of Japan and Chernobyl have had a taster and I suspect they arenot eager for a repeat. .However,Shetland is####..Hmm.Rock on.Haydn, Thorium reactors, not Uranium! no atom bombs, no long term isotopes decaying for millennia. Almost infinite clean energy with really cheap fuel.Where would your preferred site be for the Shetland nuclear power station be Dr Tinkler  Aith  Bigton  Would bring plenty work to the west side. You could include it in your manestoyou stand for the council again.Well, Ray Purchase, it is already here. Thousands of Shetlanders have had radiotherapy and had their lives saved by a nuclear atomic reactions of one type or another.I seriously doubtthere is a single person on Shetland who has not had their own, a member of their family or close friends le saved by the products of nuclear reactors.Are you so moronic as to deny that or is that a bit too deep for you to understand or Oh dear Dr Tinkler, it seems you’ve come down with a nasty case of whataboutery. I didn’t ask you about the undoubted benefits of x-rays and radiotherapy I asked you where you would build a nuclear power station in Shetland. Now do you think you could give a straight answer to a straight question  Physician heal thyself!If thorium proves viable, I would be happy for such a station in Lerwick. Safe, clean, small and less damaging than the district heating woodchip waste burner we have at present and infinitely less toxic. I also asked is that a bit too deep for you to understand  # So it seems to be!!Well done Ian, you answered the question! There was a lot of unnecessary waffling and needless aggression but you got there. So, in the incredibly unlikely event of a, totally safe, nuclear power plant being built in Shetland you’d still want it as far away from where you live as possible. Fair dos.Instead of nuclear power or gas have you ever put any thought into wind power  I’ve heard that they don’t cause any carbon pollution at all, so they’d be ideal. They’re very pretty too and scientic. Like an actual windmill, I’m a big fan.Sadly Ray, you are being misled. take Viking for example. Peat disturbance alone. over  kilometres of tracks, the ground footprint of over  square kilometres. A fair amount of COreleased there. Then tens of thousands of tons of concrete basses.emissions, Chatham House.  kilometres of the interconnector, Copper plastic!!! Now just imagine the peat is so unstable that helicopters are being used, just to move survey teams to reconnoitre the site. Tracked vehicles to damaging for the peat!! . Just what is that carbon footprint  Laughableit was not so sad!How something you and Mark Ryan Smith may understand. The very latest scientic information on controlling climate change “Tree planting #has mind-blowing potential# to tackle climate crisis” , now would not planting a tree be a more rational action for these children  That would be the sensible, intelligent and educated option. PS, could someone please inform the SIC SNP SCT and Green Lunatics!No one here has denied climate change Brian Smith. Just a discussion on the merits or otherwise of the School children#s strike. Our youngsters being encouraged to jump on the #Greta Thunberg# bandwagon. There you really do have a sacricial lamb to the European Green lunatics but that is another really sad story!You mustcarefully, Mr T.Well, Brian, I have never denied Climate change. I just dispute the best way to combat it.Deft footwork here from Ian. His, and his hero Farage’s position # not that he cares to own up to it # is not that there is no climate change. Obviously the climate changes over time. What he is conveniently avoiding are the questions around cause and appropriate response.Please do not make up speculative little stories porkies Peter. Farage is not my hero, however, I find him infinitely preferable to Corbyn and Salmond, however, here is not the place to digress further.Will Hell freeze over before Ian tells us what he presumes the protestors are ignorant of  Answering the question he posed Brian is not too mammoth a task for him surely. I suspect he is trying to dodge it for a reason.Read and weep Peter. If your intellect stretches that far. !! In the most simple of Science, It is set out below. The protestors are ignorant of the very most basic understanding of carbon capture and the prevention of climate change. Trees!! Only the very most utterly stupid, like yourself cannot see the wood for them!It is not clear the protest had a position on biomass, however Ian has firmly stated the need for those taking any position to be able to answer #how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age #Ian has thus far excitedly cited three articles, none of which reference any ice age. The first: #Tree planting ‘has mind-blowing potential’ to tackle climate crisis#, has Professor Crowther emphasising #it remains vital to reverse the current trends of rising greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel burning and forest destruction, and bring them down to zero# this is needed to stop the climate crisis becoming even worse and because the forest restoration envisaged would take - years to have its full effect##Reafforestation, necessary as it is, isn#t no silver bullet, nor a speedy enough solution, though many on the protest would likely love to plant some trees.The second and third articles focus on biomass, which is contested.To help Ian make his point, does he mean the Cryogenian, the second last ice age or the Little Ice Age  Again, other than to spread scorn and belittle, what is Ian#s actual point Sorrymy point is beyond you Peter. My question # “how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age ”That would require a thesis at post-graduate level to answer. Hardly space here! My point was that these children simple to not have the science to have a considered and informed opinion based on knowledge. The science is actually simple, I suggest you look it up and read it.Lest anyone thinking of studying the sciences, physical or social, be put off, Ian’s approach to advancing a scientic argument is far from typical. Thomas Kuhn made a very useful contribution by proposing that as a science advances some innaccurate claims will inevitably be made and indeed built on, but will later be corrected as sufficient contrary evidence emerges. Hawkins himself corrected some of his own foundational work. A settled consensus generally emerges over time through reasonable and reasoned dialogue and argument in which peer reviewed sources, research evidence and the thinking they provoke are made apparent.This is perhaps one reason why the Shetland Times asks contributors to observe normal standards of decency and tolerance for the opinions of others. It helps to bring forth the truth.It is, however, more than unusual for anyone taking themselves seriously to make a strong central scientic claim then refuse to back it up, clary it’s meaning or intent# unless of course Ian is proposing rhetoric, cant and distracting insult are now sciences, in which case top marks are due to the happy fellow.What a load of pretentious twaddle. You have outdone yourself here Peter. The word Science simply means knowledge, no more no less. It is just as simple as that.Whilst he remains intent on running away from clarying and substantiating his own point, here is an easier question for Ian: Why does he call Greens lunatics  There must be some point of disagreement between him and them, in his own head at least.That would be self-evident Peter. Read up the following. Bio-Fuels, palm oil plantation. Diesel fuel promotions, particulates. Germany non-nuclearpolicy,brown coal burning. Shetland exports clean gas imports polluting wood chip. Tree planting reverses CO build up, wood chip more polluting than coal burning and deforests huge areas. The EU % of renewable, Biomass .Greenies promote non-nuclear. more people killed in wind farm accidents in Uk than nuclear ever has. All the above would indicate a somewhat lunatic approach from the Greens. Now we have, using helicopters to survey Viking Energy sites as peat too unstable for tracked vehicles to reach, unbelievable!!! I hate to say the cult of #Greta Thunberg#,depression, eating disorders, and anxiety attacks,Asperger’s syndrome, high-ing autism, and OCD. She also suffers from selective mutism and self-harm. The sacricial lamb of the Greens across Europe. The inspiration behind the school strikes!!!!! Nowthat#s not lunatic, what is Ian’s position on global warming is either well grounded or is, well, hot air. He knows how this goes. Either he has a reputable theorist publishing an article in a reputable journal, or even a weblink to a news story referencing such, or he doesn’t. Because some vested interests have bought and paid for their own pet scientiststhere may be dferent opinions regarding whatever his as yet unclear point was with his unnamed and undated second ice age. If he really wants to be taken seriously he should put up or# consider his alternative.C’mon Ian, one reference to one reputable scientist backing up whatever it is you so obviously don’t want to say. You know you can do it.I am would be intrigued to opinions relating to climate change due to agriculture and what would be the answer to providing food but reducing or stopping climate change due to agriculture. I may be wrong but I believe agriculture produces  times more greenhouse gases than all of transportation put together, but this has, conveniently, been avoided by the media and scientic community. There is a terrible dilemma between producing food to this of attempting to reduce green houses gases and the progressive climate change taking place Both Ian and Greta Thunberg are right tho. We are not taking climate change seriously enough and we are confused.One minute providing grants to preserve Shetland#s peat carbon store, and the next proposing digging acres of it up, releasing all that carbon, to build Viking.Giving out paper straws in McDonalds with juice in a plastic cup .I mind askingabout planting trees on my croft. They said #oh we dont want these clumps of trees any more, not our landscape#, when I had always thought tree planting was good.Such a mixed message. Why dont we have a green rating system like we have for our washing machines. You could rate biomass, nuclear, windfarms from construction to operation in terms of green to red, so we would know where we are in the scale with our choices.Any way, still have a patch of high hill that would be great for a mini woodsI referenced Greta with a very heavy heart, a truly exploited child whose background would fire concern with any child specialist in the UK, psychologist or Social worker.Sorry, Johan, who isn#t #taking climate change seriously# Theresa May and the Tories are taking it very seriously, indeed, passing Mrs May#s unilateral # net zero# plan into law. The Treasury says it will cost over £ trillion , enough to fund the salaries of , nurses for  years.Too little for Greta Thunberg and her #Extinction Rebellion pals, apparently.This will find its way on to consumers# electricity bills, including those in fuel poverty, a clear majority of homes in Shetland #  percent, before the recent price hikes.The Shetland Labour Party that I grew up with was concerned with alleviating poverty, not creating it. They were not interested inwinning #Green Blue Peter Badges# for futile, bourgeois bagatelles like#tackling climate change#, without any hope of success.Britain, far less, Shetland, can achieve nothing alone.The only candidate to exhibit concern for Shetland#s poor is Ian Scott.Im confused. You state that the Tories are proposing  net zero and then you say Labour creating poverty.I am very seriously concerned about fuel poverty everywhere and especially in Shetland. I hope that there are no price hikes in our fuel bills, this is something we need to resist, and I also hope more help is forthcoming for retrofitting better heating systems and more insulation to improve housing quality.Please do not try to tell me what I believe.Johan, I don’t recall you ever mentioning fuel poverty before. Do you support or oppose “ net zero”, which was done in knee-jerk response to the campaigns of Greta Thunberg and her pals “Extinction Rebellion” Only, you have been supporting Ms Thunberg’s “climate emergency” campaign at local level, have you not Mrs May’s , nurses salaries for  years isn’t “emergency” enough for them, they want more.You can huff and puff as much as you like, the cost will find its way to the fuel poor, increasing their number.I put it to you that you cannot simultaneously support Greta Thunberg AND the fuel poor, whom you have now mentioned for the first time.Mr Scott has been arguing for Shetland’s poor since long before he became a councillor.No John I have not been supporting Greta#s campaign locally and yes I have mentioned fuel poverty before and I think I can support greener politics and the poor. It is an important point tho, how we are going to pay for it all. I heard somewhere the Tories are going to pay for it from the proceeds of G.Johan, I responded to your comment above that Greta Thunberg is right .You have also defended the Shetland schools strike “climate emergency” demonstration in this self, same thread.I quote: “Both Ian and Greta Thunberg are right tho. We are not taking climate change seriously enough#..etc..”That sounds awful like you think Mrs May committing  years’ worth of , nurses salaries isn’t “taking climate change seriously enough” If you are now saying that you do not support Greta Thunberg and do wish to tackle Shetland’s lamentable fuel poverty, will you be making a clear, prominent statement to that effect in your campaign literature Including your and Shetland Labour’s proposals for solving the fuel poverty The twisting of my words is really uncalled for, and completely ignoring the main point of my post which is that we need a green rating system to stop you all arguing about what is green and what is not # but then you enjoy the fight too much and would poo poo any system anyway I suppose.Strange move of support from Wir Shetland to Ian Scott  You#re scraping the barrel, now, Johan, getting personal. After your Up Helly-Aa performance, your comment about #enjoying the fight# is, frankly,a bit rich.It appears you are not prepared to make the campaign commitment I suggested. That#s ok.I#m not supporting anyone yet as I haven#t heard from all the candidates. I merely pointed out that Mr Scott is the only one so far to have shown any real concern for Shetland#s poor. He needs to say more about that. Under the present arrangements #climate emergency# will dump on the fuel poor. They have votes, too, of course # more than  percent of the electorate.Good luck with your campaign.Given his concern for the fuel poor John Tulloch will presumably be supporting whichever candidate puts the cancellation of Brexit first and foremost in their manesto  The largest driver of upward pressure on heating bills over the past two years is the devaluation of the pound following the Brexit vote. Greta Thunberg had nothing to do with it. In the event of further declines in the value of the pound post prime minister Johnson increased hard Brexit probability, the suffering of the fuel poor will continue to worsen as the wholesale price of gas becomes relatively more expensive when purchased in pounds sterling.The  dilemma that John Tulloch posed to Johan Adamson could equally well be phrased thus: I put it to you that you cannot simultaneously support Brexit AND the fuel poor.I apologiseI have gotten personal. Be as naesty as du wants, I just cant fathom why you need to be so  Breakfast TV only this morning were talking about how the market is not working, people not changing utility supplier and these people paying more as a consequence.Its surely not fairyour contract runs out that they are able to leave you on a higher rate Action on fuel poverty needs to include tackling the inequalities in the market as well as action to make our houses warmer.Ok, Johan. I’ve made my points about fuel poverty and there’snothing I want to add.So forgive meI don’t digress into bickering about who has or hasn’t been “naesty”. Readers may judge.Good luck with your campaign.Yes, Ian can answer a question when he chooses to. And there is sense in some of what he says. Wind farms on peat, for example, happen when commercial interests chase subsidies, so it is up to governments to get the correct approach. Not all that blame goes at the Green’s door, and they are either correct to claim there is a climate emergency or they are not.On the climate emergency Ian’s thoughts can only be guessed at. They have something to do with an ice-age, which is appropriate as progress towards getting him to answer his own question is, as yet, glacial.A big problem inside these debates stems from some people get beguiled by fake scientic claims. This is why genuine people making genuine scientic claims are generally happy to back them up by referencing the work of the real scientists involved. This offers folk who may or may not be less expert than Dr. Ian Tinklersome protection from charlatans with an axe to grind. Again,Ian is serious, rather than just being a contraryIan, he will reveal his ice-age source s. Or would doing so would reveal his actual movitation  C’mon Ian, youknowyouwantto.I actually sent them to the Times. They failed to print them as perhaps regarded as irrelevant pertaining to the school strike. I will do so again so Peter can untwist his knickers.The book you really should read, Mr T., is The Uninhabitable Earth by David Wallace Wells. Things are far more precarious than you think.David Wallace Wells. I would rather believe scientic specialists in ious fields than blindly take the word of a Journalist, Brian. He appears to hold no scientic qualication of any type. Writing for theis not reliable science training any more than writing for the Mail..Try reading it.Abruptclimate change , at younger dryasfor years also because of meteorite strike in Greenland. We still haven#t founda proper way of storing spent nuclear fuel, i can seethe repository at Sellafield being under miles of snow through the many ice ages to come before it issafe again.The nuclear nonsensewas never about cheap and safe electricity it was of course about weapons grade plutonium tons,produced here in Scotland alone,why that amount when a few tons could polish off the entire planet does anyone know Do we trust Boris and fruitcake farm with this ,aye right- their record speaks for itself! Maybe the bairns protesting about climate change holds a candle of hope up - -we are all going to need it.Graham Fleming, Thorium breakdown isotopes have short half-lives. Long term storage is nor an issue. Ask a standard grader that is beyond your understanding.Incidentally, the global stockpile of separated plutonium is about  tonnes. That is  tonnes too much, however Thorium reactors produce none at all. Sad you cannot get your facts straight Graham Flemming, so very SNP.Having read these pages for a long time Peter, it should be apparent by now that Ian is a dental surgeon by training and therefore qualies for Dr status.No need to have a PhDor any other bits of paper !Ok, well thanks to Ian, andthe Times did withhold the links as irrelevant to the school strike they maybe had a point. It was Ian that insisted to Brian Smith way back when that this issue was relevant, for whatever reason.I#m still not clear what Ian draws from these articles though, or why anyone would have to have this knowledge to take a view on the current level of threat, but I get that global warming isn#t about to lead to another ice age. I don#t recall the protest saying it would# It#s a welcome change to have Ian express himself without resort to petty insult though. Long may that continue. On his earlier point on science, however, I#m not sure most scientists would agree science means knowledge only, as Ian proposed, without including the search for it by using scientic methods.But here is the big unanswered question # whatever it is Ian take from these links # does he, or does he not, think we are facing a climate crisis  If we are then surely the kids are right to be concerned, especially as some government sponsored action on climate change is potentially green-wash.Slight problem with the colour test Johan.About % of men have problems when distinguishingbetween red and green .

The Loch Ewe farm has failed the required environmental standards for nearly  years. Mowi, despite virtually unlimited resources, were apparently unwilling or unable to make the necessary changes. broadcast in May.In January , the Scottish Parliament#s Rural Economy and Connectivity Committee agreed to undertake an enquiry into the state of salmon fishing in Scotland and in November  the regulatory body SEPA published proposals for a revised regulatory regime for the finfish sector. Within these proposals, SEPA said it would begin a programme of work to #modernise the regulation of existing sites#.Mowi#s head of environmental management, Stephen MacIntyre, said that the company wanted to #align its growth# with recent recommendations. The company had plans to sustainably grow their fish production levels over the next few years by #expanding into new high-energy farming areas located further offshore#.Bill Whyte, convener of the Wester Ross Area Salmon Fishery Board, said he welcomed Mowi#s recognition of the wild salmonid habitats and added: #We will expect further clarity about the process of biomass relocation. However,Mowi can provide evidence through EIAplanning and SEPA regulatory structure that the relocated biomass will have reduced potential impact on wild migratory fish, then we would be prepared to support biomass relocation on a conditional basis.#*A spokesperson from the Scottish Environment Protection Agency , said: “It is really encouraging to see that industry is proactively choosing to consider more sustainable locations for fish farms, away from more sensitive waters where pressures on the marine environment are greatest. “SEPA’s new regulatory framework for marine cage fish farming, launched on  June, , combines more accurate modelling and enhanced monitoring to encourage a more sustainable approach to the siting of fish farms. “In practice, we anticipate this will lead to fewer fish farms in shallower, slow-flowing waters and more fish farms in offshore locations where the environment capacity can better assimilate wastes. The new framework is designed to actively support operators who are seeking to relocate to more sustainable locations, and through improved practices and the innovative use of new technologies, reduce their impact on the marine environment.#They went on to add: “Indeed, our new framework provides exactly the type of flexibility and outcome-focus Mowi outlines it is looking for.Within this new framework, we will consider each inidual proposal on its merits against the legal standards.We encourage Mowi and other operators to work with us and other interested parties to explore their innovative proposals under our new framework.We look forward to doing so."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Kara-with-100m-IM-Gold.jpg","title":"inspirational western isles swimmer kara hanlon wins four gold medals at international island games in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine July.And the -year old was not the only WesternIsles athlete to celebrate a podium place in the shadow of the famous rock, asmore joy followed in the pool and in the athletics stadium.Isla Budge won bronze in the -metres freestyle event, while in Thursday’s triple jump final Mary Macleod won silver and Heather MacKinnon took bronze.Eriskay jumper MacKinnon had won gold in the event in Gotland two years ago with a shorter jump than it took to win third this time around.Hanlon’s week of glory began on Monday whenshe retained the  metres breaststroke title she won in Gotland in .

They have provided assurances that she will not be disadvantaged as a result of losing out on the experience of acting up nor will she be victimised in any way. The Board has also committed to liaising with the Equality Commission on appropriate training in recruitment and selection with specic focus on part-time workers.Anne McKernan, head of legal services at the Equality Commission, welcomed the result. \"This is a good result all round,\" she said. \"One of the main reasons we support cases is to effect change.\"While Catherine missed out on this opportunity, she has been able to secure a change in policy and practice that will benefit other teachers into the future. \"Its good that this has been resolved productively and amicably.\"Ms McKernan said the case should serve as a reminder to employers of the need to treat staff fairly. \"Were publicising this to remind all employers of the dficulties and dangers of disadvantaging people on flexible or part-time working arrangements, even unintentionally,\" she said.The legal expert pointed out that % of female employees work part-time in NI compared to % of male workers.Women make up % of part-time employees here. \"Because of the high concentration of women in part-time jobs, any measure which excludes part-timers from a particular post or promotion is likely to have a more adverse effect on women,\" Ms McKernan explained. \"Thats why it may amount to indirect sex discrimination.\" Ms McCormick, who will continue teaching at the grammar school, also welcomed the outcome which she believes has led to positive change. \"I love my job and am happy at the school,\" she said. \"So Im pleased that a new co-option policy has been put in place which will ensure that opportunities for career enhancement are dealt with in a formal and procedurally correct manner.\""},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38323328.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/porto.jpg","title":"portrush traders hoping for a longterm lift from open","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsThe TwelfthThe OpenNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

That was up by % in , when , were caught.The highest speed recorded was mph on both the M Southbound in South Yorkshire and the M Eastbound in Avon and Somerset- more than twice the national speed limit.Brake called for an automatic driving ban for those caught travelling at over mph and greater resources provided to the police to help improve speeding enforcement.Drivers caught speeding at more than mph are referred to court, where magistrates have the discretion to issue a driving ban or six penalty points on a drivers licence. The maximum fine for serious speeding offences is £,, rising to £,caught on a motorway.Joshua Harris, director of campaigns for Brake, said:“There is absolutely no justication for any driver to be travelling at such excessive speeds – more than twice the national speed limit in some cases – putting themselves and others in grave danger.\"The number of drivers caught speeding at over mph highlights some deeply concerning issues with speeding across the country and makes clear the need for action. Anyone caught travelling at such speed should always face a ban – we have to make sure these dangerous, selfish drivers are taken off our roads.“The Government must invest in national roads policing as a priority to provide the police with the resources they need to get out on the roads and act as a true deterrent to dangerous driving. The law must also be used to its fullest extent in penalising such dangerous behaviour, making it clear that speeding will not be tolerated.” Four forces recorded more than , motorists exceeding mph last year. West Yorkshire police recorded the most with , followed by Kent Police with , then West Mercia Police with , and Surrey police with ,.Inspector Rosemary Leech: “The position of the Police Service of Northern Ireland on speeding is absolutely clear. “Excessive speed for the conditions is consistently one of the principal causes of the most serious road traffic collisions in which people are killed or seriously injured on roads across Northern Ireland.  “Drivers have to take responsibility for their own actions and by speeding they are causing a danger to fellow road users. “Every time you hear about a fatal or serious collision on the news, there is a family, a circle of friends, a community plunged into mourning.  There are many other people across the country how are having to learn how to cope with le changing injuries after being involved in serious collisions.“This is why it is critically important to remind all drivers that there are consequences to breaking the speed limit and driving in a manner that does not consider the safety of all road users. Police will continue to enforce the law and are determined to make Northern Irelands roads safer. “In , the number of speeding detections rose by .% from the previous year, consequently the number of offenders who are caught travelling at higher speeds is also likely to increase. “Removing excess speed from the road safety equation should be the easiest thing that every road user can do. If we all stop speeding, more people live. If we all stop speeding, fewer people have to contend with le changing injuries.“If everyone slowed down, did not drive after drinking or taking drugs, wore a seatbelt and drove with greater care and attention then together we can save lives on our roads.”"},{"url":null,"title":"taoiseach should contact parties before discussing backstop change sinn fein","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsThe TwelfthThe OpenNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The Committee then asked architect William Barker to estimate the cost of the renovations to the old building as well as the cost of a plain new place of worship.Mr Barker’s financial quote for the construction project said that the revamp of the old church would cost £ and a new church would be £,. To put the overall estimate into perspective, today the combined  figure of just over £, would be worth over £,.The records of Burt Presbyterian Church show that a Committee meeting on February ,  it was decided upon the casting vote of Rev Ross to abandon the renovation scheme and the idea of building a new church was then put before the congregation at a meeting on February , .The go-ahead for the new building was dependent upon the congregation subscribing an additional £ more than they had already promised. When that was agreed by the congregation, plans to construct the new church were given the green light for the year .Financial pressure on the project was immediately eased when Lord Templemore subscribed the entire £, but further collections were made in Derry, Newtoncunningham, Crossroads, Raphoe, Strabane, St Johnston and Carrigans, Knowhead, Fahan and Inch.Rev Ross himself reported back that he had gathered another £ in Belfast and Lisburn.With the money in place, William Barker was tasked to prepare plans for a meeting house that could accommodate  people, to have a plain roof, double windows, buttressed walls finished with cement dashing and windows with cement plaster. The church pews were to be pitch pine with walnut top rails.The location of the new church, it was decided, was to be in the upper corner of the ground filled by the old building with the entrance door facing the present gateway in line with the entrance of the old meeting house. Two Porrett stoves sunk in each aisle were to provide the heating.The lineage of Presbyterianism in Burt is one that stretches back over three-and-half centuries. But, as the city of Derry began to grow after the Plantation of Ulster, the Presbyterians of Burt travelled there. In the city at this time, Episcopacy, or the governance of the church by a clerical hierarchy was established by law. But, services were conducted at St Columb’s Cathedral and St Augustine’s Church on the walls to suit the views of Presbyterians.Back in , a Presbyterian minister in Derry was deposed for failing to conform to the views of the Episcopacy and another  fled from the city to avoid being imprisoned.By , the Presbyterian Congregation in Derry was still languishing when attempts were begun to bring preachers over from Scotland.As evidence of the persecution of those of the Presbyterian tradition, a William Hampton, who had been brought into the city by Presbyterians such as Campsie, Burnside and Early was implicated for preaching at a large meeting house which they had built within the city’s walls and just a few yards away from the mansion of the established church’s Bishop.This ‘affront’ to the Anglican tradition could no longer apparently be tolerated by the church authorities.On Sunday, September , , the Bishop decided to take action and with the Mayor, a judge, the city’s Sherrf and other officers they visited the meeting house where they found the Presbyterian congregation praying with William Hampton.It was recorded that they were: “Praying and preaching openly, and not according to the established Liturgy and order of the Church of Ireland.”A “riotous” confrontation took place, the leaders arrested and the church was promptly shut down. This situation continued until August ,  when devoid of anyone to lead them in prayer, the Derry Presbyterians asked for Hampton’s services until another preacher could be appointed.In , Rev Robert Rule of Kirkcaldy in Scotland accepted a call to minister in Derry and was installed that year.Some  years before Rev Ross set foot in Burt and application was made to the Presbytery of Laggan by an Alderman of Derry, John Craigie and a merchant, Mr John Fisher together with William Cunningham of Burt to ide the Parish of Templemore into two congregations. This came about in  and the previously pilloried Rev William Hampton ed from Scotland and was ordained at Carnamaddy on October  that year.Another  odd years later, there was a dispute over parish boundaries within the Presbytery of Derry when in  the people of Elagh, Coshquin and Ballynagalliagh refused to belong to Derry. But, it took until January , for the Synod to order “that the liberties of the City on that side of the water wherein the City standeth should be the bounds of the Congregation.”It seems the Burt people weren’t happy with that decision and appealed it, but without success.Another point of interest about Presbyterianism in Burt is that in  the worshippers from Inch who had attended Burt since  formed their own congregation under the Derry Presbytery. The mode of transport to Burt from Inch Island had always been boats. It’s said that on Sunday’s someone sat at a window in the Gallery of Burt church watching the tide and when it was just right, the person stood up and announced that ‘the Inch folk may go now.’During the -year ministry of Rev Robert Graythe old church had fallen into a state of disrepair. There were no pews and the aisles were covered by cold flagstones. But, previous to that there was only an earthen floor and no heating at all.In , the church had a new roof and ceiling installed. Prior to that it was recorded that it was a common thing for the rain to pour down on the heads of the congregation.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshNevertheless, the Presbyterian denomination in the district was flourishing. In , the Parish of Burt had , Presbyterians,  people belonging to the Church of Ireland and , Catholics.When it came time to finalise the plans for the new church under the watch of Rev Ross in , the final estimate of William Barker was £, and tenders for the construction project were advertised on April .Three bids were received. One came from R Colhoun in Derry who bid £, for the church and £ for its boundary wall. Another came from Joseph Colhoun, also from Derry who bid £, for the church and £ for the boundary wall. The final tender came from Matthew McClelland from the city who tendered £, for the church and £ for the wall, who having made the lowest bid won the contract.It was agreed that contractor was bound to have the house roofed, the outside of the walls finished and the windows installed by September ,  and ready for opening by March , .In the presence of shirt industry magnate, William Tillie, the High Sherrf of County Derry and many members of the congregation and people from the surrounding area, the foundation stone was laid on July , .The builder, Joseph Colhoun presented Mr Tillie with an inscribed silver trowel to lay the stone and a sealed bottle acted as a time capsule which inside were placed copies of the Derry Standard, the Derry Journal, Londonderry Sentinel, Northern Whig, Missionary Herald, Christian Banner, a photo of the old church and some coins. Lunch was provided for the dignitaries in the lecture room which was highly decorated with flowers and plants.The contract deadline was narrowly missed and the church opened in early May, .The opening services on Sunday, May ,  were conducted by the then Moderator of the General Assembly, Rev Dr G Buick from Cullybackey and the following week by Rev William Colquhoun of Fitzroy Avenue, Belfast. The minister’s room and toilet in the church as well as the pulpit and choir  were provided as gts by Mrs JB Mullin of Buncrana who was the sister of Rev Ross and the we of John Brice Mullin the Deputy Lieutenant of County Donegal.Fundraising events for the upkeep of the church were however still of course necessary. In , it was reported that Rev Ross organised a very successful Sale of Work and Summer Fete which were held on July ,  and  that year.The events took place in the Lecture Hall and a marquee in the church grounds and began at .pm each day. The proceedings were opened on July  by Mrs McMaster of College Avenue in Derry and the Mayor of Derry, Alderman JP Thompson oversaw the events.There was an Empire Work Stall, a Shamrock Work Stall, a Provision stall, a Sweet Stall, a Children’s Stall and Refreshment Stall. The Amusement Committee organised a large number of competitions that included shooting events. On the nights of the  and  July, a iety concert took place in the Lecture Hall. Over the three days, a firm called Neely’s operated a sidecar service ferrying people from Bridgend Railyway Station to the church and back again. The combined rail and admission ticket cost d and a specially laid on train took people back to Derry from Bridgend each night at .pm.The funds raised in July,  helped to renovate the Lecture Hall and other church buildings and to properly lay out the church grounds.As with many other congregations of all denominations across Ireland, the First World War impacted upon Burt Presbyterian Church. To reflect this, in August of  the Church Committee proposed to obtain an organ and a Memorial Tablet at the entrance of the church.Three of the congregation, John Buchanan, Stewart Buchanan and Joseph Downey were killed between -. And, in October  it was reported that £ had been collected for the organ and the memorial. The tablet was unveiled on Sunday, January ,  by Mrs Bowen, we of Colonel William Bowen DSO and the preacher on this occasion was Captain Rev WP Hall and a Guard of Honour travelled to Burt from Ebrington Barracks in Derry for the event. The tablet also remembered  more men and women from Burt congregation who had served in WWI.After the Great War and the partition of Ireland in , many of the working-class families connected to Burt Church moved into Derry city and other part of the North and many more who had served in the war had not ed to the area as work was scarce in this era. The drop in numbers within the congregation was reflected by the names recorded in the Communion Roll Book between -.Rev R W Ross resigned from active duty as Minister of Burt Presbyterian Church on July ,  and he died aged  at the City and County Infirmary in Derry on Sunday, July  after a long illness. The Church Session and Committee met later that day and paid tribute to the long and diligent service that had he had given.A deputation from the church was due to travel to Belfast the next day to meet with the Presbyterian Union Commission and they went ahead with the plans despite Mr Ross’ death as there would not an opportunity for another meeting for at least another two months.The Union Commission was proposing that Burt and Netwoncunningham congregations should be amalgamated under one minister, but the Session and Committee of Burt flatly rejected the suggestion.In June of  the Committee looked at the issue of enquiring at the price of a memorial for the late Rev Ross and a stained glass window and in February of  a Mr Haslett submitted sketches for a memorial tablet and his proposals were accepted. The memorial tablet was unveiled by Rev Ross’ widow Bessie on Sunday, June , .Rev Robert William Ross had married Bessie in  and in his will left a total of £ s d. He was buried in Derry City Cemetery.Upon her husband’s passing Bessie lived firstly at Castlehill Road, Belfast and later at Bognor Regis and then Pallant, Chichester. Following her death on July ,  she was buried there. Bessie bequeathed a total of £, s d to her two sons, Leslie Norman Ross and Arthur Gordon Ross, who were both doctors.A third son, George Harold Ross was born on May ,  in Derry.

There is currently, after years of campaigning, a genuine momentum of support building in Dublin and in London for a new university here.“We need to harness this carefully and creatively, to deliver a standalone Higher Education institution for our city region.“There is a real chance to redress  years of isolation and alienation and to build hope and prosperity for future generations in northwest Ireland.“We must be careful not to be side-tracked into short-term fixes as we have been before. We have an opportunity here to create a legacy that will endure for centuries.”The spokesperson added that the North West must immediately begin revising its current ‘tenuous’ development plans so as to accommodate a new university.“It is a matter of great concern that so much of this region’s future planning centres on promises made by Ulster University, an institution controlled in Belfast and Coleraine, which has consistently failed Derry and northwest Ireland – and has broken promise after promise to this city - over the past six decades.“As regards the long-term planning of the region, it is not acceptable that we do build and deliver our own alternative. Derry and the North West have the capability, the determination and the vision to deliver a better future for ourselves.“It is reckless and perilous to remain entirely dependent on outside institutions that will always, by necessity, serve their own interests and those of their friends first. Why should we continue to acquiesce to those who have failed us, misled us and ultimately alienated us over six dferent decades ”The spokesperson added that a new Derry-centred institution, with a cross-border element under the auspices of the National University of Ireland, could help militate against the impact of Brexit.“Derry Strabane Council needs, as its first priority, to re-draft its City Deal to ensure that it can include a new independent university as its new anchor partner.“Council also needs to engage pro-actively with the Dublin and London governments to enact supporting legislation, and to secure resources, funding other support and accreditation for this new dedicated institution for the North West.“The positive momentum is there. This is an opportunity we cannot afford to miss. We have a responsibility to future generations to seize this opportunity and build a new, dedicated university in the North West.”The Derry University Group, which is based at Ráth Mór, was established in  by Conal McFeely, Diane Greer and Garbhan Downey.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"eamonn mccann derry treated contempt nationalist leadership","story":"By Eamonn McCanngoogletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshThe neglect of Derry on both university education and rail links has been blamed for  years on sectarian unionism.There is a great deal of truth in this - but it’s not the whole truth.The same neglect has continued under politicians wearing green jerseys.It is half a century since unionism held sway in these parts.

Derry is already not just a walled city but a world city.A Derry university freed from the shackles of UU would attract students and academic talent from around the world.Pleading for a medical school in terms which suggest that that’s all we want falls far short of what’s needed.

The committee was headed by Lockwood, who was an English academic. He produced a report on a second university for Northern Ireland he recommended not Londonderry but Coleraine.“Runner-up to Coleraine was the city of Armagh. It was not a sectarian decision it was made by an impartial English academic. It is slanderous to suggest that he was sectarian.”However, alluding to successive decades of underinvestment Mr Adonis yesterday told the Derry News: “No matter what the motives behind these decisions were, the result is that Derry has unfairly lost out and its young people deserve better.“The past should not govern the future. Yet the situation is getting worse not better.”Figures gathered by the Derry News under Freedom of Information legislation, and published last month, show that student numbers in the city actually fell from , in   to , in  .This comes at the same time UU created a new and much larger campus in Belfast city centre at a cost of £-m. The university has attributed a reduction in student numbers and “expansion challenges” in Derry to higher education budget cuts.At Monday’s debate, Baroness OLoan defended Ulster University’s position insisting that the building infrastructure at Jordanstown was not capable of being sustained leaving it with no option but to relocate.UU’s decisionWhile, Lord Empey, a former leader of the UUP, and Minister responsible for further and higher education who dealt with Ulster University at somesaid he supported the proposition of a medical school in Derry.However, he added that the decision of where to invest was down to the university alone and UU “made very clear to us what it wanted to do. It said: we want to rebuild our Jordanstown campus and put it in the centre of Belfast. Will you support us or not “It was not a question of Londonderry versus Belfast—that option was not open. It had made its decision.”Meaningful change can be brought about as a result of this report which, Mr Adonis says, is a signicant first step towards increasing student numbers in Northern Ireland and the establishment of a new university with its principal campus in Derry - \"I hope action will follow,” he added.“It is realistic to believe that Derry can have a standalone university since it is the norm for cities the size of Derry across the UK to have universities of their own. Derry is unusual only in being so acutely disadvantaged. It is scandalous that this issue was not addressed years ago.”Askedhe will continue to advocate on Derry’s behalf, he added: “Absolutely! I will follow the government’s report in September closely and continue to push for Derry to have a university with its principal campus in the city.

But, that short daily journey must have taken as least twice as long as it would have taken anyone  simply because almost everyone he passed knew him, stopped him and engaged in conversation with him.On the th anniversary of the school’s opening in  I was asked to help compile a book to mark the occasion. When I sat down to write a list of those who would have to be interviewed, John Dunne was the first name on the top of the pile.When I started to transcribe John’s interview it began like this: “In this era of media created ‘stars’, famous for nothing more than seeking fame-or infamy, in many cases-the tag of legend is one that is all too easily doled out.“Most people in their formative years can point to a mentor who influenced them greatly and provided knowledge and encouragement when these vital commodities were often all too scarce. More often than not, these people are unassuming and go about their lives in the same manner.“These people are society’s real legends and in the history of St Joseph’s, fewany, earned that accolade more than John Dunne.”That chapter of the book on St Joseph’s was entitled ‘One of nature’s gentlemen’, and there’s absolutely no reason to change that title for the purposes of this appreciation of John Dunne’s le because in my opinion its accuracy cannot be upgraded in any way.‘Big John’ as he was affectionately known to all former pupils of the school, made a positive mark on thousands of young lives in his four decades at St Joseph’s. It would be hard to find anyone that would disagree that the word big when applied to John Dunne not only represented his physical stature but also his intelligence and patience.By , the Dunne family had lived at Brandywell Road, Burnfoot and then back to Derry and more specically the newly developing Creggan estate.John Dunne began his career at St Columb’s College in  in the company of contemporaries such as Nobel laureates John Hume, Seamus Heaney.In  he told me: “I enjoyed the time at St Columb’s without really realising or wondering what le was about. There were people then who went back up to the College at six o’clock and studied until nine o’clock.“But, I and another man, Bill Smyth, who also ended up teaching at St Joseph’s, instead of going to the school, followed a great interest we had discovered-greyhounds. That was our main pursuit. Strangely, we both also ended up training as teachers at St Joseph’s College in Belfast which was linked to Queen’s University but separate in that it awarded its own accreditation.”It was at training college that John Dunne encountered a dilemma. Already well-known for his ability as a footballer, his lelong passion, he had to make the choice of whether he would pursue as a career as PE teacher.“I had distinct limitations, because when I was very young, I nearly died twice. When I was six months old and again when I was five, I caught pneumonia. I remember the second time and having to lie from about December to April before I came around.“I was in a sort of comatose state for a long time, but my mother God rest her, battled away and I survived. But, it left me severely limited in terms of stamina. In terms of pace, I was very quick off the mark, but I couldn’t sustain it. And, the further up you went in football, the more of a problem it became. I loved reserve football, but the full senior game was just too fast for me,” he said.In September  John began his teaching career at the newly opened St Joseph’s Secondary School in Creggan for the princely sum of £ per month. It was here that he spent the entire span of his professional le.The new school with its emphasis educating those who had not successfully navigated the old  plus exam, it was a ready-made home for John Dunne and many of his contemporaries alike. Like many of his era, John benefitted from easier access to grammar school system because of post-war changes to British education policy. But, also like many of his generation, John spoke candidly about his reservations on it. His words also revealed why he preferred the non-selective route through school.“The thing about going to St Columb’s is that we weren’t completely accepted. We were dferent somehow. The boarders who stayed there were the ‘real’ St Columb’s boys as far as the clergy were concerned.“There are things now that are still etched in my memory. Where I lived, there was a protest after a child lost a leg having been hit by a bus. The people were worried about the safety of their children so they weren’t prepared to let the bus keep travelling that route.“Anyhow, the protest could be seen from the College. A priest, who shall remain nameless said, ‘well, what would you expect from people like that ’“We took great umbrage at that. I had been through a kind of elitist system at St Columb’s, where you had to prove yourself in the first place by getting so many marks in an  plus exam, in English and Maths-and they weren’t easy. They were quite dficult examinations. I went to the Christian Brothers at they drilled us kept us on in the afternoon for an hour, got us up on Saturday mornings and drilled us and drilled us.“When I went to teach in a secondary school it was very dferent. You had children there that for one reason or another had fallen through the system. They hadn’t perhaps done themselves justice in the system that surrounded them. In my time at St Joseph’s there were children who should not have been there because they could not get anything out of the system at all, no matter how much we tried or how much sympathy we had for their position. But we did try.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“I had been through a system where I met good teachers, people who had made a good impact on my le. So, what I did when I saw what they were doing was imitate them. I wove all the goodness in other people into a fabric that I could use myself, and I found that it worked,” said John.At the end of John Dunne’s first decade as a teacher, the Troubles erupted on the streets of his native city. St Joseph’s geographical location meant that major disturbances often encroached upon the school itself. It befell people like John Dunne to provide a calm backdrop to the mayhem outside the gates of St Joseph’s.In  he said: “It was a very, very strange environment to be working in, because all hell could have broken loose in the immediate vicinity of the school at any time. There were teachers out on the streets, acting as buffers, trying tom keep a lid on things.“In practical terms, I found it very hard because in summer time it was very hot and you had to open the windows to let a bit of air in. But, there were helicopters flying about and the noise was unbearable and the youngsters couldn’t hear you. A lot of young people became involved and some of them lost their lives as a consequence.”Apart from a very quick but understated wit, John Dunne was blessed with a fantastic voice, full of dramatic intonation, that would have been the envy of many stage actors.As a teacher of the English language John had the ability the bring the most boring text to le and kept his students enthralled. He could have been reading the contents of the back of a cereal box aloud, but when he spoke people listened.The ability to relate a story, complete with an array of accents when required, was one that he credited his grandfather John Downey with.“He was a great storyteller. I remember as a young boy he used to take me early in the morning for his pension. We used to go to Mass about seven or eight o’clock and then go to the train station on the Strand Road and out to Bridgend for his pension and then visit people in the area.“But when we were walking, he always told me stories about haunted houses, about what kind of flowers were at the side of the road.“There seemed to be no end to his knowledge and then he could deviate and tell me another yarn. I just thrived on his stories.“I think also it was the way I was taught at the Christian Brothers. They were very precise about language. It’s become too loose now. People are very loose, especially when using mobile phones.“I’ve even read about the use of the apostrophe being lost. I was taught these things were important when you wrote something. I stuck to it and I tried to instil it into youngsters without being overly heavy about it.”John Dunne’s dulcet tones were employed again when Derry City FC re-entered senior football in  and for many years after he commentated on many of the games played by his beloved Candystripes.This interview with John Dunne was conducted in  at Pilot’s Row community centre. At this stage he had been retired from teaching for almost two decades. But, the huge capacity that he had to retain swathes of information was still very much evident.Asto prove that very thing, in the later stages of this conversation a young boy, no more than ten or eleven years old walked past and said cheerily, ‘hello John!’Without blinking an eye, John Dunne recounted the boy’s family history and how many of his relatives attended St Joseph’s. That was proof that you could take the man away from St Joe’s, but not St Joe’s away from the man.The interview with John Dunne ended with him speaking about the five decades since the school opened.He said: “It’s been some fty years, especially for somebody like me who has finished up living in the Bogside. When I got here, I was a little bit apprehensive about being someone who worked in St Joseph’s and being accepted into the local community. But, it’s no bother. I am on first name terms with people.“I was walking over to Mailey’s pub one night in the summer about .. It was a beautul night. There was a group of young men sitting in a garden. I was walking in the middle of the road and one of them came out and addressed me by my name.“He said, ‘John, there are not many teachers that could do what you are doing and walked through this area untouched.“That’s good to know I said.”CAPTION: The late John Dunne."},{"url":null,"title":"springtown camp monument officially unveiled next month","story":"A monument commemorating the Springtown Camp in Derry will be officially unveiled next month at a ceremony near the entrance to the former site it has been announced.The unveiling will take place on Thursday, August  adjacent to the North West Regional College Training Centre at  noon and will be followed by a Civic reception at the Guildhall at pm.The art installation will take the form of a Nissan hut in which the inhabitants of the camp were forced to live in deplorable conditions because of a policy of housing discrimination in operation at the time against the Catholic community.Springtown Camp was originally a Second World War United States military installation which was vacated after the end of the conflict in the mid-s. Over  families once inhabited Springtown Camp and occupied it around  because of over-crowded living conditions in Derry.The decision to squat in the former military huts, despite the fact there was no electricity, running water or means of heating, came after many families evaluated that these conditions were actually better than they were enduring.The camp became a focal point of the early civil rights agitation in Derry.Willie Deery, who grew up in the camp, said: “This monument is vital because the camp symbolises the precursor to the civil rights marches.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“It’s also somewhat ironic because  years after our mother’s were evicted from the Guildhall for protesting against the conditions at the camp there will now be a civic reception for us there.“This will be a recognition for our parents who had to raise their children in shocking circumstances.

Irsquom still in shock, she confessed.The highly-dedicated athlete didnrsquot start the competition that well, but she recovered well to lt bronze.ldquoI had a bad first shoot, which I put down to nerves. I then I had to work my way from the back over the next few circuits.Good shoots and strong running in the next three circuits is what helped to pull me up to bronze, she continued.ldquoMadeira was amazing.

I also had the pleasure of meeting campaigners from across the UK as part of the Extinction Rebellion protests in Parliament.And I recently bumped into some students from Stanwell School who have been taking part in the climate strike movement and standing up for action on climate change and the climate emergency. I was glad to help get their and other constituentsrsquo voices heard on this in Parliament, because itrsquos not being debated enough - itrsquos getting lost behind other things.So whether itrsquos local action we can take on recycling and packaging, or global action on climate change and carbon emissions, we all need to do more to deal with an emergency thatrsquos going to affect us all for generations to come.I was out and about again in Penarth this weekend, along with a team of our fantastic Labour town and Vale councillors, talking to people about the forthcoming European elections. There was a lot of support for our clear Welsh Labour position backing a final say in a peoplersquos vote for the public on any Brexit deal.Following the mixed results in the local elections in England and Northern Ireland last week, there was much talk about Labour lsquobailing outrsquo the government. Let me be crystal clear on this ndash I will never lsquobail outrsquo the disastrous Tories on Brexit, and neither will the overwhelming majority of Labour MPs.We can resolve the situation, but not by any backroom stitch-up that would risk letting down both those who voted Leave and Remain. The only way forward out of this mess is to let the people have the final say on any deal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

And under my leadership, a Conservative administration will proudly put the people of the Vale of Glamorgan first.ldquoNaturally, we are open to working with other councillors who share those ideals.ldquoOthers - including those who resigned from the Conservative party - will have to explain to voters where they stand on these issues - and I would urge them to back us, rather than propping up a Labour administration that was rejected by the Vale at the last election.Cllr Bailey said he had a six-point plan for the Vale.He pledged to deliver the Dinas Powys bypass stop inflation-busting council tax rises scrap proposed parking charges review the local development planto curb inappropriate development protect rural schools and oppose the Barry Biomass plant.Cllr Bailey said that he was also keen to improve engagement with the public, after a series of hugely unpopular decisions taken by the existing cabinet.He said: ldquoDuring the elections in , we promised to build a stronger relationship with local residents by consulting them on key decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, too many people feel that their views are simply being ignored and that Vale consultations are just tick box exercises. Take the proposals around car parking charges, or the closure of Llancarfan School. I donrsquot think anyone outside of the Civic Offices believes that those decisions werenrsquot already done deals, and thatrsquos simply unacceptable.ldquoAnother good example is the councilrsquos failure to listen to the public over Penarthrsquos original Victorian lamp posts.ldquoIrsquove been criticised for wanting to listen to the people who elected me, and I make no apologies for that. Under my leadership, thatrsquos exactly what would happen and whilst I do accept that there are dficult decisions to be taken, we have to take the public with us - not ignore their legitimate concerns. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John. He really made an impact on our wards and with our patients who listened to his shows.ldquoItrsquos such a lovely way to mark not only Johnrsquos birthday but also to mark the contribution he made as a volunteer during Volunteersrsquo Week. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people.

Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This is a project of regional signicance and we need to be banging the drum for funding because this scheme should be the top priority for the administration. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/nstreet1.jpg","title":"belfasts north street arcade to be redeveloped","story":"Posted on Tuesday  June  by John Mulgrew A former Belfast shopping arcade left derelict after being gutted in a blaze more than a decade ago could be brought back to le amid fresh development plans.

It’s been sitting empty for  years, but once played host to a range of popular Belfast stores, including DJ and local punk pioneer Terri Hooley’s record shop, Good Vibrations. The plans to redevelop the arcade are included in a revised scheme called Tribeca Belfast – formerly Royal Exchange. UK developer Castlebrooke is planning to redevelop much of the north side of the city centre as part of a £m scheme. It’s made a number of amendments and changes to the development, most notably revising back from a formerly retail-led scheme to one with fewer shops. Tribeca Belfast includes development around Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, North Street, Garfield Street and High Street. Castlebrooke Investments says it is now committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format, with space designed for independent retailers. It has also been announced that architectural design firm Squire  Partners has been appointed to work on the amended proposals. The team from Squire  Partners will work alongside conservation architects from Belfast-based Consarc Design Group. Neil Young, chief executive of Castlebrooke Investments, said: “We are very pleased to be able to reveal our proposed amendments to our outline planning application for Tribeca Belfast, changes which we feel demonstrate that we have listened to feedback from the city. “We will continue to listen and today we have launched a voluntary public consultation process into these planned changes ahead of the submission of our application. Our community exhibition will provide an opportunity for anyone interested to see the new plans and we will be revealing more information about this in the coming weeks.” Murray Levinson, partner at Squire  Partners, said: “The mix of uses across the site – designed to attract a iety of retail, restaurant, cultural and workplace tenants – and the creation of new public realm, will ensure this part of Belfast will be active throughout the day and into the evening. Providing a large number of residential apartments with shared gardens, as well as a hotel, will create a new opportunity for people to live in the city centre.” And Graeme Moore, specialist conservation architect at Consarc Design Group, said: “Consarc Design Group is delighted that we continue to be involved with the proposals for Tribeca Belfast to offer our expertise in building conservation. As with the previous proposals, all of the listed buildings within this phase are to be retained, restored and adapted for a sustainable ongoing use within the masterplan, rooting the new development in the unique historical character of this part of the city centre.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/droad_1.jpg","title":"major new apartment building planned for dublin road","story":"Posted on Friday  June  by John Mulgrew The Dublin Road in Belfast A new serviced apartment building could be developed along Belfast’s so-called ‘Golden Mile’ on the Dublin Road, it can be revealed.

Peter Allen, partner at Deloitte, said: “For  years, the Technology Fast  awards have celebrated the success and growth of Ireland’s leading indigenous technology companies. “It is fantastic to be able to look back and see how some of the companies which appeared on the Fast  list in the early days have become global businesses and market leaders. “The likes of First Derivatives and Novosco, who were early stage tech companies when they first made the Fast , are now major employers and shining lights within the NI economy.” One of the few Northern Ireland companies to have topped the Fast , appearing in it  out of the  years since the ranking’s inception, is Newry-headquartered financial software company First Derivatives.

The paper, which examines the negative impact of a ‘no deal’ EU exit, warns the “Northern Ireland Civil Service’s assessment remains that a ‘no deal’ would have a profound and long-lasting impact on NI’s economy and society”. Among its key points, it says a ‘no deal’ “could lead to a sharp increase in unemployment, with at least , jobs at risk, based on EU export exposure”. “The impact of EU tarfs could reduce NI’s exports to Ireland by % and the inclusion of non-tarf barriers could see a decline of %,” it says.
