As a schoolgirl in south London, my teacher Miss Peterkin inspired me. She was a Black woman and head of year. She was quite strict and some girls didn’t get on with her, but I was hard-working and could go to the staffroom to ask her advice about life in and outside school. I am second generation Black British Caribbean. My grandparents were part of the Windrush generation and my heritage is hugely important to me. My dad worked in automotive engineering and now he’s a college lecturer, where he is well-liked and respected. Since entering teaching, it has been important to me to continue the legacy of people like him and Miss Peterkin. I feel comfortable and confident in the classroom. I studied chemistry at university and had imagined a career in forensics, but realised I was too sociable for life in a lab. In the final year of my degree, at Kingston University, our project work focused on improving practical skills in secondary schools. My lecturers then asked if I’d considered teaching. I took this on board, particularly as I’d realised how much I enjoyed working with young people, and I knew I was passionate about passing on my knowledge. I went on to do my teacher training at King’s College London, and I was very happy when my mentors said that I had a natural presence in the classroom and an ability to connect with students. Relatability is a big thing for young people. When I started at my current school, the pupils were excited to have a teacher they considered “cool” and from a similar background to them. Students respond to people they respect and like, so you have to find opportunities to connect with them wherever and however they’re inclined to communicate. I always wear heels and a skirt or trouser suit to school, and the girls love to talk about clothes, music or hair with me – as well as about chemistry. The comments I hear from them, particularly Black girls who tell me how important it is to see a woman like them succeed, have a positive impact on all of us. At university, I was the only Black woman in my cohort. I am passionate about changing that representation so the next generation can fulfil its potential. In 2018, I was named Black Young Professionals Network Role Model of the Year and given a Harris Federation Transforming Lives Award for engaging young people in Stem (science, technology, engineering and maths) subjects. In 2019, I started up Young Gifted and STEM – an online network to improve engagement in those subjects among Black and minority ethnic British students. We connect them with role models from industry, colleges and universities and provide opportunities to learn new skills with the aim of boosting representation in the Stem workforce. I want new teachers to feel supported so that the students can always come first. Finding the right school is really important and I was lucky, at my second school, to discover an environment where I could truly thrive. I’m now in my sixth year here and have progressed to head of chemistry, head of science and now associate assistant principal, overseeing the sixth form. Now that I am in a leadership position, I ensure that new teachers can lean on more experienced colleagues for support. As a teacher, I’ve been on a journey and never looked back. In what other job would I get to be sociable, passionate about my subject, and build relationships with about 150 different people every day? I lead a science department of 11 women and half of us are Black, which sends a positive, representative message to students. I watch them grow from 11-year-olds to confident, educated iniduals at 18. For me, teaching a kid to fulfil their potential is a dream. "},{"url":null,"title":"i teach at my old primary school how great teachers and happy times inspired me","story":"These days, when I’m on playground duty, I sometimes see the children putting on similar performances there, just like we did. I tell them that I used to sing and dance on the “stage”, which they love. They get a kick, too, from knowing that some of the teachers still at St Mary’s taught me when I was there. My friends, singing and dancing, my lovely teachers: this was the epitome of happiness for my 9-year-old self. I started at the school in year 4, and at first I was really sad as I missed my friends from my old school. But being a Tottenham born and raised girl, St Mary’s soon started to feel like home, and I grew to love it. From a young age, I knew I wanted to be a teacher. I had such great teachers in my life, who always had me engaged and wanted to push me further. I even wrote into the local newspaper when I was 14, about how proud I was that St Mary’s had received a good Ofsted rating. “The teachers are great, the food is fantastic, even the assemblies are interesting,” I wrote, adding that one day I’d love to be a teacher there. After that did indeed happen, I led a school assembly about careers and used myself as an example of what you can achieve when you set your mind to it! Tottenham has been the victim of bad press over the years, what with the riots of 2011 and it being a bit rough around the edges. But the local community is so warm and supportive. I’m proud to be a product of Tottenham, and I’ve learned that it doesn’t matter where you’re from, anything can be achieved if you work hard enough. My story hasn’t been all plain sailing though. I lost my mum at the age of 15 and some of my GCSEs were impacted. As a result, my route to becoming a teacher was a bit of a journey. I took education studies at university, and then went on to get more experience in the field, working as a teaching assistant in various schools across London. Teachers that I worked with would often encourage me to take the leap and apply for a PGCE so I could become a fully-qualified teacher. With that encouragement, plus the support of my father and my friends, and thinking about what my mum would have wanted for me, I retook my GCSEs and went on to complete my PGCE at Middlesex University. When it came time to find a job, I was encouraged to apply for positions at my two placement schools. But I really just wanted to work at St Mary’s because it was such a happy place for me growing up. It was my ultimate goal, so I waited until a job became available. I started working here, in my old year 5 classroom, in September 2019 and haven’t looked back. It’s funny because I work alongside some of the teachers who taught me and my brothers. Getting the opportunity to work with the teaching assistant from when I was in year 6 makes me want to pinch myself. I was so inspired by these adults growing up, and now I’m incredibly grateful to be working with and learning from these amazing, experienced teachers. There are actually six teachers that were previously students here too, including the incredible headteacher, so I’m not alone! I don’t think it’s a coincidence that so many of us have returned. There is something about this school, and the Tottenham community, that gets under your skin. And I think the senior leadership team at my school recognises the value of bringing in local teachers, who really understand where these children come from. I’m known for my infectious smile – and my laugh can be heard throughout the corridors. My enthusiasm branches out into my teaching. One day I might consider getting involved in senior leadership here, which would really mean I’ve come full circle. But for now, I’m just so happy to have achieved my childhood dream. I’m thrilled to be where I am with my year 5s and to see them smiling and enjoying learning. In time, I hope they will cherish the memories they’re making here, just like I do. As told to Sarah LaBrecque "},{"url":null,"title":"the dog couldnt eat the homework three tech savvy teachers making digital learning rock","story":"One of them, Charlotte Hawthorne, 32, has been working at St John Fisher Catholic college in Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire, for two years. She is a self-confessed nerd and adores her job as deputy head of maths, earning herself the affectionate nickname Mrs Maths. When she’s not teaching maths, attending maths conferences, or baking maths cakes – such as a giant calculator – she’s championing the digital maths community, on her blog and through social media. Hawthorne, a mum-of-two who is married to a maths teacher, shares her lessons on her blog and hosts online maths chats, encouraging other teachers and mathematicians to get involved and talk with one another. She uses hashtags for specific subjects, allowing members of the online community to contribute and benefit from the success of others. “I regularly talk to people who have written maths books, or lead on national projects. It’s led to a massive improvement in my teaching.” Technology has provided Hawthorn with a collaborative “brain” to pick, and her championing of digital cooperation means decades of experience are on hand. She says: “It’s so important for learning and improving as a teacher. You can say: ‘I’m struggling to teach this,’ or ‘My children are not getting the concept of that.’ The responses and ideas have really made a difference to the way I teach – and to the rest of my department as well. I’m always encouraging them to join in. “It feels like a community – we’ve even started a lockdown social group, which is just a lovely chat with a load of maths teachers! It’s helped me help the pupils with how to do things online, especially during the pandemic.” As a PE teacher, the only technology that Elliot Bailey, 26, previously incorporated into his lessons were treadmills and exercise bikes. But that was pre-pandemic. Now, a year after Covid-19 changed all of our lives, his innovative use of tech and live-stream lessons provide his pupils at Sandringham school, in St Albans, Hertfordshire, with escapism and fun – when they need it most. Bailey, who is also a semi-professional footballer for St Albans City FC, has created a video hub where his pupils can share clips of themselves keeping active in lockdown. The compilations have included tap-dancing, kids flipping on trampolines and even a Segway dog walk. Bailey and his colleagues are working hard to keep things fresh, he says. “After a few weeks the novelty wears off so we have to keep changing it. I’ve made board games, such as snakes and ladders, with fitness elements. We roll a dice and the squares the pupils land on have either a 30-second workout, rest or sprint. “I also created a Marvel-style game – it took me ages! To beat the characters, the players have to do, say, 20 press-ups in 30 seconds. Pupils really love that one.” He’s had to become something of a shape-shifter in lockdown, giving Joe Wicks a run for his money one week and feeling like a children’s TV presenter the next, but Bailey says teaching during the pandemic is his proudest achievement to date. He adds: “I know the students look forward to PE lessons. I feel like they need that escapism. I’m proud and privileged that I can keep children engaged and involved during this time.” Meanwhile in Northumberland, Nick Tuck, 47, has helped transform the online infrastructure at Ponteland high school, in Ponteland, where he works as head of science. Due to Tuck’s hunger to move things forward, every pupil now has their own online account and access to learning resources at any time, building the kind of digital literacy and independence that will benefit them far beyond the classroom. The father-of-two believes that the days of pupils heading to “the computer room” should be a thing of the past, and that technology needs to be part of everyday lessons, just like an exercise book. Tuck, who is a Google certified educator, says: “If IT comes to you in a science lesson it becomes a normal part of that lesson, enhancing it.” As a result, when the pandemic reared its head, pupils and staff were as prepared as possible for home schooling. What do the pupils think of it all? They’ve become great cheerleaders for his new system, singing its praises to other staff and encouraging them to jump on board. And one unexpected benefit of IT-integrated lessons, Tuck has found, is that pupils are far less likely to lose or forget about tasks. It turns out the dog can’t “eat your homework” if it’s nestled safely online. He laughs: “There’s nowhere to hide.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/50ac6bb356b7015d3538b42f5c0d4602648c27e1/0_0_5600_3362/master/5600.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=c2d186398165f931112f17007adc41cb","title":"a colourful closeup of east london in pictures","story":"Mollica is now based in Hackney and these snapshots of local street life show “an impulsive visual mosaic of east London”.

Health experts warned over the weekend that the rise in coronavirus cases across Europe could jeopardise the UK’s roadmap out of lockdown and makes foreign holidays unlikely.  My colleague Molly Blackall reported on Saturday: Social care minister Helen Whately warned this morning that the UK public should wait before booking summer holidays abroad, due to rising COVID-19 infection rates in Europe. Whateley told the BBC: Our main Covid-19 liveblog has more details: That means their price has slumped very sharply today, pushing up Turkey’s cost of borrowing. Financial stocks are leading the selloff, on fears of a new currency crisis after President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan replaced Central Bank of Turkey Governor Agbal with Sahap Kavcioglu. Stephen Innes of AXI Trader says Agbal’s dismissal has given investor confidence a hefty knock: Innes reckons it will take “a little while before the dust settles”, given the new uncertainty over Turkey’s monetary policy: Reuters has the details: Jim Reid of Deutsche Bank told clients: David Madden of CMC Markets adds: It could be a volatile day in the Turkish financial markets, after president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan dramatically sacked the country’s central bank chief early on Saturday. The shock dismissal of Naci Agbal stunned investors, who had welcomed Agbal’s move towards more othodox monetary policy since his appointment late last year. That included a hefty interest rate rise on Thursday, which had bolstered confidence in the currency. Back in 2018, Erdoğan famously described high interest rates as the “mother and father of all evil”. He argues that they cause high inflation a view at odds with conventional economics. This is the third time that Erdoğan has fired a central bank chief, and analysts were quick to warn that reversing recent interest rate rises could be destabilising. Tim Ash, senior emerging markets sovereign strategist at Bluebay Asset Management, said: “This implies the government will once again try to stimulate the economy by low rate policies,” said Selva Demiralp, director of the Koc University-TUSIAD Economic Research Forum, in Istanbul. The new governor, Şahap Kavcıoğlu, is a former banker and ruling party lawmaker. He has taken steps to reassure the markets, Reuters reports: European stock markets are expected to open lower, with last week’s government bond selloff fresh in the City’s mind. Fears of a third wave of Covid-19 in Europe, and the escalating row between the UK and EU over access to AstraZeneca’s vaccine, could also weigh on the markets this week.  The latest US housing data, and an econonic survey from Chicago, could intensify the debabe about how long the US central bank can leave its interest rates at record lows.

What was your motivation for writing a memoir? I see the memoir as part of a trilogy. I wrote a book called Alone Together in which I diagnose a problem that technology was creating a stumbling block to empathy – we are always distracted, always elsewhere. Then I wrote a book called Reclaiming Conversation, which was to say here’s a path forward to reclaiming that attention through a very old human means, which is giving one another our full attention and talking. I see this book as putting into practice a conversation with myself of the most intimate nature to share what you can learn about your history, about increasing your compassion for yourself and your ability to be empathic with others. I also wanted to write this book because I’ve wanted to read this kind of book. That is to say a book where you learn about the backstory of somebody whose work life has truly been animated by the personal story. Many people have this book to write but daren’t because they think their work life should be pristine, that it should come from a purely cognitive place. And I knew that in my case, that wasn’t true. So is there an academic whose yet unwritten memoir you’d like to read?I’m not going to tell you who I think has an interesting backstory, but I admire the work of Oliver Sacks. In his book Uncle Tungsten he shows how chemistry saved his life after he was so damaged by the war. The periodic table helped him organise his thoughts. My deepest concerns really come out of my own story. I felt that not enough people are saying: my personal life and my profession are really mixed together and that’s what makes my professional life rich. I wanted to say that. There’s nothing in my personal life that I’m ashamed of. I’ve made mistakes that had false starts, but there’s nothing in this book that I disown. In The Empathy Diaries you often write about putting yourself in the shoes of someone whose behaviour has been troubling in an attempt to understand their point of view. When did you become conscious you had that kind of capacity? Before empathy was a virtue for me, it was a survival mechanism. That’s because my family was trying to embed me in a tissue of lies. And I knew for my sanity, I had to have a little bit of distance. The periodic table wasn’t going to do it for me – I was trying to find peace in the world by putting myself in other people’s shoes. One of these lies is explained after your mother died of cancer. You find out that she orced your father because when you were very young he was conducting psychological experiments on you. How did that feel when you found that out? I don’t remember anything about the experiments, but when I found out about them in my late 20s, a remarkable thing happened. Which is that years after her death, I had a reconciliation with my mother. Because I’d been so angry that she had taken my father away from me. And now I realised that she had saved me. That was really a moment of great tenderness and empathy towards her because I understood for the first time that she did what she did with great love, empathy and compassion. As a child, I would have had no way of knowing this. Eventually you tracked down your father. When I met him I was able to give up the fantasy of him. So I was able to realise that’s done now and you can stop turning him into Prince Charming – he was a flawed guy. There was a deep shift as I reconciled with my mother because although I loved her, I had showed her little cruelties – cruelties that darted out because I was so angry at her for depriving me of this father. When you were researching your memoir, did you have new insights? Yes. There’s one event in particular – a story I don’t tell in the book because I didn’t have the realisation until after it was finished. I’m around eight and a half, my mother comes to pick me up from my grandparents, hands me a white hat and says: “I knitted this for you.” I know this hat is from a store near the subway station. I don’t know why my mother is lying to me again I can’t figure it out. Years later I spend a lot of time in psychoanalysis and it never gets resolved. But when I’m writing the memoir, like the character in Homeland, I’ve placed index cards on the wall, with strings linking them, to make sure the timeline adds up. I figure out that my mother got her diagnosis of cancer at exactly this point. So perhaps she was coming back from the doctor to pick me up from my grandparent’s house. And she’s decided not to tell me. She must have felt so alone, but wanting to connect with me, on the spur of the moment, she bought me this cap and, wanting to be more the perfect mother, hands it to me and says she knitted it. I could not empathise with her until I pinned where she was that afternoon. His essential insights were that computers shouldn’t be these grey boxes sitting on tables. They should be beautiful things that people could identify with. I called it an intimate machine, I called the computer a second self – that was his kind of thing. So I deserved to be talking to Jobs. And of course, Steve Jobs walked into my apartment, looked at my vegetarian dinner and he said, this is the wrong kind of vegetarian and walked out. So I was even a failure as the little woman. So I couldn’t even succeed as the lady professor who could make the dinner for Steve Jobs. I am so late to see the sexism in my own career and feel the appropriate anger. The internet enables us to block, ghost and troll people. Yet it can help us feel less isolated. Are there two sides to the relationship between empathy and technology?The answer to that question is yes, which is why this is no simple story. Look at the pandemic. It has made us so dependent on forging relationships and maintaining relationships onscreen. It’s a miracle, but there are limitations. Let’s not get into the following problem. You start out saying the internet is better than nothing, then suddenly you start saying maybe it is better than everything. When I was researching Reclaiming Conversation, one 18-year-old said to me: “I tell you what’s wrong with conversation that takes place in real time. We cannot control what you’re going to say.” I’ve been in Zoom meetings where things get difficult and some people just disappear. Then they reappear after the difficult part of the conversation has ended. You turn off your screen and put it on mute. The problem we face as this pandemic is ending, God willing, is that some people are going to be tempted not to reappear. The thing about human contact is that we’re vulnerable. In your years of studying technology, has there been a turning point, feature or service that has accelerated its unwelcome side-effects? There are two things. The point when Facebook and social media in general discovered its business model – that’s when the connection between democracy and privacy became my subject. After two manipulated US elections and the Covid misinformation, we are now seeing there’s a higher level of public consciousness about what’s going on here – 10 or 12 years ago I couldn’t get people to engage. Number two is pretend empathy. AI programs that say they are listening, pretend they are your friend… more people are saying if they help an old or lonely person, that’s great. But this is my line in the sand. Living through the pandemic has shown that people need relationships, people need people. We can write programs that mimic us, but I don’t want to talk to a robot, something without a body, that isn’t a child, that didn’t have a mother.

The impenetrability is the point. The accuracy and detail by which the police procedural, Jed Mercurio’s third-finest work (the first two, informed by his years as a hospital doctor, are Cardiac Arrest and Bodies – I will brook no riposte), is characterised has become legendary. Jargon, shorthand and acronyms abound, and the viewer must either keep a glossary to hand or just go along for the ride, enjoying the breeze in their hair as the abbreviations whip past even faster than the plot. PNC! HCP! MIT! HGP! (Unless that’s HCP again and I just misheard.) The sixth series opens as strongly as ever. To translate (with the aid of Google) the opening paragraph for you: a Covert Human Intelligence Source (Chis) or “snitch” as they might have had it in The Sweeney, has told their police handler that a man called Ross Turner admitted to them that he killed Grace Vella. Vella was a journalist shot dead at point-blank range and on whose case very little progress has been made. “Sucking diesel” is the preferred expression of delight by head of anti-corruption unit AC-12 Supt Ted Hastings (Adrian Dunbar) when one of his men (not to be confused with “one of our own”, which generally prefigures disaster) catches a break. Hastings hasn’t turned up yet, however. So far we are with the MIT – murder investigation team – led by DI Jo Davidson. She is played by Kelly Macdonald, following in the hallowed footsteps of Lennie James, Keeley Hawes, Thandie Newton, Stephen Graham and others as the guest star around whom increasingly large numbers of plot threads promise to twist and gather under increasing tension until AC-12 manages to unpick everything. AC-12 doesn’t get involved until one of Davidson’s team, PC Farida Jatri (Anneika Rose) reports her concern that her boss erted them to an armed robbery she seemed to spot through a brick wall on their way to arrest the Vella suspect, and did so to give the suspect time to get away. DI Steve Arnott (Martin Compston) takes the call and this seems as good a time as any to inform you – and my intel is A1 on the matrix here – that this series will become known, however compelling it proves to be, however many shock twists and sudden deaths and revelatory performances we witness, as “The One Where Arnott Has a Beard”. I mean, I quite like it. It’s just that part of me feels that after five series of commitment from viewers, we should be consulted before this kind of character choice is made. Anyway. Arnott slightly fudges his way to getting Hastings to allow him to investigate, and before the hour is up the stage is set, balls are in play, seeds are planted, plates are spinning and wheels are in motion. Suspicions are gathering, at least one gasp-worthy moment has been delivered and there is altogether a fine sense that we are gearing up for an absolute humdinger of a series. Longtime fans will remain slightly on edge, however. Every Line of Duty outing begins explosively. There hasn’t been one that hasn’t been utterly addictive at the off. The trick is to keep up the level of intrigue and credibility, and the previous series stumbled, badly, particularly with believability. The main storyline flagged, with Compston and Vicky McClure – as Kate Fleming, the third part of the anti-corruption triumvirate headed by Hastings – given embarrassingly little to do with an often embarrassingly clunky script. The overarching storyline about H – the alleged spider at the centre of a web of police corruption – was almost irredeemably fumbled in the finale. But Line of Duty’s back and it so far seems just as good, if not better, than ever. If it can hold to its successful formula without tipping into parody, if it can find its way back from the H debacle, and if it can weave its customarily masterful narrative spell without tying itself or us in knots – well, then we’ll all be sucking diesel."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa344c1378e89909d3dc9794260c0c11a7f87bdf/0_47_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=92198fa414d0b932af49b6d7a755cc23","title":"coronavirus live news global covid updates germany lockdown chile record daily cases","story":"One is from China’s CanSino Biologics company and the other is CoviShield, the Indian version of the AstraZeneca jab.  If both are approved for mass use by the National Health Centre, Hungary will have seven sources to procure vaccines from.  It is unclear when and in what quantity the country planned to deploy the two newly authorised doses. It comes after reports that some people had been unwilling to receive the jab due to concerns about side effects. Poland did not suspend use of the vaccine unlike several European countries, arguing that the benefits outweighed potential risks.  “This shows that we made the right decision not to suspend vaccinations with AstraZeneca, there are definitely more people willing to be vaccinated with this vaccine,” he added. Poland is grappling with spiralling infection rates amid a third wave of the pandemic driven by a highly contagious variant first discovered in Britain.  Health minister Adam Niedzielski said the numbers of daily cases would continue to grow for two to three weeks. The country has reported 2,073,129 cases and 49,365 deaths.According to the Handelsblatt newspaper, a draft by German federal and state governments states: “The level-headed behavior of the citizens in Germany during the Christmas days has impressively shown how family get-togethers can be made safe.”  Therefore, from 2 April to 5 April, 2021, meetings with four people beyond their own household plus children up to the age of 14 from the close family circle will be allowed – even if this means more than two households or five people over 14 years of age. The nationwide seven-day incidence rose to 107.3 on Monday, the Robert Koch Institute said. The Greens’ health expert Janosch Dahmen warned against hesitant action in the face of a third wave. “If we always wait to be perfect and certain before we do anything, then this third wave will be worse than the second,” Dahmen told Frühstart on RTLntv.  Dahmen said it was possible that soon more and younger people will be in intensive care units.  I’m now going to hand over to my colleague Nadeem Badshah.“The recommendation has been revised to provide the 2nd dose of Covishield at 4-8 weeks’ interval after the 1st dose, instead of earlier practiced interval of 4-6 weeks,” the ministry said in a statement, using the brand name for the vaccine made locally by the Serum Institute of India. “Maybe the ideal goal is ... to get half of the tourists we had in 2019. This, for the industry, would be an achievement,” she said in an event held by Europa Press news agency.  In prime minister Boris Johnson’s roadmap out of England’s lockdown, 17 May had been earmarked as the earliest possible date for international leisure trips, which are currently illegal. Whately’s comments drew sharp criticism from the UK travel industry. The survey conducted by YouGov, a British polling firm, shows that a majority of people in some of the biggest EU member nations — including Germany, France, Spain and Italy — now deem the vaccine to be unsafe.  The poll involved around 8,000 people in seven European countries between 12 and 18 March. Last week, a different poll found that the temporary halt of the AstraZeneca rollout in at least 13 different countries due to concerns over rare blood clots hardly affected the willingness of Germans to get vaccinated. The RDIF sovereign wealth fund said on Monday full-scale commercial production would start after completing the transfer of technology in the second quarter.  The announcement follows similar deals with Indian pharmaceutical firms Gland Pharma, Stelis Biopharma and Hetero, Reuters reports.  India, the world’s largest vaccine maker, has become one of the biggest producers of the Sputnik V shot outside Russia. Other countries producing it include Brazil, China and South Korea. The country also reported another 361 deaths, raising the official toll to 95,391. The country logged 7,757 new coronavirus cases on Sunday, the third consecutive day new cases breached 7,000 and just a slight drop from the record-high tally posted a day before, CNN Philippines reported. In a bulletin, the health ministry said on Monday total confirmed cases had reached 671,792, while deaths increased by four to 12,972.

We are pretty much stuck and we could be looking at another surge,” he told RTÉ Radio 1’s Morning Ireland.“The more we come together, the more the virus spreads. The new strain spreads faster,” he added.The public needed to look at which situations were most important and to prioritise them, Prof Cormican suggested. Coming together for occasions such as wakes and birthday parties was a “huge risk” to everybody. This was evidenced by the spread of Covid in certain workplaces and other settings where people come together.Prof Cormican said that everything had to be done in proportion and that included mandatory quarantine which was under constant review. The main concern about travel was that people might bring a variant to Ireland that might be vaccine resistant, he said.It was all about managing the risk, he said, adding: “Everything that we do has to be about balancing risk.” There was a balance between people being able to live their lives and controlling the virus with the lowest possible level of risk, he said.Contact tracingOn Monday morning, infectious diseases expert Professor Sam McConkey called for “huge investment” in public health, including retraining unemployed people to help with detailed contact tracing.Speaking on RTÉ radio’s Today with Claire Byrne show, Prof McConkey also warned that opening up the hospitality sector and multi-generational mixing could lead to a surge in cases and thousands of deaths.The current Level 5 restrictions have not led to the same responses as were achieved in the first and second lockdowns, he said.People were getting tired of the restrictions, which meant the country was in “a really tight spot”. He warned that if the country opened up “things will get rapidly worse.”It could be September to November before the widespread vaccination programme was completed, he said, because of vaccine supply issues.If there was a “huge investment” in populationpublic health it could mean thousands of people becoming involved in local outbreak management teams. With more staff, better IT, along with processes and governance, outbreaks could be better managed.Volunteers and retrained unemployed people could assist with tracing and help the current staff who were struggling, he said.There was also a role for employers, such as in providing access to GPs and sick pay. “There’s a lot that could be done better, that should have been done a year ago.”The arrival of several new vaccines will ease the situation, he said. But it will take a little while. “When it goes from three to 12 we will be able to vaccinate the majority.”Mandatory quarantine was important, but the majority of Covid cases were as a result of domestic contacts. Such quarantine measures were just one part of a 20-piece jigsaw, he said.Cause for hopeMeanwhile, the HSE’s chief clinical officer Dr Colm Henry said there was a need to focus on the positive.“We’re not seeing the dip we’d hoped for, but we’re not back to square one,” he told Newstalk Breakfast, adding that the current level of Covid-19 cases was “disheartening”.Nursing home residents and staff were almost completely vaccinated as were acute frontline workers, where numbers had decreased from 1,000 in one week in February to 14 in one week recently.The vaccination programme will reduce illness, hospitalisations and deaths in vulnerable groups which was a cause for considerable hope, he said. Vaccination enhances public-health measures, but “we cannot rely purely on vaccination alone”, he warned, as it will not lead to an immediately improved situation.“The lower we get figures down, the more choices we will have. There are still a lot of cases out there.”Dr Henry said he is concerned that the continuing high level of cases will lead to more hospitalisations.When asked about the introduction of mandatory quarantine in hotels this week, he said the country was ready for it, but any public-health measures needed the support of the population. “We’ve swallowed more bitter pills in the last year,” he said.Dr Henry said he would encourage people to “hold tight” to help protect the old and vulnerable. As the vaccination programme progresses, case numbers will come down and choices will increase, he added.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 vaccine tracker what s available in the republic of ireland and what else is coming","story":"It has been almost a year since the first case of Covid-19 was confirmed in the Republic of Ireland. Since then, over 200,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and more than 4,000 people have died.Globally, over 100 million people have been diagnosed and over 2.5\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.NEWS AND UPDATES: - How many have been vaccinated here?Scientists have been racing to develop a vaccine that would bring an end to the pandemic, and there are now 64 different vaccines in clinical development, with another 173 in preclinical development, according to the World Health Organisation.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Jannsen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspis also in talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva. 165,398 had received their second dose.Some 180,594 of these vaccines had gone to people in long term residential care facilities, while 292,961 had gone to frontline healthcare workers and 142,306 had gone to people over the age of 70. Some\u0026nbsp4,239 people in Cohort 4 - those\u0026nbspaged between 16 and 69 at very high risk of severe Covid-19 disease - received a dose.\u0026nbspGlobally, over 400 million doses of a Covid-19 vaccine have been administered.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 5.4 million doses by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.EMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc. While talks continue on how to increase production, the company has now committed to a total of 40 million doses for the EU in the first quarter of 2021.While the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab, resulting in a significant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.On March 11th Norwegian health authorities said three health workers in Norway who had recently received the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine were being treated in hospital for bleeding, blood clots and a low count of blood platelets.Norway halted the rollout of the AstraZeneca vaccine, following a similar move by Denmark. Iceland later followed suit.Germany, France, Italy and Spain have also suspended their use of the vaccine pending a review by\u0026nbspthe European Medicines Agency, which is expected to be concluded by Thursday, March 18th.How many will Ireland get? 190,000 doses in February and a further 95,000 in early March - supply after this is not confirmed.Storage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2–8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st .On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2–8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and expects to have its first results by April 2021. On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?In December the HSE published the provisional order in which people in Ireland will be vaccinated against Covid-19. After over-65s in care homes and frontline health workers, people aged 70 and older and other healthcare workers are next in line to receive the vaccine.\u0026nbspPeople aged 16-69 with very high risk conditions will then be\u0026nbspthe fourth cohort to be vaccinated.The next categories are: people aged 65-69 years an ill-defined group referred to as “key workers” and people aged 18-64 with certain medical conditions. Next up will be: those living or working in crowded conditions people working in education those aged 55-64 workers in other occupations important to the functioning of society people aged between 18 and 54 and, finally, pregnant women and those under 18.The vaccination of people aged over 85 began on Monday, February 15th. Those in the 70-84 age bracket should begin to receive their first dose by March 8th, alongside people aged 16-69 with very high risk conditions.The HSE has said everyone over the age of 70 should have received their second dose by mid-May.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4516237.1616358699!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"gp suspended by medical council over refusal to give covid 19 vaccine","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDr Gerard Waters, a GP at the Whitethorn Clinic in Celbridge, said  he would not administer the Covid-19 vaccine on the basis he believed it was untrustworthy and unnecessary. Photograph: Alan BetsonA Co Kildare GP who refused to administer Covid-19 vaccines to his patients has been suspended by the Medical Council.The council, which regulates medical doctors in the State, confirmed that Dr Gerard Waters had been suspended “until further steps are taken”.Dr Waters, a GP at the Whitethorn Clinic in Celbridge, last month told RTÉ Radio One’s Liveline programme that he was a “conscientious objector” to the Covid-19 vaccine and would not be recommending it to his patients.He later told The  he would not administer the vaccine on the basis that he believed it was untrustworthy and unnecessary. Following his comments, the Medical Council used its powers under the Medical Practitioners Act 2007 to make an ex parte application to the High Court for his suspension.Postmortems pointThe hearing was heard in camera, in keeping with the legislative provision that the application can be heard “otherwise than in public” unless the court determines differently.In playing down the severity of the virus last month, Dr Waters said questions remained as to why children did not die and that he did not know anyone who had died from it. He said postmortems should have been carried out on everyone whose death was linked to Covid-19.He also confirmed he did not refer patients for Covid-19 tests. “I have decided not to get involved with the whole thing from the beginning,” he said. A Medical Council spokesman said it has written to “a number” of inidual doctors directly, reminding them of their ethical duty on matters relating to Covid-19.“There is also a number of matters being investigated by the council as part of a regulatory process.”The Medical Council takes issues relating to doctors not following public health guidelines or spreading misinformation in relation to Covid-19 and vaccines very seriously, the spokesman said. Ethics guide“Doctors must continue to advocate for their patients by actively promoting the public health guidance.”The ethics guide governing doctors’ practice included a duty to ensure compliance with all laws and regulations relating to this practice, the spokesman said.“This also includes ensuring doctors promote a culture of patient safety within the context of the wider health system. Doctors also have responsibilities when it comes to posting on social media.”Health Service Executive chief executive Paul Reid last month suggested that healthcare workers who refused to take the vaccine could be removed from their posts. He said everyone had a right to refuse a vaccine if they wished, but the Health and Safety Act allowed for workers to be removed if they were regarded as a threat to other people.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4516283.1616365068!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"another surge in covid 19 possible just ahead of decision time on lifting curbs","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA lab technician with a swab at RocDoc’s drive-through testing facility at Dublin Airport for hauliers bound for France. Photograph: Brian LawlessPA Wire The Government is bracing for another possible surge in Covid-19 infections just a week before the Cabinet is due to decide which restrictions might be lifted in early April after more than three months of Level 5 curbs.The National Public Health Emergency Team on Sunday reported 769 cases and two deaths. Health officials had been expressing concern about case numbers appearing to be stuck at about 500 to 600 per day for the last few weeks, but Sunday’s total was the highest since February 26th.Government sources said the figures were not surprising and that further increases could be expected once the full effects of St Patrick’s Day, Mother’s Day and the recent good weather became evident later this week.The State’s mandatory hotel quarantine regime for passengers arriving from high-risk countries is expected to finally open this week, with a booking system due to go live either on Monday or Tuesday. There will then be a 72-hour period before the contracted hotels open to passengers.The hotel group Tifco has been awarded the contract to operate quarantine hotels.\u0026nbspHundreds of spaces will be available for incoming passengers although the Department of Health does not yet know what the level of demand will be given those entering the system will face a €2,000 bill.Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly visited Dublin Airport on Sunday to inspect how the the system would work from aircraft to hotel. He was brought from airside into the airport, where travellers will meet customs officials and border management. He was then escorted to a security bus and brought to one of the hotels to observe the check-in protocols.The first passengers to use the system could arrive from Thursday onwards. Air carriers will contact anyone who is due to fly in from the date of commencement and inform them that they must book and pay for a space in a quarantine hotel in order to travel.People who stay in the hotels will be given a set period for exercise or smoking and can bring alcohol in with them, or order wine with their dinner, but will not be able to order alcohol to the hotel.SecurityPrivate security will be on site and while there will not be a full-time Garda presence, the force will be called if an occupant breaks their quarantine period, which is likely to be 11 days long.There will be a limited number of “very hard cases” that will allow people to avoid quarantining, but it is understood this will not include allowing people to bypass the system to attend funerals.Meanwhile, the chief executive of the Irish Medical Organisation, Susan Clyne, said on Sunday that 84,000 doses of Covid-19 vaccines were scheduled to be delivered to about 500 general practices this week.She said more than 250,000 people over the age of 70 should have received a dose by the end of the week. The expectation is that everyone over the age of 70 will be fully immunised by mid-May.Ms Clyne said she was confident in meeting those targets if supplies materialise as expected. “If that changes, that creates difficulties.”She said that because of supply line recalibration “we will not have enough vaccines to fully complete the 75-80 age cohort by the end of next week.”European Union leaders will on Thursday consider whether to impose export bans on vaccines to countries outside the bloc.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4513171.1616012156!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"taoiseach says us interest in ni makes a difference at delicate post brexit time","story":"US president Joe Biden spoke in glowing terms of his relationship with Ireland during the bilateral meeting with Taoiseach Micheál Martin.

Photograph:  Julien Behal PhotographyPA WireThe “eyes and interest” of the United States continue to “make a difference at a delicate time” for post-Brexit Northern Ireland, Taoiseach Micheál Martin has said.Speaking at a virtual meeting of the traditional Friends of Ireland St Patrick’s Day event, Mr Martin told Irish-American politicians that there has been “deep appreciation of the importance of the balances and nuances” of Northern Ireland’s Belfast Agreement in Washington since Brexit.This was “an appreciation that we do not take for granted”, the Taoiseach said in an address that touched on the tensions caused by Brexit in the North and between the EU and UK.Mr Martin said the Government always knew that the UK’s departure from the EU would “create strains and complications, especially in Northern Ireland”, and that the “voices” of Irish-American politicians within the caucus “helped pave the way” for the Brexit withdrawal deal.The Northern Ireland protocol within that agreement was “an agreed, balanced compromise” and was “the only way” to manage complexities in Northern Ireland and to avoid a hard border.“Implementing the protocol involves change and sometimes it takes time for people to adjust to new ways of doing things. The protocol has only been in operation since the start of the year,” Mr Martin said.“I have always known that there would inevitably be bumps and wrinkles along the way. That is why the agreement itself contains mechanisms through which any difficulties can be resolved.” For the protocol to succeed and deliver benefits for the people of Northern Ireland, there has to be a relationship between the UK and the EU “based on trust and good faith”, he said, in a reference to the tensions over the UK government’s decision to delay border checks for British businesses.Proud memberIn a video address, US president Joe Biden said that he was a proud member of the Friends of Ireland caucus when he was a US senator and paid tribute to his former colleagues who “tended to the flame of Irish-American relationships – a flame that glows ever brighter every single day”.Democratic congressman Richie Neal, a co-chair of the Friends of Ireland group, said in his online remarks that the 1998 Belfast Agreement underpinning the Northern Ireland peace process “remains the only way forward on the island of Ireland – there is simply no plan B”. Mr Biden quoted his favourite poet Seamus Heaney and his poem The Cure at Troy, which he has quoted in public for years, saying: “We have a chance to make hope and history rhyme.” The Friends of Ireland caucus of Irish-American politicians marks its 40th anniversary this year. Normally the Taoiseach would attend the Friends of Ireland St Patrick’s Day lunch alongside the president at the US Capitol – one of only two occasions in Washington’s political calendar when the president travels to Capitol Hill – but the Covid-19 pandemic forced the event online.

Photograph:  Patrik StollarzAFP via Getty Germany and Belgium appear poised to tighten their lockdowns and EU leaders have cancelled plans to meet in person as coronavirus infection rates continue to surge across Europe.Ahead of a videoconference on Monday of Germany’s national and regional leaders, the Robert Koch Institute for Infectious Diseases reported that case levels had passed a key marker.The number of infections per 100,000 inhabitants hit 103.9 on Sunday, the institute said, above the 100 threshold at which it is deemed that Germany’s intensive care units will no longer be able to cope.An in-person summit of EU heads of state and government scheduled to take place in Brussels on Thursday was cancelled on Sunday. The leaders will discuss the new wave of coronavirus cases via videoconference instead. A spokesman said the decision had been taken “following the surge of Covid-19 cases in member states”.Politicians across Europe voiced concerns over the weekend about the ability of their health systems to deal with the seemingly inevitable third wave of infection.Belgium’s health minister, Frank Vandenbroucke, spoke on Sunday of the need for additional measures despite the country having been in a tough second national lockdown since November.“We have set ourselves a very important ambition by completely opening schools after Easter and catering from 1 May,” Vandenbroucke said. “With this increase in contamination, there is a risk of not achieving these objectives. It is not impossible. To ensure our goals, additional measures are needed.”An average of 3,438 people a day tested positive in Belgium between 10 and 16 March, a 36 per cent increase on the previous week.Romania recorded its highest number of Covid-19 patients in intensive care on Sunday after reporting its highest number of infections for three months last week.The prime minister, Florin Cîtu, nevertheless insisted that a strict national lockdown would not be introduced. “A lot of people are asking if we will end up in lockdown again. My very clear answer is no,” he said.Turkey’s health ministry reported an infection rate of more than 251 cases per 100,000 in Istanbul, the country’s largest city, up 41 per cent since last week.The country’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, announced last week that newly-allowed dining in restaurants would continue “for some more time” despite the rising infection rate, but he has also warned that tougher measures could be brought back.GreeceGreece’s prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, wrote in the To Vima newspaper on Sunday that he was prepared to requisition private-sector doctors to assist the public health system given the danger of hospitals becoming overwhelmed. The government has already called on private-sector doctors to offer their services, but only 55 have volunteered of the 200 required. Mitsotakis said co-operation was always preferable as a first step and that obliging doctors to offer their services was not sufficient. “We have to inspire them to do it,” he wrote.Despite the worrying medical situation, the government announced plans on Friday to reopen the Acropolis in Athens and other ancient sites. It remains determined to restart the tourism season by mid-May.EU leaders are expected to discuss how the bloc’s vaccination strategy can be improved on Thursday, given the comparatively slow rollout.

Photograph: Ruth FremsonThe New York TimesJoe Biden never had a seat at the cool kids’ table at the Obama White House. Heading into 2016 and 2020, if you told the hotshots from Obamaworld that you thought Biden would be a good candidate, they would uniformly offer a look of infinite patience, tolerance and condescension and say something like, “Well, I could understand how someone would think that.”The message was unmistakable: Biden was not part of the Obama entourage. He was sort of a goofball and windbag. He was a member of an older, outmoded generation. In other words, uncool. The West Wing attitude was that Biden should simply be grateful that the Great Obama had handed him a ticket to ride. Biden was viewed as a past-his-sell-by-date pol who needed the president’s guiding hand to keep Uncle Joe from making a fool of himself as vice president.In 2012, Biden faced “friendly fire” from the West Wing, as one outraged Biden family member put it to me back then. Obama aides were furious when Biden went on the Meet the Press TV programme and made a glorious gaffe, blurting out support for gay marriage while his boss was still dragging his feet. They trashed him anonymously to reporters, froze him out of meetings and barred him from doing some national media.“Being managed into a box by Obama’s cocky campaign team only exacerbated Biden’s innate insecurity and drive for independence,” Glenn Thrush wrote in Politico in 2014. In eight years, Biden said in a recent reveal that stunned CNN anchor Anderson Cooper – and left Washington gasping – he and Jill were never invited by the Obamas to their private digs in the White House. Despite a secret poll to see if he should be dropped as veep in favour of Hillary Clinton in 2012, despite being pushed aside by Obama for Hillary in 2016, and despite not getting an endorsement from his erstwhile partner in his uphill primary fight in 2020 until he was the last candidate standing, Biden refused to go gentle into that good night, to quote one of his favourite lines of poetry.With a boost from black Democrats, if not the most famous one, Biden achieved what pretty much no one – especially bratty Obama disciples – had thought possible. At 78, nearly half a century after he arrived in DC as a senator, he became the oldest man ever sworn in as president.So now comes a delicious twist: president Biden is being hailed as a transformational, once-in-a-generation progressive champion, with comparisons to Lyndon B Johnson and Franklin D Roosevelt aplenty, while Obama has become a cautionary tale about what happens when Democrats get the keys to the car but don’t put their foot on the gas.The collective smirk was wiped off the face of Obamaworld this past week, as former aides expressed their irritation at the retrospective dissing, and while Biden’s inner circle enjoyed an unfamiliar sensation: schadenfreude. Now the friendly fire once aimed at Biden is coming toward Obama.All month long, Democrats have been trashing Obama for the size of his itty-bitty 2009 stimulus bill – Chuck Schumer called it “small” and “measly”– and his refusal to sell it to the public. Now, after Biden passed the $1.9 trillion cornucopia of liberal delights, Democrats are thinking that if he keeps it up, they’ll soon be picking up their chisels to carve his face on Mount Rushmore, right in the spot that Obama must have been picturing for himself.Creaky, old-fashioned Joe moved fast and broke things. Unlike the sleek, modern Obama, who kept trying to work with obstructionist Republicans, Biden blew them off, calling it “an easy choice”. Progressives, who had fretted that Biden would govern in a centrist hell, trapped in a sepia, split-the-difference Washington where Mitch McConnell would eat his lunch, were pleasantly surprised.The lacklustre Democratic response to the Great Recession, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez told The New York Times, “created so much damage economically, for people, but it also created a lot of political damage for the party”. Obama’s failure to go big and to send the tumbrels rolling down Wall Street certainly greased the runway for Donald Trump. The paradox of Obama is that Americans embraced radical change by electing him but then he held himself in check, mistakenly believing he was all the change they could handle.As vice president, Biden worried that the Obama advisers at the cool table were too cerebral sometimes, that they’d rather be right than win. Once Obama had spoken, he expected others to come along. If the policies were good, they’d sell themselves. The president, as it turned out, hated politicking. The idea that he had to sell his agenda was so anathema to him that – shockingly – he had to get Bill Clinton to do it for him at the 2012 Democratic convention. Obama joked that his predecessor would be the new “Secretary of Explaining Stuff”.Obama seems more comfortable as Netflix talent, sitting pretty with celebrities and chit-chatting with Bruce Springsteen in their new Spotify podcast, “Renegades: Born in the USA”. Biden, by contrast, is a natural-born salesman, the son of a salesman, who loves nothing more than to mingle with the masses. Democrats think it’s really kind of cool.

first lockdown may have inadvertently saved more lives than it cost, according to a new analysis.Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been heavily criticised for only imposing the national restrictions on March 23 last year, at least nine days after he knew that the NHS would not be able to cope if coronavirus was allowed to rampage unchecked.A number of scientists and opposition politicians have claimed that delaying the decision caused tens of thousands of unnecessary deaths.However, a University of Cambridge expert now argues that countries who locked down early effectively delayed part of their first wave to the winter, resulting in higher overall mortality.Dr Raghib Ali, a senior clinical research associate at the university’s MRC Epidemiology Unit, said Britain’s relatively late lockdown meant more people were infected in the spring, when underlying pressure on the NHS was relatively light, meaning they were protected by antibodies come winter, when the service traditionally struggles to cope.Writing for The , he saidin the absence of a vaccine, lockdowns postpone infections, rather than prevent them, and suggests that March and April was a better period in which to catch the virus.Many of the claims that Britain’s late lockdown exacerbated the death toll have been made using the statistical models that urged the measure in the first place.By contrast, Dr Ali compared the UK to European countries with similar populations, age structures, seasons and healthcare systems.While Norway and Finland, which locked down a week before the UK have both had small first and second wave death tolls, these are exceptions, according to Dr Ali, also a professor public health at New York University.“What happened in many other countries in Europe who also locked down (and closed their borders) at the same time is that they did have very small first waves in spring 2020 but this was followed by much larger second waves in autumnwinter 2021 (and now into spring 2021, too)”, he writes.“And this has happened despite second and third lockdowns in many of these countries as people understandably struggled to maintain compliance with restrictions for months on end.”He adds: “But based on current trends it seems likely that many of these countries that we thought were doing well due to their early lockdowns and small first waves will end up having higher excess mortality than the UK, including Czechia, Poland, Portugal, and many others.”Dr Ali also argues that closing borders has emerged to be a key intervention in controlling the virus, and points out that Sage (the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies) opposed the policy last year.However, he concludes that even if ministers had ignored the body’s advice and closed the borders last March, it would have been too late.The point is that getting the timing of lockdowns right is not straightforward, especially when you have to balance their very significant harms against their benefit, and there really is not good evidence that an earlier lockdown would have saved lives,” he said.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off

weekend disorder","story":"The mayor of Miami Beach has declared a state of emergency as the police struggled to control the crowds who descended on the city for the annual spring break.Dan Gelber imposed an 8 pm curfew after warning that the numbers of revellers are more than we can handle.The city took draconian measures fearing that the crowds, who were neither wearing masks nor observing social distancing, would trigger another coronavirus surge.On Sunday the City Commission voted to extend the 8 pm curfew for another three weeks.More than 32,000 Floridians have died from Covid-19, with Miami-Dade County proving one of the centres of the pandemic.Despite health experts\u0027 fears, Florida has eased many of the lockdown restrictions with the state governor, Ron DeSantis boasting that the area was booming - unlike Los Angeles and New York City.The relaxation turned Miami Beach into a magnet for lockdown-weary revellers who descended on the city in huge numbers, especially with hotels and airlines slashing prices to boost demand.On Friday night mayhem ensued after somebody fired a shot into the air and the situation worsened on Saturday as police struggled to maintain order.Police fired pepper spray into crowds of revellers and at least a dozen people were arrested as the city attempted to enforce the mayor\u0027s 8 pm curfew.Too many are coming, really, without the intention of following the rules, and the result has been a level of chaos and disorder that is just something more than we can endure, Mr Gelber told CNN.Other things have happened that are similarly challenging, and so it feels like a tinder, it feels like just any match could set it off.At night, Mr Gelber added, it feels like a rock concert, wall-to-wall people over blocks and blocks.Events in Miami Beach have highlighted fears that the Americans may be letting down their guard as the pace of vaccinations increase.After weeks of the number of infections falling, the decline has halted recently.“History has shown us that when you have that plateauing, that’s usually the forerunner of another surge — we’ve actually seen that in the European Union,”  Anthony Fauci, America\u0027s top infectious disease expert, told the  Today Show.“If we can just hang on a bit longer, the more people get vaccinated, the less likelihood that there is going to be a surge.”More

there is at last some light at the end of this very dark tunnel.  Over 25 million people have now received the vaccination, and the NHS deserves all our thanks.Covid is, of course, a deadly disease to those who are vulnerable to it.  But lockdowns and restrictions have had a disproportionate social, emotional and academic impact on children and young people – those who are least at risk from the disease itself.  We must remember the pandemic’s often forgotten victims, especially the one million disabled children in the UK and the four million children living in poverty, the blow to them has been particularly severe. That’s why I’ve teamed up with children’s charity Variety for our 23 March campaign, which has persuaded the Government to mark the anniversary of lockdown. I am also grateful to the Speaker for agreeing a minute’s silence in Parliament at midday on Tuesday, to remember those who have died and those who have lost so much during the pandemic.  It’s absolutely essential that we mark this first anniversary with a national day of reflection, and look forward to a brighter future with our freedoms restored.  But that takes us to Thursday’s votes about the future shape of our country as it emerges from lockdown. By February 15, we had vaccinated the top four groups who are most at risk from Covid – people that account for around nine in 10 of those at risk of dying from the disease.  The UK’s four Chief Medical Officers have told us that the first vaccination dose gives us “substantial protection within 2-3 weeks”, which is why schools returned on March 8 .  As the Prime Minister said on that day, these vulnerable groups had their “immunity bedded in”.The Government says we are still on track to have vaccinated the top nine vulnerable groups by April 15  – people that have accounted for around 99 per cent of Covid fatalities.  With all this good news, as the weather gets warmed, and as the Easter holidays approach, people are asking why on earth the Government is trying to implement a tougher set of restrictions than we had last Summer, at a time when we didn’t have the vaccine.Earlier this year vaccines were said to be our “way out”, yet today ministers caution that we can’t vaccinate our way out of this, that we might have to wait for second doses, or that the Health Secretary’s tests for lifting restrictions – deaths and hospitalisations – is morphing into one of circulation or infection rates.  The whole point of vaccinating vulnerable people is so that infection by Covid cannot harm them.We’ve got to stop this muddled thinking.  Not only are we abandoning the science and denting public confidence and trust in both politics and the vaccine, we are destroying livelihoods, damaging people’s mental health and welfare, and it’s our disabled and disadvantaged young people that suffer most each time Westminster decides to abandon our freedoms. Ministers want to renew the Coronavirus Act for six months until the end of September.  This law gives unprecedented, disproportionate, extreme, and wholly unnecessary powers.Parliament already has enough powers under the Civil Contingencies Act 2004 and the 1984 Public Health Act.  These laws are much more democratic, requiring regular parliamentary scrutiny, votes, and the involvement of the courts.Renewing these powers would demonstrate a lack of confidence and belief in the Covid vaccines. It would not befit our great British democracy, and would fly in the face of the Prime Minister’s promise that we are on a “one-way road to freedom” by 21 June.  If that’s the case, why do we need such authoritarian powers for another six months?     Let’s start bringing back some common sense and proportionality to all of this.  Scientists, medics and public health professionals tell us that vaccines prevent hospitalisation and death, and we’ve had one of the fastest vaccination rollouts in the world.  The next logical step is for us to have one of the fastest unlocking and the swiftest of economic recoveries.  On March 23 last year the whole country came together and clapped for carers and our NHS and found a new community spirit that helped us through a national crisis.  The NHS has paid us back for our sacrifice by keeping us healthy, saving lives and leading a world-beating vaccination rollout.  Let’s not waste this terrific opportunity. We should now be enjoying a vaccination idend. If we are to truly honour the disabled and disadvantaged children who have suffered so much, those who have lost their lives and livelihoods, and those families, friendships and relationships that have been stretched to breaking point, we need to reflect together on 23 March of course.But then we need urgently to bring to an end these sweeping state powers and the ability of the state to interfere in our lives so that we can reclaim our freedoms and remind ourselves what makes life worth living again.  More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"vote abu yair benjamin netanuahu bid woo arab voters israels","story":"In Israel\u0027s 2015 election, Benjamin Netanyahu sent a video message to Right-wing supporters warning that Arab Israelis were “voting in droves”. It was a ruthless - but ultimately successful - manoeuvre to scare wavering voters to keep him in power.Now, with another crucial election on Tuesday, one of the world\u0027s most shrewd political operators is shamelessly wooing the very people he demonised in the hope of winning one or two crucial extra seats to extend his extraordinary premiership further still.In the Arab city of Nazareth, a large billboard greets visitors with a photograph of Mr Netanyahu staring mystically into the distance - and a highly unusual slogan.“We’re all with Abu Yair,” it states, using an intimate Arabic nickname which literally means “the father of Yair,” referring to Mr Netanyahu’s 29-year-old son.It is a significant turning point in Mr Netanyahu\u0027s pugnacious career, in which he has regularly shown disdain for Arabs, even branding them as terrorist sympathisers - when it suits him.In this election, Israel\u0027s fourth in two years, he has travelled from north to south, promising a crackdown on rising crime in Arab cities and more normalisation treaties with Arab neighbours, such as Saudi Arabia. He has also added the first Arab Muslim to his Likud party\u0027s candidate list and hopes that his major success on securing Covid vaccines will boost Arab support. However, in an interview with the Sunday  on the campaign trail, one leading Arab politician claimed that “Abu Yair,” was a cynical alter ego, and that Mr Netanyahu was not to be trusted. “In this election, he is speaking nicely, playing soccer with Arabs, and the purpose is to say, you are not at risk from me,” said Ayman Odeh, the leader of the Joint List, an Arab political alliance.“Abu Yair drinks coffee with the Arabs, while Netanyahu advances the nation state law,” he added, referring to the isive law which proclaimed that only Jews have the right to national self-determination in Israel. He also joked that Mr Netanyahu seemed to be spending more time in Arab communities than in Jewish areas during the campaign. “He has surprised everybody by courting the Arab vote,” said Tamir Sheafer, a professor of political science at Hebrew University. “The way he presented Arabs throughout his career was sometimes appalling, I would say, and so this was a really big tactical turn.”However, even if thousands of Arabs forgive Mr Netanyahu for his past comments and back his Likud party, the path to victory is littered with obstacles.Recent polls suggest that Likud will only gain around 30 seats and will need support from ultra-orthodox and rival right-wing parties to form a 61-seat coalition in the Knesset.In addition to courting the Arab vote, Mr Netanyahu has controversially flirted with the far-Right Kahanist movement, which regards Arabs as enemies of the state. This prompted Yair Lapid, the centrist leader projected to win some 20 seats, to warn that Israel was on the brink of electing an “extortionist and extremist” government. The Arab Joint list, meanwhile, is projected to secure around eight seats.   Mr Netanyahu is also facing a new challenger in Gideon Sa\u0027ar, a former Likudnik whose breakaway party New Hope claims to be the only viable right-wing alternative to Mr Netanyahu.“New Hope has established a political home for the many Israelis on the right of centre who feel that Likud no longer represents their values,” candidate Michal Shir told the Sunday .Though the polls say Mr Sa\u0027ar may end up with fewer than 10 seats, this could theoretically be enough to scupper Likud’s hopes of finding the elusive majority of 61 in Israel’s famously fragmented political sphere.As the polls suggest there will be no clear winner on Tuesday night, many tense weeks of coalition talks may well follow. Vaccines have been a key pillar of Mr Netanyahu’s re-election campaign, which presents him as the saviour-statesman who led the world’s fastest inoculations drive.Likud also hopes that peace treaties struck with the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain will burnish their credentials with Arab voters, though many of them regard those accords as a betrayal of the Palestinians. This is because the Palestinian leadership has long argued that Israel should only be embraced by Arab nations after the creation of a Palestinian stateWhoever emerges as the victor will need to carefully manage Israel’s new relationship with the United States under Joe Biden, who has adopted a tougher stance on Israeli settlements and other Palestinian issues compared to his predecessor. The next prime minister will also need to urgently pass a state budget and rebuild Israel’s economy in the wake of the pandemic unemployment briefly reached a peak of around 20 per cent last year.And should Mr Netanyahu emerge as the loser, he will be facing a high-profile corruption trial, without the protection of high office, which could see him jailed for a decade. He strongly denies all the charges. Back in Nazareth, Joint List activists played down concerns that Mr Netanyahu could steal some of their seats, as well as claims that many Arabs are privately tempted to vote Likud.But some acknowledged that he may succeed in splitting the Arab vote, which would weaken Israel’s array of opposition parties even further.“He is a big liar,” claimed Ramiz Jaraisy, the former mayor of Nazareth, in a sign that Mr Netanyahu\u0027s frenetic campaigning in Arab towns has not won over everybody. “The main issue to be concerned about in this election is Netanyahu himself - he is ready to do anything to stay in power.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"wandering walrus fell asleep had go floe","story":"A walrus has never been so lost. A juvenile Arctic walrus, the size of a cow, was spotted at the weekend resting on a rock at a secluded beauty spot on the Pembrokeshire coast.Dubbed a little unkindly as Wally the Walrus, the juvenile marine mammal is thought to have fallen asleep on an ice sheet in its native Greenland and drifted thousands of miles south into warmer waters.The RSPCA officer dispatched to check on the walrus\u0027s well-being, described the sighting - with perhaps a little understatement - as surreal.The walrus - it\u0027s unclear if it\u0027s a male or female because no one would dare to get close enough to find out - was first spotted on Valentia Island off the Kerry coast of Ireland, a week ago.It then swam a further 300 miles around the southern tip of Ireland before arriving at a secluded bay on the Pembrokeshire coast on Saturday.Its ivory tusks have not fully grown out and are about three inches long, indicating a juvenile.The RSPCA said that no walrus had ever been spotted so far south in British waters. A walrus was previously sighted in Scotland in May 2018 - the first time such a beast had been seen on the British mainland in 54 years.Ellie West, the RSPCA animal rescue officer who raced to the scene, said: People must have wondered if they had been hallucinating. But I\u0027d seen the walrus had been in Ireland and I was half expecting its arrival.Ms West added: When I got there, it was lying on a flat rock in a secluded bay. I think it\u0027s most likely it is from Greenland stock although unfortunately they don\u0027t come with a birth certificate. In their natural habitat, walruses spend a lot of time asleep on the ice pack and as we all know the ice pack is breaking up. Somehow it has gone south and not stopped.The RSPCA was called out after receiving calls from the public and from the Welsh Marine Life Rescue charity.Cleopatra Brown, from Welsh Marine Life Rescue, said: It was about the size of a cow. It was a whopper. I\u0027ve seen them on telly and the news but it was huge.She added: I did a double take. You go around the coast path and go, \u0027woah\u0027. It\u0027s not what you expect - it would be like seeing a penguin in your lounge.An inspection at a distance suggested the walrus was underweight but not suffering any serious injury. At about 5pm on Saturday, Ms West and other onlookers watched the walrus swim out of the bay and out to sea. He has not been seen since and there are inevitably fears the walrus will struggle to survive in the warmer waters.Apart from it being very, very surreal and very, very unusual, I have to admit my main emotion is feeling quite sad that this poor guy has turned up over here on a very long journey far from home and an unknown future, said Ms West.Video footage from the RSPCA showed the animal swimming off the flat rock and bathing in the choppy Welsh waters. The exact location is being kept secret to deter sightseers from flocking to the spot and causing the animal any further distress.The walrus had caused quite a commotion when it arrived on Ireland\u0027s southern coast. A local marine biologist there described it as extremely tired and emaciated.Ms West said that despite being underweight, she thought the walrus might still weigh around 300kg.Alan Houlihan, who was on a walk with his daughter when they stumbled across the walrus, told Irish radio last week: It is the size of a cow or a bull in the water ... I hadn\u0027t seen anything like it before in Ireland. His daughter had given the walrus the name Isabelle or Cian, depending on gender. Unkinder souls on social media called him Wally. On Twitter the inevitable cries of Where\u0027s Wally? were being posted. There remains the possibility that the Arctic walrus is now en route to Cornwall.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"freedom dine outdoors april no freedom","story":"April, according to Chaucer, is the month when people long to go on pilgrimages. And on April 12 the long-awaited day arrives when people in England may once again make the pilgrimage to their local restaurant for a meal (the rules vary elsewhere in the UK).It won’t be eating out as we once understood it: the guest list is limited by rules of Byzantine complexity and until May 17 restaurants and pubs are restricted to serving customers seated outdoors. That doesn’t seem to have put most people off, but will the experience match the nostalgic recollection? Nourished on a diet of the lavish picnics of children’s literature, something about the British sensibility seems irresistibly drawn to a romantic idea of al-fresco dining, even though the reality invariably involves some combination of rain, traffic fumes, a sharp east wind and marauding wildlife (seagulls, wasps).Reflecting on his recent flurry of bookings, the proprietor of a Derby restaurant remarked: “We wouldn’t normally have a single soul sat outside in April.” There is a reason for that, trenchantly expressed by Shakespeare in his line about “the uncertain glory of an April day”. There is something indomitable about our national determination to eat out whatever the weather, and resourceful restaurateurs are already planning ingenious ways to circumvent the mutable splendour of our island spring, with hastily erected awnings, patio heaters and marquees.But writing in the current issue of The New Yorker, the essayist Adam Gopnik notes three prevailing moods of temporary outdoor dining solutions: “Let’s Pretend This Isn’t Happening Welcome to My Dystopia and Baby, It Isn’t Actually Cold Outside”. Of Gopnik’s alternatives – the faux-normal outdoor dining room, the “hygienic” dining environment with symbolic partitions between tables and the chilly rigours of dining beneath a patio heater – it is the weather that most decisively discourages me from eating out in April.In the chapter on picnics in her book Summer Cooking, Elizabeth David quotes the novelist Henry James, who decreed that dining outdoors should be “not so good as to fail of an amusing disorder, nor yet so bad as to defeat the proper function of repasts”. The line between “amusing disorder” and the “proper function” of a meal is a flexible one and I salute the diehard outdoor diners of April. But although I long to go out for a meal, I plan to wait until I can enjoy once again the lovely, liminal moment of stepping into a restaurant filled with the cheerful clink of cutlery and the glorious smell of food cooked by someone else.The naming of cats, TS Eliot observed, is a serious matter. Likewise the naming of dogs. The Queen is reported to have named her two newly acquired puppies Muick (pronounced Mick), after a loch near Balmoral, and Fergus, after her late uncle, who fell at the battle of Loos in 1915.Naming animals after people (or vice versa) is a tricky business. (My son narrowly escaped being called Max, after a cat I had at the time, who was himself named for the then editor of The Daily .) The best rule is to follow the Queen’s example and bestow on your pet a name that you wouldn’t feel an idiot hollering across a grouse moor – or, for subjects, a public park.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"lockdown proponents assumed worst had no evidence","story":"The sunk cost fallacy is a well-known source of distortion in human decision-making. A decision is made which has destructive implications. The limited benefits and immense collateral damage gradually become apparent.It is next to impossible for those involved in the decision to change their minds. No one wants to admit that it might all have been for nothing, even if that is the truth. They have invested too much in the decision to reverse out of the cul-de-sac. So they press on, more to avoid blame than to serve the public interest. This is what has happened to governments across Europe and to the dug-in body of specialists who advise them. Their recipe is simple: if lockdowns haven\u0027t worked, there is nothing wrong with the concept. We just need more of them.What we really need is a fresh look at the evidence by people who are not committed to their own past positions. This is what the Health Advisory and Recovery Team (HART), a group of more than 40 highly qualified scientists, psychologists, statisticians and health practitioners have provided in an Overview of the Evidence published last week. It is addressed to non-specialists, but is scrupulously referenced to specialist research. It will not change the minds of ministers or their advisers. But it should provoke thought among the rest of us. We cannot contribute to the science, but we can at least understand it. Those who are unwilling to do even that much have no moral right to demand coercive measures against their fellow citizens.The HART overview concludes that lockdowns must never be repeated. They serve no useful purpose and cause catastrophic societal and economic harms. It calls for a return to the pandemic plans prepared over a decade for just this sort of event by the UK and other governments and endorsed by the WHO. They were based on two principles. Avoid coercion and don\u0027t go for one size-fits-all measures like lockdowns when the risks affect different groups differently. They recommended balanced public health guidance, no border closures and targeted action to assist those who are most vulnerable. These principles were abruptly jettisoned a year ago. They were replaced by an untried experiment, which there was neither time nor research to consider properly.Not everything that HART says is convincing. But three core points in this study have never been answered by the proponents of lockdowns.First, international comparisons are now available which show no correlation between the severity of a lockdown and the level of infections or deaths. Sweden, whose conditions are broadly comparable to ours, has fared better, with no lockdown, no school closures and only minimal legal restrictions. Comparable US states like North Dakota (lockdown) and South Dakota (no lockdown) show no significant difference in outcomes.Secondly, the collateral costs of lockdowns are staggeringly high but governments have obstinately refused to confront them.Our own government\u0027s studies suggest that the long-term death toll will be about 220,000, about half of which will be due to factors ranging from undiagnosed cancer to increased poverty, which are attributable to the lockdown rather than to Covid. Even that takes no account of the rapid rise in mental illness and dementia, itself a big killer. Looking at the non-health effects, we have so far suffered a 10 per cent fall in GDP whereas the equivalent figure for Sweden is just 2.6 per cent. The consequences will be with us for decades.Thirdly, the burden of the lockdown has fallen mainly on those least at risk of serious illness or death. The extreme example is the closure of schools, which has had exceptionally serious effects on the current mental health and future prospects of the young. Yet not a single previously healthy child has died of Covid. The evidence of significant transmission of Covid by children is exceptionally thin.We have been addled by the so-called precautionary principle, which holds that if we have no evidence of something, we should assume the worst. This marks the extreme point of our risk-averse world. The alternative view is that you must have good reasons backed by evidence if you are going to stop people satisfying the basic human need for social contact, destroy their businesses and jobs and wreck their children\u0027s lives. If you don\u0027t know, don\u0027t do it.Lord Sumption sat on the UK\u0027s Supreme Court between 2012-18More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"high streets must revived given","story":"NewsopinionHigh Streets must be revived to be given fighting chance against online giantsThe Daily Mirror’s High Street Fightback campaign’s championed a level-playing field sadly still missing, Government words rarely supported by actionsmirrorShareCommentsByVoice of the Mirror:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR NewsopinionOur high streets are in serious trouble \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get US and UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

David Cameron’s silence over claims he approached Rishi Sunak to obtain Covid funds on behalf of Greensill, a firm that subsequently collapsed, is unacceptable. Equally a statement or limited media interview would be insufficient when lobbying is a contentious area and an ex-PM exploiting personal contacts would smack on cronyism. So let’s have an open inquiry to discover who said what to whom and when and why.

However, they warned it was “quite early days” and suggested the priority would be to reopen the UK economy. The proposed blueprint comes amid fears millions of us will be forced to stay at home as a third wave of the virus rages across Europe.  Ministers warned it would be “premature” to book summer breaks as soaring rates in countries including France and Poland raise the likelihood of vaccine-resistant strains. Cabinet minister Ben Wallace said of booking breaks: “It would be premature to do that. It’d be potentially risky, we are seeing growing iants. We are not going to do anything that puts at risk this national effort on the pandemic. Let’s take it step by step.” The Defence Secretary also warned the EU not to “build walls” around the distribution of vaccines amid an escalating war of words.

Oxford University’s Sir John Bell said Europe’s “hopeless” response to Covid- risks the South African strain “flooding in the back door” when travel restarts.

The Cottage, number  on Southwood Road, is the final building on the road and is located near St Michaelaposs Train Station and Aigburth Cricket Club. The property looks derelict, with overgrown grounds and locked gates and it is believed nobody lived there since its ownersapos son died two years ago. The front door is boarded up and there is some evidence of potential fire damage to the property.But the unique thing about it is a mysterious picture with some messages attached to the locked front gates of the cottage, the Liverpool Echo reports.The framed black and white image is of a smiling woman and a closer look suggests it is part of a last will and testament. The names David Oliver and Paula Marjatta McKay are mentioned, alongside a warning that states: Whoever removes this from its position will receive  hours of regret. The word Kanmah is also written several times on the document. Around the side of the dilapidated cottage and along one of its extensive, overgrown walls is another picture frame, with the same black and white image of the same woman. Dferent messages are written on this frame, with one saying Remain loyal to you Paula and the other adding Extraordinary person who will live on. At the bottom of the frame a message reads: To Kanmah, your loyal servant. Our colleagues at the Liverpool Echo tried to build a picture of the history of the property. They found that Land Registry documents show that the registered owners of the cottage are Arthur Robert McKay and Paula Marjatta McKay - who is the woman named on the pictures.  The documents show that the couple bought the house on August , . The couple are believed to have lived at the property with their son Erik McKay, who sadly died in the cottage at the age of  on November , . During their investigations, journalists at the Echo spoke to John Parry, who was a close friend of Erikaposs for much of his le. He said the two had lost touch and he only found out recently of his death from a discussion about the cottage on the nextdoor community website. John, , who still lives in the Aigburth area, said: Erik was a good friend of mine, but he had a troubled le. We grew up in the area together, he lived in the cottage and I lived close by in Belgrave Road. John said he believes Erikaposs father worked for the British Transport Police and that originally the family lived in a house attached to St Michaelaposs Station that was provided by the force - before they purchased the cottage directly opposite.  He said that sadly Erikaposs father died at a relatively young age, leaving Erik and his mother Paula living in the cottage. John said: Erik and his mum were together for a long time, he was quite well known in south Liverpool - not everyone liked him but we always got on, he was my friend. We used to play in the big cottage garden, shooting targets with air rles. John said that Erik had worked as a nurse at one stage but went on to struggle with mental health issues and spent some time in hospital. He added: He was an incredibly intelligent man, he was so well read - he was a real character.

Quinn was clipped by the van and was left with minor injuries. Immediately after he tried to attack the pair, Johnson drove back to the shop and cut himself with a kne, slashing through his own clothes to make it seem like he had been attacked. He then told police he had been the victim of an assault involving Lee having cut himself  times. Johnson maintained the lie in interviews with officers and continued to say he had been attacked when he appeared in court, despite CCTV evidence. At an earlier hearing, after his claims had been thrown out by Judge Graeme Smith, Johnson pleaded guilty to dangerous driving, perverting the course of justice and possession of cannabis.  He appeared before the judge again at Bolton Crown Court on Friday. Explaining the case, prosecutor Rob Hall told the hearing that that the incident could have been much more serious.

The first-time parents didnapost know what to expect when they ed home with newborn Hudson, Daniel recalled. “It was scary to be honest. Obviously with lockdown we didn’t know what was going to happen - nobody did - or how serious Covid was.” Kimberleigh gave birth to Hudson at Wigan Hospital, where Daniel was only allowed to see his son for an hour under the restrictions just coming in at the time.  Daniel said it was tough not being able to be there for his partner and newborn son, but described the maternity ward staff as absolutely amazing. Like couples up and down the country who found themselves welcoming a baby in the first lockdown, they were completely on their own - and with no idea just how long the crisis would keep them apart from loved ones. Daniel recalled: “With your first child normally you would get a lot of help from family. It was scary as we were very new parents and we did the best we could. Their friends and family were only able to aposmeetapos Hudson over video calls at first - and in what feels like de ja vu - they are now doing the same with his little brother.It was four months before Hudson got to meet his grandparents for the first time - starting with Danielaposs mum. Daniel said: He was the most special, brightest baby. When he met everyone we worried he wouldn’t cuddle. But with mum it just happened, he was completely happy. He is such a character.”  Only Hudson has met the little ladsapos aunt, Charlene Colcough, through windows at first as she shielded during her treatment for breast cancer. Before the current restrictions she was able to hold him for the first time, Daniel said. “She used to drive over and stand outside the window and just look in at him, he added. Extended family are yet to hold Jaxson due to current restrictions, as hugs remain banned and the vaccine rollout is yet to protect everyone in the family.  Daniel, who lost his work as a taxi driver in lockdown, said it had been a “tough” year to start a new family. Kimberleigh, a carer for the elderly, hopes toto work later this year. Meanwhile Daniel is now training to be a lorry driver. He says he feels lucky to have had more special time at home with the new babies than he would have before Covid hit.

Sam Lillie, Ms Knellaposs former partner and father of her daughter, claims he warned police about out of control Flanaganaposs behaviour just hours before the killings. Mr Lillie claims he contacted social services and visited a police station early on Friday.He told Sunday World: The reason why alarm bells started ringing was because on Wednesday I saw Ken with Stacey, my daughter, and thataposs when the red flags started popping up for me - thataposs when I realised I had to take some kind of action because I didnapost want a guy with his reputation to be near my daughter.They told me they only investigate crimes. They said they canapost advise Stacey on who she has a relationship with. Police confirmed they did receive a report, but said there was no evidence the child was in danger. It is understood Flanagan was recently imprisoned and resumed a relationship with Ms Knell once he was released. Detective Chief Inspector John Caldwell said: “While we have launched a murder investigation, we are not looking for anyone  in connection with these incidents which we believe are connected.” Northern Irelandaposs Minister for Justice has said the murder of two women on Friday night was an absolute tragedy. Naomi Long said while she could not comment on the specic incident, it is a tragedy when violence is perpetrated against women.  Ms Long said it is hugely important to focus on issues surrounding domestic violence. She said she plans to bring a paper to the Northern Ireland Executive in the coming days that would introduce a strategy to protect women and girls from violence. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that does not have a specic strategy. Iaposm also bringing forward a Miscellaneous Provisions Bill which will be at the Assembly in May and that will deal with a wide range of issues which Sir John Gillen identied in his review of serious sexual offences, Ms Long told BBC Sunday Politics programme. We need to see progress made, for example in education in terms of relationship and sex education, in terms of dispelling rape myths, in terms of dealing with attitude around victim blaming. We need to deal with things like street harassment, which is hard to prosecute as crimes but nevertheless has a huge impact on womenaposs lives. Ms Long also defended the decision to make the proposed legislation gender-neutral. We want to recognise that there are men, there are people who are transgender, there are those who are in same sex-relationships who are also subject to domestic violence and abuse, she added. Kelly Andrews, CEO of Womenaposs Aid in Belfast, said that a gender-neutral strategy does not cut it. What weaposve been doing has not been good enough, Ms Andrews added. Two women in the UK are murdered every single week and tragically in Northern Ireland on Friday night we had the murder of two women. We really need to recognise the gender-specic nature of domestic abuse.

Leeds University used data from , people to test for a potential link between eating meat and developing a decline in brain . Processed meat, which also includes sausages and burgers, caused a dramatic increase in risk, but some unprocessed meat, such as beef, pork and veal, did the opposite and could protect against dementia, researchers said. People who ate g a day of unprocessed meat were around  percent less likely to develop the condition, according to the findings. The findings were published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition today. Research supervisor Professor Janet Cade said: Anything we can do to explore potential risk factors for dementia may help us to reduce rates of this debilitating condition. Have you been affected by this story  Let us know at webnews@mirror This analysis is a first step towards understanding whether what we eat could influence that risk. Using studied data from the UK Biobank database, which includes genetic and health stats, and was collected from those aged  to , research included looking at how often people snacked on certain meats. The study also included people who avoid red meat, though vegetarian and vegan diets were not looked at specically.  Over an average period of eight years, around , dementia cases emerged, with the economically deprived and less educated more likely to develop the condition. Older people, smokers and the less physically active, as well as those with stroke and dementia family history were also more likely to have a dementia-related gene, the study said. Researchers also found more dementia cases in men than women. Professor Cade said: Some people were three to six times more likely to develop dementia due to well established genetic factors, but the findings suggest the risks from eating processed meat were the same whether or not a person was genetically predisposed to developing the disease. Those who consumed higher amounts of processed meat were more likely to be male, less educated, smokers, overweight or obese, had lower intakes of vegetables and fruits, and had higher intakes of energy, protein, and fat including saturated fat. It is believed to be the first large-scale study to look at the link between specic meats and dementia using data collected over several years.

No one knows that. Later in the televised sit-down Harry said it had been just them and Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby present. This would pre-date the coupleaposs very public wedding, which took place in May  in St Georgeaposs Chapel at Windsor Castle. Since the Oprah interview questions have been raised about whether Meghanaposs claims about a prior ceremony were accurate, with a number of vicars taking issue with the statement. And there now are further doubts over the claim, according to an official who reportedly dealt with their marriage licence at the time. Stephen Borton, ex-chief clerk at the Faculty Office of the Archbishop of Canterbury, who drew up the wedding licence, told The Sun: “I’m sorry, but Meghan is obviously confused and clearly misinformed. “They did not marry three days earlier in front of the Archbishop of Canterbury. “The Special Licence I helped draw up enabled them to marry at St George’s Chapel in Windsor and what happened there on  May  and was seen by millions around the world was the official wedding as recognised by the Church of England and the law.

Mr Borton was also reported to have said they could not have got married on the grounds of Nottingham Cottage as it isnapost an authorised venue and three people isnapost enough witnesses for a valid ceremony. The Sun also published an image of what it says is the coupleaposs wedding license, which is said to confirm the official date of the marriage was May . A spokesman for the Archbishop of Canterbury previously said he would not comment on personal or pastoral matters.  During the Oprah interview Meghan said: Three days before our wedding, we got married. No-one knows that but we called the Archbishopand we just said aposthis thing, this spectacle is for the world but we want our union between usapos. But in the aftermath of the programme vicars cast doubt on Meghan’s claims, as rules on Church of England weddings require at least two witnesses, and the public must have aposunrestricted accessapos to the ceremony so objections can be lodged.

Despite the soothing strains of Lana Del Rey playing gently in the background, the tiny tot sat for four minutes with her head poking out of her mumaposs tummy looking furious. The tiny terror then wriggled her body out of the incision and cried before snuggling into the delighted -year-oldaposs arms for seven hours.

When I saw the little face she pulled I just started laughing. You do understand though, sheaposs gone from being all cosy and warm to the bright lights of theatre. Seeing her for the first time looking like that was so cute, the first thing I saw was her bottom lip poking out, she was definitely the Incredible Sulk.  The doctors left her sitting there for a good three minutes just sulking, the picture was perfect. Stacey said the past year of her childaposs le has been characterised by the lockdown, which is such a shame. The full-time mum booked a gentle caesarean in which the newborn essentially wriggles free them self, after very unpleasant C-sections with her three previous kids, Maddison Leeming, , Leo Leeming, seven, and Brooklyn Leeming, four. She described her other births as rushed and scary, adding: With Jersey I was dead set on wanting everything perfect and relaxed so decided on a gentle c-section.  It was amazing seeing her being born but it was also overwhelming to watch. Everyone was happy, except the baby. Sheaposs still just as grumpy now. Ahead of giving birth, Stacey opted to have a glam mummy makeover before giving birth to Jersey, plumping for a spray tan, tint and wax on her eyebrows, fake eyelashes and had her nails painted pink.  Stacey wanted to look picture-perfect so she could document the occasion, knowing this would be her final pregnancy. Because Iaposd had three c-sections before it would have been too dangerous to have labour, then they tied my tubes after that because it was too dangerous to have any more babies. I knew this was going to be the last time so I just wanted to feel my best...it was nice but sad at the same time.

Her heroic neighbours, who had rushed to the property after seeing the inferno first helped her out and then went back in to save the ashes. Itaposs believed the blaze started after Mariana sprayed some air freshener in the living room, which ignited with the heat from her gas fire and caused the can to explode. The sheer force of the explosion blew the patio doors off their hinges and smoke started billowing from the property.

Emergency crews rushed to the property, and Marina was taken to Aintree Hospital. Everything she owned was destroyed in the inferno, and she has now been made homeless.But a family friend has rallied behind her to set up a GoFundMe page in the hope of raising enough money to renovate the house. Daughter-in-law Suzannah Wynne told the Echo: My niece went to the shops to do her shopping and what happened was Marina decided to spray air freshener but the gas fire was on and itaposs gone into the gas fire.Because sheaposs had an aerosol can there as well that caught fire and the fire spread to the couch and itaposs all gone up in flames. She was trying to put the fire out, she went into the kitchen and got glasses of water to throw over it and then sheaposs realised that itaposs too overwhelming so sheaposs stayed by the kitchen door and two lads went in there to get her.  Suzannah said the two men who rescued Marina were her neighbours who happened to be in their car outside at the time. She said: We canapost thank them enough, they saved her le. She was refusing to come out because she wanted her husbandaposs ashes. They got her out and then a lad went back into the house and got the ashes for her, so he went in twice and risked his own le. Suzannah said the house had not long been refurbished after Marinaaposs husband Ted died in September, but the fire has completely gutted the property and destroyed all of her belongings including family photographs. Sheaposs lost everything. The ashes were on the table and the table was burnt to smithereens. The ashes are the only thing that survived, itaposs uncanny. Itaposs like someone was definitely there watching over her. Sheaposs been really upset and blaming herself. She keeps apologising to everyone all the time and sheaposs really shocked at how many people have pulled together to help.Weaposve had an electrician offer to rewire the whole house and a joiner, we donapost even know these people, theyaposve got in touch on Facebook.The family are determined to sort the house out for Marina so she can move back in as soon as possible.

The Arctic creature was found lying on rocks near Broad Haven South beach, Pembrokeshire, and it is thought to be the same one seen off the coast of County Kerry last week.Experts believe the animal floated thousands of miles from its Arctic home while sleeping on an iceberg. And its arrival has been flagged as another warning sign of the growing climate emergency, reports Wales Online. People have now been urged to keep their distance from the aposwhopperapos of a walrus, because the animals are a apossensitive speciesapos. Sea Rescue Ireland said: The tired, young Walrus last spotted on Valentia Island, County Kerry last Sunday has been spotted in Wales. The Arctic voyager reappeared and Marine Le Rescue is keeping a close eye. The walrus has since gone back out to sea and is undoubtedly tired after another long journey, soyou spot it in your area, please remember that this is a sensitive species and to avoid disturbance. Cleopatra Browne of Welsh Marine Le Rescue told the BBC: It was about the size of a cow. It was a whopper. Iaposve seen them on telly and the news but it was huge.  Walruses are more often seen in the Arctic, and are not usually seen this far south. RSPCA animal rescue officer Ellie West, who checked the animal, said: He was resting and, although appearing slightly underweight, thankfully he wasnapost displaying any signs of sickness or injury. This is an incredibly rare sighting and these big, beautul animals never usually venture so far south. We believe this may be a juvenile who has travelled down this way in search of food. People are being urged to keep their distance and not approach the animal.

Itaposs claimed the teenager was detained by officers simply for aposshaking his headapos at the end of a protest, reports Manchester Evening News. Greater Manchester Police say the -year-old was arrested for alleged aposbreach of the peaceapos and he was later de-arrested. Inspectors at the Professional Standards Branch will now investigate following a complaint. Hundreds of people gathered in St Peteraposs Square in Manchester city centre last nightto demonstrate on a number of causes including opposition to the governmentaposs proposed new crime legislation. After the crowd dispersed, there was an incident nearby involving an -year-old man and a group of Tactical Aid Unit officers.  A video shared on social media shows an officer pinning the teenager up against a van, at one point appearing to have his hand on the manaposs throat. Other officers told people to stay back as his friends complained.A witness told the MEN: I think my mate just casually shook his head at the police van as we went passed and this officer jumped out and pinned him against the van. He was saying aposare you shaking your head at me you little s***apos   I got my phone out and they werenapost letting me film it, two officers shoved me to the floor. He wasnapost arrested, they just put him in the van and dropped him at the McDonaldaposs in Peel Park. He asked for their badge numbers and they said aposdo you want to spend the weekend in the cells apos GMP said in a statement: Following protests in Manchester City Centre yesterdayan -year-old man was detained for breach of the peace. He was later de-arrested. Following a public complaint in regards to this arrest, the incident has been referred to GMPaposs Professional Standards Branch for assessment. Police took no enforcement action against the protest in the city centre which involved thousands of people.  Explaining GMPaposs handling of the protest, Assistant Chief Constable, Nick Bailey, said: We were aware of several protests which took place yesterday across the City Centre and our position in regard to all protests during this lockdown remains that they do not meet what is an acceptable reason to gather during the lockdown. Public safety is a top priority for GMP, and in the lead up to these protests, police actively engaged with the organisers to explain government guidance and discuss alternate options in order to dissuade a public gathering from taking place. However when large groups chose to ignore that, we will always look to see whether it is safe to take action which would physically prevent the protest and disperse the crowd. A careful assessment was made about the policing approach and it was decided that a low key approach, which was sensitively policed, would be the most appropriate form of action. Proportionate action was taken on the day, and officers engaged with those present to encourage social distancing and dispersal of attendees. GMP will continue to make assessments of all gatherings that are felt to be unlawful and make a decision as to how best to protect the wider public from the spread of infection, our staff policing the event andthose engaged in the protest.

While some apologised and even resigned from their positions for breaking the rules, others attempted to defend their actions. Here are some of the high-profile names who have been accused of breaching coronavirus measures since the first lockdown  months ago. Dominic Cummings Prime Minister Boris Johnsonaposs former chief adviser caused public outcry when he drove from London to County Durham with his we and son during the first lockdown in late March . In an apparent breach of restrictions, Mr Cummings travelled  miles to his parentsapos property in Durham after his we developed coronavirus-related symptoms. Despite calls for the aide to resign over the journey - which included a trip to local beauty spot Barnard Castle to check the quality of his eyesight - Mr Cummings was backed by the Prime Minister. Mr Cummings, who also fell ill with Covid symptoms, defended his actions in a press conference in the Downing Street rose garden, saying he believed he behaved reasonably and did not regret his actions. Durham Constabulary said it would not take retrospective action despite finding the former adviser may have made a minor breach of lockdown laws.  Professor Neil Ferguson The scientist, whose research helped usher in the lockdown, resigned on May  from his role as a key Government adviser after admitting that he had undermined social distancing rules by reportedly meeting his lover at his home. Scotland Yard criticised his behaviour as plainly disappointing but ruled out issuing a fine because he has taken responsibility after stepping down from the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencies .  Rita Ora The pop star admitted breaching lockdown restrictions when she held a small gathering at a west London restaurant to celebrate her th birthday. The incident was described as one of the most egregious, and certainly the most notorious, breaches of the regulations committed on licensed premises, by a lawyer representing the politan Police at a subsequent licence review hearing for the restaurant.In an Instagram post apologising for her actions, Ora said she had made a serious and inexcusable error of judgment.Model Cara Delevingne and her sister Poppy were among those who attended the party on November , police said. The restaurant which hosted the party, Casa Cruz in Notting Hill, avoided having its licence revoked in February, with Kensington and Cha Council instead agreeing to suspend it for six weeks.  Jack Grealish The Aston Villa captain was banned from driving for nine months and fined a total of £, after crashing his £, Range Rover during the first lockdown. The -year-old pleaded guilty to two charges, including one linked to the incident in which his x hit two parked vehicles in Dickens Heath, Solihull, West Midlands. A judge was told that a witness said Grealish smelled of intoxicating liquor and was slurring his words immediately after the crash on March .The England international was involved in the incident less than  hours after issuing a Twitter video message urging people to stay at home to save lives and protect the NHS. Jeremy CorbynFormer Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn breached the rule of six, which limits the number of people in social gatherings, according to a report.He attended a dinner with eight other people, breaking one of the tight restrictions in place during the Covid- pandemic, The Sun newspaper said. Laws prohibiting social gatherings of more than six people came into effect on September  last year. The newspaper, which claimed the dinner party took place on September , said Mr Corbyn had apologised.  Dr Catherine Calderwood Scotlandaposs chief medical officer resigned in April  after breaking lockdown restrictions twice in order to visit her second home, which was located more than an hour away from her main residence in Edinburgh. Despite Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon backing Dr Calderwood to remain in her position, she ultimately decided to relinquish her role so as not to be a distraction from the Governmentaposs social-distancing message.  MP Margaret Ferrier The -year-old had the Scottish National Party whip removed after it emerged she allegedly travelled from Glasgow to the House of Commons while waiting for the results of a Covid- test in September last year. It is alleged she then made thejourney after being informed she had the virus. Ms Ferrier, who remains an independent MP for Rutherglen and Hamilton, was later charged with culpable and reckless conduct. She appeared at Glasgow Sherf Court in February but no plea to the charges was made. She was committed for further examination and was released on bail.  Kay Burley Sky News presenter Kay Burley was taken off air for six months after she broke Covid- rules while celebrating her th birthday. Burley had previously said she was celebrating at a Covid-compliant restaurant and afterwards popped into another venue to use the bathroom on December . But in a statement later posted on Twitter, she said: It doesnapost matter that I thought I was Covid-compliant on a recent social event. The fact is I was wrong, I made a big mistake, and I am sorry. The gathering was reportedly in London, which was under Tier  restrictions.  Stanley Johnson The Prime Ministeraposs father Stanley Johnson said he was extremely sorry after being pictured shopping without wearing a face covering on September . He was pictured in The Daily Mirror newspaper perusing the shelves at a newsagentaposs in west London, seemingly breaking the rules by not covering his mouth and nose.  Robert Jenrick The Housing, Communities and Local Government Secretary was forced to explain himself in April after travelling more than an hour to visit his parents despite warning people to remain at home. Mr Jenrick was also criticised for travelling  miles from his London property to his Herefordshire home, from where he travelled to his parentsapos home in Shropshire. However, he defended his actions, saying he went to deliver food and medicine to his isolating parents.  Stephen Kinnock The MP for Aberavon in South Wales was publicly shamed by police after travelling to celebrate his fatheraposs th birthday on March  last year. His father is former Labour leader Neil Kinnock. After Mr Kinnock posted a photo on Twitter of himself practising social distancing with his parents outside their home, South Wales Police replied: We know celebrating your dadaposs birthday is a lovely thing to do, however this is not essential travel. We all have our part to play in this, we urge you to comply withrestrictions, they are in place to keep us all safe. Thank you.

The mandatory questionnaire - which was filled out yesterday by millions of people - includes questions such as where do you mainly work  or what is your job  For thousands of people, this has changed drastically in the last year, either because they changed roles or now find themselves working from a kitchen table or their bedroom. The Office for National Statistics has said that it wants answers that reflect the current reality - but some errors may have to be accounted for. One woman was left in hysterics after her mum accidentally changed her brotheraposs career while filling out the form. Her tweet racked up nearly , likes and thousands of retweets. She wrote: My mum’s in a panic because she filled in the census for my little brother and listed his occupation as ‘barrister’ rather than ‘barista’ and I am being no help at all because I can’t stop laughing. Naturally, people on Twitter had helpful suggestions on how to fix this.One person replied: Your brother will just need to change his profession. That will fix it. Another comfortingly advised: Well,she gets done for lying on the census, at least your little brother can defend her in court. The full details of the census are kept under lock and key for  years - so his ancestors might be intrigued to see what happened. One person joked: Don’t worry. It’ll give future generations some fun trying to work out why great great great uncle fell from grace and got disbarred between  and  -or it may inspire to become a barrister.

Turns out itaposs not. As the video continues, Rebecca gets out a pressure washer. The slabs are washed and viewers can see as the water is sprayed over the patio, it transforms from a dark shade to reveal the real colour underneath - which is a light stone. How satisfying, says the video caption.So far more than , people have watched the clip, with over , liking it.Hundreds of people also took the time to comment and share their thoughts, with one writing: Wow, I think I might need to borrow that pressure washer.

Though they remain bottom, victory would see them move to within a point of the pack above.It was Dundee who made the first chance of note, however.Just four minutes in, McDaid got the better of his marker on the left wing and sent a dangerous cross into the area. Jason Cummings met it with a firm header but it flew straight into the arms of Neil Parry in the home goal.Up the other end in-form Alloa striker Innes Cameron nipped in behind Sam Fisher but his shot trundled to Adam Legzdins.On  minutes, Lee Ashcroft leapt highest to meet a Paul McGowan corner but, with Parry in no man#s land, the big defender headed wide.The early efforts kept coming with McDaid next to try his luck but skewing his strike wide from  yards after  minutes.After  minutes, Danny Mullen won a free-kick  yards out. Cummings stepped up but curled his effort just over the crossbar.Dundee had been racking up the corners but it was Alloa threatening at the other end as Legzdins under pressure punched straight to Kevin Cawley. His effort hit Ashcroft and the danger passed.Finally those corners counted for the Dark Blues as McGowan found Ashcroft#s head and the defender made no mistake this time around, powering a header into the corner for -.In first-half stoppage time Cummings# attempt at a spectacular volley once more found the arms of Parry and Dundee had to settle for - at the break.Dundee switched wingers in the second half with Paul McMullan lining up on the left flank.Moments after the restart they had a golden chance to double their lead as Liam Dick#s error allowed Cummings through on goal.However, the former Hibs and Rangers man was denied by a good save from Parry.They did get that vital second goal and from the exact same route as the first.McGowan sent in the corner, Ashcroft was too strong in the air and the big defender grabbed his second of the night, powering into the top corner.And it was almost - on the hour mark as Cummings lted a ball into the area but Mullen flicked his free header wide of the post.Alloa were still a threat, continually putting Legzdins under pressure from set-pieces and the former Burnley man was forced to tip a Scott Taggart free-kick over the bar.With  minutes to go, the home side were pushing to get back into the game with Ray Grant trying his luck from distance but saw his looping volley fly over.Two minutes later, Adam made his entrance as Dundee filled up their midfield, Cummings the man making way.With  minutes left it was - and game over.A long clearance was latched onto by the speedy McMullan. With the defence rushing back, the winger squeezed a ball through the defence to set Anderson free.And the young midfielder grabbed his third goal in five games with a fine finish into the corner.Alloa kept going but couldn#t find their way past the Dundee defence with Legzdins keeping his second clean sheet in three games.And the result saw the Dark Blues move level with Dunfermline on  points ahead of their meeting next weekend.Alloa: Parry, Taggart, Graham, Dick, Cawley, Robertson, Grant, Hetherington, Murray , Connelly , Cameron.Subs not used: Willison, Jamieson, Williamson, Lynch, O#Donnell.Dundee: Legzdins, Elliott, Fisher, Ashcroft, Marshall, McDaid, McGowan , Anderson, McMullan, Mullen , Cummings .Subs not used: Hamilton, Kerr, Cameron, Strachan.Referee: Grant Irvine vw, px\"  Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/syndicatenews/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/03/20083855-575x372.jpg ","title":"dundee boss james mcpake hails attitude of dark blues players after 3 0 victory at alloa","story":".dct-cta@-webkit-keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate@keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate.dct-cta__title.dct-cta__content p.dct-cta__content p:not.dct-cta__content p:last-child.dct-cta__label.dct-cta__input.dct-cta__input::-webkit-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::-moz-placeholder.dct-cta__input:-ms-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::placeholder.dct-cta__label:hover.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__label:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__input:hover,.dct-cta__input:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__btn .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn.dct-cta__btn:disabled.dct-cta__btn:not.dct-cta__btn:not:hover.dct-cta__btn:not:hover,.dct-cta__btn:not:focus.dct-cta__btn-text.dct-cta__btn:before .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn-loadingborder-top:px solid #fffborder-radius:%width:pxheight:pxbox-sizing:border-box-webkit-animation:dctSpinner .s linear infiniteanimation:dctSpinner .s linear infinite.dct-cta--signup.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--signup__dialogs.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--success.dct-cta--signup__dialog--error.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__grid.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and @media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap+.dct-cta__content@supports or.dct-cta__flex:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--js-active.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and @supports or.dct-cta__grid:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label,.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__gridgrid-template-columns:fr minmaxgrid-gap:.rem .remJames McPake says his Dundee side showed “attitude” in their - victory over Alloa Athletic.The Dark Blues moved level with Dunfermline in second spot after two goals from Lee Ashcroft were added to late on by Max Anderson’s third goal of the season in Clackmannanshire.Following a poor home defeat to Ayr, McPake was delighted to see his side respond in the best manner, picking up their biggest league victory of the campaign.He said: “Attitude was the big thing. Eventhings are going against you the attitude still needs to be there.“I can never question the players for work-rate and attitude and I was proud of them because they had something about them.“It should be a given – competing from the word go. Most games we do. But sometimes we have a knock and something goes against us and we go under.“But Alloa are a good team. At times they had chances but that team in previous weeks might have buckled.“They have a lot about them and I am pleased for them.”Big questions were raised over McPake’s future at the club and their chances of winning promotion through the playoffs after the loss to Ayr.However, the Dundee boss points to the performance at the Indodrill as proof there is enough at Dens Park to get the job done.“There is enough spirit and more than enough quality,” he added.“There is never a question about that. It doesn’t get much harder than coming here and I really mean that.“Alloa make it hard and Peter Grant has them playing well. But we stood tall and won the game and deserved the win.“The last time we were here we were behind and Charlie Adam pulled us out a hole.“I’ll have a better sleep than I had after the Ayr game, that’s for sure. I have barely slept since Tuesday night.“I am delighted with the win.

The hub will encourage the adoption of proactive cyber security practices for SMEs who adopt G technologies through collaboration with Abertay University.New products, tools, services and software will be designed and developed to ensure secure access to the G network.The hub team will also work with SMEs in and around Dundee to be more digitally connected, helping increase employment and drive profitability.This investment will align with and build upon work currently being undertaken by Dundee City Council, in partnership with Scottish Futures Trust and Abertay University, to create a G Testbed within Dundee Central Waterfront.The Central Waterfront Testbed, funded through Scottish Government’s Growth Accelerator Model, will help deliver core infrastructure needed to meet the objectives of the G innovation hub.£ million of funding has also been ringfenced within the Tay Cities Deal to support the delivery and demonstration of G use cases.Derek Graham, programme director at Scottish Futures Trust said: “The Digital Infrastructure team have been working closely with Dundee City Council to drive the development and delivery of its G testbed since its inception.“We are now looking forward to extending this collaborative approach with its partners to position the G testbed as a catalyst for future G innovation across the Tay Cities Region.”Councillor Mark Flynn, convener of Dundee City Council#s city development committee, added: #The business community in Dundee currently enjoy a high level of connectivity and ultrafast services with good upload and download speeds.“We want to ensure that more businesses in the city can enjoy a more unorm experience, with the greater performance and improved efficiency that G offers.“I am delighted that Dundee will be the site of Scotland#s latest G innovation hub.” vw, px\"  Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/03/0d748fa3-c3ba-46ee-971a-6d1e57b30eaa-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/03/0d748fa3-c3ba-46ee-971a-6d1e57b30eaa-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/03/0d748fa3-c3ba-46ee-971a-6d1e57b30eaa-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/03/0d748fa3-c3ba-46ee-971a-6d1e57b30eaa-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"gym worker in dundee sees poetry work popularity soar during lockdown","story":"A city gym worker who has spent lockdown fine tuning her poetry writing has been earning rave reviews for her works over the past  months.

empty eyesore buildings renovated as part of the council#s -year vision for the town centre.A draft masterplan has been published by Moray Council which highlights key areas of the town which will be the focus of wide-ranging improvements.Cooper Park could be connected to the High Street via active travel corridors, offering a safe space for cyclists and walkers.Fencing and vegetation around the front of the park would be removed and a new attractive gateway will be created to welcome people in.The footbridge over the A Aberdeen to Inverness road could also be replaced by a walking cycling route into North Port.The existing play park and mound could be upgraded and become more open and inclusive, with the public toilets relocated there and the skatepark expanded.A sports hub will replace the existing sports pavilion and will include changing rooms, showers, storage, bike parking, and hire and flexible space.Under the blueprint, the pond will be transformed, with a water fountain centre-piece in the form of an angel to be installed, and water-sports to take place there, with equipment hire available from the sports hub.A -seat outdoor performance area is also planned, where live performances could take place.Moray Council wants to ensure the town centre is vibrant and pleasing to visitors and is targeting eyesore buildings such as the former Junners toy shop.Empty since , it is a substantial premise on South Street, with the owners failing to sell it.Now, the local authority wants to transform it into a courtyard cafe restaurant and modern flats.The former Jailhouse nightclub and Grant Lodge would also be brought back into use as part of the proposals, along with the Sawmill and Auction Mart sites on Linkwood Road.Plans to develop the auction mart into housing and a restaurant have been proposed before but fell through due to flooding concerns.There is a vision to create at least  new residential homes in the town centre by .Properties above MCo will also be targeted as new housing or potential hotel development.Public art, illuminated  and living walls would be used to brighten up the frontage along the A to make the road #less hostile# for walkers and cyclists.The plans include revamping South Street the use of benches, planting, and street art to make it more welcoming.The Poundland building would also be used as a mixed-use development to #improve negative perceptions of the street due to the imposing nature of the building that align it.#It is currently undergoing urgent repairs over fears that stonework from its roof could plummet onto the pavement below.Shopfronts in the town centre will be helped by an improvement scheme to make them more welcoming, and the #tired and dating# North Port precinct will be a main part of this.The masterplan also outlines the partial pedestrianisation of Moss Street by restricting it to one lane for cars.Batchen Lane is to be made more attractive through enhanced lighting, street furniture and planting.The blank facade of TK Maxx would be improved through a new mural, illuminated , or a green #living wall.Cafe culture will also be encouraged through outdoor seating areas throughout the area, including Batchen Street.A Visit Elgin app will be developed, along with a new heritage trail, both by .Improvements will also be made to shabby-looking lanes in the town centre.This will #encourage people to use them more frequently as they provide direct routes into the City Centre and are an important part of Elgin’s history.#Harrow Inn Close, City Arms Close, Fe Arms Close, Hays Close, Red Lion Close, Shepherd#s Close and Branders Close will all be prioritised.The Cultural Quarter has long been discussed by the council, with funding awarded through the Moray Growth Deal for it.It involves Elgin Town Hall being transformed into a #cultural and creative learning and entertainment centre.#The premises will eventually boast a restaurant, a small cinema space and learning spaces for creative industries and related courses with music and media studios.The currently empty Grant Lodge will be refurbished and turned into a high-quality food and drink heritage visitor experience attracting , visitors per year.It is hoped these projects will increase pedestrian footfall between Cooper Park and town centre shops by % between  and .A high-quality four or five-star hotel will be developed at Lossie Green or another location to help support this.You can have your say on these plans here.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content,

independence referendum without Westminster#s consent  It#s a question that will likely dominate the months following the Holyrood election.On the face of it, the answer is simple: no.If a request for a section  order — which transfers the relevant powers from the UK Parliament to Edinburgh to hold a poll — is refused a referendum cannot, at least under the current understanding of the law, take place.Why  The  Act of Parliament that established Holyrood stipulates that the #Union of the Kingdoms of Scotland and England# is a reserved matter and therefore only Westminster can decide upon the Union, unless consent is otherwise given.During the passage of the  Act this very issue was debated by none other than the future first minister Alex Salmond and then-Scottish Secretary Donald Dewar.Mr Salmond was keen to know whether a Scottish Parliament could legislate for a referendum, to which Mr Dewar responded: #It is clear that constitutional change — the political bones of the parliamentary system and any alteration to that system— is a reserved matter.#That would obviously include any change or any preparations for change.#I have made that clear in I do not know how many exchanges with Mr Salmond over the years.#He adds: #A referendum that purported to pave the way for something that was ultra viresis itself ultra vires. That is a view that I take, and one to which I will hold.#But signicantly, Mr Dewar did not close the door completely. He added: #But, the sovereignty of the Scottish people, which is often prayed in aid, is still there in the sense that,they vote for a point of view, for change, and mean that they want that change by their vote, any elected politician in this country must very carefully take that into account.#Herein lies the rub. Mr Dewar was clear that an independence referendum called by Holyrood would not be legal under the terms of the Scotland Act, but he also believed that UK parliamentary sovereignty could, in political practicenot in law, be overtaken by a clear political statement of the “sovereignty of the Scottish people”.Scotland has had an SNP government since  and  is likely toanother pro-independence majority. Is the continued refusal of a section  order really within the spirit of the  Act The SNP#s constitution secretary, Mike Russell, is clear he has argued that there is no #moral or democratic justication for denying# a request and has warned the Scottish Government will put the  Act to the test in the courtsrequired.Mr Russell, in the SNP#s #road to a referendum# policy paper published in January, saidhis party won another majority the choice for the UK Government would be to either agree that the Scottish Parliament already has the power to legislate for a referendum, agree the section  order, or take legal action to dispute the legal basis of the referendum.#Such a legal challenge would be vigorously opposed by an SNP Scottish Government. The issue of whether there should be such a referendum is dferent from the issue of whether Scotland should be independent,# he said.The UK Government has not said whether it would refer the Scottish Government’s intended Bill to the Supreme Court, but statements from Scottish ministers suggest they anticipate a challenge to be made.SNP MP Joanna Cherry QC anticipated that any court would deploy “a process of statutory interpretation”, she also expected: #The UK Supreme Court and indeed Scotland’s Supreme Courts, to look to the wider constitutional context and to have some comments to make about a Government which does not allow a second indyref when there is a clear electoral mandate in favour of one.#This was the approach of the Supreme Court of Canada when, in , it was asked to rule on the possible secession of Quebec.The Canadian government hoped the Court would confine itself to the wording of the Canadian Constitution, which does not contain a secession clause.Instead, the Court concluded that: #The federalism principle, in conjunction with the democratic principle, dictates that the clear repudiation of the existing constitutional order and the clear expression of the desire to pursue secession by the population of a province would give rise to a reciprocal obligation on all parties to Confederation to negotiate constitutional changes to respond to that desire.#The legalities therefore remain uncertain, but what we can be sure of is that  will be a crucial year for the fate of the Union.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. vw, px\"  "},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2021/03/11823181am_38298271-846x564.jpg ","title":"andy considine says aberdeen havent given up on third spot","story":".dct-cta@-webkit-keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate@keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate.dct-cta__title.dct-cta__content p.dct-cta__content p:not.dct-cta__content p:last-child.dct-cta__label.dct-cta__input.dct-cta__input::-webkit-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::-moz-placeholder.dct-cta__input:-ms-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::placeholder.dct-cta__label:hover.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__label:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__input:hover,.dct-cta__input:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__btn .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn.dct-cta__btn:disabled.dct-cta__btn:not.dct-cta__btn:not:hover.dct-cta__btn:not:hover,.dct-cta__btn:not:focus.dct-cta__btn-text.dct-cta__btn:before .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn-loadingborder-top:px solid #fffborder-radius:%width:pxheight:pxbox-sizing:border-box-webkit-animation:dctSpinner .s linear infiniteanimation:dctSpinner .s linear infinite.dct-cta--signup.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--signup__dialogs.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--success.dct-cta--signup__dialog--error.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__grid.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and @media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap+.dct-cta__content@supports or.dct-cta__flex:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--js-active.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and @supports or.dct-cta__grid:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label,.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__gridgrid-template-columns:fr minmaxgrid-gap:.rem .remAndy Considine says Aberdeen still believe they can finish third this season – despite falling further behind Hibs.The Dons lost - to Dundee United at Tannadice on Saturday with Hibs’ - draw at Livingston taking them seven points clear in third place.Having won just once in their last  matches and with only five Premiership fixtures left, it appears unlikely the Reds will be able to secure a top three finish.But, despite their poor form, Pittodrie veteran Considine insists the players still believe they can overhaul Hibs.The defender, , said: #It#s going to be very hard to finish third now, but anything can happen in football.#We#ve still got Hibs to play and I feel we need to win pretty much every game we have left to make sure of third.#That#s going to be a tough ask, but we all believe we can still do it, there is definite believe in the dressing room.#We were all angry that we couldn#t find the back of the net on Saturday, but there was some good football.#It#s going to be a big ask, but strange things can happen in football.”A lack of goals has crippled Aberdeen’s bid to finish third, having scored just once in  matches.Considine says everyone – and not just the attackers – need to take responsibility for the problems in front of goal.The player, who is part of Steve Clarke’s Scotland squad for the World Cup qualiers this week and next, added: #We need something to fall for us because we got into many good positions.#Ross #s header kind of epitomised what is going on at the moment, a free header from six yards and not hitting the back of the net.#We#ve all got to take responsibility # it#s not just the forward players # we got a good number of corners so it#s up to ourselves from the back to try to get our heads on something as well.#It will come, we just need to keep going. The most positive thing was the way we played, our intensity and it was more entertaining stuff.”The interim management team of Paul Sheerin, Barry Robson and Neil Simpson took charge of Aberdeen for the first time at Tannadice after the sacking of Derek McInnes and Tony Docherty.Considine feels the Dons squad have bought into what the interim management team want.He said: #I thought we played well, we#ve been working for the last two weeks on our pressing game and building from the back through the thirds.#I thought every one of us bought into it and we beat their press many a time.#I thought it was good football and we got into some great positions, but it just wasn#t falling for us and it#s tough one to take having seen other results, because I thought we could have caught up on Hibs.#The past two weeks have been good and the way we played I felt was more like it.#I was sorry to see and hear the gaffergo.#But we move on and Paul, Barry, Simmy and Scott Anderson have been outstanding with us for the past two weeks.#We#ve worked hard as you could see building out from the back and through the thirds and all the boys have bought into it and we played some good stuff.#We couldn#t find the back of the net, but I know that will come, but training has been really good.#One positive for the Dons was Jack MacKenzie. The -year-old was handed a start at left-back, while -year-old right-back Calvin Ramsay made his debut off the bench in the closing stages.#I thought hewas brilliant. I#ve felt Jack has been ready for a while,” Considine said.#I#ve seen enough of him in training and he#s been out on loan at Forfar as well and the reports I#ve heard have been very good and I though he slotted in really well and didn#t look out of place at all.#I hope this can be the start of him playing left-back for Aberdeen and it was very encouraging.#Calvin Ramsay came on as well and made his debut, we#ve got a really good crop of young lads at Aberdeen and it#s just giving them a chance.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. vw, px\"  "},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/syndicatenews/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/03/Murray-George-Aberdeen-FC-197_21970743-419x564.jpg ","title":"looking back on aberdeens previous interim managers as paul sheerin prepares for first game in charge","story":".dct-cta@-webkit-keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate@keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate.dct-cta__title.dct-cta__content p.dct-cta__content p:not.dct-cta__content p:last-child.dct-cta__label.dct-cta__input.dct-cta__input::-webkit-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::-moz-placeholder.dct-cta__input:-ms-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::placeholder.dct-cta__label:hover.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__label:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__input:hover,.dct-cta__input:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__btn .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn.dct-cta__btn:disabled.dct-cta__btn:not.dct-cta__btn:not:hover.dct-cta__btn:not:hover,.dct-cta__btn:not:focus.dct-cta__btn-text.dct-cta__btn:before .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn-loadingborder-top:px solid #fffborder-radius:%width:pxheight:pxbox-sizing:border-box-webkit-animation:dctSpinner .s linear infiniteanimation:dctSpinner .s linear infinite.dct-cta--signup.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--signup__dialogs.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--success.dct-cta--signup__dialog--error.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__grid.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and @media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap+.dct-cta__content@supports or.dct-cta__flex:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--js-active.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and @supports or.dct-cta__grid:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label,.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__gridgrid-template-columns:fr minmaxgrid-gap:.rem .remPaul Sheerin, Barry Robson and Neil Simpson will boss Aberdeen for their Premiership meeting with Dundee United tomorrow.The trio could be in charge for as long as the rest of the season, giving Dons chairman Dave Cormack time to find a replacement for long-serving boss Derek McInnes after his departure last week.Tomorrow will be the seventh time a caretaker manager, in former midfielder Sheerin, has been handed the Reds reins.⚽️🔴🎙️ Will Stephen Glass be the next @AberdeenFC manager  Listen to the Northern Goal podcast here:Apple: https:t.co SUunYRipSpoty: https:t.co cSjgIEWO pic KFCMYrfxmdash EveningExpress SportMarch , The -year-old, as well as ex-Scotland playmaker Robson, may even be hoping # aided by club legend and youth academy chief Simpson # they can stake a claim to be appointed permanently over the next few weeks.Taking a team on a caretaker basis is a strange situation, and rarely #joyous# # as Simpson#s fellow Gothenburg Great Eric Black told the Evening Express earlier this week. Here#s how previous interim Pittodrie gaffers have got on:Murray, who made  appearances at right-half for the Dons between  and , filled the gap between Jimmy Bonthrone#s exit and Ally McLeod arriving at Pittodrie.Knox had already been Alex Ferguson#s co-manager in , with the former assistant boss ing to the club to replace Willie Garner and shouldering more responsibility while Fergie prepared to lead Scotland to the  World Cup.Towards the end of , when Ferguson left for Manchester United, Knox stayed behind to fill the gap until Ian Porterfield was appointed, before following Fergie to Old Trafford.In his three games as caretaker, Knox oversaw a - draw with St Mirren, a - Tynecastle loss to Hearts in which John Hewitt netted for Aberdeen and a - hammering of Clydebank, with goals from Billy Stark , Robert Connorand Hewitt.When Roy Aitken was sacked in , director of football Burkinshaw took charge to give the club time to appoint Alex Miller, leaving when Miller arrived.In the dugout, Burkinshaw achieved a - home draw against Rangers, with Eoin Jess firing in a -yard rocket, before the team recorded the same scoreline against Dunfermline at East End Park. Billy Dodds scored the Reds# goal in the latter outing.Former Scotland midfielder Hegarty took the reins for the remainder of the   season after the departure of Miller.After an upturn in form, things dwindled again towards the end of the campaign, with the Dons picking up just three pointsfrom their last seven league games.Still, his % win record was higher than both Miller, under who he#d served as assistant, and his successor Ebbe Skovdahl, but Hegarty was never offered the position permanently, despite steering Aberdeen away from the threat of relegation.Speirs only bossed one game before Steve Paterson was brought in to replace Skovdahl, to whom Speirs had been assistant manager.The Dons were on an eight-match winless run when Speirs was put in charge.Nevertheless, he didn#t lose his solitary match, securing a - home draw against Motherwell, in which Darren Young netted for Aberdeen.Youth coaches and former players Cooper # who went on to manage Inverurie Locos # and Gothenburg Great Simpson, who is part of the current interim team, filled the gap left by Mark McGhee, taking the side for one game before Craig Brown#s arrival.Unfortunately it wasn#t a happy afternoon, with the Dons going down - to Hearts at Tynecastle.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. vw, px\"  "},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/syndicatenews/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/03/DCT-KE-200321-01-005_38303454-e1616267688800-940x564.jpg ","title":"peterhead boss jim mcinally delighted with sides performance to overcome bogey team airdrieonians","story":".dct-cta@-webkit-keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate@keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate.dct-cta__title.dct-cta__content p.dct-cta__content p:not.dct-cta__content p:last-child.dct-cta__label.dct-cta__input.dct-cta__input::-webkit-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::-moz-placeholder.dct-cta__input:-ms-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::placeholder.dct-cta__label:hover.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__label:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__input:hover,.dct-cta__input:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__btn .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn.dct-cta__btn:disabled.dct-cta__btn:not.dct-cta__btn:not:hover.dct-cta__btn:not:hover,.dct-cta__btn:not:focus.dct-cta__btn-text.dct-cta__btn:before .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn-loadingborder-top:px solid #fffborder-radius:%width:pxheight:pxbox-sizing:border-box-webkit-animation:dctSpinner .s linear infiniteanimation:dctSpinner .s linear infinite.dct-cta--signup.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--signup__dialogs.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--success.dct-cta--signup__dialog--error.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__grid.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and @media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap+.dct-cta__content@supports or.dct-cta__flex:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--js-active.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and @supports or.dct-cta__grid:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label,.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__gridgrid-template-columns:fr minmaxgrid-gap:.rem .remPeterhead boss Jim McInally saw plenty of positives in his side#s win over -man Airdrieonians.The seventh-placed Blue Toon ed to League One action against the full-time Diamonds at Balmoor, with Jordon Brown#s low th-minute finish the dference between the teams.Victory has moved McInally#s men level on points with the three sides above them, including Airdrie, who Peterhead hadn#t beaten in four attempts since theirto the third tier in .The home side were able to control proceedings, without creating too many chances, after Kyle Turner#s deserved fourth-minute red card for a late lunge on Ryan Conroy.McInally thinks # given the mitigating circumstances of  weeks in the cold storage # the afternoon went as well as he could have hoped, and said: “I did say earlier in the week that when we’ve played Airdrie before we’ve not had many breaks and obviously we get a break with them getting a man sent off in the fourth minute.“At the end of the day, we were lucky it wasn’t a serious injury, because it was a shocking tackle.“Playing against  men can be tough, so the pleasing thing for me is we’ve went through  minutes, by the time you add time added on, without our goalkeeper having a save to make.”McInally was delighted with how his players stood up to their first competitive outing since January , and he was also able to give striker Niah Payne, a winter window signing, a long-awaited debut.Two signings from the last seven days also played # Inverurie Locos loanee Hamish Ritchie started in midfield, turning in a composed and creative display, as well as setting up Brown#s goal, while teenage Dundee right-back Daniel Strachan made a late cameo.McInally, who is trying to lessen the risk of muscle injuries which could blight the third and fourth tier after such a long break, said: “Generally, I’m really pleased.“I thought Scott Brown was magnicent the whole game and I thought Hamish Ritchie was excellent for a boy making his debut for us.“He’s a natural footballer, even his pass for the goal – it was completely unselfish, he could’ve hit it himself, but he put it on a plate for Jordon Brown.“Jordon coming back and scoring is exactly what he always done for us – Popping up in the area and scoring goals.“It was also good to get Danny Strachan on, a local boy, so it was nice and nice to win, because Airdrie have been a bogey team for us.”Peterhead started on the front foot, with Payne flashing a header over the right stancheon soon after kick-off, before Turner was dismissed soon after.The visitors went close on  minutes, with Calum Gallagher capitalising on a defensive mishap to crash a left-footed drive off Josh Rae’s bar from  yards out.On  minutes, Andrew McCarthy had Peterhead’s only clear-cut opportunity of the first half, but fired past the post from Ritchie’s pinpoint ball.After the break, Airdrie suffered another early blow as their much-lauded attacker Thomas Robert was stretchered off with what appeared to be an ankle problem.Peterhead#s man advantage, which had seen them have most of the ball throughout, really began to tell after the hour as they probed for an opener with more urgency.And, on  minutes, they took the lead, with Brown firing low across Airdrie keeper Max Currie from the left corner of the six-yard box after being played in by Ritchie.Peterhead are in Scottish Cup third round action against Stenhousemuir tomorrow.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. vw, px\"  "},{"url":null,"title":"crinan puffer goes virtual for 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Once again, the group excelled, taking the tally for the month to beyond , miles.The Camanachd Association ran a competition on the final day of the month – whoever ran the furthest would be rewarded with a Scotland replica top from association partners Macronstore Highland.Aberdeen University player Joe Folan set the early pace, clocking up . miles at am.

It therefore has a special responsibility to do all it can to advance the peace process.So, while calling for an end to violence, it is simultaneously supplying the weapons necessary to prolong the conflict.The shameful neglect of this leadership role and continued licensing of arms to facilitate Saudi-led offensives is unsustainable. It is a stance that leaves the UK increasingly isolated on the global stage, with countries including Germany, Italy and the Netherlands already banning the export of arms to Saudi Arabia.The UK government now faces a choice: to join President Biden and live up to its obligations as UN penholder by ending the UK’s involvement in the Saudi campaign, or to continue to act as both peacekeeper and warmonger, undermining any moral leadership it might claim.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,The SNP has voted to conceal Alex Salmond#s evidence to the parliamentary inquiry.The Scottish Conservatives brought a vote to the Salmond inquiry demanding that Salmond’s evidence, much of which is already in the public domain, be published.This would allow Salmond to give crucial evidence in person about the SNP#s botched handling of this case. All the SNP MSPs on the committee, however, voted against its publication, meaning it will not be released.The Scottish public deserves to know the truth of what happened and why £, of public money had to be paid to Salmond.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward.Sir,The personal testimony of the men and boys in the final independent report into non-recent sexual abuse in Scottish football # who have shown incredible courage # demonstrates how needed this independent review has been.The abuse young players have suffered in football is inexcusable and heart-breaking. By bravely speaking up, they provided the catalyst for the review and the changes that will come from it are thanks to them.We welcome the ongoing work the Scottish Football Associationhas carried out in light of the report’s recommendations and encourage them to continue their progress.The SFA is showing it is willing to listen and implement changes that ensure no more children suffer the experiences described in the report.We are pleased to see children and young people’s involvement in the process, including the consultation with the Scottish Children’s Parliament. The voices of children and young people are crucial to developing improvements for their own wellbeing and safety and to change a culture where children can be frightened to speak up.Safeguarding in Sport, a partnership between Children st and sportscotland, has developed the Standards for Child Wellbeing and Protection in Sport, which state children have a right to express their views and have their voice taken into account. We are keen to support the SFA in its continued implementation of the recommendations to create a culture in football where we can be sure that every child is safe to enjoy the huge benefits of participating in sport.Any volunteer or official looking for advice or support about a child can contact safeguardinginsport@childrenst.org.uk or contact the Children st Parentline service on   or online at www.childrenst.org.uk parentline.Mary Glasgow, chief executive, Children st.Sir,Zero Waste Scotland’s Energy Efficiency Business Support Service provides free, independent advice to Small and Medium-Sized Enterprisesto introduce more energy efficient technology.Businesses can apply for an interest-free Scottish Government SME loan of £, to £,, with a maximum cashback grant of £, for those eligible.Many businesses in Argyll and Bute have decided to take action to reduce their energy use, adding profit directly to the bottom line while helping Scotland meet its target to reduce carbon emissions to net zero by .Since , the impartial advice given to companies in the region has identied almost £m of potential energy savings through heating, lighting and building upgrades.To find out more or to apply, visit www.energy.zerowastescotland.org.uk.

Options! There is only one possible and that should be obvious.When I first moved to Argyll, driving through Glen Croe was a beautul feeling that I had left the urban areas behind and come out into fresh country. No longer # it is a disaster zone and will remain so for a number of years, and possibly decades,a new  safe road is not built.With the elections in May for the Scottish Government, we should be calling on our  politicians to deliver a suitable road through Glen Croe and to do it soon, not  years  away with no firm plans to do it even then. Our politicians are in hiding and it is time they should deliver.The option should be for a new safe road well away from any landslide so that we, the inhabitants of Argyll, can get back to some normal le.Derrick Anstee, InveraraySir,The neglect of the A is a disgrace.It’s not just the long detour via Crianlarich when it rains heavily, it’s the potholes and ruts when we get a spell of cold weather.Three years ago we had a cold winter and the A became a dirt track. Emergency repairs had to be carried out. The Scottish Government said they’d solved the problem. Now we have another cold winter, and again emergency repairs are needed.Other trunk roads in Scotland don’t get closed when it rains or get all these ruts and potholes in a cold winter.We need serious money invested now to solve the A problems. Yet all we get from the Scottish Government is waffle about y public inquiries.We need money and action now to make the A as reliable as Scotland’s other trunk roads, not more cheap solutions.Councillor Alan Reid, Cowal wardMr Reid is the LibDem candidate for May#s Scottish parliamentary electionSir,With reference to theto school, I do hope that the pupils in Lochgilphead Joint Campus are kept in at lunchtime instead of being allowed to roam the streets like herds of wildebeast, with absolutely no social distancing or the wearing of masks.There is a perfectly good ing canteen restaurant in the school and or packed lunches.There is no need, at this time, for them all to be out and crowding supermarkets, fast food shops, cafes and chippies.This needs to be addressed by the Argyll and Bute education department as soon as possible.Name and address suppliedSir,In a leaflet delivered to every home in the Argyll and Bute constituency, Conservative MSP Donald Cameron claims that the #UK Governmentannounced the Argyll and Bute Rural Growth Deal worth £ million# and goes on to say that he is working with local councillors #including Alastair Redman# to #see what further action is needed#.The Rural Growth Deal, however, is a joint project involving £ million from the Scottish Government and a matched sum from the UK Government as well as more than £ million from other sources.In addition the deal has its origins in discussions between the Argyll and Bute MSP Michael Russell, then Scottish Government Finance Secretary John Swinney and the former leader of Argyll and Bute Council, Dick Walsh, in February . The UK Government only became involved some years later.This would be a very serious attempt at disinformation were it not so ludicrously self-defeating. Mr Cameron is standing to be a member of the Scottish Parliament yet he is trying to airbrush out anything Scottish about the largest investment ever in Argyll and Bute and its future.I hope it is merely ignorance of what has happened here that has led him to so severely misrepresent the truth of the issue, becauseit is political spin then he needs to apologise and withdraw the leaflet.Being pictured next to Alastair Redman won#t help him either, given that Mr Redman is best known for his regular letters to local papers attacking the very Scottish Government that is putting an extra £ million into this area.The Scottish Tories need to decide who they are working for # Boris Johnson in London, or the people of Scotland.Until Mr Cameron sorts his loyalties out, then he can#t be regarded as any sort of contender for the privilege of representing the people of Argyll and Bute.Michael Russell MSPSir,The SNP has committed £, to prepare for a second referendum within the next year.Instead of being focused on Scotland’s vaccination programme and protecting people’s jobs, the SNP’s priority is holding another isive referendum as early as this year.Setting aside this vast sum of money to help preparations for a referendum shows the SNP’s commitment toScotland to the politics of ision all over again.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward"},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast episode 20 the final tee","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Not before time.I was supportive of the mitigation plan, using nets and catch pits, as the simplest and least expensive approach. It was certainly worth a try, but it is abundantly clear now # with reputedly £ million spent # that it is not working.The , tonnes or more poised to come down on the road may well be an underestimate, and recent closures of the OMR, despite the new bund, doesn’t say very much for the efficacy of the protection. So we need an alternative, and we need it soon, not  years away.Talk of #alternative traffic corridors# is just a distraction.There may well be a case for a bridge-and-tunnel approach. Such has been successful in Norway and # notably # both in Iceland and Faroe Islands, which have much smaller resource bases than Norway. But these would be long-term schemes, each requiring the completion of several major interlinked crossings, for the like of which Scotland’s roads authority has hitherto shown neither interest nor aptitude.The problem at the Rest is a local one which requires a local solution. It’s only a mile or so of road which is at issue there.The alternatives, realistically, boil down to three:Overhead protection might well be required over quite a long distance, as it’s not just the bit at the catch pits which is threatened. The slopes of the Cobbler have experienced slides too. Since the hillside ies it might not be possible to use standard prefabricated modules, and in any case installation work would close the A for some time.A tunnel through to Butterbridge could be driven quite quickly # particularlythe Norwegians did it # but the approach in upper Glen Croe would require protection just like the OMR. Sir William Lithgow’s proposal mentions this, but construction would also almost certainly close the OMR, leaving no ersion for that period.The construction of a new alignment up the south west side of the glen, however, either on or roughly parallel to the existing forestry road, would avoid interference with through traffic.Both the gradient and the transverse slope would be substantially similar to those of the existing A, though thewould be marginally greater, which is probably why the north east side was chosen when the #new# A was built.The core of the case for the third option, however, is that the south west side of the glen has experienced far less erosion, both historically and in recent years, than the north east one.Stand at the upper viewpoint, or better still a little way along the Lochgoilhead road, and look around. The slopes of Ben Luibhean on which the A runs show far more watercourses and gullies than any of the others in the vicinity.This indicates a lot more rainfall impacting that slope, probably by the prevailing weather being funnelled on to it through the pass at the top of Glen More. And that weather is becoming worse.There have been no major slips over the forestry road in recent years, despite a spate of them on the opposite slope. It may just be the trees. I don’t think so, but in any case the trees are there, while it would take some years for tree cover to established above the A.Going back a lot further in time, the pattern is the same. The burn in the floor of upper Glen Croe has been pushed, over the centuries, by slip debris coming down from the north east slope, and the depth of that debris can easily be seen in the gullies recently carved in it behind the new bund.There is also a fair number of impressively-sized boulders on the lower slopes on that side, which at some point rolled down the hillside. Some of these came from the Cobbler, and although most are below the road a few are not. There is nothing to say that more will not arrive.A further point is that while the lower slopes on each side of the upper glen are similar, those on the south west side ease off towards the top, while those on the NE slope do not.It is on these upper slopes that the small slips develop which can pick up more and more water and debris on their way down, hence the fan shape of the typical slip. There is, in other words, a lot less potential for the initiation of slips on the south west side.I think that this all points to the need for a serious look at the forestry road, and I fail to understand why the investigations a few years ago dismissed it as a viable alternative.It’s the existing A which isn’t viable. And why any of these solutions would take  years to complete also beats me. Local objections  There is only one house in upper Glen Croe, and in the rest of Argyll I have yet to meet anyone who doesn’t want a permanent solution.My suspicion is that the biggest dficulty is that Transport Scotland can’t yet find a way to explain how £ million could be spent to such little effect. I might, of course, be wrong in all this, but I wait to be convinced of it.Arthur Blue, ArdrishaigSir,Since the temporary repairs to the Rest are clearly getting nowhere and costing money into the bargain, I would like to suggest a radical solution to the problem, and that is to build a viaduct right down the centre of the valley, based on the design of the MillauFor those not familiar with this structure, it is well worth an internet search. I believe this is still the world#s tallest bridge and is a really beautul structure.Seen from a distance, the white deck and piers look quite unreal # moreBefore anyone asks where that sum of money is to be found, I would point out that Boris Johnson#s proposed tunnel to Northern Ireland may cost between £ billion and £ billion # nobody knows because it hasn#t been designed yet. Nevertheless, Alister Jack is extremely enthusiastic about the proposal, so clearly money is not a problem.Not only would this new viaduct solve the problem once and for all, I suspect that, like the Millau Viaduct, it would become a much-photographed tourist attraction.John McCall, LochgilpheadSir,In last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser, Councillor Alastair Redman criticises the SNP for setting aside £, of its own money to campaign for an independent Scotland.Not surprisingly, he fails to enlighten us as to the costs of  the Tory party#s #Union Unit# set up by the Prime Minister at the taxpayers# expense.David Hay, MinardSir,Due to the speed with which the NHS is carrying out its vaccination programme, there is hope that we can soon all get out again andto normal.We still, however, face huge challenges. The economy has suffered. The NHS faces a big backlog of cancelled operations. Our young people have a lot of schooling to catch up on. We don’t have much time left to stop our climate changing before it is too late.Here in Argyll the Scottish Government must rise to the challenge of building a permanent solution at the Rest and Be Thankful.These must be our priorities. We can’t afford to spend the next few years arguing over independence. That’s an unnecessary distraction.We need a needle-sharp focus on the recovery without the distraction of another isive referendum.Put recovery first.Councillor Alan Reid, Cowal wardMr Reid is the Argyll and Bute LibDem candidate for May#s Scottish parliamentary election"},{"url":null,"title":"look out for nuthatches in argyll this spring","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The vaccination process carried out with great economy and efficiency # and entirely painlessly so that we really will have to stop calling it #the jag#.The real bonus was the warmth and good humour from everyone involved that made the whole process welcoming, so that you left with a smile on your face. Only after the event do you realise what a tremendous team effort it was from everyone involved and all of them deserve our thanks.I hope very much that the Mid Argyll area makes a near  per cent response to the vaccination invitation, because that is what this effort deserves and will demonstrate to those involved the very real, genuine appreciation we have for their work during the pandemic.Norman Rea, Kintallen, TayvallichSir,The rank hypocrisy of the Scottish Tories knows no bounds.While they are frothing at the mouth that the first minister should resign over allegedly misleading the Scottish Parliament, at the same time Prime Minister Johnson was proven to have deliberately misled the Westminster parliament.Standing up in the House of Commons, Mr Johnson stated that all Covid-related contracts were #on the record#.This was three days after the High Court ruled the government had acted unlawfully by failing to publish hundreds of such contracts, which somehow seemed to find their way to those with Tory party connections.Two weeks prior to this, the Health Minister Matt Hancock was found guilty of illegal activity by the High Court, refusing to resign or even apologise when the extent of illegal awarding of PPE contracts was revealed.Last year Tory Home Secretary Priti Patel was found guilty of breaching the ministerial code by being a bully and shouting and swearing at civil servant employees in the Home Office, recently reaching a £, settlement with the former Home Office Permanent Secretary.Compare and contrast that with north of the border, where the Tory party has demanded the resignation of the first minister even before the outcome of the enquiries into the handling of the Alex Salmond case by the Scottish Government has been published.Not a cheep from them demanding an apology, let alone a resignation, for the flagrant abuses by their Westminster colleagues. What hypocrites.Alex Orr, EdinburghSir,This Mother’s Day, school feeding charity Mary’s Meals would like to pay tribute to incredible women around the world.From the mums in the UK whose food has nourished us throughout our childhoods, including those who volunteer and fundraise for Mary’s Meals, to the women who cook and serve our daily meals for children in some of the world’s poorest countries, we celebrate them all.Mary’s Meals feeds more than . million hungry children in  countries every school day.That’s why I am asking your readers to send a Mary’s Meals gt card to the special women in their lives this Mother’s Day.

Thanks to the amazing commitment of some truly dedicated people working in the NHS and in social care, lives have been saved and people have been cared for. Stroke teams up and down the country have in many areas managed to continue to offer specialist care and treatment to patients throughout the pandemic. We cannot thank them enough.But the fallout from Covid- is going to pose challenges for everyone in health and social care. Our Recoveries at Risk report last autumn highlighted the real le impact of the pandemic on people recovering from a stroke.Emerging evidence of links between Covid- and stroke means that now, more than ever, a renewed national focus on stroke is needed in Scotland.Health officials have been working during the pandemic to review evidence and define what #a progressive stroke service for Scotland# should look like.This will include improved stroke care bundle figures, improved stroke prevention measures, a national thrombectomy service and stroke-specic, person-centred rehabilitation.The charity is pleased that people affected by stroke will be included in the development of this work.A draft paper will be with the Scottish Government in the next few weeks. Whatever the outcome of May’s election, the Stroke Association in Scotland expects the next government to push this work on, and for a new, improved, progressive stroke service to be implemented.Colin Oliver, public affairs officer, the Stroke Association in Scotland"},{"url":null,"title":"argylls abigail releases debut single","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Keith also co-wrote and produced the single at his studio on the Isle of Lewis.Abigail said: #The single is about encouraging women to follow their passions and carve out a le that they can enjoy and be proud of.#The music video that we created doesn’t have me in it, I wanted it to showcase powerful women who are following their dreams in whatever field their passions and talents lie.#The ambition behind the single is for it to be inspiring and help others to find the courage and drive to fight for their goals, no matter what those are.#I have always recorded with my band Heron Valley, who are a traditional folk band, so recording something for myself has been really dferent. Firstly, due to the obvious genre dferences but also because I’ve always had the support of five other people to make key choices, so it’s been a big change making decisions by myself on how I want the music to sound.#I have really enjoyed the process and the musical independence recording the single has given me.#Originally from rural Argyll, Abigail grew up with music very much at the heart of her family learning fiddle from a young age, also being taught guitar and vocal stylings at home with her father. She joined Heron Valley in its infancy while also studying at Royal Conservatoire of Scotland Junior School.As well as touring extensively with Heron Valley, Abigail went on to graduate from The Royal Conservatoire of Scotland where she studied Scots Song and classical violin. Her unique music style and honest song writing make Abigail an exciting prospect for the Scottish music scene and Lady a much-anticipated release.Lady will be available to download and stream from Friday March ."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column march 12 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The detailed assessment will also consider construction risk, cost and environmental impact of the options and a Statutory Environmental Assessment will be published in April.#Mitigation works at the Rest and be Thankful will carry on meantime, with a new debris cage, catchpit, debris fencing and flood mitigation planned.Medium term improvements are also being considered to improve the route through Glen Croe, including  the forestry track, old military road and other options on public land.Cabinet Secretary for Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity, Michael Matheson MSP said: #Following the disruption caused by landslips at the A Rest and be Thankful, I understand the frustration and disruption that these bring for local communities and road users.#We are progressing substantial short term investment in the existing A including installing a debris cage and new culvert, construction of an additional catchpit, debris fencing and flood mitigation measures at the River Croe crossing.#I can also announce today that I have asked Transport Scotland to progress work to look at a medium term resilient route through Glen Croe including consideration of the forestry track, the old military road and other options on land already owned by Scottish Ministers. Depending on the statutory consents required, this work will seek to develop finalised proposals within  months.#Along with this work on the existing A, we are working in parallel to identy a permanent solution to the road at the Rest and be Thankful. Following the conclusion of the preliminary assessment of the corridor options under consideration the preferred corridor has been identied as the Glen Croe corridor, Option .#Identying the preferred route corridor is a major step forward for this vital work and we are now pushing forward to look at five alternative options within that online corridor and starting the process shortly to appoint design consultants for this work.#As I made clear at the Rural Economy and Connectivity Committee last week, I have asked Transport Scotland to accelerate the preparation and delivery of the scheme where possible given the importance of the route to local communities and road users.#However, we are required to follow the correct statutory process to ensure a fair and transparent assessment of options and impacts on local communities and road users.#From today the new Story Map portal will provide regular updates on the design work as we look at alternative options within the preferred route corridor. We are also encouraging those with an interest to provide feedback on the preferred route corridor and possible route options between now and the end of May.#All of this work underlines the Scottish Government’s commitment to continued work with key stakeholders and local communities to ensure that Argyll and Bute remains open for business.#John Gurr, chairperson of The Rest and be Thankful Campaign chairperson, gave the news a lukewarm reception.#Whilst we welcome today’s announcement and the preferred option of Glen Croe, said Mr Gurr, #we are still no further forward in terms of timescales.#As we move into day  of the Rest and be Thankful being closed or disrupted, we urge Mr Matheson to put deliverable dates against this project.#Our request of a completion date of May  has once again fallen on deaf ears and without any mention of any dates it feels very much like a fluffy pre-election promise.#"},{"url":null,"title":"creative youngsters invited to showcase visual artwork","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

As many examples as possible will then also be published in the Campbeltown Courier, Argyllshire Advertiser and Oban Times newspapers.The artwork, which must be created specically for this showcase, can be on any surface # as long as it can be photographed and submitted # but it is limited to one image per person. It is not a competition and none of artwork will be judged.Gigha-based youth work facilitator Kenny Wilson, one of the project#s organisers, explained: #As youth workers, we kept hearing the same phrases from young people, phrases like #My bedroom has become my classroom# and #I feel like the walls are closing in on me#. Young people were asking questions like #Where can we go # Nowhere. #Who we can meet # No-one. #What are we allowed to do # During lockdown, very little at all.#The idea is to give artistic young people something to do that#s not prescribed by the Curriculum for Excellence [Scotland#s education framework] or by the government to give them the freedom to choose what they want to do, to design whatever they want to design.#The reward will be seeing their artwork published online and in the newspapers. The purpose of the whole thing is to increase the wellbeing of young people, to give them a boost # it#s as simple as that.#He added: #It could well be that something catches the eye of someone in the wider artistic community and they could be put in touch with the young creator of the piece in question # but that would have to be arranged through the youth workers, subject to careful child protection measures, and with parents# consent.#Kenny explained that safeguarding is an essential part of all that youth workers do and, as such, the organisers have created a GDPR statement which reads: #We will ensure that all personal data that we collect will only be held until all the images have been showcased, and will be processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner and only collected for the legitimate purposes of the showcase, and will never be passed on to any other organisation or third party without your explicit permission.#Those who would like to register an interest in taking part, can email ayelovetomake@gmail providing their first name and location. They are not required to submit their surname, full address or age, as long as they are within the  to  age range.When the project officially launches on Friday March , they can then send photographs of their artwork to the same email address so it can be uploaded to the project#s Instagram account, where it will be made visible to the public after the Sunday April  closing date.Kenny added: #If you are a young person with a desire to create, then go for it!#"},{"url":null,"title":"heathers treks renaissance ruins and ancient rock art","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

She has travelled and trekked throughout the world, walked across Scotland numerous times, climbed many of its peaks and now lives in Argyll amongst the scenery she loves.Lovely Kilmartin Glen is host to many wonderful historic sites and ancient monuments.Overlooking its northern reaches the renaissance remains of Master John Carswell’s Carnasserie Castle stand proud, its ruins eerily dramatic despite now being more home to crow than human.There are many ways in which to explore the area. This circular takes you through time from Carnasserie Castle in the east to the prehistoric rock art at Ormaig in the west, before wending southwards on the path used in bygone days to reach Old Poltalloch. Then, turning east, you come to Lady’s Seat, which offers lovely views down the glen, a brief respite before turning northwards toto the castle’s realm. Glimpses over to Loch Craignish and down Kilmartin Glen give one time to ponder the geology of the area swept by the glaciers of the last ice age.At the car park you will see a small path exiting the NE corner by the information boards. Turn left and head up the track towards the castle. You initially come to a turning left, you will take this shortly. Meanwhile the castle lies just ahead, through a gate and up a steep path to your left. Currently you can but admire its grandeur from the outside, either from here or the next section of the walk .Return to the track and take the turn on your right SW up through the trees and to a gate. Ahead you will cross the field for m, with the castle to your right, before re-joining the farm track. Follow it to a T-junction .Turn right and continue up the field and through a gate. A young forestry plantation lies to your left, pretty and convoluted little hills and glens to your right. Effectively the valley floor is the line of a dyke with the lumps, bumps and ides a mixture of limestone, igneous rock intrusions, sandstones, gritstones, conglomerates and folding doing much to create the complex NE SW flow seen in the shape of the hills and lochs all carved out by glaciers.Follow the track over the col past a gnarly old plantation on a knoll. The route descends for km towards Loch Craignish before veering sharply right to cross the Eas Mor burn at its western end. Note the main track you come on to. For those wishing to miss the path to Old Poltalloch you will need toto this point and keep following it south east to join up with the rest of the route.Cross the bridge over the Eas Mor. Ignore the small path to your right with a barrier and continue for m look out for the new track signposted up to the prehistoric rock art of Ormaig. After ascending m you will see the little paths to your right leading to the stones, a good place to pause and wonder at those who carved them.Return to the track below and south over the Eas Mor. At the sharp left-hand bend turn immediately right towards the sea. After just m, opposite a ruined croft, an easily missed path slips down to a wall. As soon as you are on it, it is obvious and now wends its way southwards towards Old Poltalloch through the ‘Big Wood’.The path is boggy in places with the odd fallen tree. After .km it reaches a forestry road turn left and follow this for m to a sharp left-hand bend. The path goes straight ahead at the bottom of the bend just below a turning point, again it is not obvious until you are on it. Continue to follow this all the way until you reach the road at Old Poltalloch, passing farmstead ruins and the old walled garden on your right. The house itself has now been renovated.Turn left. The track, which also leads to a jetty below, climbs upwards for nearly km before reaching the col leading to Kilmartin Glen. Ignore the two tracks you pass on your left .Descend for m and take the grassy forestry track to your right. After m a path leads upwards on your right to Lady’s Seat, a worthy detour for a grand view over the glen.Return to the track and turn right to descend to the main track below . Cross straight over, through a gate to the right of some sheep pens. Passing a track from your right after mzigzag down through the woods to a gate. The track does a sharp -degree turn right and, a little after, turn left to follow the tracks back to Carnasserie and your earlier outward route.Please note: Historic and Environment Scotland properties and sites remain closed due to Covid the castle can only be viewed from the outside at this time.

How could they turn so quickly  Where was their integrity Some just followed the crowd others feared Jesus was challenging the accepted order, so better get rid of him for the greater good.If we face betrayal, injustice, double standards, how do we react  Revenge, get our own back  That is a very natural reaction, but the consequence is to prolong the bitterness, perhaps ramp up the situation.Jesus asks us to step back, to #turn the other cheek# , to suck up the injustice, the double standards, and let peace rule.Impossible  Well, that is what He did at the cross, and because of Him, I think it is possible.I don#t always get it right in my le, but #don#t do as I do , do as He tells you#.

But two thirds of women are diagnosed late, when the cancer is harder to treat.This March, for Oian Cancer Awareness Month, I’m writing to ask your readers to take just two minutes of their time to learn the symptoms and spread the word to their families and friends.The main symptoms of oian cancer are: persistent bloating, feeling full or having dficulty eating, tummy pain, and needing to wee more often or more urgently.If you believe in a future where every woman diagnosed with oian cancer has the best chance of survival, please show your support and visit www.targetoiancancer.org.uk MarchSarah Greene, Target Oian Cancer PatronSir,We welcome the latest announcement from the Scottish Government that communal worship can potentially resume from March  with the possibility of up to  people in attendance, assuming physical distancing of two metres can be in place.Christians are Easter people we live with hope in all circumstances, and the church will be providing guidance to congregations to help them ensure that buildings are re-opened in a safe and responsible manner.While some congregations will adopt a cautious approach regarding the reopening of our buildings # and others won#t have the practical means to do so # everyone will be very glad at this news and will already be looking forward to how most appropriately to celebrate Easter .In whatever we do, we#ll be remembering that the God who raised Jesus from the grave has been faithful to us throughout the whole of this last year.Rt Rev Dr Martin Fair, Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of ScotlandSir,The first Citizens’ Assembly of Scotland has submitted its final report to the Scottish Parliament, with its  powerful democratic recommendations aimed at improving the wellbeing of Scotland#s people and governance.I personally would have loved to be a participant in this new democratic exercise, meeting and sharing with, speaking and listening to, a wide range of our people, many very unlike me and with very dferent perspectives, opinions and lived experience.To be informed by a range of expert, evidence-based perspectives, to explore and discuss implications and reservations, and to move towards a rough consensus on a range of key questions that will affect ourselves, our children and grandchildren, and that will shape the future of our country – that’s the exemplar of the active, responsible citizen of st century Scotland.There#s a climate assembly also currently working towards its conclusions, and I await its recommendations with interest and anticipation.Recommendation six of the first assembly is: #That in order to ensure that citizens can make informed decisions in relation to rebuilding their communities the Scottish government and parliament should: establish community-based citizens# assemblies to assess what is happening in our communities , identy gaps and recommend actions, including through digital technology, that can bring people together and make our communities more inclusive.#We have a Scottish election coming up in May, and I hope to see a good turnout as a good majority of Scotland’s electorate, from age  upwards, make sure to vote in this most critical exercise of our moment of power and responsibility.Subsequently, I hope to very soon look forward to a renewed interest in local democracy, as an Argyll and Bute Citizens# Assembly debates and decide the shape of Argyll and Bute#s future for the coming decisive decade.Perhaps that future will include enhanced interest and participation in some version of our current powerless and voiceless community councils.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"longing for a rest","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

MSPs wanted to know when the Scottish Government was advised it would likely lose the challenge raised by Mr Salmond, but ministers said handing over the advice would breach the ministerial code.On two occasions, MSPs voted for the evidence to be released, with a deal eventually being struck in December to reveal the advice only to MSPs on the committee.Following a vote of no confidence threat in the Deputy First Minister, the Scottish Government released ldquokey legal advice, but the Scottish Tories were not satisfied and continued in their bid to oust John Swinney, which ultimately failed.Mr Salmond and Ms Sturgeon separately sat for mammoth sessions in front of the committee, taking questions from MSPs over several hours.Didnrsquot Mr Salmond face trial on sexual misconduct charges Yes. The former first minister was cleared of  charges at the High Court in Edinburgh in March last year after being arrested in January .What were the issues with Mr Salmondrsquos evidence to the committee Mr Salmond and the committee have been caught in repeated legal wrangles over evidence published by the inquiry.Last month, the former first minister said he would not appear before the committee after it decided not to publish his submission to a separate investigation into whether Ms Sturgeon breached the ministerial code over fears it may identy some of the complainers in Mr Salmondrsquos criminal trial last year.However, an alteration made to a court order by Judge Lady Dorrian meant the evidence could potentially be made public.While the committee voted against publication, the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Bodymade the decision to publish anyway.The evidence was online for less than  hours before the Crown Office raised concerns with Holyrood about it, asking for redactions to be made.In his submission, the former first minister accused some in the Scottish Government and SNP of a ldquomalicious and concerted attempt to damage my reputation and remove me from public le in Scotland.But Ms Sturgeon said her predecessor did not have ldquoa shred of evidence to support his claims.The submission was later re-released, with a number of paragraphs relating to the set-up of a meeting between Mr Salmond and his successor redacted.Is the committee inquiry the only investigation into the matter No. Ms Sturgeon is currently under investigation by James Hamilton QC to establishshe breached the ministerial code.Ms Sturgeon referred herself after being accused of misleading Parliament over when she knew of the complaints against Mr Salmond.She previously said she had been told about the allegations by Mr Salmond himself during a meeting in her home on April , .However, it was later found that Mr Salmondrsquos former chief of staff Geoff Aberdein had met with the First Minister in her Holyrood office four days prior to that, where she was told of the complaints.Scotlandrsquos first minister @NicolaSturgeonresponds to @SkyNewsexclusive the harassment committee has ruled she misled Parliament in her evidence.ldquoThe opposition members of this committee made their minds up about me before I uttered a single word of evidence. pic UNeUJsmdash Fraser KnightMarch , What has the committee concluded A leak on Thursday evening from inside the committee revealed it has concluded the First Minister misled the inquiry over whether she had offered to intervene in the case ndash which Ms Sturgeon denies doing.Two other witnesses, one of whom is Mr Salmondrsquos lawyer and former SNP MSP Duncan Hamilton and who was at the meeting in question, contradicted the First Ministerrsquos statement.The conclusion was arrived at following a - party line vote, with the four SNP members of the committee, including convener Linda Fabiani, supporting the First Ministerrsquos assertion.What happens next The decision is likely to increase pressure on Ms Sturgeon to stand down before Mayrsquos election, although it is unclear whether the act was deemed a resignation-worthy offence.Last night, Scottish Conservatives leader Douglas Ross called for her to quit.He said: ldquoThe committee will publish its findings in the coming days and we will wait for that report.ldquoBut we have already detailed that Nicola Sturgeon lied to the Scottish Parliament and for that, she must resign. All wersquore waiting for is confirmation.Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said: ldquoI am not going to prejudge the outcome of the committee report and we await its findings, butit does conclude that the First Minister has misled Parliament and potentially breached the ministerial code then that is incredibly serious.A Scottish Parliament spokesperson said: \"Further to media reports on the Committeersquos findings, the Committee is still finalising its report.

Edward and Mary were married in Knocknow, Southend, on October  .Their son, also named Edward, who was born in Southend on August  , travelled from West Virginia to Washington in the s and was one of the founders of a settlement which remains to this day.The village was founded in  when pioneers settled on its tide-swept flats and began to reclaim the land from the sea.#Washington Ed#, as he became known to the West Virginia McTaggarts, moved to the area in , and built a homestead on  acres of land, floating the timber for his home across the land at high tide.As others moved to the area and the settlement expanded, it was decided that a post office was required. Ed called a meeting at his home on March   to discuss the matter, with  settlers in attendance.A petition was drawn up and signed, asking for the creation of a post office with Ed as postmaster. He suggested naming the settlement Edison in honour of the inventor Thomas Edison.This led to the establishment in  of a trading post on land donated by Ed. In around , Edison#s first hotel was built on a small section of Ed#s land adjoining that on which the store stood.In , Ed married Mary Judson whose parents, Phoebe and Holden Judson, founded the city of Lynden in Washington. Ed and Mary had two children, a son and a daughter.Their son, also named Edward, farmed the family#s land from  until  before moving to San Francisco in , and later to Seattle.While Jim and his relatives know a fair bit about those who moved over the pond, they are keen to find out more about their ancestors who lived in Kintyre prior to those who emigrated.Anyone who is able to assist with their research, can contact Jim by emailing mfcnevada@gmail"},{"url":null,"title":"leader march 5 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

This is in contradiction to what is surely the council#s main aim when setting the budget # saving money where possible.Despite many of KRL#s staff having barriers to working, they do an exemplary job and are happy in their workplace # something which is evident from a visit to the recycling centre. The fact that some of them may lose the jobs they enjoy and do so well as a result of this decision is shocking and heart-breaking.Campbeltown has seen record levels of redundancies over the last couple of years, with more than  lay-offs at CS Wind and Campbeltown Creamery alone, never mind the many people who have since lost their jobs as a result of the pandemic. To potentially add to this level of unemployment for no apparent good reason is baffling.KRL not only provides an efficient and cost effective service but worthwhile jobs to people who may otherwise struggle to find employment and are no doubt very concerned about their futures right now.This decision should be reconsidered."},{"url":null,"title":"letters march 5 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

I immediately hung up # wondering which of my frailties had been discovered # and phoned  which tells you the last number that called.I twice noted the number given by  and ventured to phone it. On dialling this number, the phone company advised me that there was #no such number#.Over a week, adopting identical procedures, five dferent #no such numbers# were found. The job of answering morning calls was then delegated to the message answering machine and only once did it receive a call which was terminated speedily by the caller without a message.Is there a flaw in our phone companies# systems with consequent loss of income  If this flaw could be eradicated, phone scammers might be less numerous and consequently afford a little more protection for the vulnerable.Going by theof John Newall#s reply to my letter on England#s disastrous Brexit, forced upon Scotland against our democratic wishes, I had expected better than the mishmash of worn out tropes and John Bull exceptionalism trotted out by Mr Newall.Mr Newall makes great play of the successful roll-out of the Covid vaccine in Scotland and the UK. He is absolutely right, it has been a fantastic achievement, but to then go on to use this success to denigrate the EU#s vaccine programme is crass and over simplistic.Our success is an illusion until both doses of vaccine are administered, crowing about vaccines when only . per cent of the UK population has had the vital second jag, compared, for example, to . per cent in Denmark, is both presumptuous and inappropriate.Mr Newall goes on to assert that Scotland has a deficit that will prevent Scotland re-entering the EU, without of course mentioning the elephant in the room, the UK#s ruinous £ trillion # and increasing # debt. Unionists need to get their own house in order before lecturing anyone .Of course, legally, Scotland has no #deficit# or #debt#. How can a country with virtually no borrowing ability have a debt  What Scotland does have is a notional #debt#, the price of Westminster failure within the UK, where spending outwith Scotland#s control is assigned to Scotland, such as Trident, HS and London’s Crossrail. Spending that Scots taxpayers cough up for.Indeed,Courier readers start counting now at the rate of one a second, they#ll reach the number of pounds spent on Boris Johnson’s failed Track and Trace system at about .am on April  in the year . Readers may well wonder where the money went and why this is being loaded on to Scotland#s ledger.Straight from the #Better Together# playbook, Mr Newall brings up the hoary old #Spanish veto# myth. The truth is that Spain has no issue with an independent Scotland in the EU so long as this is within the framework of the UK constitution # which it is.Unlike Catalonia#s predicament, Scotland is not a #region# of the UK, there is no constitutional prohibition on independence votes or indeed of Scotland abrogating the  Treaty of Union with England.This is why successive prime ministers, from Margaret Thatcher to David Cameron, have repeatedly recognised the right of the Scottish people to independence # and why Boris Johnson#s oafish #No# will run into the sand.Mr Newall and I will never agree but that is the essence of democracy, and the right to choose in a free country.Scotland can either remain, semi-detached and impotent, as part of an increasingly insular Little Englander Tory Britain, bringing in its wake further austerity and diminished le chances for our young people, or Scots can vote for independence, just like our neighbours.Yes, there will be dficult choices, yes, there will be mistakes, but they will be our decisions to get right as we work for the prosperous, open and internationalist country that is within our grasp.I am delighted that our council will be investing nearly £. million to help keep Argyll and Bute going and growing.After relentless campaigning from myself and others it#s great to see, at long last, some substantial investment in our crumbling infrastructure.Building on investments made in previous years, an additional £. million will be invested to drive forward improvements and repairs to Argyll and Bute#s network of roads in rural, remote, island and urban communities, bringing the overall roads reconstruction budget to £ million for  .We are also investing more in active travel, in line with the council#s agreed priorities. This includes a further £, in enhancing and improving footpaths. This investment complements the current allocation of £, in green transport and travel.This recent Covid pandemic has highlighted more than ever the need to tackle our urban-rural ide.

I’m not alone in this: stroke strikes every five minutes in the UK, and around . million survivors are living with its devastating effects.Despite this, research into stroke is severely underfunded. Just one per cent of the total UK public and third sector health research spend goes towards stroke research.The Stroke Association has launched a unique opportunity for stroke survivors and those who care for stroke survivors to have our say on the future of stroke research. Partnered with the James Lind Alliance, the charity will find out what matters to us most so research can make the biggest dference to our lives.With such limited funds for stroke research, worsened by the Covid- pandemic, it#s vital that we come together and make our voices heard.If you#re a stroke survivor, or you care for or work with someone affected by stroke, join me and speak up for stroke.Visit www.stroke.org.uk jla by March ."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week march 5 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Minutes later, the MFV steamed away from the village, minus the men.A Land Rover had earlier searched a wide area in vain for them.On Tuesday morning, three Marines called at the village bar and asked for sandwiches. An employee said they were obviously very tired and had just come from the hills.Contact was established with the missing men in the early hours of yesterday. They had been in the hills and were discovered by a Land Rover which had been searching for them.The men were yesterday trying to make their way back to the base at Plymouth. It is understood they have not been seen since the weekend.The men had, in fact, being separated for a time but had managed to meet up with each other, too late to catch the boat at a pre-arranged rendezvous.Council brevitiesThe cost of converting council-controlled coin-operated locks to take decimal currency was to be £.

Mr Wilson is trying to muddy the waters there.Whilst Mr Wilson is correct that Scotland cannot have debt , Scotland does have deficit, and the reason we know this is because the SNP-run Scottish Government tells us so in the annual Government Revenue and Expenditure, Scotlandbut Mr Wilson contradicts himself by going on to say that Scotland has a #notional debt# . Scotland has no debt. Scotland cannot have debt. Mr Wilson needs to realise that debt and deficit are two dferent things.With regard to HS, yes, Scotland pays a two per cent share of the total cost but will receive approximately . per cent back in Barnett consequentials. THAT is a very good deal for Scotland. London#s Crossrail  Not a single penny for that will be paid for by Scotland.Mr Wilson goes on to say that there is no #prohibition on independence votes#. Another error from him. Section  of The Scotland Act , the act which allowed us to have a devolved assembly and to which the then Scottish Office signed up, lays down the exact process required. We need permission from HMGov.Oh, and the notion that Scotland can abrogate the Treaty Of Union is also wrong. Whilst Westminster is a parliament of equals, it cannot of itself dissolve the Treaty of Union of which it was not itself a progenitor. That is the prerogative of the suspended national parliaments of England and Scotland, which will require to be recalled from suspension #in abeyance ad interim# where they legitimately reside at the present time. Only the recalled national parliaments of Scotland and England may re-negotiate the  Treaty of Union.I would take this opportunity to remind Mr Wilson of two things: we had a referendum in  and voted to stay in the UK, and he should really learn to live with that and in no election ever, General or Scottish, has the SNP garnered more than  per cent of the vote.The decision by Argyll and Bute Council to stop funding Kintyre Recycling Limited is perverse to say the least.No thought seems to have been given to the level and cost of the future support for the employees who will be thrown on the scrap-heap. Will that go to the social work department and will they get the same level of support as they do now No thought seems to have been given to the effect on the mental health of the employees # what support will be available and what budget will it come from How can the expenditure of a quarter of a million pounds be justied when the council is struggling for money and how long will it take to save this amount compared with the partial funding for Kintyre Recycling Limited It is shameful that only two of our local councillors are against vulnerable people being thrown on the scrap-heap when all three should be supporting their constituents.I am pleased to support the new business group set up to campaign for a quick and permanent solution for the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A.It’s now seven months since the landslide closed the A last summer. That should have been a wake-up call for the SNP Government, but all we#ve had since then is a failed attempt to protect the Old Military Road from landslides and talk of taking  years to solve the problem.This is just not good enough. We need urgent action now.Last week#s Courier letters page didn#t offer much hope. The SNP only wrote about independence, not the real issues facing us, such as the Rest and Be Thankful.The SNP Government should be concentrating on fixing the Rest and Be Thankful and recovering from the Covid pandemic, not spending its time plotting about independence.This Mother#s Day, school feeding charity Mary#s Meals would like to pay tribute to incredible women around the world.From the mums in the UK whose food has nourished us throughout our childhoods, including those who volunteer and fundraise for Mary#s Meals, to the women who cook and serve our daily meals for children in some of the world#s poorest countries, we celebrate them all.Mary#s Meals feeds more than . million hungry children in  countries every school day.That#s why I am asking your readers to send a Mary#s Meals gt card to the special women in their lives this Mother#s Day.

This will include improved stroke care bundle figures, improved stroke prevention measures, a national thrombectomy service and stroke-specic, person-centred rehabilitation.The charity is pleased that people affected by stroke will be included in the development of this work.A draft paper will be with the Scottish Government in the next few weeks. Whatever the outcome of May#s election, the Stroke Association in Scotland expects the next government to push this work on, and for a new, improved, progressive stroke service to be implemented."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week march 12 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

That is a tough place to be in.The first occasion, He told them to go out again into deeper water , on the second occasion,it was to cast the net on the right side of the boat. In both accounts, these fishermen caught so many fish the nets were at breaking point.Oh, that it could always be as straightforward as that!Right now, fishermen and their families are facing such a dficult time and feeling that their voices are not being heard. These Bible stories remind us that their need and cry is heard by Jesus, the one who chose fishermen as His companions whilst on earth.We too must not forget them and this important industry in our west coast communities. I hope you will join me in praying for them, not only for their daily safety but also for provision and wisdom.In these stories, there is a lesson for us all to think about. What obstacle do you face this week that could be overcome by changing our actions or by thinking dferently  We resist change particularly when something has worked for us in the past, but sometimes we need a dferent approach.Sometimes, like the disciples, we too can find that calling on Jesus gets us through."},{"url":null,"title":"council leader defends recycling decision","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

In rural areas, this is likely to result in considerable additional costs, accompanied by very stringent targets to meet.#All of this means we have to find ways of providing these services in as sustainable a way as possible.#It is vital to address that as soon as possible – we have no choice but to comply with the requirements of that new legislation when it comes into force. Similarly, any other organisation responsible for the delivery of recycling services would also have to bear these additional pressures and signicant costs which could potentially be prohibitive for smaller organisations.#That is the context of this particularly challenging decision, and it is a context which councillors absolutely had to bear in mind when considering the future delivery of recycling services in Kintyre.#Therefore we took the decision to agree a six-month extension to KRL#s contract, to work towards the longer-term sustainable delivery of recycling services for households in Kintyre, but also to give time to work with KRL in relation to the scope for transfer of their employees when the service is brought in-house.#Our officers made contact with KRL as soon as they possibly could following the budget to put those discussions and arrangements in motion. Every effort will be made to mitigate the impact of the decision to transfer the service back to the council.#Kintyre and the Islands# third councillor, Anne Horn, who voted against the decision, said: #When council officers suggested bringing recycling in-house on Islay it proved much more dficult than envisaged and over the anticipated budget. This is another reason I objected as the precedent proved to be a cost burden rather than the proposed saving.#The employees from KRL are inspirational in their attitude to their job and want only to work to the best of their ability.#There must be some replacement for the support the employees have while at the workplace and this will reflect on resources from the Health and Social Care Partnership.#Only time will tellthe potential savings materialise over future years and, for me, this is such a huge uncertainty I could not support this proposal.#"},{"url":null,"title":"creative youngsters invited to showcase visual artwork","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

As many examples as possible will then also be published in the Campbeltown Courier, Argyllshire Advertiser and Oban Times newspapers.The artwork, which must be created specically for this showcase, can be on any surface # as long as it can be photographed and submitted # but it is limited to one image per person. It is not a competition and none of artwork will be judged.Gigha-based youth work facilitator Kenny Wilson, one of the project#s organisers, explained: #As youth workers, we kept hearing the same phrases from young people, phrases like #My bedroom has become my classroom# and #I feel like the walls are closing in on me#. Young people were asking questions like #Where can we go # Nowhere. #Who we can meet # No-one. #What are we allowed to do # During lockdown, very little at all.#The idea is to give artistic young people something to do that#s not prescribed by the Curriculum for Excellence [Scotland#s education framework] or by the government to give them the freedom to choose what they want to do, to design whatever they want to design.#The reward will be seeing their artwork published online and in the newspapers. The purpose of the whole thing is to increase the wellbeing of young people, to give them a boost # it#s as simple as that.#He added: #It could well be that something catches the eye of someone in the wider artistic community and they could be put in touch with the young creator of the piece in question # but that would have to be arranged through the youth workers, subject to careful child protection measures, and with parents# consent.#Kenny explained that safeguarding is an essential part of all that youth workers do and, as such, the organisers have created a GDPR statement which reads: #We will ensure that all personal data that we collect will only be held until all the images have been showcased, and will be processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner and only collected for the legitimate purposes of the showcase, and will never be passed on to any other organisation or third party without your explicit permission.#Those who would like to register an interest in taking part, can email ayelovetomake@gmail providing their first name and location. They are not required to submit their surname, full address or age, as long as they are within the  to  age range.When the project officially launches on Friday March , they can then send photographs of their artwork to the same email address so it can be uploaded to the project#s Instagram account, where it will be made visible to the public after the Sunday April  closing date.Kenny added: #If you are a young person with a desire to create, then go for it!#"},{"url":null,"title":"district news march 19 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

While he was gutting and cleaning a large cod at sea, something fell onto the deck.When the deck was cleared and washed down, Mr Colville examined his find# the honeycomb from a bee#s hive!How on earth it ever managed to find its way to the murky depths and into a cod#s stomach we will never discover.It is just #one of those things#.Councillors call for removal of #eyesore#Campbeltown councillors are up in arms about a #rusting eyesore# which is lying on the shores of Campbeltown Loch.The ex-Admiralty tug Empire Ace ran aground at Southend nearly two years ago and was towed to the loch, where it was beached. It has lain at the Rocky Burn area ever since.The vessel caused a row between the Town Council and the firm who owned it, George Hood and Company of Helensburgh.At a meeting last September, it was suggested that the firm be charged dues.Councillor Harry Moffat was quoted as saying: #If people are allowed to dump boats in the loch, I can go and dump a car and nobody can do anything about it.#The council discussed the question of taking legal action against the firm. A considerable number of people have since remarked on the unsightliness of the vessel, which has started to rust.Fishermen ing from the grounds were using the Empire Ace as a mooring stage while they cleaned and washed their catches.But a spokesman for the Helensburgh firm said that it had sold the vessel some months ago. The spokesman refused to reveal the identity of the buyers, but after inquiries, we ascertained that it was purchased by McFadyen’s, the local contracting firm.A spokesman for Archibald McFadyen and Sons said that the Empire Ace was purchased by the firm about two weeks ago.He added that breaking up work was to start on the vessel #within the next few days#.Tobacco firm expands furtherThe well-known Campbeltown firm of Richard Daniels Ltd, tobacco wholesalers and distributors, has opened a depot in Peebles, to meet an increased demand from customers on the east coast.The firm, whose custom stretches from Aberdeen to Middlesborough in England, has just been awarded a #very large# contract from a brewing firm to supply its retail outlet # public houses.Askedthe Peebles opening would create redundancies locally, Mr James Daniels told the Courier that staff in Campbeltown would be unaffected.#It is merely a new phase being added to the business,# he said.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOCastlehill Church Sunday SchoolThe children of the Kinloch Church Sunday School had a highly enjoyable social evening on Friday last.

I care about mankind in general and the plight of its citizens, particularly where there is a prevalence of political ineptitude affecting their lives.To reiterate, the EU purchasing system regarding vaccines was and still is chaotic, with the bureaucratic executive in Brussels initially lashing out, and currently certain members within the group are endeavouring to purchase supplies of vaccines for their citizens.In addition, we now have a ban by some countries of vaccine exports from EU manufacturers to non-EU countries. An action which has angered the World Health Organization and upset Australia and other countries.Regarding the comment that the vaccine success is an illusion, perhaps the perusal of some scientic pronouncements in relation to the efficacy would be appropriate.To accuse me of crowing is not only resented but additionally hurtful. I have an extended family in France.My daughter is married to a now retired French army captain and she is an environmental scientist and director of a laboratory in the IRD , a French public research institution. While her mother-in-law has had her first vaccination and in the last week so has her husband, she does not know when she will get an appointment.Currently, in certain areas of France, the virus is very active and part of her remit involves travel to some of these hot-spots when working from home is not practicable. A situation which is very concerning to me.I also do not know when I will be permitted to see them, either in France or in Scotland.Crowing, indeed, I think not.Amidst the miscellany of economic disaster claims awaiting an independent Scotland thrown up by Michael McGeachy in last week#s Courier, I am gratied that Mr McGeachy does, at the very least, accept that Scotland has no debt at the point of independence. This is progress.Unfortunately, Mr McGeachy then goes on to hold up Scotland#s putative deficit as an ace card in the unionist case to #prove# that Scotland is an economic basket-case surviving on English largesse. In reality, it demonstrates the opposite.Scotland#s #deficit#, created within the UK, with our overall budget set by another government # that#s  per cent of Scotland#s revenues and  per cent of our spending # is a damning indictment of Westminster#s reckless economic vandalism. It is the cost of Westminster Tory rule and the union#s failure.Indeed,being part of the UK was such an advantage, Scotland would have a stronger economy than our northern independent competitors.That they are all considerably more successful, with fewer economic resources than Scotland, makes the case for Scotland to have control of all the sovereign economic levers required to succeed in the global economy.Mr McGeachy concludes with the familiar splenetic, #you had your referendum# in . In this time we have had three Prime Ministers, two Westminster elections and one Holyrood election, not forgetting England#s Brexit imposed upon Scotland.Democracy is not pick and mix, Mr McGeachy. The #Better Together# parties can huff and puff about #taking back control# to London, but Scotland is not their possession.We still live in a free country andScots vote this May for an SNP government focused on Scottish priorities, including the right to ensure that Scotland#s future is Scotland#s choice, not Boris Johnson#s, democracy, as we saw with the election of President Biden, will prevail.The fact that the SNP has produced a new digital strategy document will come as little consolation to residents of the Highlands and Islands, who would struggle to download it eventhey wanted to.The SNP has left the Highlands and Islands in the digital dark ages.The  SNP manesto committed to deliver superfast broadbandto every home and business by . This has comprehensively failed, with ministers refusing to discuss completion dates. A December  report logged an average download speed of .Mbps in Glen Shiel. That is  times slower than Scotland’s fastest street.The pandemic has exposed the glaring digital ide that exists between rural and urban parts of Scotland.Scottish Liberal Democrats want our remote and rural communities to be great places to live, work and study.That#s why we are setting out new proposals to put power in the hands of local community managers and prioritise investment in catch-up zones to ensure that everyone has access to the digital services they need to prosper.Cancer continues to claim lives regardless of the pandemic.As resources within the NHS are stretched to their limits, charities like Target Oian Cancer need your help more than ever before. Please help us raise awareness and raise funds. Whilst we are all fighting coronavirus, Target Oian Cancer is putting the needs of women with oian cancer before all .In , my mother, the actress Marjie Lawrence, was diagnosed with oian cancer just three weeks before she died.Had we and her doctors been aware of the symptoms, Marjie might be alive today.

But two thirds of women are diagnosed late, when the cancer is harder to treat.This March, for Oian Cancer Awareness Month, I#m writing to ask your readers to take just two minutes of their time to learn the symptoms and spread the word to their families and friends.The main symptoms of oian cancer are: persistent bloating, feeling full or having dficulty eating, tummy pain, and needing to wee more often or more urgently.If you believe in a future where every woman diagnosed with oian cancer has the best chance of survival, please show your support and visit www.targetoiancancer.org.uk March"},{"url":null,"title":"one year on from first covid 19 lockdown","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

His aunt would have surely pointed it out to him. Then he read the information board and realised it was a recent reconstruction. The name of the nearby cafe now made sense to him.On the path that followed the old railway line, Finn stopped. There it was, hersquod found it: the oak tree. It still looked young, standing guard over the pebbly beach with multiple spreading branches and the magisterial presence Finn remembered.His daughter headed immediately to the waterrsquos edge. It was a much busier place now, with frequent walkers on the nearby path.There was a suspension footbridge spanning the river which Finn couldnrsquot recall. A couple walking by paused for a moment but didnrsquot come to the beach. Perhaps social distancing had some benefits, thought Finn.While his daughter played, he tried to identy the spot he had spent that first night of storytelling with his aunt.ldquoHere, right here, he whispered to himself.Time and space fused together as he imagined going back to the past to explain to his -year-old self what that evening of tales around the fire had really meant.But he would not have been able to listen, not even to his older self. His world then was a broken mirror with vital pieces missing in which he could see only part of himself those pieces lost to him forever. Guilt and anger clawed at Finnrsquos gut, rousing his depression from its slumber.He felt the dark creature trying to pull him down, pain taking over. No, not now, he thought, not in the presence of his daughter.He would not submit to it, refused to feed it with more ruminations.He wonderedhe should have taken Eilidh on this pilgrimage of healing. But yes, her presence with him, and his love for her, was the light in his soul that kept the dark creature at bay.He would be present for her and walk with her to the summit of the faerie hill. She wanted to leave the faeries a gt and a wish. Finn did too.ldquoYou ready for that walk up the faerie hill  he called out to his daughter. She nodded excitedly with a joyful smile.September Finnrsquos phone call to his mum before they left Strathyre suggested he was coping with the temporary separation. He hadnrsquot wanted to climb the faerie hill, but Izzy hoped hersquod be up for a walk up to the rock of the boar when they got to Balquhidder.It was still early morning as they crossed the old Stron Bridge and a stunning view of Loch Voil greeted them.Mist spiralled from the water and swirled around the trees on the steep braes either side. But it was already warm, with more blue sky than grey above the mist. It was set to be one of those glorious September sunny days, the kind you appreciate all the more because you know it may be the last for a long time. They stood awhile watching the mist play above the loch, as the mountains slowly revealed themselves. The Highlands wake slowly in the morning.Izzyrsquos soul tingled as she soaked in the beauty of the moment and breathed in the sweet air.ldquoCan you smell that Finn, the scent of the Highlands  she said.Finn raised his head and snfed: ldquoSmells like cow dung.He was right, it did now. A waft of it came from a nearby field where cattle grazed. Izzy laughed.ldquoAye, well, thatrsquos the historic smell of the Highlands too!She led Finn back to the old bridge they had just driven over. Its three arches spanned the river with historic elegance.They sat on the walls looking down at the water and Izzy took it as an opportunity to tell Finn about the drovers, how in days of old they would come this way, driving hundreds of cows to markets in the south, crossing rivers and traversing through glens.Theyrsquod often sleep outside with the cattle, or sometimes in droversrsquo inns. They were the cowboys of the old Highlands, who knew the land and the dferent hazards of each route, but didnrsquot wear Stetsons of course, and rarely had a horse.She pointed towards the hills to the north: ldquoOver there was a droversrsquo route, bringing the cattle this way. The drovers could veer round and steer the cattle east of the river, but with this bridge theyrsquod have been able to cross here, then again at Strathyre downriver. There were lots of dferent ways, and the drovers had detailed maps inside their heads drawn by experience. Cattle were so valuable they would often be lted by one clan from another.Finn looked bemused.ldquoLted  Like carried on their shoulders  Izzy burst out laughing at the image and Finn looked hurt.ldquoAw, sorry Finn, I wasnrsquot laughing at you, I was laughing at the image you painted in my imagination. Lted means, well, stolen. But people called it lting because it was seen as a tradition rather than a crime. At least by those doing the lting!Finn looked around, still feeling a bit raw by his auntrsquos reaction to his question.ldquoI havenrsquot watched TV for a whole day now, he said, realising hersquod missed his breakfast TV programme. He picked up a pebble and dropped it into the water below, then watched the circles expand.ldquoWhere we going today  he asked.ldquoWell, letrsquos see how far we get, but right now we are heading for Balquhidder Kirk!ldquoWhere the minister who wrote the book on faeries was ldquoAye, but there is much more to its story.Izzy took her rucksack from the roof box.ldquoSo we are walking there ldquoYep, itrsquos really not far, his aunt replied.But Finn was wary. Her rucksack seemed suspiciously full for a short walk.They set off along the quiet single track road. The air buzzed with le and mooing from the cattle had replaced the sound of traffic. Soon they had crossed a small old bridge and were heading into a wood. They were at the base of Kirton Glen and the sound of a waterfall touched Finnrsquos senses.Izzy paused only briefly at the falls but Finn wanted to linger.ldquoWersquoll come back this way, and then we can spend some time here, she said.She pointed ahead of her: ldquoJust there, through the trees, is where we are headed. I always think this is the best way to approach this ancient place to emerge from a wood after being doused with the sound of running water, rather than just arrive from a car park and... well, yoursquoll see.The path opened up onto a gravel drive and a Victorian church. He followed Izzy round the corner of the church and found himself standing on the edge of an ancient graveyard.Old gravestones littered the ground, which was uneven. A gravestone in the form of an ancient Celtic cross stood out against the blue sky.Generation upon generation lay beneath his feet. The graves surrounded the ruins of a th-century kirk. The historic site was framed by distant mountains. His aunt was right about the approach Finn felt like Indiana Jones emerging from the jungle to discover a long-lost ruined temple.Izzy led Finn carefully past the graves and into the ruins, then through the open doorway of the old kirk. Before them were three old recumbent gravestones lying side by side, surrounded by a low metal railing.A modern-looking gravestone above the graves had an inscription: ldquoMacGregor Despite them.Finn read the smaller inscriptions. They told that these were the graves of Rob Roy, his we and two of his sons. Someone had laid flowers at the foot of the graves.ldquoHe was a legendary outlaw, explained Izzy, ldquoa member of the MacGregor clan, who were hunted like the wolf.ldquoWhy ldquoThe whole clan was outlawed, which is why there is that inscription, which means despite their persecution they survived. Rob Roy lived part of his le as a hunted man, some say he was the enemy of the rich and a defender of the poor. Irsquove heard him called Scotlandrsquos Robin Hood.ldquoSo he was a hero.ldquoWell, he is to some. But to others he was a villain, a thief and a nasty killer.ldquoWhich is true, was he a goodie or a baddie ldquoPerhaps a bit of both, depending on who you are and what you believe.ldquoWhat do you believe aunty  asked Finn. Izzy pursed her lips in thought.ldquoWell, I love the romantic stories about him, like how he gave the minister here a sheep and cow each year infor him not increasing his fees to the local people.ldquo The fact the animals were probably lted didnrsquot seem to bother the minister. People want these stories to be true because we want our heroes to be always heroic and good, and not disappoint us. But other stories show him in a very ugly light.ldquo I want him to be a hero, said Finn, ldquobut now I donrsquot know what to believe.ldquoPerhaps we can admit to ourselves that even our heroes arenrsquot always perfect and have flaws, and so sometimes they do the wrong things.Finn shrugged his shoulders: ldquoWhatrsquos flaws ldquoErm, an imperfection, or fault.Finn looked down and scuffed the ground with his boots. Izzy knew this was a challenge to how he saw the world.ldquoI want to show you something , she said.She led him to the edge of the graveyard, then pointed up at a rocky ridge which emerged from a wood on a steep brae above them.ldquoCan you see, up there, the clf face with the ledge above  Thatrsquos called Creag an Tuirc, which means the rock of the boar. It looks out over the glen and was the clan rallying point for the MacLarens who lived here. Itrsquos a special place, Irsquom hoping you will chum me up to it. I have snacks we can have when we get there.Finn looked unsure. It seemed a steep uphill walk.ldquoItrsquos a place that knows the secrets of this glen because itrsquos quietly seen everything.ldquoSecrets ldquoAye, like the mystery of Rob Royrsquos grave, and what really happened when those Buchanan clansmen arrived here looking for a fight.ldquoWhat mystery Izzy just gave Finn a teasing smile.ldquoAnd it gives you amazing views. she added.ldquoAs good as from that Celtic fort and the giantrsquos stone yesterday  asked Finn, who was wavering.ldquoIrsquod say even better.Finn ed her smile with a cheeky one: ldquoCan I have a snack now to give me energy Izzy chuckled: ldquoSure!She put her rucksack down, and took out a chocolate bar: ldquoHow about this Izzy pulled on her rucksack and started to walk out the graveyard.

MSPs wanted to know when the Scottish Government was advised it would likely lose the challenge raised by Mr Salmond, but ministers said handing over the advice would breach the ministerial code.On two occasions, MSPs voted for the evidence to be released, with a deal eventually being struck in December to reveal the advice only to MSPs on the committee.Following a vote of no confidence threat in the Deputy First Minister, the Scottish Government released ldquokey legal advice, but the Scottish Tories were not satisfied and continued in their bid to oust John Swinney, which ultimately failed.Mr Salmond and Ms Sturgeon separately sat for mammoth sessions in front of the committee, taking questions from MSPs over several hours.Didnrsquot Mr Salmond face trial on sexual misconduct charges Yes. The former first minister was cleared of  charges at the High Court in Edinburgh in March last year after being arrested in January .What were the issues with Mr Salmondrsquos evidence to the committee Mr Salmond and the committee have been caught in repeated legal wrangles over evidence published by the inquiry.Last month, the former first minister said he would not appear before the committee after it decided not to publish his submission to a separate investigation into whether Ms Sturgeon breached the ministerial code over fears it may identy some of the complainers in Mr Salmondrsquos criminal trial last year.However, an alteration made to a court order by Judge Lady Dorrian meant the evidence could potentially be made public.While the committee voted against publication, the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Bodymade the decision to publish anyway.The evidence was online for less than  hours before the Crown Office raised concerns with Holyrood about it, asking for redactions to be made.In his submission, the former first minister accused some in the Scottish Government and SNP of a ldquomalicious and concerted attempt to damage my reputation and remove me from public le in Scotland.But Ms Sturgeon said her predecessor did not have ldquoa shred of evidence to support his claims.The submission was later re-released, with a number of paragraphs relating to the set-up of a meeting between Mr Salmond and his successor redacted.Is the committee inquiry the only investigation into the matter No. Ms Sturgeon is currently under investigation by James Hamilton QC to establishshe breached the ministerial code.Ms Sturgeon referred herself after being accused of misleading Parliament over when she knew of the complaints against Mr Salmond.She previously said she had been told about the allegations by Mr Salmond himself during a meeting in her home on April , .However, it was later found that Mr Salmondrsquos former chief of staff Geoff Aberdein had met with the First Minister in her Holyrood office four days prior to that, where she was told of the complaints.Scotlandrsquos first minister @NicolaSturgeon responds to @SkyNews exclusive the harassment committee has ruled she misled Parliament in her evidence.ldquoThe opposition members of this committee made their minds up about me before I uttered a single word of evidence. pic UNeUJsWhat has the committee concluded A leak on Thursday evening from inside the committee revealed it has concluded the First Minister misled the inquiry over whether she had offered to intervene in the case ndash which Ms Sturgeon denies doing.Two other witnesses, one of whom is Mr Salmondrsquos lawyer and former SNP MSP Duncan Hamilton and who was at the meeting in question, contradicted the First Ministerrsquos statement.The conclusion was arrived at following a - party line vote, with the four SNP members of the committee, including convener Linda Fabiani, supporting the First Ministerrsquos assertion.What happens next The decision is likely to increase pressure on Ms Sturgeon to stand down before Mayrsquos election, although it is unclear whether the act was deemed a resignation-worthy offence.Last night, Scottish Conservatives leader Douglas Ross called for her to quit.He said: ldquoThe committee will publish its findings in the coming days and we will wait for that report.ldquoBut we have already detailed that Nicola Sturgeon lied to the Scottish Parliament and for that, she must resign. All wersquore waiting for is confirmation.Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said: ldquoI am not going to prejudge the outcome of the committee report and we await its findings, butit does conclude that the First Minister has misled Parliament and potentially breached the ministerial code then that is incredibly serious.A Scottish Parliament spokesperson said: \"Further to media reports on the Committeersquos findings, the Committee is still finalising its report. There will be no further comment on the report ahead of its publication.It is expected to be published on Tuesday.What has Nicola Sturgeon said Nicola Sturgeon has said a ldquovery partisan leak from the Alex Salmond inquiry is ldquonot that surprising as the committee is understood to have deemed she misled parliament.She told Sky News last night: ldquoI stand by all of the evidence I gave to the committee, all eight hoursrsquo worth of evidence.ldquoWhatrsquos been clear is that opposition members of this committee made their minds up about me before I muttered a single word of evidence, their public comments have made that clear.ldquoSo this leak from the committee ndash very partisan leak ndash tonight before theyrsquove finalised the report is not that surprising.She added that she is awaiting the result of the James Hamilton QC investigation into whether she broke the ministerial code.A spokesman for the First Minister previously added: ldquoThe First Minister told the truth to the committee in eight hours of evidence, and stands by that evidence.ldquoIt is clear from past public statements that opposition members of this committee had prejudged the First Minister at the outset of the inquiry and before hearing a word of her evidence, so this partisan and selective briefing ndash before the committee has actually published its final report ndash is hardly surprising.ldquoThe question of the First Ministerrsquos adherence to the ministerial code is being considered independently by James Hamilton, and we expect to receive and publish his report soon."},{"url":null,"title":"musselburgh-sea-cadets-virtual-walk-london-back","story":"Along with family members, they are logging their steps or kilometres, completed daily during March, via an online tracker which calculates the distance walked for each day.They had originally planned to walk km, from Musselburgh to London, but smashed their target distance and started thejourney back to the Honest Toun ndash a total of ,km.They have already raised nearly pound,.Chief Officer Mark Tfin , from Gorebridge, is supporting the unit ndash TS Indefatigable ndash by taking part in the virtual sponsored walk while on his Maersk Line Hamburg Sud ship off Chinarsquos coast, covering more than km.Funds raised will be used to provide training when the cadetsto their newly refurbished unit building on South Street after Covid- restrictions are eased.The property has undergone a full upgrade costing pound, to include new toilet and shower facilities, offices and classroom space.

That problem continues to pose concerns, not least over whether the sizeable gatherings outside Ibrox and in Glasgowrsquos George Square might be repeated, perhaps at the upcoming Old Firm match.I watched Celtic draw with Dundee United last weekend, a result which guaranteed the Premiership for Rangers. Football fans will perhaps understand that my first thought was that my team, United, now had virtually no chance of securing a top six place in the league, and thus avoiding a possible relegation battle. BRIAN TAYLOR:This is not a civil war in the SNP. This is more vicious and more visceralHowever, the wider consequences soon emerged as Rangers fans mustered to celebrate their teamrsquos success, in clear breach of rules prohibiting mass gatherings.Condemnation was swt from the First Minister, Opposition leaders and the police. While praising Rangersrsquo sporting achievement, they declared that the supportersrsquo actions were unacceptable and dangerous. They reminded us bluntly that closely packed crowds had the potential to spread disease and even death.Let us be clear. Parliament has the democratic power to prescribe rules. Within those rules, the police have a duty to proscribe behaviour which threatens the peace and, in this case, the health of citizens. Law and order must be maintained.The question is how. What is the truly effective way to prevent repetition  To do that, we need to understand the motivations underlying the behaviour we all witnessed.Otherwise, we risk making matters worse, we risk reinforcing a negative stereotype. To say this is in no way ndash I stress, in no way whatsoever ndash to condone the behaviour on display. It was dangerous and, potentially, deadly.Nicola Sturgeon has warned the Old FirmFirstly, I would broadly exculpate the police. You will hear it said either that they over-reacted or that they should have made far more arrests.The police did not create the situation. The fans gathered instinctively, emotively, no doubt prompted by social media. The police had to deal with events as they found them.An over-zealous response would have risked provoking the crowd, amplying the challenge to public order. Precisely the opposite of what the police were seeking to achieve.Secondly, consider the intrinsic nature of football support. We are dealing here with fans, or fanatics. For many, their le is defined by their vigorous adherence to their team. They exult in victory, they despair at defeat.This particular triumph for Rangers followed a decade without winning the league title a decade in which they had to rise from the lowest rank in Scottish football. In winning, they thwarted their greatest rivals.More generally, many fans regard their support for their team in an antithetical fashion to rival clubs, or even to society more generally. It is no accident that many supporters sing ldquonobody likes us, we donrsquot care. Their contrived self-image is as a beleaguered tribe, standing together against an external foe or an uncaring world.That is true of the most fervent of fans generally but it is particularly true of the Old Firm. Their adherents will often define themselves in contradistinction to the other side. Which can present a challenge for neutral observers or, indeed, for politicians seeking to intervene.Grimacing wryly, Nicola Sturgeon told MSPs this week that half of Glasgow presumed she was partisan for one side of the Old Firm while the other half presumed exactly the contrary. She was, she stressed, unconcerned about the colour of the shirt.It was also notable in Rangersrsquo official statement that they immediately drew attention to what they regarded as ldquoan unbalanced approach adopted towards their half of the Old Firm.In that same statement, Rangers insisted they had taken every step to pre-empt and deter such behaviour. It might be pertinent to note here that broader support for that analysis is distinctly limited. Further, eventhey were doing all they could, then those efforts demonstrably failed.Crucially, however, Rangers supporters will agree with their club. They will discern bias against them which others do not spot. Such a standpoint is not entirely unknown on the other side of the Glasgow sporting ide, nor indeed in football more generally. They are not known as fans for nothing. Once again, that does not remotely exonerate the behaviour we witnessed.However, it is also the case that there are many Rangers fans who will regret the scenes witnessed, who will seek to dispel any bad odour lingering around their clubrsquos remarkable success. As The Herald reported, supportersrsquo groups have raised thousands of pounds to repair damaged benches in George Square.Equally, though, those of us who are football fans need to reflect that many, perhaps most, people in Scotland are not. BRIAN TAYLOR:Sturgeonrsquos inquiry performance was thorough, respectful, controlled and capableRemember Brenda from Bristol  On being told that a further General Election was pending, she replied: ldquoYoursquore joking! What, another one !Translate that from Brendarsquos broad Bristol accent into Scots, and you have it pat. For many in Scotland, their reaction to another controversy in football is ennui. They find it weary, stale and flat full of sound and fury and signying nothing.In that light, we now need action which will be effective, rather than simply voluble. Perhaps a promise of substantial celebrations deferred, linked to the warning that the Old Firm game may have to be cancelled. Perhaps a reminder of possible sanctions by the European football authority.It will not be sufficient for that message to be delivered solely by politicians. Still less, by the police. That will not work with the truly zealous.Football leaders must douse their instinctive indignation and urge compliance. Consistently and without equivocation. In tandem with politicians and the police. It may be exasperating that such effort is required but anything  risks further failure. Understand, then act.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Based on the best-selling novels by Diana Gabaldon, scenes were filmed at locations across Scotland, including Doune Castle , Blackness and Drumlanrig Castles, Newtonmore and Glen Coe in the Highlands. Gabaldon received an International Contribution to Scottish Tourism award at the Scottish Thistle awards, while VisitScotland published a paper describing the soaring numbers of Outlander ldquoset-jetters.The new tourist boom wasnt all due to Outlander . Lonely Planets Best Travel  ranked the Highlands and Islands ldquofth in the world, describing the region as ldquoone of the wildest, least inhabited, and most scenic parts of Europe, a judgement wrapped in ironies for students of Highland history. In  the launch of the North Coast  route saw the opening up of the northern Highlands to mass tourism, bringing economic benefits but also problems for residents, as single-track roads became jammed with campervans and tour buses. Visitor numbers to the Fairy Pools on the Isle of Skye doubled between  and : islanders complained of congested roads, as well as litter and human waste dumped on roadsides, partly due to lack of toilet facilities. It was reported that the proleration of Airbnb and rental cottages caused a hike in property prices, squeezing out locals.While the pandemichave put the brakes on international tourism, the easing of lockdown restrictions in the summer of  saw Scots from the Central Belt fleeing from months of urban confinement to beauty spots in the southern Highlands, while English tourists poured across the Border for Scottish ldquostaycations. In June  police had to close congested B-roads on Loch Lomond and Callander, while double yellow lines were painted on roads in the Trossachs and where to prevent parking on the verges.Yet this influx of visitors clogging up the Scottish roads infrastructure is not a modern day phenomenon as can be seen in Old Ways New Roads: Travels in Scotland -, a book I co-edited with John Bonehill and Anne Dulau Beveridge. The book accompanies a virtual exhibition hosted by The Hunterian at the University of Glasgow which opens later this spring, with a programme of public events and talks.Our title refers to a ldquotourist paradox whereby access to Scotlands ldquoold ways was only made possible by the th-century infrastructure of ldquonew roads, many constructed by the military to contain the Jacobite threat. Before then, intractable terrain, especially in the Highlands, had made many areas inaccessible and frustrated the movement of troops and supplies. The Welsh traveller Thomas Pennant claimed that Scotland had been previously ldquoas little known to its southern brethren as Kamtschatka: but once his own tours in  and  proved the country ldquomight be visited with safety ... it has ever since been [inundated] with southern visitors.Pennant was the first to describe tourists following two main itineraries, the ldquolong tour from Edinburgh to Inverness and down the Great Glen to Fort William, Skye and Mull, or  the ldquopetit tour, a fortnight circuit of the military roads through Perthshire and Argyll in a horse chaise. Highlights of the latter were the scenic, landscaped Breadalbane, Atholl and Argyll estates.As early as , Lord Breadalbane noticed that ldquoall the world is travelling to Scotland, and like other landowners weary of putting up fashionable visitors armed with letters of introduction, he opened an inn in the village of Kenmore as a base for visiting local attractions, such as the picturesque ldquoHermitage he had constructed overlooking nearby Acharn Falls.However the improvement of Highland roads and inns was only relative: in , an anonymous English tourist anticipated todayrsquos Tripadvisor phenomenon by complaining in his travel journal that Kenmore Inn was ldquodirty cold and damp and beds hard and uncomfortable, and that his party had arrived too late to view the scenery thanks to ldquothe bad state of the roads. Off the beaten track, it was even worse ndash in , the English Romantic poet John Keats had to live off eggs and whisky, sleeping in damp shepherds bothies, on his walking tour along Loch Awe and across Mull to Iona and Staffa.The closure of Europe during the war years of -, and the rise of a new British middle class, did much to stimulate ldquodomestic tourism in the Romantic period: intrepid women now joined men in exploring remoter parts of the country, keeping journals and sketchbooks, while celebrated artists like Turner and Alexander Nasmyth were among the many portraying its scenic splendours. Nonetheless, anticipating the age of Outlander, the Scottish tour was a profoundly literary phenomenon, as tourists sought out the settings of Scottish poet James Macphersons Ossian, the poems and songs of Robert Burns, or the romances of Sir Walter Scott. Landowners capitalised on such literary landscapes: in the early s, the Duke of Atholl rebranded his Dunkeld Hermitageas ldquoOssians Hall, and from his base on Ulva, Ranald Macdonald Steuart-Seton, ldquothe Laird of Staffa, supplemented his rentals by managing tourist access to Fingals Cave, the ldquojewel in the crown of the Highland tour. John Keats couldnt afford to take a boat from Oban to Staffa because the going price was an astronomical seven guineas. ldquoTis like paying d for an apple at the playhouse, he complained.Nowhere attracted tourists quite like the Trossachs, relatively accessible from Glasgow and Stirling. This was largely Scotts doing, having chosen the Trossachs as a setting for his  poem The Lady of the Lake.Scott himself first visited as a tourist, plundering the guidebooks consulted by his friends Dorothy and William Wordsworthin the poems notes. It sold , copies in the first year of publication, and, like Scotts later poems and novels, was rapidly adapted for popular theatre, opera, panoramic displays and even wallpaper designs. Seldom read today, the poem features a romance between the stag-hunter ldquoFitz-Jamesand the exiled Ellen Douglas , who dwelt on a romantic island still known as Ellens Isle on Loch Katrine.Scott gave a new resonance to Highland landscape in describing his heros view from the Trossachs: ldquoLoch Katrine lay beneath him rolld   In all herfar winding lay  With promontory, creek and bay,   And islands that, empurpled bright,  Floated amid the livelier light ...Just like Outlander ldquoset-jetters today, Scotts fans quickly made the Trossachs one of the most popular tourist sites in Europe. One female tourist estimated that more than  carriages had reached this ldquofar-famed spot in the summer of : no doubt many were parking on the verges. In  an angry Loch Lomond boatman was heard complaining that ldquoever since [Scott] wrote The Lady of the Lake ... everybody goes to that filthy hole Loch Catrine, than comes round by Luss, and I have only had two gentlemen to guide this blessed season ... The devil confound his ladies and his lakes, say I!An enterprising local farmer converted his dwelling into overnight accommodation for tourists, known as Ardcheanochrochan Inn: it was rebuilt in  as the baronial Trossachs Hotel by Lord Willoughby dEresby. Poet laureate Robert Southey, visiting in  with Thomas Telford, snidely observed that ldquo the owner of the house has a proper sense of his obligations, he will set up the sign of Walter Scotts head. But just five years later, the geologist John Macculloch complained that tourism was destroying Highland romance: ldquothe mystic portal has been thrown open, and the mob has rushed in, dispersing all these fairy visions ... barouches and gigs, cocknies and fishermen and poets, Glasgow weavers and travelling haberdashers, now swarm in every resting place.Scotts literary fame may have dipped, but his recently refurbished Abbotsford House in Melrose still makes a substantial contribution to Scottish tourism, although not on the scale of the National Trust for Scotlands Robert Burns Birthplace Museum at Alloway, Ayrshire: a  Government-commissioned report calculated Burnss annual value to the Scottish economy as around pound million, with an additional ldquobrand value at around pound million.ldquoSet-jetting has greatly boosted these traditional literary attractions, with overall tourist spending for  estimated at a staggering pound. billion. Old Ways New Roads demonstrates that the appeal of premier tourist sites like the Trossachs had as much to do with investment by canny landowners and local residents as with poetic genius. Theres a lesson here for Scottish tourism in the era of ldquostaycations and Outlander. Namely, the need for more investment in roads, parking and toilet facilities as well as accommodation and hospitality that create jobs in the underpopulated Highlands, without depriving locals of affordable homes, not to mention peace of mind.Nigel Leask is Regius Professor of English Language and Literature at the University of Glasgow and an expert on Romanticism, empire and travel writingOld Ways and New Roads: Travels in Scotland -, edited by John Bonehill, Anne Dulau Beveridge, and Nigel Leask is published by Birlinn, pound, and available from the publishers or http:university-of-glasgow.myshopy collections hunterian-exhibition-catalogues products old-ways-new-roadsIts linked to an upcoming online exhibition at the Hunterian museum, Glasgowhttp:gla.ac.uk hunterian visit exhibitions virtualexhibitions oldwaysnewroads"},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-icons-thought-scotland-without-redheads-enough-make-hair-curl","story":"Scotland is a country much associated with red hair, as is Ireland.

There are Melanesians with red hair. Jewish people have a reasonable incidence of red hair, and  per cent of their beards are ginger. Indeed, in medieval times, people with red hair were identied and persecuted as Jews by the highly questionable Spanish Inquisition.Red hair is multicultural. Even in England, ginger beards are common, often with head hair ostensibly a dferent colour. This is because the chin is further away than the top of the head from the Sun. Joke.Red hair is historical. It crops up all the time. Bacchus, the Roman god of bevvy, was depicted with red hair. It was the hair of the god. Redheads crop up frequently in Roman frescos. The Thracians were described, by the Greek poet Xenophanes, as having blue eyes and red hair.In that Iliad, the barnet of the aforementioned Achilles is most often translated as ldquoblond or ldquogolden but also sometimes ldquored or ldquotawny. In ancient Egypt, as well as the aforementioned Cleopatra , Ramesses II and the deity Set were said to have red hair.Closer to hame, the Roman historian Tacitus said: ldquoThe reddish hair and large limbs of the Caledonians proclaim a German origin. . Bear in mind, too, that you must take classical ethnography with a large vat of salt.Tacitus also described the Germans as having ldquofierce-looking blue eyes, reddish hair, and large bodies. As with the Caledonians, you have to ask: ldquoSurely, there were some wee sappy ones as well A fairly distinguished history, then. So why do redheads get it in the neck so much  If blond or blondeis so much admired, why is its close neighbour, ginger , so derided Well, it could just be the Scottish connection as wersquore the last people in the world at whom it is legitimate to laugh. Mean, unintelligible, ginger, yada-yada. But I suspect therersquos more to it than that.In medieval times, folk with red hair and green eyes were suspected of being witches, vampires or werewolves. Howling load of nonsense. In , the novelist Wilkie Collins noted ldquoa prejudice against red hair. In LM Montgomeryrsquos Anne of Green Gables, one character says of the redheaded heroine that ldquoher temper matches her hair.The fiery temper is a common stereotype. Mind you, studies claim redheads arenrsquot good with either heat or cold, which could make one pretty irritable.In the end, all prejudice on dumbo planet Earth comes down to folk being against anything dferent. Itrsquos the ultimate tribalism. In recent times, some redheads have tried getting ldquogingerism defined as a form of racism, though that hasnrsquot really taken off or been given official approval.Itrsquos true that people have been assaulted by nutters for having red hair. In , a ldquoKick a Ginger group was started on Facebook. In , Tesco produced a ridiculously cruel Christmas card that said: ldquoSanta loves all kids. Even the ginger ones. In , former Labour Equalities Minister Harriet Harman referred to Scottish Lib Dem Danny Alexander as a ldquoginger rodent. Singer Mick Hucknall says he repeatedly faced prejudice because of his hair colour and supports this being considered a racial-style crime.While itrsquos true that, by definition, redheads are a minority, Lord knows there are enough ldquoidentities on the go already. Is it a good idea to identy yourself primarily by your hair colour  ldquoHello, Irsquove got red hair.I get laughed at in the street for having a big red nose, but I donrsquot want ldquonasalism to be categorised as a hate crime, evenmy proboscis is part of my identity and I introduce myself at parties by saying: ldquoHello, Irsquove got a big red nose.Meantime, gingers have started fighting back by celebrating their beautul heids. Therersquos an annual Redhead Day in Holland, an Irish Redhead Convention, a redhead festival at the Gezer Kibbutz in Israel, and therersquos been a Ginger Pride march in Edinburgh.In , widely publicised research purported to show that both red and blonde hair would become extinct within  years. But this was a hoax based on wilful misinterpretation of genetic data.Again, in , it was claimed red hair in Scotland could die out as the country got sunnier with climate change. But does it work like that  Red hair entered the genes millennia ago, and therersquos a fair sprinkling of gingers in hot countries.For now, redheads ainrsquot going anywhere. And thank goodness. The thought of a Scotland without redheads is enough to make your hair curl."},{"url":null,"title":"covid-scotland-places-coronavirus-cases-week","story":"Scotlandhad , positive cases betweenMarch and March , which was .cases per , population and a test positivity rate of .%.These numbers are higherthan last week, in whichScotlandreported ,positive cases,.cases per , population, and a test positivity rate of .%.:Last weeks figuresFallinin Stirling had the most Covid cases inScotland, with  people testing positive from a population of ,.The council area with the most cases of Covid- is Glasgow City with positive cases, which works out at . per , people.However, the area with the most Covid cases per , population was East Renfrewshirewith ..Only the OrkneyIslandsin Scotlandhad zero cases of Covid- over this seven-day period."},{"url":null,"title":"kevin-mckenna-nicola-sturgeon-really-think-voters-stupid","story":"If these lead to applause followed by laughterthen you will carry the day.A trusty crowd-pleaser is any apercu that features the theme of ldquothe voters know best.

Even those with only a transitory interest in these high matters of state now also know that the initial investigation was botched by the sort of basic incompetence that would cost most of them their own jobs.And while they may not have initially known why this has cost them poundk they now know it was because the government chose to ignore all independent legal advice entreating them to desist.

I make two points from this: first, like myself, Mr Cowe appears to be beyond middle age but unfortunately his powers of recollection are decidedly rose-tinted as I will demonstrate below, and secondly, in an independent Scotland he will be able to vote for a party of his own choice and get the government Scotland chooses ndash a new democratic experience for all of us.It is here I must apologise, for there is simply insufficient space to record the peace-loving harmonious existence of the people living in the homogenous United Kingdom of Mr Cowersquos memory. From  onwards we have had many protests, some very violent ndash CND, the Winter of Discontent, the minersrsquo strike, Greenham Common, Toxteth riots, dockers strikes, London riots with civil unrest, Northern Ireland troubles, fuel protests, the poll tax, anti-Iraq War demonstrations and so on. What is it Mr Cowe yearns for Some would of course wish to argue that the Scottish independence referendum of  was a nasty, violent affair but the bald fact is, one politician got hit by a single egg much to the chagrin of Better Together, who likened it to something altogether more unpleasant, although no one was injured and no one died in the entire two-year violence-free campaign.Clearly a British nationalist and nothing wrong with that, Mr Cowe and his fellow nationalists are quite withering about Scotland, yet seldom stop to think that in accusing others of xenophobia, the removal of the UK from the EU is in itself an act of narrow-minded isolationism. Loosely quoting from the Queenrsquos comments at Balmoral during the  campaign, Mr Cowe concludes: ldquoVoters need to think very carefully where to put the X in May and I could not agree more.

Only recently, however, have signicant studies been published and the results have been mixed. Last week it was announced that two, still to be peer-reviewed papers had reached the conclusion that evidence for a direct link between vitamin D deficiency and Covid- outcomes was lacking.However, the pandemic is not the only reason to start popping your vitamin D pills. Apart from anything , therersquos the fact that here in Scotland, where sunlight hours and intensity are relatively limited, many of us are vitamin D deficient. A clinical paper in the British Medical Journal revealed that more than  per cent of adults in Britain have vitamin D levels that are too low, with  per cent being severely deficient in winter. Such deficiency can lead to respiratory issues, numbness, muscle pain, joint pain, bone loss, depression and seasonal affective disorder.A clear link has been demonstrated between multiple sclerosis and lack of vitamin D. and studies show that the vitamin can reduce cancer cell growth and reduce inflammation.Government advice on vitamin D supplementation, given by the Chief Medical Officer in Scotland, is that for most people  micrograms a day is enough and is safe and that adults should avoid daily high dose vitamin D supplements containing more than  micrograms.: health enhancing walks you can do from any back door in ScotlandFeast on fibreThe debate rages on about whether fat or sugar and carbohydrates are our biggest dietary demons, but no-one argues against the idea that to enhance our health most of us should eat more fibre. A paper in the Lancet in  said that a series of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of trials and studies, conducted over nearly  years, reveal the health benefits of eating at least g to g or more of dietary fibre a day.People who eat higher levels of dietary fibre ndash found in vegetables and fruits and whole grains ndash have lower rates of non-communicable diseases than people who eat less.Increasing fibre intake has also been shown to be associated with lower bodyweight and cholesterol. In , the UK Scientic Advisory Committee on Nutrition recommended an increase in dietary fibre intake to g a day, but only % of UK adults manage to reach this target.Ditch the alarm clockItrsquos World Sleep Awareness month so there is no better time to start making sure that yoursquore getting the necessary shut-eye. Aside from following all the usual advice about establishing good and regular sleep routines, one tip you might like to follow is to ditch the alarm, whether itrsquos on your phone or bedside clock.Waking up with an alarm is known to deplete sleep, since yoursquore not getting what your body requires, but also means you wake up at the wrong point in your sleep cycle. Research done with medical students has shown that both irregular and reduced sleep time raises the likelihood of depression and low mood.Take a brisk strollAny kind of walk in the outdoors is good for you ndash whether a vigorous march or an amble.

One study found that fast-paced walking on a daily basis increased cancer survivorsrsquo chances of living longer.In a report analysing of a number of studies, researchers found that walking reduced the risk of cardiovascular events by %.

A study published last year, which looked at the hunter-gatherer Hadza people of Tanzania, found that, despite being effectively sedentary in such positions for almost ten hours a day, they lacked the usual markers for chronic disease associated with long periods of sitting.The lead author on the study, Dr David Raichlen of the University of Southern Calornia, said: ldquoEven though there were long periods of inactivity, one of the key dferences we noticed is that the Hadza are often resting in postures that require their muscles to maintain light levels of activity ndash either in a squat or kneeling.Connect habitsIf you want to make a change, or start a new habit, tag it onto a habit thatrsquos already part of your le. Dr Rangan Chaterjee said in one of his blogs: ldquoI get my own five-minute workout done when the kettlersquos on and my morning cup of tea is brewing.

What new habit could you piggyback onto something you always do without thinking about Eat less red meatIt has long been known that intake of red and processed meat heightens the risk of being diagnosed with bowel cancer. But it appears that the damage done by meat goes further. An Oxford University study published in recent weeks found that eating red meat, processed meat or poultry three or more times a week was associated with an increased risk of developing nine serious illnesses, including heart disease, diabetes and pneumonia.Lead author Dr Keren Papier said: ldquoWe have long known that unprocessed red meat and processed meat consumption is likely to be carcinogenic and this research is the first to assess the risk of  non-cancerous health conditions in relation to meat intake in one study.Dr Papier added, however, that people who cut down on meat need to be careful that they obtain enough iron through other dietary sources.Wine and cheeseWhen interviewed last month on her th birthday, Sister Andre, a French woman who is the oldest known person to survive Covid-, was asked for her longevity secrets. One of these was red wine ndash and she celebrated her birthday with a lunch that included ldquoroasted capon with mushrooms and sweet potatoes as a main course, followed by a two-cheese platter ndash Roquefort and goat cheese ndash and maybe a few glasses of red wine.Of course one womanrsquos longevity does not make for a health rule, and there is plenty of research that suggests most of us should cut back,but moderate wine consumption has been found toassociated with reduced risk of stroke and heart disease ndash and itrsquos known to protect against diabetes. A recent study in the Journal of Alzheimerrsquos Disease showed that regular moderate consumption of both wine and cheese is associated with greater cognitive acuity in later years.:Danusia Malina-Derbens Noise: a new manesto for motherhoodCut the processed foodOur Herald food columnist, Joanna Blythman, has long been an advocate for cooking from scratch and eliminating anything processed ndash any packaged food that contains a long list of ingredients. She is not alone. Doctor Rangan Chatterjee suggests we need to eat ldquomore real food. ldquoThis is one of the most powerful pieces of health advice I can give anyone, he has said. Meat that looks like meat and vegetables that look like vegetables are what he recommends. Two studies published by the British Medical Journal in  found positive associations between consumption of ldquoultra-processed foods and risk of cardiovascular disease and death. These would include ldquopackaged baked goods and snacks, fizzy drinks, sugary cereals, ready meals containing food additives, dehydrated vegetable soups, and reconstituted meat and fish products.Turn your housework into a work outA study of physical activity, which analysed data from , people across  countries and was published in  found that one in  deaths could be prevented with  minutes of physical activity five days a week. But it wasnrsquot all about going to the gym or taking up jogging - household chores such as vacuuming or scrubbing the floor were among the types of activity that provided enough exercise to protect the heart and extend le. Top household workout chores include mopping, gardening, kneading dough and doing your washing by hand.Two hours in the outdoors per weekAccording to one report, just being outdoors in nature for a two-hours a week is enough to signicantly boost health and wellbeing, evenyoursquore not doing anything you would rate as exercise ndash evenit feels like you are doing nothing at all! A study based around , people in England found that those who spent more time in nature were more likely to be satisfied with their lives and feel their health was good.An expanding body of research is showing how time spent in green places, forest bathing for instance, can enhance health and there are also the benefits of exposure to daylight ndash which is known to help prevent and reduce depression. Researchers have even noted a link between exposure to the sun and lower blood pressure levels.Drink teaConsider that good old-fashioned cuppa a dose of medicine. Whether itrsquos green tea, black tea, oolong, they all contain plant compounds called polyphenol, which are known to encourage the growth and activity of ldquofriendly lactobacillus bacteria in the gut. The antioxidants in tea also help lower blood pressure, by causing relaxation of the muscles that line blood vessels. And green tea has also been found to be good for so much more ndash inhibiting the formation of cancers and reducing the risk of heart disease.Drink a glass of water before every mealIn a  study, researchers from the University of Birmingham found that drinking ml of water at half an hour before eating main meals may help obese adults to lose weight. This is probably because the water gives a sense of fullness, so diners then tend to eat less. But also, the other positive of drinking water is that even mild dehydration can cause a drop in energy levels, and a regular glass is the best way to prevent that.Wean yourself off the digital and get back into the real worldThe last year has seen us plugged into the digital more than ever ndash almost whatever age we are ndash our posture impacted by months of craning over laptops and slumping with phones. That has now started to seem the norm, and, as we ease out of lockdown, one of the challenges will be to bring ourselves back out of the digital world, into the real world, for the sake of our health as much as anything . To start off your retreat from the digital, create no-phone zones, or periods in your le. The dinner table, for example, is a prime opportunity for families to agree to put phones away for at least  minutes and reconnect.Eat within the daylight hoursIntermittent fasting ndash popularised in diets like the : or ndash has long been a popular restriction regime for weight loss, but studies in humans, generally found that though it was safe and effective, it wasnt more so than other diets. However, in recent years, more research has been done into whether the timing of the fasting is key, andits a matter of eating and fasting more according to our circadian rhythms. A small scale study by researchers from the University of Alabama obese men with prediabetes, compared two groups, one which had their meals fit into an early eight-hour period of the day ,and another which had theirs spread over  hours . Neither regime had a huge impact on weight, but after five weeks, the eight-hours group had dramatically lower insulin levels and lower blood pressure.Meet up with a friendWe may not yet be able to meet up in large groups, but we can at least make a date with a friend or family member outdoors. Throughout the pandemic lockdowns some of the greatest challenges to our health have been the result of isolation. We humans need to socialise. Dozens of studies have shown that people who have social support from family, friends, and their community are happier, have fewer health problems, and live longer. Loneliness can be as bad for us as smoking up to  cigarettes a day. One study found that lack of strong relationships increased the rick of premature death from all causes by  percent.Escape the noiseA  report by the World Health Organisation noted that \"in western Europe alone at least . million healthy years of le are lost as a result of road traffic noise\". If you live in a city, or near an airport, motorway or building site chances are you are being exposed to some serious noise. Get away from it as much as you can, in a local park or other nature space, but also,noise-levels bother you, campaign for better noise policies and infrastructure planning.Dont worryThis may sound counter-intuitive and in contradiction to some of the other advice here ndash but actually stopping worrying about how fit you are could actually take you a step closer to better health. A study conducted by Hard University looked at two groups of hotel workers, one of which was told that their daily work fulfilled recommended exercise guidelines, and the other was not. The former group actually showed signicant health improvements, including a drop in systolic blood pressure and small weight loss. There are some benefits in simply believing yourself to be active enough. One large scale study in the United States examined data from , people and found that those \"who perceived themselves as less active than others were up to  percent more likely to die in the follow-up period [up to  years] than those who perceived themselves as more active\". It concluded that \"inidualsrsquo perceptions about their level of physical activity strongly predicted mortality, even after accounting for the effects of actual physical activity and other known determinants of mortality."},{"url":null,"title":"line-duty-series-six-episode-one","story":"BBC iPlayer****DEAD of night.

As a result, the tree is said to have been \"losing vigour and producing less and less fruit\".Moreover, as thousands of plants are currently being moved out of the Gardens glasshouses to allow a multimillion pounds renovation project to begin, the palm is too large to be removed in one piece and plans are now in place for the tree to be dismantled.However, it will leave an important legacy. The trunk and other parts will be used for educational purposes and seeds could even be planted in other collections as the Garden continues to play a vital role in global conservation.Meanwhile, visitors to the RBGE will be able to watch its progeny grow for another  years or more.Horticulturist Simon Allan, RBGEs palm expert, said: \"Our Sabal Bermudana has been in the collection since the late s so its been here a very long time.\"When it was transplanted from Leith Walk, it was moved down the road in a special carriage which had been constructed for moving trees in an upright position.\"At one point, it grew so tall they ran out of room and had to extend the roof with the dome, but it has reached the end of its natural le.\"The tree will be dismantled later this year ahead of construction work on the Edinburgh Biomes initiative designed to safeguard the global resource for future generations.Central to the initiative is the restoration of the Gardens three iconic public glasshouses, which is expected to take up to seven years.The roofs of the Victorian Temperate Palm House, Tropical Palm House and Modernist Front Range - comprising , panes spanning more than ,m - will be removed meaning thousands of plants must first be relocated to keep them alive.Mr Allan added: \"Once weve potted up and removed everything that we can we will take down the things that we cant transplant. The Saban Bermudana will be dismantled from the top down, but it will have a legacy. There are dozens of its own progeny all around the bottom.\"We also have seedlings and over the years they have been put aside and grown on so we already have some larger plants as well. Some will be moved to our nursery site so we can look after them and grow them on ready for replanting after the refurbishment.\"They take a very long time to get established. It could be decades before they even form a trunk and it could be  or  years before a new plant starts to bear fruit. We wont be around to see them mature but its a legacy - we feel a duty of responsibility to the plants and also to future generations.\"Fiona Inches, Glasshouse Manager, added: \"Sabal Bermudana is the oldest known plant in our Living Collections and, as far as I know, the oldest palm tree in Scotland. It was one of only two plants in our glasshouses that were brought from the Leith Walk site in .\"Every plant is being removed for the Biomes work but in the case of Sabal Bermudana, it is now reaching the end of its le.\"We will capture as much data as we can, and keep as much of the plant as possible for future generations to research.

Perhaps, more than any other manager, Moyes has benefited from their absence. At one time chucking away a three-goal lead, as his side did yesterday against Arsenal, would have had the boo-boys spitting out their larynxes, the ire would have spilled over to the next game and there would have been a predictable self-perpetuating run of defeats to follow. Instead, shorn of the London Stadiums poisonous atmosphere, West Ham boast the second best home record in the league this season.There was a bit more clarity over the identity of which team will suffer relegationIts fairly safe to assume that Sheffield United are gone, West Brom too, but Fulhams fate looks less well defined. Meanwhile, Newcastles abject defeat at the hands of Brighton on Saturday brought up their sixth successive game without a win under Steve Bruce and have won just twice since the turn of the year.That form would be risible enough in isolation but compounding fears that relegation is inevitable comes from a study of Newcastles opponents in their run in. Tottenham ndash admittedly with problems of their own ndash are up next but then comes a series of fixtures which will have Newcastle fans suffering heart palpitations. West Ham, Liverpool, Arsenal, Leicester and Manchester City are all on the calendar in the weeks.Should it come to pass this would be Newcastles third relegation under Mike Ashley. In , club revenue dropped by poundm, seven years later that figure had leapt to poundm ndash it promises to be higher this time arounds. They have bounced back before there seems much less likelihood of it happening a third time.Nothing stopping CityNo team has completed the domestic treble in England before. Manchester United managed to secure a famous hat-trick of trophies in  when they won the league title, FA Cup and Champions League but were knocked out of the League Cup by eventual winners Tottenham in the quarter-finals.Spurs finished mid-table that season attesting to just how dficult it is to fight on three fronts let alone four. Since then, of course, United have ceded their status as Englands dominant team to Manchester City.It would be another slap in the face for the Old Trafford club were their neighbours to become the first English club to not just equal their record of winning a treble but go one better by claiming the first ever quadruple. The Premier League is theirs, they face a mutinous Spurs in next months Carabao Cup final and were paired with a beatable Borussia Dortmund in Fridays Champions League draw.Chuck in a dogged - win over Everton on Saturday to reach the FA Cup semi-final and its definitely on.

He extolled the virtues of the tournament as the best in the world and one that had lost none of its lustre, despite staggered kick-off times and Premier League matches also running this weekend.It was a claim that lost the rest of its credibility the minute he started to pluck balls out of a bag to pair teams up in the midst of a match in which that games winners knew who they would play next ndash unlike the other quarter-final winners Cha, Southampton and Man City.Gilmour deserves a call-upThomas Tuchel was almost apologetic to Billy Gilmour in his pre-match press conference prior to Chas FA Cup quarter-final win over Sheffield United, saying that he kept him at Stamford Bridge in January for selfish reasons.The decision closed the door on loan offers from others almost certainly cost Gilmour his place in Steve Clarkes squad for the forthcoming World Cup qualiers against Austria, Israel and Faroe Islands.The Cha manager urged Clarke to pick him anyway saying that the only reason he wasnt making his starting line-up was because of the presence of Ngolo Kante, Mateo Kovacic and Jorginho ndash three players whom Tuchel says are never injured - in his squad. Debates about the respective merits of at least one of that trio vis-a-vis Gilmours ability aside, he had a general point.Gilmour is already worthy of inclusion in the Scotland squad as evidenced by his general performance yesterday and one little cameo where he won a - ball against John Fleck, a midfielder whohasbeen included in Clarkes selection."},{"url":null,"title":"alex-salmond-inquiry-women-make-complaint-parliament-salmond-evidence-leaks","story":"In a statement released through Rape Crisis Scotland on Sunday, the two women who made complaints of harassment against former first minister Alex Salmond said they would be making a formal complaint over the leak.A story in The Sunday Times claims the women, giving evidence in private last Monday, painted a picture of a demeaning environment for women, with one saying it was ldquolike the Wild West.We are issuing a statement on behalf of the two complainers whose evidence to the inquiry has been leaked: https:t.co RmgsMHYgcu pic HwxiVFcleomdash Rape Crisis ScotlandMarch , The statement said the leak was a breach of the MSP code of conduct, as well as ldquoa violation of the trust we placed in the committee, and raised concerns about the accuracy of the leak.It added: ldquoThe reporting of our evidence has included inaccuracies and distortions, which appear to be intended to serve a political agenda.ldquoComplainers in this case have been subject to regular attacks and misrepresentations on social media, and have found their experiences repeatedly exploited for political purposes during the inquiry.ldquoFor a committee members to perpetuate this is indefensible and an abuse of their position.ldquoWe will be making a formal complaint.The inquiry is expected to come to a head this week, with the Committee on the Scottish Government Handling of Harassment Complaints due to publish its final report.Portions of the report, where MSPs voted - to conclude that First Minister Nicola Sturgeon misled the committee over a meeting with Mr Salmond, were leaked last week.The First Minister described the leak as ldquopartisan, while the committeersquos convener Linda Fabiani said she was ldquodismayed the information had been disclosed before the final report was published.The independent investigation into the ministerial code, being conducted by James Hamilton, is also expected to report this week and could prove more dangerous for the current First Ministershe was found to have knowingly breached the code.Nicola Sturgeon referred herself for investigation after she was accused of misleading parliament over when she knew about allegations against Mr Salmond.The Scottish Tories have given Ms Sturgeon until Tuesday to resign, or she will face a vote of no confidence on Wednesday, due to what the party says is ldquooverwhelming proof she broke the ministerial code."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12412131.jpg?type=article-full","title":"covid-scotland-astrazeneca-vaccine-100-per-cent-effective-severe-coronavirus","story":"The jab, which has been the subject of controversy in Europe over concerns about links to very rare blood clots, is also % effective at keeping people out of hospital with severe illness.Some , people across all age groups took part in the phase three trial in the US, Chile and Peru, with a total of  cases of symptomatic Covid- reported.The results showed that among people aged  and over, there was % protection against developing Covid-.The degree of effectiveness against symptomatic Covid- was even higher than observed in the Oxford-led clinical trials.:AstraZeneca: Covid vaccine side effects - should I be concerned about reports of blood clots An independent data safety monitoring boardalso identied no safety concerns relating to the vaccine.It conducted a specic review of thrombotic events, as well as cerebral venous sinus thrombosisndash the specic type of brain blood clot that has been troubling Europe.The DSMB found no increased risk of thrombosis among the , participants receiving at least one dose of the vaccine.

Almost all of Britainrsquos mountain hares are found in Scotland, yet in most regions we have very little information on how they are doing.\"That is why we are calling on the public to help in our new project. You donrsquot have to be a specialist: all you need is to be out in the hills with a smartphone.Rob Raynor, a mammal specialist at NatureScot, added: ldquoMany people enjoy seeing mountain hares in the Scottish hills. Our priority is to make sure they remain a common sight.\"To do that, we need a better understanding of the existing population ndash something which this novel national survey will make possible by filling in the gaps in our knowledge. It will give us a better picture of mountain hare numbers, both regionally and nationally, and support decisions about how to maintain and conserve our native hare population.:Scots nature agencys concerns for seabirds from Shetland space centre planldquoWersquod like to encourage hillwalkers and anyone with an interest to contribute their sightings to this valuable project.\"We have an online training video and guidance within the app, so participants who arenrsquot certaintheyrsquoll be able to tell the dference between mountain hares, brown hares or rabbits can feel confident about their identication once theyrsquore out in the hills.\"Ben Darvill from the BTO added: ldquoScotlandrsquos outdoor enthusiasts can transform our understanding of mountain hares via this simple survey.\"Itrsquos easy to log hare sightings while yoursquore out in the hills, and keen participants can also record the upland birds that they see, too.

Thatrsquos how the idea of having a cross in the church grounds came about as people need to be able to grieve and heal just now.ldquoItrsquos also about remembering the year we have come through and it could relate to any of us including young people who have had a particularly hard time with schooling disruption and at times not being able to see friends.The cross, built at the Bullwood Project, a Glasgow-based charity which helps people from all walks of le develop their woodwork skills, will be in place for a week.Mr Galbraith, who is also a member of The Herald memorial garden projectrsquos steering group, added: ldquoAnyone can come along and place a flower on the cross as an act of remembrance for someone they have lost or they may just feel the need to do something. The idea of a white flower is for remembrance and healing. By the end of the week it might be completely covered in flowers and people can pay their respects in their own time while being socially distanced outdoors.ldquoI hope this simple act of healing will help until such times we can come together in church again to remember loved ones.Read more: Covid one year on: families pay tribute to those lost to the virusAs the founder of Glasgow the Caring City charity, Mr Galbraith along with son Ross have built up a network of people who are often willing to help them in a time of need.ldquoI did wonder how we were going to get this cross built and it was my son Ross, who is charityrsquos Projects Development Manager, suggested the Bullwood Project. And they have been marvellous in offering to create it.The Bullwood Project, based in Townsend Street, Port Dundas, is run by Joe Kilmartin and he said they were delighted to help.ldquoWe would have been more than happy to do this for them and when we found it what it was for, there was no hesitation at all, said Mr Kilmartin. ldquoWe have used a larch from Perthshire which when oiled will look almost silver. Itrsquos not every day we are asked for a six foot cross, but we had the timber here and it has been a pleasure to do it from them.The charity, previously based in Nitshill, has worked with community groups over the years and has helped young people interested in learning a new skill.Mr Kilmartin, , added: ldquoAnyone can come along to our workshops and we donrsquot charge. You could be working, out of work, or looking for an interest, but we find people get a lot out of it when they have completed something.In  Mr Kilmartin also famously took the previous yearrsquos George Square Christmas tree to New York for Tartan Day with the caber having pride of place in the celebrations.It was turned into the tallest ornamental caber in the world and donated to New York as a sign of friendship.The Herald memorial garden project is looking to create a place where people can go to remember loved ones who died from covid.Since the campaign launched last May more than pound, has been raised through a public fund, which has attracted some high profile donations.

He criticised the idea of a mandated identication to prove vaccination, which has raised concerns about issues of privacy, inidual choice, and discrimination against people of dferent health statuses, amongst other worries.The Government is currently conducting a feasibility review on the idea of introducing vaccine passports.Speaking in the House remotely, Mr Carmichael said: “On Wednesday morning, I shall be joining the queues in the Pickaquoy Centre in Kirkwall to have my vaccination, and I very much look forward to the extra freedoms that that may allow me.“However, it is worth remembering that one year ago we all surrendered a signicant number of important freedoms to the Government. It was a necessary thing to do at the time. One year on, though, we know an awful lot better how we must deal with this pandemic. I suggest that the Government’s efforts should be focused on ing our liberties rather than tightening them further. That is why I oppose the idea of a vaccine passport.”He added: “Once we have said that it is okay to have a passport for COVID, where will that argument go when the threat of COVID has receded  What we have before us today is the very thin end of a thick and dangerous wedge.“The concept of a vaccine passport is a first step in a major redefinition of the relationship between the citizen and the state. When freedoms are given up, the state rarely rushes tothem.#Remember how it was the last time we had identity cards. It was only going to be for the duration of the Second World War, but seven years after the end of that war, it required a citizen to take the Government to court to end it.

The same is not true for our island communities, which have been left in limbo.“A fortnight ago, in response to my question, Nicola Sturgeon insisted that Orkney would move to Level Two when the rest of the country moved to Level Three. Now, this seems to be up in the air and subject to further discussions.“I have no dficulty with the government wanting to take account of the views of islanders in these decisions. However, there is no reason why this could not have happened prior to today’s statement.“Across Scotland, preparations will now be underway for what happens at the end of April. Meantime, people and businesses in Orkney are still in the dark.“We need urgent clarication from Ministers about who is to be consulted and when a decision can be expected. If travel is indeed the main factor holding up a decision, the government should step up efforts to put in place testing at entry points.“Nicola Sturgeon’s previous statement made no mention of islands at all. Today, the islands appeared to be an afterthought. All of which makes it more dficult for islanders to share in the cautious optimism expressed by the First Minister.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We’re not complaining about that — the ferry pays its dues — but we have to find a way of reconciling the effect that has on Ullapool#s tourist trade because the place where visitors congregate to admire the loch and the view is Shore Street.In addition, the -year-old sea wall will be replaced with a higher structure to protect the village from rising sea levels.As part of the pre-application consultation, an online Zoom meeting will be held tonight at pm when the proposals will be presented for the first time and as many people as possible are being urged to take part.To join the meeting people can visit the website: http:www.ullapool-harbour or phone    and enter meeting ID:  to listen in.Anyone who wishes to make representations can do so by contacting Fiona Henderson, Affric Limited, Lochview Office, Loch Duntelchaig, Farr, IV AW, or by email: consultation@affriclimited, by th March ."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ARCHIVE-CENT-ANGUS-OG-6.jpg","title":"chust lovely angus og finds a new home in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe collection of the comic strips were handed over to the Skye and Lochalsh Archive Centre in Portree, in recognition of Angus Òg creator Ewen Bain and his family links to Skye.Ewen was brought up in Maryhill, Glasgow but his father John hailed from Waternish and his mother Flora from Staffin. Every summer of his youth was spent on the island.The adventures of Angus, and the residents of Drambeg in the Utter Hebrides first featured in the Glasgow Bulletin in , but soon moved to the Daily Record where it would enjoy a loyal cult following for nearly  years.Ewen’s daughter Rhona Flin thought it was appropriate the artwork should find a home in Skye.“My father grew up in the city, but in a very Glasgow-Skye household that would be familiar to many. There was Gaelic in the home and every summer would be spent back in Skye with relatives.“Angus Òg was set in Drambeg in the Utter Hebrides, but the only island my father knew well himself was Skye!“People still fondly remember the cartoons – they were full of topical references on local and national issues, which people will still relate to.”Rhona inherited the collections after the death of her mother, Sheila, and set about finding a permanent home in which they could be displayed.They had previously featured occasionally in museums and two books were made to showcase the collection.“I was keen that they would be seen –they are there to looked at and enjoyed,” added Rhona, who lives in Aberdeen but spent two summers working in Skye in her youth.Catherine MacPhee, archivist at the centre, said she was delighted to have taken delivery of the collection, which she said featured theme familiar to the modern audience.She said: “The first Angus Òg strip I looked at back in , when part of the collection arrived, was poking fun at the hordes of tourists arriving in Drambeg – at the time it made me giggle as we were mid tourist peak in Skye.“It is important it survives as it is part of Scotland’s social history.”Ewen Bain had initially been an art teacher, but left the profession to concentrate on his cartoons. Angus Òg ran six days a week in the Record and Sunday Mail until Ewen died in , a victim of a flu epidemic which struck that year.has also been set up to allow people to see the cartoon creations."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/KYLEAKIN-PLAYPARK-1-scaled.jpg","title":"new playpark in kyleakin after community reach fundraising","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe new playpark will be sited on land donated by Kyleakin Feus near to the village hall and local primary school.A mixture of community fundraising, grants and contributions linked to the building of new housing in the village has helped complete the funding package and parent Maddie Newsome, who has chaired the fundraising group, said she was delighted to see all the local efforts bearing fruit.She said: “The committee are delighted to be able to bring the project into reality in such a short time and want to thank all the donors for theirgenerosity.“The new play park will provide a fun, creative and social outdoor play area for the young children of Kyleakin and surrounding villages, and the support from local groups, businesses and the local council has been overwhelming.”Funding was made possible thanks to National Lottery players as the lottery’s community fund gave £,.The National Lottery Community Fund Scotland Chair Kate Still said: “In these uncertain times our priority is to ensure that National Lottery money continues to flow to charities, voluntary sector organisations and grassroots groups. I would like to congratulate Kyleakin Playpark project on their award, theirs is an important project and will support people now and in the future when they can physically come back together to make great things happen in their community.”The final piece in the funding jigsaw came from a Highland Council ward discretionary grant of £,.Local councillor John Finlayson said: “Myself and fellow members were really impressed by the fundraising drive to date and the fact that through ious channels, almost £, of the funding was secured before the ward discretionary was turned to.“The fundraising to date made the decision to support the final piece in the jigsaw very easy and members were keen to point out that this project highlights how community drive and partnership working, that includes a clear strategic vision, can achieve positive outcomes.”James MacQueen Building Contractor’s Limited gave £, and a developers’ contribution from Lochalsh and Skye Housing Association of £, was made linked to the construction of the new houses.A further £, came through the Kyleakin Gala MOWI Scotland donated £, Kyleakin and Kylerhea Community Council gave £, online crowdfunding brought in £, while £ was raised through the Balmacara SPAR.It is hoped that the park will be completed by late summertime."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/LAMB-SALES-19-2.jpg","title":"the responsibility of a crofter is not to do as you","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineIt is far from a new problem and one that very much sits hand in hand with a long-standing wider issue in relation to crofting development and productivity – lack of use and neglect.You don’t need to go far to come across overgrown and rank crofts, where fences have rotted away and the ground has been covered in a blanket of coarse, dead vegetation. It is a depressingly all-too familiar sight.“Stagnation” was the term Mr MacKinnon used, and he was spot on.As lives become ever more disconnected from the land, it’s quite understandable why people no longer have the inclination, or time, particularly when there is no great financial . But how it must frustrate those desperate to work the land to see all these crofts going to waste.Survey after survey has demonstrated a huge interest from people wanting to get a foot on the ladder, but they can’t because the traditional avenue of family inheritance is not open to them.The croft tenancies that do come on the market go for astronomical sums, way beyond the reach of young families and completely out of kilter with agricultural potential.And this is the problem, the reason that so many people hold onto non-working crofts is because they can see the pound signs they can see what it might fetch in terms of its housing potential, with estate agents only too happy to downplay the fact that every croft tenancy sale and every de-crofting application has to be approved by the Crofting Commission. It’s not proved too much of an impediment in the past.In fairness to the commission, they have made improvements. As much as the law enables, they do now try and prevent housing speculation – although one recent case in Lochalsh suggests there may be still some way to go. And they have at least made the right noises about dealing with neglect, which has prompted an increase in formal sub-leases and tenancy transfers.But as Mr MacKinnon noted, it is dficult for them to really stamp their authority without the proper resources.So an impasse remains, young families are unable to get access to land while countless crofts go to waste.But there is a solution, evenit will make for an uncomfortable journey: remove the ability to trade tenancies on the open market and at the same time get rid of the right to buy a croft. At a stroke, those motivated purely for monetarywill disappear their incentive gone. Then arm the commission with the necessary resources to properly tackle neglect —rather than the current practice of gentle encouragement without force — and those who have crofts but can’t do the work will have to quickly find a solution. Step forward new entrants.Granted, the opposition to such an approach will likely be signicant. Denying people the opportunity to do with an asset what they please will be seen as anti-libertarian, a curb on personal freedom, and you can easily predict the outrage.But the responsibility of a crofter is not to do as you please. You are part of a unique system of land tenure which was established nearly  years ago to keep people and communities alive. That is still very much of relevance today. Denying those fortunate enough to have crofts from lining their own pockets and ensuring everyone lives up to their duties doesn’t seem an unreasonable expectation in that context.It is expected that, Covid recovery depending, the new term of the Scottish Parliament willto the matter of crofting reformand there is an opportunity here for a proper radical approach which addresses the needs of crofting today but, crucially, with the principles of old at its heart.It will require politicians and leaders of strength and conviction who are able to make a compelling case in the face of undoubted opposition, who can the see the vision that a new, radical approach will bring and who can reject pressure from all sorts of vested interests. The trouble is: there is precious little evidence of that calibre of inidual in Scotland’s political landscape of today.IT SEEMS like only yesterday I was talking about preparing for the winter and here we are with spring on the horizon. Soon the digital clock in the van will be at the right time again. I have more reason than usual to hope for a good lambing. The scanning results were on the disappointing side,  empty out of  and  sets of twins giving an overall percentage of around . Not a disaster by any means, particularly in this part of the world, but my own lowest tally ever, as usually I’m looking at somewhere around the  to  per cent mark.I suspect an underlying issue with fluke at tupping time. Fasciola hepaticais a tiny mud snail which is ingested through grazing and attacks the liver. It thrives in wet conditions and is re in Scotland.There are routine treatments, but it’s now recognised that the parasite is developing a resistance to some of the products on the market. As a result of that, the advice is to constantly use dferent ones and I probably wasn’t as meticulous in this as I should have been, although I know that others too have had increased problems with fluke in the early part of the winter – and it was horrendously wet in November through to December.So the dry, hard frost of a couple of weeks ago was a godsend and it was on such a bracing but beautul morning that we gathered for the scanning, the ground underfoot like uneven concrete. You could have gotten away with your trainers.Once the work was completeI linked up my iPhone with the scanner and a detailed breakdown of the results popped up on the screen. A couple of pings later and it was out in the ether, all the way out to the North Sea where it was downloaded by someone not able to be in attendance to view his own results almost instantaneously.It was a lovely symbiosis of tradition and technology, though goodness knows what the bodachs of yesteryear would have made of it all."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/John_Purser-202030713-edited.jpg","title":"tobar and dualchais pure escapism among the fenian","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThat may explain why story-telling and mythology were so highly prized.

You could say she was pursuing the romantic Celtic dream, but with Father Allan and the people of Eriskay she found it, and it was no more a dream than was she herself.We should be immensely grateful to her. Her style of writing may seem slightly arch to some today, but none other than Padraic Colum was happy to write the foreword to her book, full of praise for her writing skills.She was a kind of predecessor of Margaret Fay Shaw, that most redoubtable of ladies, made of Pittsburgh steel, chain-smoking and with a bourbon to hand and her beloved piano just across the room.

Those in housing stress are deemed in priority need of housing.Over this period  properties were allocated and the average number of months an applicant was waiting for a housing was  months. This is the longest average wait of any area in Northern Ireland.This compares with average waiting times of . months in Foyle, . months in east Belfast and  months in north Belfast. The shortage average waiting time was in the Upper Bann and Strangford areas, both at  months. Looking at Northern Ireland as a whole, the average wait was  months.People Before Profit MLA for West Belfast, Gerry Carroll, said: Every week I am contacted by scores of people in my constituency over this issue. Every week I hear of heart-breaking, unfair and moving stories of people who need a house, urgently but are forced to wait years on one.The Executive needs to rapidly change track on this issue. The Communities Minister needs to bin her plans which would effectively see the privatisation and outsourcing of some aspects of the NI Housing Executive. Instead she, her party and the wider Executive should commit to increasing and strengthening the provision of public housing to help those languishing for many years on the waiting list to finally get a house.Justin Cartwright, director of the Chartered Institute of Housing Northern Ireland, said the increasing amount of time applicants spend on the waiting list is deeply regrettable, urging we need to build more affordable, good quality homes at speed.Jim Dennison, chief executive of Simon Community NI, said they welcome commitments from the DfC and NIHE to increase housing stock and reduce waiting times.Tony McQuillan, director of Shelter NI, said the charity believes the pandemic will create a long-term legacy of increasing need for social housing.A DfC spokesperson said that Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey recognises the need to revitalise the NIHE.We also need to deliver more social housing and the minister plans to reintroduce ring-fencing, which means money will be protected to prioritise new social housing in areas where there is highest housing need, such as north Belfast, west Belfast and Foyle, the spokesperson added.An NIHE spokesperson said West Belfast is an area of high housing demand and low housing turnover, so some applicants may experience longer waiting times.In addition, it has been well recognised that there is a supply issue for available land in west Belfast for new social housing. We are addressing the supply issue with a number of large-scale housing developments in the west Belfast constituency set to be completed over the next couple of years, they said.Belfast Most Read#I#m dying, I#m dying... it#s my son#: Mum Karen McClean and girlfriend Stacey Knell stabbed to death in murder-suicide in Newtownabbey#Butch lesbian# Arlene Foster line in Fern Brady#s BBC comedy routine angers DUPNI hairdresser Nan Dunlop #kned woman  times# in Iceland car park, court toldDUP will bring down Stormont, warns group that represents loyalist terroristsGerry Adams in Easter Choccy ar la moveTop Videos\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news eea .ece AUTOCROP wh cbcacffddc.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news eea .ece AUTOCROP wh cbcacffddc.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news eea .ece AUTOCROP wh cbcacffddc.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayEmergency services at the scene of three overnight incidents in ArdoynePlayThree people dead in suspected murder-suicide in NewtownabbeyPlayMuseum staff walking  miles to keep the lights onLatest NewsStarmer seeks to move on from Brexit rows as Hartlepool contest loomsSpace debris demonstration mission blasts offDUP MP questions NI vaccine supplies as UK hits record number of jabs What measures are in the Bill which promises to overhaul the justice system Meghan’s front-page statement in Mail On Sunday on hold pending possible appealLatest from Belfast Starmer seeks to move on from Brexit rows as Hartlepool contest loomsSpace debris demonstration mission blasts offDUP MP questions NI vaccine supplies as UK hits record number of jabs Mikel Arteta lauds Martin Odegaard for starring role in Arsenal comebackGlentoran boss Mick McDermott warns of #hard weeks up ahead# as Irish League intensity set to ramp up,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Phase , after the Easter break, will expand the programme to include all staff in primary schoolsThe third phase will add nursery, pre-school and, at least initially, pre-school education providers participating in the Pre-School Education Programme.Department of Education advice said that the LFD test was not “% perfect but the speed and convenience of LFD tests means they are very successful in identying asymptomatic iniduals”.“A small proportion of people may receive a  positive result but in NI anyone testing positive must immediately book a PCR test to confirm the result.“It is also possible to get a  negativean inidual is in the early stages of infection,” the Department said.“This is why everyone will be tested regularly so that no cases will be missed.”\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland ebe .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_fdb-cb--ab-aeb_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland ebe .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_fdb-cb--ab-aeb_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland ebe .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_fdb-cb--ab-aeb_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland ebe .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_fdb-cb--ab-aeb_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"A lateral flow immunoassay diagnostic device  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueA lateral flow immunoassay diagnostic device The LFD programme aims for two tests to be carried out before Easter, and one prior toto school as an additional mitigation to reduce asymptomatic cases in school.Iniduals who receive a positive result from an LFD test will have to isolate along with members of their households from the time of their positive LFD result.A confirmation PCR test will be required for everyone who tests positive on LFD.If the PCR test result is negative, the inidual and their household can leave isolation and no further action is required.If the PCR test result is positive the inidual and their household and all other close contacts must complete a full ten days of self-isolation.Is it compulsory No. Consent forms will have to be signed and initially that is where the responsibility of teachers ends. Whether pupils take the test is left up to inidual families.Pupils in Years - and staff in post primary schools will be offered the tests twice weekly from next week, and teaching union the NASUWT said that schools “have not been given the time necessary to ensure the delivery of a competent testing system that will be robust and effective”.After the Easter holidays, all staff in primary and pre-schools will also be offered regular testing and the Department of Education plans to make the tests available for all pupils “at a later date”.The Lateral Flow Devicetests, which give a result in  minutes, will be offered to the oldest pupils and staff in post primary schools.Read MoreNI special schools to receive rapid Covid testingNI schools plan another failure by #ineffectual# Education Minister, claims teachers# unionUnions say that no guidance has been issued and training will consist of a webinar for principalsfollowed up by a series of frequently asked questions.School leaders have now been told they will have to issue consent forms and record who has received kits, but tests will not be taken in school.“Once pupils have received kits you should arrange a demonstration for them of how to use the kit the first time,” a document issued by the PHA and the Education Authority said on Thursday night.“The pupils then take their kit home to conduct their first test.”Schools were only notied last Monday, March , that they would organise testing for staff and pupils in Years - from theirto school on Monday March .What are the teaching unions saying about it The last minute rushing through of the testing procedure has angered teaching unions.“The Department of Education must work with unions and schools on a sensible timescale for the roll out of testing which is backed with the necessary practical and financial support,” said NASUWT General Secretary Dr Patrick Roach.“We all want pupils and school staff to be as safe as possible in school but an unplanned, uncoordinated and unworkable approach to mass testing without the provision of adequate resources and additional trained personnel risks undermining, rather than enhancing Covid safety.”\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland bab .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_fc-dd--bcbc-eefffb_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland bab .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_fc-dd--bcbc-eefffb_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland bab .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_fc-dd--bcbc-eefffb_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland bab .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_fc-dd--bcbc-eefffb_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Nasuwt’s Dr Patrick Roach.

The Union’s Northern Secretary, Justin McCamphill, said it was “shocking” that the Department of Education are expecting school staff to supervise the administration of these tests with almost no notice.“Neither the Department nor the Education Authority can explainrisk assessments have been carried out while it is evident that little or no consideration has been given to the workload of school leaders,” he said.“In the absence of adequate guidance, proper consultation with unions or evidence of adherence to Health and Safety Regulations no teacher or school leader should either demonstrate the safe use of these tests or supervise pupils while they take the test.“Unless a teacher has a specic contractual term to the contrary, schools must not expect teachers to carry out or supervise the tests. Teachers and principals in grant aided schools in Northern cannot be instructed to undertake medical procedures.”What role will the teachers take in the programme now Teachers will not now carry out the tests, but there has to be a supervisory role. What happens when the tests are introduced at a later date for the youngest pupils, as the authorities have indicated, might be a dferent matter.The Association of School and College Leadersin Northern Ireland said teachers had no idea the testing programme would be rolled out before the announcement and had not been consulted about what would be expected.“Teachers do not want to see ato a revolving door of schools opening and then having to close again,” said Robert Wilson, Regional Officer.“The announcement that all pupils in Years  to  will face lateral flow tests on theirto the classroom has come as a total surprise to school leaders and comes on the back of a pilot scheme, the success of which they know very little about.“Schools have not been consulted about testing and communication on this matter from the Education Minister has been woefully poor and extremely short on detail. Teachers have been given precious little time to make arrangements for a major logistical operation they had not been previously warned about and have no experience of organising.“Unlike schools in England, which were given weeks to prepare for testing, their counterparts in Northern Ireland now have days to learn how to become medical professionals and act as an authority to their pupils on how to use lateral flow tests,” he added.“Testing may ultimately help our pupils to safelyto the classroom but we are concerned that rushing it may create more problems than it solves.”\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland c .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_fdb-cb--ab-aeb_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland c .ece AUTOCROP w

Minister Peter Weir PA FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueNorthern Ireland Education Minister Peter Weir The Education Minister, Peter Weir, admitted he had read some reports concerning the effectiveness of the lateral-flow test and the possibility of “ positives”.“No test is completely accurate, but studies indicate a very high degree of effectiveness at detecting those who are infectious,” he said.“When infection levels are low in the community, a positive LFD test indicates that the inidual may have Covid,” he added.The Northern Ireland Teachers’ Councilsaid that while the organisation supports the further mitigation, there are concerns about ‘assisting’ students to take the test in a classroom school environment.“NITC remain keen to engage with the Department to discuss what support will be needed for the roll-out of lateral flow testing in schools to be successful – but in a way that does not compromise safety in school – or add to the already unacceptably high workload demands on school leaders,” NITC said.“Any member who comes under any unreasonable pressure with regard to any aspect of LFD testing is advised to contact their union immediately.”NITC added: “The Education Authority has indicated that additional resourcing to cover the administrative burden will be assuredrecorded under Covid costs.“The role of teachers is purely to facilitate familiarisation of the LFD test and the teaching unions advise that testing is safest carried out at home for privacy and to ensure no potential positive cases come into school.“School staff cannot be compelled to supervise or support pupils to conduct self-testing in schools,” they added.What has the Education Minister said Education Minister Peter Weir said the testing will provide a signicant level of reassurance to education settings.“All settings will be reminded of the need for stringent adherence to good practice and additional signage will be provided to all schools to encourage people to comply with public health messaging,” he said.“While it is for each family to decidethey wish for their child to participate in the testing, it will be of benefit to all those in schools for us to be able to break the chain of transmission of the virus by identying all those who may be asymptomatic.”Read MoreMark Bain:OpinionAs schools are set to , there’s a mixture of joy tinged with frustrationThe first batch of tests were scheduled to be delivered to post-primary schools this week, meaning all post-primaries will have enough tests to conduct at least one supervised test in school, and for pupils to be able to conduct a test at home before theyafter the Easter break.Jacquie White, General Secretary of the Ulster Teachers’ Union, said there are still too many unknown for teachers to be convinced of the long term sustainably of Covid-safe environments.“The Lateral Flow Testing is as yet an unknown and while the Minister admits it will be ‘challenging’ I think that is an understatement,” she added.“This is even before one considers the efficacy of the test which won’t detect asymptomatic carriers of Covid and is also known to give  positives.”Belfast Most Read#I#m dying, I#m dying... it#s my son#: Mum Karen McClean and girlfriend Stacey Knell stabbed to death in murder-suicide in Newtownabbey#Butch lesbian# Arlene Foster line in

Clergy started streaming liturgies through newly installed webcams and social media, and held virtual parish meetings on online s that heretofore had only been the realm of computer experts and technical wizards.Now with Holy Week and Easter approaching, Fr McGee says there is a profound sense of consolation, hope and joy that accompanies theagain to public worship.There is also a flurry of activity within our parishes to carry out risk assessments, reactivate the measures already put in place to keep parishioners safe and to mobilise again the volunteers who have sanitised churches and facilitated public liturgies.Fr McGee says the last year has brought much suffering and pain and there is a need for healing and reconnection as we emerge as a society from the hold of the pandemic.The greatest cross has been carried by those who have lost loved ones as they have been unable to observe the rites and rituals associated with mourning that are so much part of our faith and culture, he added.The pandemic has also had a profound impact on education, business and brought economic hardship and insecurity to families. It will take time for us all to recover and heal the wounds of the pandemic but we will recover and we approach the future together with the Easter hope of resurrection.Rev Joanne Smith was just getting into her stride as a first-time minister at Caledon and Minterburn Presbyterian Churches in Co Tyrone when everything changed.I now have a large file on my computer called #Coronatide#, she reflects.It#s full of hastily pulled together Sunday sermons and talks for our online mid-week services from those early lockdown weeks a year ago, when many of us honestly had no idea what we were doing, or how to do it.We started recording services on our phones and we are still doing that! Teenagers and teachers edited them, and like everyone , we got very used to Zoom - and distance.A year later, Rev Joanne says everything is the same, but also dferent.Everything is the same in that we are still zooming and recording services, though we now record in the church which is much better, she explains.We still have no in-person meetings and while there are things that can be done on Zoom, like our prayer meetings, so many things can#t - like mums and tots groups, which have just stopped.I really want to be with people, but as time has gone on, simple staying in contact has also got harder, but we are getting there.Thankfully, everything is also dferent. People are now being vaccinated, some of our more senior members are about to get their second, and we have heard this week that we will be able toto church for Easter, she said.And looking ahead to her third Easter as a minister, Rev Joanne added: It will be dferent from last year - but in a good way - as we will be able to meet, and we will be able to celebrate together that on the third day Jesus rose again and the hope that brings - especially in these tired days.Rev Gareth Harron, rector of St Philip and St James Church of Ireland in Holywood, Co Down, feels that we took a great deal for granted before last March.It#s a cliché, but we have learned to appreciate something of what church is really about, he said. As we moved our services online, we weren#t caught completely cold. We had been recording services for distribution on DVD for some years, but we needed to get up to speed with live streaming.While we know that not everyone has access to technology, going online with things like our bible studies, prayer meetings, fellowship groups, select vestry meetings, book-groups etc. has opened up engagement beyond our parish boundaries. We have been joined by people from around the globe.For Rev Gareth, the main challenges to pastoral ministry were having to grieve with families faced with limiting the numbers attending funeral services and being unable to visit hospitals and nursing homes.I am hopeful that the lessons we have learned will make us better equipped to support people - that church might not just go back to #normal# but might actually feel better, he adds.I am looking forward to meeting around the Lord#s table this Easter - no outdoor dawn service, no breakfast afterwards - but blessed by the opportunity to give thanks with the church family, whether in person or online, united by the good news of hope in Christ which transcends lockdowns and social distancing.Rev Dr Heather Morris, general secretary of the Methodist Church in Ireland, says the past year has been as challenging for churches as it has been for the whole of society.The grief of those who have lost loved ones through these months has been heightened by the necessary restrictions on visiting and funerals, but ministers have been #on the frontline# of support for these families, Dr Morris said.Churches have run and been part of community helplines, to support those who can#t get out, whether that was delivering prescriptions or groceries, simply being available on the phone for a chat, or offering prayer.She adds: There was undoubtedly initial shock and re-adjustment to this new landscape but Methodist churches responded with imagination and creativity, asking #what can we do, rather than focussing on the things that couldn#t be done in the circumstances - a community choir in South Belfast met online and churches have been able, restrictions allowing, to keep foodbanks running.When buildings were closed for gathered worship most Methodist churches moved online for Sunday services and mid-week Bible Studies, prayer meetings and Alpha courses, and many found that they were being joined not just by the usual congregation but by others who were interested. Some congregations, in Enniskillen, Togherdoo, Lisbellaw and many others have run very popular drive-in services.Along with other churches, members of the Methodist church will be praying on Easter Sunday for recovery from the pandemic, healing, peace and renewed hope for the whole community.Belfast Most Read#I#m dying, I#m dying... it#s my son#: Mum Karen McClean and girlfriend Stacey Knell stabbed to death in murder-suicide in Newtownabbey#Butch lesbian# Arlene Foster line in Fern Brady#s BBC comedy routine angers DUPNI hairdresser Nan Dunlop #kned woman  times# in Iceland car park, court toldDUP will bring down Stormont, warns group that represents loyalist terroristsGerry Adams in Easter Choccy ar la moveTop Videos\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news eea .ece AUTOCROP wh cbcacffddc.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news eea .ece AUTOCROP wh cbcacffddc.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news eea .ece AUTOCROP wh cbcacffddc.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayEmergency services at the scene of three overnight incidents in ArdoynePlayThree people dead in suspected murder-suicide in NewtownabbeyPlayMuseum staff walking  miles to keep the lights onLatest CoronavirusDUP MP questions NI vaccine supplies as UK hits record number of jabs Mental health impact of school disruption on parents laid bareVaccination of , homeless people in NI to get under wayBreaches: PSNI warns of action against Rangers fans over second mass gatheringLatest from Belfast Jamie Mulgrew plays down signicance of Linfield#s win at Crusaders as gap remains at the topStarmer seeks to move on from Brexit rows as Hartlepool contest loomsSpace debris demonstration mission blasts offDUP MP questions NI vaccine supplies as UK hits record number of jabs Mikel Arteta lauds Martin Odegaard for starring role in Arsenal comeback,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Unionists could be guaranteed cabinet positions, while the Irish constitution may have to be comprehensively rewritten for any future united Ireland, Jim O#Callaghan believes.The TD for Dublin Bay South, who is tipped by some to be a future leader of the party, will lay out his current thinking on what a united Ireland might look like in a speech to the University of Cambridge tomorrow.He will propose that the current two chamber system should be retained - but that either the Dail or Seanad would be based in Belfast.It would be beneficial for a new united Ireland to retain a bicameral system, with one house sitting in Dublin and the other sitting in Belfast, Mr O#Callaghan will say, according to a report in Dublin#s Business Post. He will deliver the speech to the university#s Sidney Sussex College.His voicing of proposals on what a united Ireland might look like contrasts with party leader and Taoiseach Michael Martin#s position, according to the Post.Mr Martin wants to dampen down any talk of preparation for a united Ireland or calls for a border poll, at least in the next few years.But Mr Gallagher has decided to lay out his own vision - which also includes retaining the PSNI under a regional policing structure.While power sharing will not work, he will argue, there may be a way of ring-fencing cabinet positions for unionists to ensure they retain influence. He does believe unionists will, nevertheless, naturally develop alliances. In order to ensure that pro-union parties retained influence in an Irish government, there could be a requirement in the new constitution that a certain number of cabinet would be filled by representatives of unionist parties, he is expected to say.The TD will play down fears that a new Ireland will not be able to match how much the UK spends on Northern Ireland through its subvention, known as the block grant.Harnessing the strength of the whole island would help make those six counties a more prosperous region of a prosperous country, he will say.Belfast Most Read#I#m dying, I#m dying... it#s my son#: Mum Karen McClean and girlfriend Stacey Knell stabbed to death in murder-suicide in Newtownabbey#Butch lesbian# Arlene Foster line in Fern Brady#s BBC comedy routine angers DUPNI hairdresser Nan Dunlop #kned woman  times# in Iceland car park, court toldDUP will bring down Stormont, warns group that represents loyalist terroristsGerry Adams in Easter Choccy ar la moveTop Videos\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news eea .ece AUTOCROP wh cbcacffddc.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news eea .ece AUTOCROP wh cbcacffddc.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news eea .ece AUTOCROP wh cbcacffddc.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayEmergency services at the scene of three overnight incidents in ArdoynePlayThree people dead in suspected murder-suicide in NewtownabbeyPlayMuseum staff walking  miles to keep the lights onLatest Northern IrelandQuiet primary schools filled again with excited chatter of childrenDUP MP questions NI vaccine supplies as UK hits record number of jabs DUP to #block# Irish Act over NI Protocol issues but Sinn Fein says there can be no u-turn on commitmentsDUP not considering collapsing Stormont in protest at NI Protocol – ministerMore pupilsto school in Northern IrelandLatest from Belfast Quiet primary schools filled again with excited chatter of childrenEoin Morgan challenges England players to push T World Cup claims in ODIsFormer subpostmasters begin fight to clear names at Court of AppealKelechi Iheanacho hopes ‘best is yet to come’ after brace in cup win over UnitedCadbury owner Mondelez buys Solihull protein bar maker Grenade,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It is beyond parody that £, of public money could be spent on a report for it to lie hidden from public scrutiny and subject to endless, unaccountable working groups. Also now concealed in the black hole of the Executive Office is the Office of Identity and Cultural Expression, promised over a year ago but still delayed.Everything, from flags and memorials to language and heritage, continues to be abused to perpetuate the ide rather than promoted as a common cultural wealth. Constant inaction from the Executive Office merely allows this to continue.The days of abusing democratic rights and legitimate cultural expression must be in the past. We need publication of the report, bringing forward the legislation and the drafting of a legislative framework to promote legitimate cultural expression, ending the intimidatory use of symbols immediately.The SDLP also called for the publication of the report.South Down Colin McGrath MLA, chairman of Stormont#s Executive Office scrutiny committee, will also urge on Arlene Foster and Michelle O#Neill to meet their obligations under New Decade, New Approach to establish the Office of Identity and Cultural Expression. The Joint First Ministers received and have been considering the report for the Commission on Flags, Identity, Culture and Traditionsince July , he said.I understand that these are complex matters requiring detailed consideration but  days later, there is no excuse for continuing to hold the report in secret. If there is any intention to act on the content of the Commission#s work, it needs to be undertaken before the end of the mandate.I am also concerned about the pace of work to establish the Office of Identity and Cultural Expression, as required under New decade, New Approach. The commitments entered into under that document are the reason the SDLP entered the Executive. The glacial progress on important obligations is becoming a matter of concern. We are calling on the Joint First Ministers to take action.The FICT Commission report should be published in full along with a plan to reconcile our communities on these dficult issues. Legislation to establish the Office of Identity and Cultural Expression should also be progressed immediately.The Executive Office was contacted in connection with this report, but had not responded by the time of going to press.Belfast Most Read#I#m dying, I#m dying... it#s my son#: Mum Karen McClean and girlfriend Stacey Knell stabbed to death in murder-suicide in Newtownabbey#Butch lesbian# Arlene Foster line in Fern Brady#s BBC comedy routine angers DUPNI hairdresser Nan Dunlop #kned woman  times# in Iceland car park, court toldDUP will bring down Stormont, warns group that represents loyalist terroristsGerry Adams in Easter Choccy ar la moveTop Videos\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news eea .ece AUTOCROP wh cbcacffddc.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news eea .ece AUTOCROP wh cbcacffddc.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news eea .ece AUTOCROP wh cbcacffddc.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayEmergency services at the scene of three overnight incidents in ArdoynePlayThree people dead in suspected murder-suicide in NewtownabbeyPlayMuseum staff walking  miles to keep the lights onLatest Northern IrelandDUP MP questions NI vaccine supplies as UK hits record number of jabs DUP source: Report party to block Irish Language Act until NI Protocol issues resolvedDUP not considering collapsing Stormont in protest at NI Protocol – ministerMore pupilsto school in Northern Ireland#Historic moment# as first climate change bill goes before AssemblyLatest from Belfast Denise Van Outen says preparing for musical’shas been ‘lovely’Jamie Mulgrew plays down signicance of Linfield#s win at Crusaders as gap remains at the topStarmer seeks to move on from Brexit rows as Hartlepool contest loomsSpace debris demonstration mission blasts offDUP MP questions NI vaccine supplies as UK hits record number of jabs ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It#s an Olympic sport now so I#m still waiting for the call...Emma is an accomplished, multi-instrument musician, a very strong swimmer and a dab hand at both football and rugby.In fact, virtually nothing about the -year-old Southampton native is quite what you would expect.Viewers see her serious side on TV - which is perhaps unsurprising given that most reports involve the effects of Covid- or Brexit.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseEmma Vardy  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueEmma Vardy But it#s never long before the fun-loving Emma breaks through to the surface, both literally and figuratively.She worked as a surf instructor to pay the bills when striving to make her way as a freelance reporter.In those early days at Sky she was making tea, printing scripts and running around rather than filming pieces to camera.But then the indefatigable Emma took a Masters degree in journalism at Falmouth University in surfing hotspot Cornwall.I was working as a surf instructor when I started getting freelance shts with BBC Radio Cornwall, she said.Quite often I would be coaching surf lessons in the morning and then going to a reporting sht... with salt and sand still in my hair.Ultimately TV work and current affairs took precedence - which is rather ironic considering her upbringing.I actually grew up without a television in the house so I didn#t watch a lot of news in the s, she revealed.My parents didn#t believe in having a TV, and I actually think that that helped me become very creative.The flip side was that I hadn#t a clue what was going on in popular culture, couldn#t connect with anything that the other kids were chatting about at school.In the end, however, it helped me develop my own mind, my own curiosity about things.The gted pianist remembers her dad bringing home a video camera that you had to record onto cassette tape when I was a kid and she started making little comedy reports in the back garden.I think it started there, she said. I didn#t know I was going to be a journalist but there was something in me that loved telling a story to camera.The former BBC South Home Affairs Correspondent and Daily Politics Programme regular was working as a political journalist in Westminster when the Ireland job came up in .The Irish border got very little attention during the referendum campaign, and yet it became the biggest conundrum and basically brought down a government, she said.I wanted to explain why Brexit had potentially such big implications here.It was a time when people didn#t really understand Northern Ireland yet it was playing this central role in the biggest news story at the time that was consuming everything.It#s fair to suggest that, back then Emma#s mother Cary, who grew up in Australia and is now in her s, knew more about Northern Ireland than the new BBC Ireland correspondent.Mum remembers the Northern Ireland of the s, s and s I have to remind her that I#m not in the thick of that, said Emma.Nevertheless, she was wary of stepping on any toes or ruffling feathers when she came here.When I got the job I was totally clear that I was coming to Northern Ireland with a lot to learn, she said. I was very much an outsider in a place full of talented and brave local journalists.Also some of the BBC#s finest correspondents had done the Ireland job before me so I knew I had very big shoes to fill.She added: Mark Devenport [former BBCNI Political Editor] helped me a lot in understanding the layers of politics here and how to explain it. He was brilliant, as were many others.There was something  Emma wasn#t fully prepared for: how much she#d come to love living here.I suddenly realised that Northern Ireland was this incredibly well kept secret, she said.People back home in England seem to associate Northern Ireland with the dangerous place they used to see on the news but I discovered that it#s an incredible place to live.Just a few minutes outside of Belfast you could be on a mountain, you could be in the sea the north coast is endlessly dramatic and stunning. I absolutely love living here.It didn#t take long, however, for Emma to witness a dark side of her new habitat.Lyra McKee#s murder [on April , ] will always stay with me, she said.What happened that night was absolutely tragic, it shocked the world.It reminded people who#d forgotten that an undercurrent of violence still exists here. Lyra#s death and funeral weren#t the end of the story.I felt this huge sense of anger and disgust from the public that a teenager had been sent out into the streets with a gun. The statements put out by the dissidents afterwards trying to justy the violence sickened people.Asking them a few questions with a microphone just showed what cowards they are.Emma said she was always really incensed by things that seemed unfair and always wanted to question things that other people turned a blind eye to.I remember starting a petition at school when I was  because the boys were able to play football across the majority of the school playground but the girls weren#t, she said.I even held this protest by playing netball in the school#s no-balls area to try to take a stand.I think that was my first experience of politics, and the first sign that I wanted to question things...On April , she will celebrate two years with partner Aaron Adams , an analyst for Translink, with whom she lives in Belfast. The couple met while playing mixed five-a-side football.I actually used to be more of a rugby player but now I play football a lot, she said.Aaron and I didn#t really do conventional dates at first. We went to the gym together. Our second date was a kick-about at the park! In the five-a-sides he#d set me up to score goals so that probably clinched it. Our first #real# date was April Fool#s Day .Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseEmma with her partner Aaron Adams and his late daughter Ellsa FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueEmma with her partner Aaron Adams and his late daughter EllsaAaron lost his daughter from a previous relationship, Ellsa Alexander Adams, on February . She was just six years old.Ellsa suffered from a rare condition called CDKL, which meant she had very complex needs and she suffered from lots of seizures. Another aspect of her condition was severe epilepsy.Ellsa had become a huge part of my le, said Emma.Aaron had been Ellsa#s full time carer for three years - hospital stays, seizures, there were endless challenges but Aaron was an incredible father and Ellsa battled all of that like the little superhero she was.She spent weekends with us. Aaron always told me that you had to treasure every minute with Ellsa and that#s what we did.We were never at home for long, whether it was swimming or ice skating or going to beaches or clf paths and on boats, Ellsa came with us and we were always taking her to the most beautul places.Even though she couldn#t move or communicate we just really wanted her to experience everything she could - the sounds of the beaches, the feel of us bumping her chair along clf tops, being on boats and the feeling of the wind. We did an awful lot with Ellsa in a short time.Despite Ellsa#s all-too-apparent condition, Emma and Aaron had no idea they were going to lose her so soon.It was a real shock when it happened, said Emma.Ellsa had battled so hard for so long, and in the end I think her little body couldn#t do it any more.Nothing can ever prepare you for that. I keep reminding Aaron what an amazing job he did as a father. I think Ellsa brought us closer that#s one of the many good things she#s left behind.Losing Ellsa - who has an older brother Jonah , with whom the couple spend lots of time with and have a lot of fun with - prompted a huge show of sympathy from the Northern Ireland public.When Ellsa passed away thousands of people sent us messages, Emma recalled.Aaron did a lot of fundraising for her so she was quite widely known. When I was out with Ellsa in shops people used to stop us and sometimes it wasn#t because they recognised me, it was because they recognised her.It is impossible to describe the pain that Aaron#s feeling but all that love and kindness from so many people in Northern Ireland just meant such a lot.I wasn#t expecting that many people to reach out and when they did it didn#t make the pain any less but it did make a terrible time a little bit less dark.Emma regrets not having been home to see her family in England over the last year because of the pandemic.Father Ron, a former professional musician is in his early s, and she has two brothers and a sister - Alastair , Davidand Joanne . Alastair, who is in pyrotechnics, worked on Game of Thrones, while her sister works with horses and David is in the IT industry.She would also like to see more of Laura Kuenssberg, the BBC#s high profile Political Editor.Laura has been a huge support to me behind the scenes, said Emma. When the DUP were kingmakers in Westminster, our briefs very much overlapped so we#d share info to keep ourselves ahead of the story.No doubting Emma Vardy will continue to lead from the front because at work or at play, it is clear that she#s on the crest of a wave.Belfast Most Read#I#m dying, I#m dying... it#s my son#: Mum Karen McClean and girlfriend Stacey Knell stabbed to death in murder-suicide in Newtownabbey#Butch lesbian# Arlene Foster line in Fern Brady#s BBC comedy routine angers DUPNI hairdresser Nan Dunlop #kned woman  times# in Iceland car park, court toldDUP will bring down Stormont, warns group that represents loyalist terroristsGerry Adams in Easter Choccy ar la moveTop Videos\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news eea .ece AUTOCROP wh cbcacffddc.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news eea .ece AUTOCROP wh cbcacffddc.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news eea .ece AUTOCROP wh cbcacffddc.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayEmergency services at the scene of three overnight incidents in ArdoynePlayThree people dead in suspected murder-suicide in NewtownabbeyPlayMuseum staff walking  miles to keep the lights onLatest Northern IrelandQuiet primary schools filled again with excited chatter of childrenDUP MP questions NI vaccine supplies as UK hits record number of jabs DUP to #block# Irish Act over NI Protocol issues but Sinn Fein says there can be no u-turn on commitmentsDUP not considering collapsing Stormont in protest at NI Protocol – ministerMore pupilsto school in Northern IrelandLatest from Belfast Quiet primary schools filled again with excited chatter of childrenEoin Morgan challenges England players to push T World Cup claims in ODIsFormer subpostmasters begin fight to clear names at Court of AppealKelechi Iheanacho hopes ‘best is yet to come’ after brace in cup win over UnitedCadbury owner Mondelez buys Solihull protein bar maker Grenade,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It is twelve months since Derry pubs took the tough decision to close because of the risks posed by Covid-. Pressure was mounting on the British and NI Governments to act when the first Coronavirus cases emerged in the UK in January and NI at the end of February, . Before the government issued any formal directive for businesses to shut, the owners of Peadar O’Donnell’s announced that they would shut its doors on March , . googletag.cmd.push Assessing the past year, joint-owner William McGuinness said: “It’s been a disaster for us, it’s been a disaster for everybody. “What can you say, it’s the same for everybody. Hospitality has been the worst hit. “A lot of people can work from home and people can go on furlough and get a big percentage of their wages. “But pub owners like ourselves who aren’t a limited company, our income has just stopped.” William McGuinness and his business partner Phil Nolan took the decision to close two days before the busiest date on the calendar for Irish bars - St Patrick’s Day. googletag.cmd.push They did so in the interests of public health.  The men also own The Gweedore and Fty Seven nightclub which sit next door to Peadar’s on Waterloo Street. Along with other publicans in the city, they took a ‘massive’ financial hit by closing. At the time British Prime Minister Boris Johnson stalled before announcing that all non-essential businesses would close on March  – his delayed response was viewed as a mistake. Speaking to the Derry News over the weekend, Mr McGuinness said he didn’t expect to be closed a full year later. “I don’t think anybody could have thought it would be like this a year down the line. We were hoping for some kind of resolution in the summer, whatever that would have been,” he added.     While open for a five-week period when restrictions were eased the atmosphere wasn’t the same. Mr McGuiness explained: “We’re used to big crowds of people enjoying the live music. “But when we had to put social distancing in place our capacity was slashed even more than other people because it was standing room only in Paedar’s for people at the weekend. “So people sitting two metres apart just wasn’t viable for us.” The Derry man previously said the business had taken a ‘massive hit’. Since then it has received ‘a bit more help’ in terms of financial support from the government and workers have been supported through the furlough scheme. “From a personal point of view, Phil and me are sole traders and we haven’t received anything but we’re a victim of our own success because that’s based on business up to ,” he said. SUMMER PINTS  Stormont ministers recently agreed additional funding to support businesses and jobs during the pandemic. Finance Minister Conor Murphy proposed extending rates relief for another  months for almost , businesses, in a package worth poundm. Mr McGuiness said pubs couldn’t be charged rates as it is based on the annual level of turnover and that amounts to ‘zero’ at present. He’s happy to put  in the rear-view mirror and hopes toto ‘some sort of normality’ in . The reopening of all businesses will be informed by the NI Executive’s five-step plan for easing the Covid- lockdown restrictions. In England some pubs could open as early as April  and hospitality venues in Scotland on April . NIs ‘pathway’ does not include a timetable but will depend on public health criteria being met. The Executive will review its restrictions each month starting tomorrow and continuing until June . Based on the easing of restrictions in the past it’s anticipated that pubs will be at the back of the queue. Mr McGuinness believes the ideal scenario is to see punters with a fresh pint of Guinness in their hands on Waterloo Street by early summer. “We’re hoping to get back to some sort of normality this year,” he said. “The vaccine programme seems to be going well but it’s a bit of an unknown quantity with these iants. “The government is being very careful about reopening because of the fear of another spike and that’s understandable.” He continued: “It’s likely that bars that don’t serve food will be the last to open again but the last time it was a bit of a fiasco, it just didn’t work because people were anxious to get out. “I have my eyes set on early summer. “The Council and City Centre Initiative are trying to come up with schemes to make outside drinking a bit more appealing so hopefully that will help.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

They say Creggan is being treated as a place apart where highly aggressive policing tactics are serving to alienate the community. It comes after the PSNI carried out a search and arrest operation in Creggan yesterday morning namedOperation Ledging - looking specically at the New IRA’s bomb making activities as well as the group’s storage of explosive devices and equipment. googletag.cmd.push This morning a court was told that around  police Land Rovers and many more officers arrived in the Ballymagowan area of Creggan just after am on March . A solicitor questioned the timing of the incident, directly after St. Patricks Day, and what he described as a heavy handed approach. That view was shared by Foyle MLA Karen Mullan who said the PSNI had questions to answer, particularly regarding heavy handed tactics on women. A Creggan motherwas handcuffed and pinned to the ground by police raiding a neighbour’s home. The woman concerned said she has been left with bruising to her arms and stomach. googletag.cmd.push She explained that the incident began when her daughter, who was in distress, was pushed against a jeep. Following the operation, one man was taken to Musgrave Serious Crime Suite for questioning and two other men were charged with assaulting police officers. Now, a spokesperson for CNP and CE has criticised the police operation, saying: It has become clear that the PSNI are treating Creggan as a place apart – a testing ground for highly aggressive, unnecessary and inappropriate policing tactics which only serve to alienate this community even further. Many who witnessed the outworking of this -hour operation, carried out in Creggan yesterday, have commented that police action was heavy-handed and disproportionate.     Certainly mobile phone footage of some of these incidents, circulating on social media, supports these claims. Police engagement with Creggan residents saw two local men and a number of young people injured and a woman thrown to the ground and knelt on by several officers. A heavily armed police presence remained in the area throughout the day into the evening and incited large crowds of young people, building tensions in the community. A small number of local youth workers and community workers were present throughout the day - observing the activity and helping to calm the situation. He added: CNP and CE are growing increasingly concerned at the nature of profiling which this community and its residents are facing. The politics of demonisation, criminalisation and felon-setting are failed policies of the past and are counterproductive to the notion of peacebuilding and conflict transformation. The end result of these tactics is the creation of a sub-class of people, an entire community profiled and its public image reputation blackened. A supposedly ‘end-justies-the-means’ approach to policing this community is alienating a new generation and disconnecting them completely from all systems of governance. This situation will not improve by itself – we need a comprehensive review of policing activity in this community, and we call for senior representatives of civic society and the community, to speak out and demand independent scrutiny.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Reporter: Liam Tunney::  Mar   addthis, With the county clinging to nostalgia as a coping mechanism, Liam Tunney spoke to Maghera psychologist Sarah Connell about the phenomenon. She sees a renewed hope at the end of what has been a busy year.Having a baby and moving house are well up the list of les most stressful activities, but doing both amid a pandemic adds an extra layer of challenge. “The last month or two has been very stressful between moving house and having the baby. Equally, Ive also really enjoyed it,” she told the County Derry Post. “Ive loved the home-schooling. I love working with my wee girl because she enjoys doing it and that makes it so much easier.” The increase in mental health problems related to the pandemic means Sarah has had an increase in enquiries. She feels part of the reason for the downturn in the countrys mental health is because, last March, no one had foreseen the situation dragging on to mark an anniversary. googletag.cmd.push Sarah is looking forward to meeting clients face-to-face again. “Its taken a lot of people by surprise and people are suffering because of the fact its still going on,” she said. “Theyre feeling disheartened and there is a lot of loneliness for people. Some are on their own, having to isolate by themselves and thats what Im seeing a lot of. “Everyone has been personally affected in some way, but I think its really important for us to take comfort from things that have happened in the past. “If you think about what people went through during World War One and World War Two, le does go on and good things do still happen.” googletag.cmd.push Last year, we discussed the outpouring of nostalgia that had emerged during the lockdown, as people reached for happy memories to stave off the misery. One year on, the phenomenon appears to have dissipated, with people now looking towards the future, something Sarah feels is the way to move forward. “If we can focus on the glimmers of hope and positivity, it can see us through,” she said. “There is a -year old Hungarian gymnast – Agnes Keleti - who escaped Nazi death camps during the war and went on to win Olympic medals. “She believed in looking to the present and the future. We can take comfort from people like that and it helps us know that we can get through this.”     As we follow the governments pathway out of lockdown, there could well be a period of adjustment for people while thingsto normal.  “Its going to be challenging, because you start to get used to things the way they are,” said Sarah. “As much as people are talking about the lack of enjoyment, there is still going to be an element of feeling like this is reality. “It seems crazy, because its such a long time since we had our old normal, readjusting to that is going to be dficult for people.” Sarah is casting hopeful eyes towards the future. “I miss seeing my clients face to face. Its online and that works well for most people, but that one-to-one interaction is something you cant beat,” she said. “I think its just important that people take comfort in knowing things will improve. Im also really looking forward to being able to go out for a meal again!”  Related: COVID ONE YEAR ON: A week of fear, uncertainty and panic-buying COVID ONE YEAR ON: Dancing community missing the buzz a year later COIVD ONE YEAR ON: Clear dference in NI and Italys Coronavirus response COVID ONE YEAR ON: Two steps forward and twenty steps backward COVID ONE YEAR ON:No honeymoon yet for last couple married before lockdown  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

They told Liam Tunney they still havent had the chance to go on honeymoon.Rosemarie and Sean Lynn, from Dungiven, woke up almost a year ago oblivious to the fact they would end the day as newlyweds. “It was crazy to look back on. How many people wake up in the morning not realising they are getting married that night ” said Rosemarie. “We were driving about in the limousine that night and I remember saying to my bridesmaid Karen do you realise there is nobody  in the whole of the UK doing what were doing right now  “It was the best decision weve ever made to get married and do it that way, keeping it simple.” googletag.cmd.push Sean and Rosemarie Lynn. They didnt know it then, but keeping it simple was to become everyones long-term mantra. With Rosemarie furloughed, she and Sean have been working on the family farm. “We have the farm, so theres never a dull moment. Theres always something to do on the farm,” said Rosemarie. “Before, we were out doing loads of dferent things, so we have just learned to take a step back. You can still enjoy yourself and have fun spending time together doing the simple things too.” Sean was well-prepared. His father, who passed away in , had always issued a simple but profound piece of advice keep le simple, Sean. googletag.cmd.push “I was just thinking the day I got married, there were only four of us and it was simple. I hope its left an example to people,” said Sean. “We never really got a proper honeymoon, just a couple of days here and there, but wed love to get to Poland further down the line.”  Seans work in the ambulance service has also kept him busy over the last year, with -hour shts occasionally stretching to  or  hours, but things are more settled now. “There have been a lot of late finishes over the last year,” he said. “Back when we were getting married, lockdown had come in and it was really just work, eat and sleep, but its definitely eased off. Everything seems to be coming down a bit.”     When not on the farm, the couple have been looking after their new puppy, Midas, while also passing the time ing into TV box sets, with Prison Break and Money Heist on the must-watch list. Looking to the future, there is one thing in particular Mr and Mrs Lynn intend to remedy as soon as restrictions permit. “I just cant wait to go out for a bite to eat. We loved eating out. Im big into my health and fitness and stuff, but I just loved getting out for a wee treat,” said Rosemarie. “I think even going to the cinema will be a big thing for us. Sean would be very spontaneous, he loves to take a notion of heading away for the day, so even doing that will be great. “Nobody knows really whats happening, youre just waiting on things to open back up again and get back to normal.”  Related: COVID ONE YEAR ON: A week of fear, uncertainty and panic-buying COVID ONE YEAR ON: Dancing community missing the buzz a year later COIVD ONE YEAR ON: Clear dference in NI and Italys Coronavirus response COVID ONE YEAR ON: Two steps forward and twenty steps backward COVID ONE YEAR ON: Find the glimmer of hope and cling to it  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

People should refrain from the temptation to meet-up, particularly at this sensitive time, when we are trying to come out of the Covid crisis.     “People should continue to work together as a community, to look after each other and incidents like the two I have mentioned is not helping us.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Hyndmans of Maghera was founded in  and had served the community of County Derry and beyond since with its baked goods. In an understated sign-off, the company simply printed a short message of thanks to all its customers on its final batch of products. “Thank you for your loyalty over  years,” it read. As news of the closure began to break online, hundreds of people shared happy memories of the company and its impact on the area. “This is a sad day for Maghera and indeed the rest of the local area and further afield,” said photographer David A Scott, leading the tributes. googletag.cmd.push “To many they are a institution, one that we all grew up with and one that will be sadly missed, not only by the customers but by the employees and their families who relied on them for their livelihood.” Former customer Paula McCormack said it was a terrible loss to the area. The gates of Hyndmans were locked last Friday. “I hope their workers have been able to get jobs. Their bread was delicious, especially fruit cake and their sodas were the best in the country.” However, fans of the bakery have been buoyed by news that a number of the bakerys staff will be continuing to work in the area. googletag.cmd.push Former Hyndmans staff Geoff Lee, Nigel Chambers and Sandra McDonald have linked up with Berties Bakery in Magherafelt, who announced the news the same day Hyndmans ceased production. “Hyndmans was an institution in its own right and we were sorry to hear of their closing,” they said. “Bertie’s is however delighted that we have been able to help three of their staff into key roles within our business and perhaps in some way we will be able to keep what was best about Hyndmans alive. “Sandra will be helping us with our new cake and traybake ranges, while Geoff and Nigel bring a wealth of experience particularly in Soda Breads.”     Former Hyndmans customers will be happy to see their favourite soda bread recipe live on.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Irish juveniles are strong in the shape of Quilixios and Zanahiyr but the manner in which Tritonic scooted clear of rivals in the Adonis at Kempton last time out really caught the eye on identical ground to this week. Even on soft with a touch of heavy on his prior start, he stayed on well to catch Casa Loupi at Ascot, the same horse he beat by  s in Kempton. There isnt much between the Irish pair based on form but I would lean towards Quilixios based on the way he finished out his race at Leopardstown, beating Saint Sam and Busselton, in February. googletag.cmd.push .pm -McCoy Contractors County Handicap Hurdle I wouldnt have a strong opinion on this race this year but I am tempted to have an eachway nibble on GOWEL ROAD  for Nigel and Sam Twiston-Davies. Hes won his last two starts quite easily and I like his form behind Bear Ghylls who ran well to be fourth behind Bob Olinger in the Ballymore here on Wednesday. Gowel Road finished just one and a half s behind Bear Ghylls at Ffos Las last November. .pm -Albert Bartlett Novices Hurdle Im going for STREETS OF DOYEN  who is proven over course and trip and has plenty to offer at a big price. He ran a stinker at Naas last time out wearing cheekpieces but I am hoping he can bounce back. Prior to that blip, he had put together four wins on the spin, including at Cheltenham last October when he beat Minella Encore by three and a half s on similar ground. That was over the same trip as todayand he even won over three miles on good ground in Gowran last year where he beat Flooring Porter by five s. Based on that, even though he got plenty of weight from his rival, there is more to come from him and he could still be on a decent mark. He is overpriced at   and can hopefully give a good account again. googletag.cmd.push .pm -Wellchild Cheltenham Gold Cup Chase AL BOUM PHOTO  will aim to emulate Arkle and Best Mate in winning three Cheltenham Gold Cups. I genuinely hope he does it for Willie Mullins who waited until this horses win in  to get his hands on the Gold Cup. He is the quintessential Gold Cup horse now and so lightly raced for that very reason to have him primed for Prestbury Park. He is going into the race this year with an identical prep to last year. In , he beat Acapella Bourgeois at Tramore on New Years Day before going to Cheltenham and winning the Gold Cup in March. Again in , he raced and won at Tramore on New Years Day he even beat the same horse in Acapella Bourgeois, only this time by further. It willtake something special to stop him. The story for the UK contingent will be the horse named after AP McCoy and trained by Nicky Henderson. CHAMPwas dead and buried, fully  s behind the leaders jumping the last in the RSA last season, but somehow managed to reel in and beat Allaho and Minella Indo on the line. The field couldnt run down Al Boum Photo up the hill in the last two years butone horse can, its Champ, and what a story it would be for AP McCoy and owner JP McManus. A Plus Tard represents the powerful Henry De Bromhead Racheal Blackmore pairing but I was disappointed with his run in defeat to Min in last years Ryanair. I cant make a strong enough case for anything  at the minute and   is a nice price for Al Boum Photo, perhaps the most under-celebrated horse in training.     .pm -St. Jamess Place Festival Challenge Cup Open Hunters Chase I think Billaway is the most likely winner of this race for Willie Mullins. He was second to the reopposing It Came To Pass in this last year but has been more consistent since. For me,   is too short and the Hunters chase is a race for an eachway bet for me. The winner was   last year to that will show you that anything can happen in this race. I am going for a bit of a risky one with MR MANTILLA . He was been picking up wins on the Irish point-to-point scene most recently beating Bellow Mome from the Willie Mullins yard at Stradbally in December. He beat Rewritetherules in November and the same horse was th behind Billaway at Down Royal a month later. Its not exactly a clean line to run through the form but Im willing to take a risk that Mr Mantilla is good enough to get involved here. The Hunters chase is always a fascinating race. Dont discount the Enda Bolger runners either. He won this race in  and  with On The Fringe. .pm -Mrs Paddy Power Mares Chase I think ELIMAY  has a touch of class about her and can get the better of this field for Willie Mullins, JP McManus and jockey Mark Walsh. She has won three out of her four chase starts with her only defeat coming at the hands of stablemate Allaho. She beat Shattered Love easily by five s at Naas last time out and a step up in trip and drying ground is all in her favour. Id be surprisedshe isnt odds-on before the start, particularly after Allahos exceptional win on Thursday. .pm -Martin Pipe Conditional Jockeys Handicap Hurdle Gentleman De Mee is the favourite for Willie Mullins but Im going for GALOPIN DES CHAMPS  from the same stable. This one is very interesting based on his run behind Appreciate It at Leopardstown. He was just nine s behind Tuesdays runaway winner of the Supreme and looking through the field, that was a very hot race. Ballyadam, second in the Supreme a few days ago, was second that day in Leopardstown while Blue Lord, who would have been second on Tuesday had he not fallen at the last, was third. The selection here was only a couple of s off that pair in Leopardstown and could be suited by the step up in trip here to M F.

Declan Devine’s team barely threatened throughout and they were second best to a Longford team who showed a great hunger and desire to win in their first game in the Premier Division since . City were almost caught out within two minutes as Ciaran Coll lost out in a challenge in midfield and the home side broke forward. Eoin Toal was faced with two Longford attackers and they worked it well, Rob Manley playing in Dylan Grimes, but with Darren Cole closing in, he curled his shot beyond Nathan Gartside but just wide of goal. googletag.cmd.push A spirted start from Longford got its reward just  minutes into the game when Grimes received the ball on the right corner of the penalty area, and easily got the better of Danny Lafferty before racing into the box and drilling the ball right across goal. A number of players bore down on goal and that may have affected Gartside, as the ball went untouched into the far corner of the net to give the home side the lead. It was a poor first half overall for Derry, but Longford goalkeeper Lee Stacey was finally called into action just before the break a City finally managed a shot on target. A cross from Fitzgerald fell for Parkhouse, who, off balance, did well to swivel and met the ball with his left foot, but the shot was too close to Stacey who was able to save. googletag.cmd.push Declan Devine made two substitutions at the break, with both Danny Lupano and Jack Malone coming on for Darren Cole and James Akintunde. But a series of half chances from corners aside, City rarely looked threatening. The game’s decisive moments came after the -minute mark when, moments after Malone went down in the area, Longford broke and won a free kick. Aodh Dervin went for the shot and Gartside could only parry straight into the path of Gorman, who couldn’t miss from two yards as Longford doubled their lead. It quickly could have got even worse for Derry as a confident Devin went for goal again – this time from  yards and his effort had Garside scrambling before it crashed back off the crossbar, as Longford threatened to embarrass Derry.      Teams LONGFORD: Lee Stacey, Paddy Kirk, Dean Zambra, Dylan Grimes, Rob Manley , Aaron O’Driscoll, Aaron Bolger , Aodh Dervin, Karl, Dean Byrne , Joe Gorman. DERRY CITY: Nathan Gartside, Danny Lafferty, Eoin Toal, Cameron McJannett , Darren Cole , Ciaran Coll, Ciaron Harkin, Will Patching, Will Fitzgerald , James Akintunde , David Parkhouse.

The -year-old has seen some dark days at Derry City, much worse then this in fact, so he is not going to panic over a poor performance and a poor result in the first game of a new season. That said, he still hates the feeling of losing and he admits that on this occasion, Derry City just weren’t good enough. “We started off slowly and gave away a few silly goals,” he reflected. “We knew that they were going to come out fast. They weren’t going to lie down to us and they got off to a really good start. I thought we had a few chances where we could have equalised but as the time went on, we weren’t making any clear-cut chances. It wasn’t to be today but hopefully it is in a few weeks’ time.” googletag.cmd.push This was Toal’s first game since being made permanent captain, and it did not go the way he had hoped in any sense.  “It wasn’t an ideal start but it isn’t about me,” he said. “It’s about the team, and we just need to stick together for the next game. “We want to win every game we play because we are playing for Derry City and it is a massive, massive club and I’ve said this before, but we don’t go anywhere to get beat. We just started off slowly and there were a few silly mistakes.” As an attacking force, City were almost non-existent against Longford, but Toal believes that luck did just not fall City’s way on a number of occasions, particularly from set-plays. googletag.cmd.push “We knew that maybe we could get a few goals from set-pieces because we’re a big enough side but it just didn’t fall for us tonight but on another night it just might,” he said. “I thought we went more direct after the second goal went in. I didn’t think the second goal was coming. I thought we had a few chances from set-pieces and maybe we could grab one. I thought we could grab one late on because we were on top but it wasn’t to be.” Looking ahead With this week’s game against Shamrock Rovers set to be postponed due to Nathan Gartside’s international call-up, Derry have a two-week break before their next game. Toal believes they can can use that time to understand what went wrong in Longford.     “I wouldn’t say that we have a lot to work on but we have time to reflect and analyse the game and analyse where we went wrong and look forward to the next game,” he continued. “We have two weeks before our next game so we have got to regroup and we have to stick together. The games are going to be coming thick and fast so we need to stick together. We know we are a new team and we’ll need time to come together but there are no real excuses – we started off slow and made two mistakes for the goals, and that should be better.” There were a number of surprise results on the first weekend of Airtricity League action, and Toal knows that the mood can sht quickly with victory in the next game.  “There’s no time to feel sorry for ourselves,” he agreed. “We’ll be back into training and we need to work together and stay together. There are going to be a lot of games coming up and the boys are going to be looking to get into the team and improve and that’s the main thing, to keep working hard.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

At this stage,  countries were affected, with , confirmed cases and more than , deaths.One year on, there have been  million confirmed cases globally and more than . million deaths from Covid-. In Northern Ireland, there have been , cases and over , deaths.Pandemic is not a word to use lightly or indeed carelessly, but when Prime Minister Boris Johnston mdash who himself who ended up in hospital with the virus mdash went on national television on March  last year, he appealed to people to stay at home to stop the spread of the virus.His appeal, broadcast by every major UK television and radio network, resulted in the immediate implementation of a series of unprecedented measures.Town centres across the district were locked down and deserted and people asked to act responsibly and do all they could to halt the spread of the disease by adhering to public health advice.In the wake of the Prime Ministerrsquos address, church leaders in Downpatrick and the surrounding area appealed for ldquoprayer, unity and calm as the coronavirus threat deepened.With public worship one of lockdownrsquos many casualties, a number of services moved on-line as churches embraced st century technology to provide people with much-needed hope at a time of need and reassurance.Newry, Mourne and Down Council, with the help of the Department for Communities, led from the front locally and was instrumental in helping distribute hundreds of food parcels to people across the area who were not allowed to leave home.The districtrsquos foodbanks had to respond to a major increase in demand, which was eased by the generosity of iniduals and groups across the district, with many sports clubs helping distribute food parcels.The pandemic united people like never before as the challenge of dealing with the global virus increased daily. Sadly, today, the UK has one of the highest per capita death rates from Covid in the world.As politicians prepare to slowly ease lockdown restrictions over the coming weeks, the district is bracing itself for ato normality, but exactly how normal le will be remains uncertain at this stage.The past  months have been le-changing, with people hoping that the light at the end of the tunnel will soon be shining like a beacon..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/17Mar2021-Dancers.jpg","title":"Dancers make the best of lockdown  ","story":"A CROSSGAR Irish dance school is trying to keep spirits raised during the lockdown.Owing to Covid restrictions, Irish dancers have not been allowed to attend classes in person since November last year.However this has not deterred Chris Owens, Bridget Madden and Brid McKinney, dance teachers at Scoil Rince an Chroiacute from motivating dancers who have continued to go from strength to strength.Briacuted said: ldquoIt has been extremely challenging times. Even when restrictions were eased in November we were not allowed toto our dance studio.ldquoHowever, rather than give into adversity, we have embraced as many aspects of digital technology as possible to teach our dancers.Consequently when Scoil Rince an Chroi were able to participate in a virtual online feis in March, they did so with resounding success.Chris explained: ldquoWhen the results came in, to say we are over the moon is an understatement.ldquoThe competition was open to dancers across Ulster across in all age groups. Our results were amazing including three championship wins,  top five championship places,  first places,  second places, nine third places. Overall we achieved  places in the top  per cent of competitions.Competing in an online feis is just the tip of the iceberg of the work Scoil Rince an Chroiacute have engaged with during lockdown.Using Zoom technology, dancers have continued to learn and perfect performances three times a week with their teachers.Through virtual learning forums and social s such as Google classroom and WhatsApp, daily challenges have been sent to dancers.Recognising the strain restrictions are having on young people, this forward thinking dance school implemented a lsquoMonday Mindfulnessrsquo programme during the February.A iety of activities were presented each Monday to keep spirits high including baking together and goal setting.The dance school also organised a class quiz for the whole family using Kahoot. The finale of the February activities was a live virtual meet with River Dance star Amymae Dolan.One dance parent, Helen, said: ldquoIrish dancing has been a godsend during restrictions for my daughter.

Council confirmed at a meeting last night that there were  reported fly-tipping incidents last year, compared to  in .Between  and  over , fly tipping incidents were reported to the local authority while, incredibly, during the first two months of this year, council officials have already received reports of  fly-tipping incidents across the district.During the height of the coronavirus pandemic between March and December last year, there were  illegal dumping incidents, compared to  over the same period in .The figures made public at last nightrsquos meeting of the councilrsquos Neighbourhood Services Committee revealed that the average number of fly tipping incidents across the district rose from  each week to  for a period last year, before dipping back to .News of the scale of the fly-tipping issue comes after a large consignment of tyres was dumped illegally last week outside Killyleagh.Around  tyres were found dumped at the Scaddy Road and Greystown Road, while, there was more fly-tipping at an illegal dumping hot spot at Ardilea, near Clough, where an old washing machine and other household debris was dumped.In a bid to call time on the illegal dumpers, the local council has employed additional enforcement officers and drawn up a new plan to deal with fly-tipping and dog fouling issues.In addition, two more seasonal enforcement staff are to be appointed next week as the local authority braces itself for a busy spring and summer.Council officials have also confirmed that they are exploring the possibility of using mobile CCTV to catch those who fly-tip which could include enforcement staff wearing body-cams as part of an evidence gathering initiative.In the summer, a new awareness programme to highlight fly-tipping and dog fouling issues across the district will be rolled out by the local authority, while consideration is being given to introducing a new community fund to support anti-littering and dog fouling initiatives across the district.During the last financial year the local authority issued  fixed penalty notices to litter louts, with  of the offenders paying up. Eight fixed penalty notices for dog fouling were issued over the same period.Rowallane area councillor Billy Walker, who was alerted to the dumped tyres outside Killyleagh, said there were people who viewed secluded rural areas as open air dumping grounds.ldquoThis behaviour must stop, he declared. ldquoThe tyres dumped outside Killyleagh had been left in three dferent areas and I hope that whoever was responsible for this illegal dumping incident will be caught and that the courts will impose a penalty which sends out a clear signal that this behaviour will not be tolerated and has no place in any civilised society.ldquoCouncil officers visited the Scaddy and Gregstown roads looking for evidence and the issue has also been reported to the Environment Agency. Incidents of this nature are happening all too often across the district.Cllr Walker says there have been recent reports of tyres dumped where in the Rowallane area including Ballynahinch and Saintfield.ldquoThe number of fly-tipping incidents reported across the district makes uncomfortable reading and the ironic thing is that those responsible for dumping waste end up paying for its removal through the rates and taxes, he said.ldquoIt is clear that a van or lorry was used to dump the tyres in Killyleagh and I would appeal to anyone who knows anything about this incident to contact the council or the police. This behaviour must not be allowed to continue.Cllr Walker said while local authority officials are doing their best to get on top of the fly-tipping issue, their efforts are being hindered by some in the community who have no respect for their own areas and communities.He added: ldquoFly-tipping and dog fouling issues are a scourge on our district and while additional enforcement officers have been recruited, the battle to address illegal dumping starts with those who engage in such behaviour.

Something for everyone.It is extremely hard work to organise, but seeing the smiles of those taking part and hearing the cheering onlookers makes it all worthwhile.Roll back to the same weekend in  and it was a bleak day in the history of the race. Just like yesterday the place was deserted.Jimmyrsquos K has been in the calendar since  and has taken place every year since with only two hitches ndash foot and mouth in  and an lsquoout of the bluersquo snow day in  caused postponement, but only by a short space of time.The pandemic that struck in  totally overshadowed these minor interruptions.Covid- had been appearing in the headlines for a few weeks by then, but initially it seemed to be a remote problem confined to China and other places overseas, yet suddenly it was on our doorstep and a very real threat.The powers that be were issuing bulletins to inform us all of what restrictions might be imposed and yet it still seemed asthe race would go ahead as there was no direct order to cease.The race committee met daily and then had almost hourly gatherings as the situation closed in.When schools and work places were told to prepare for closure and the government was using the word lockdown, it was decided that it was best to communicate to all that the race would not take place.After doing all the hard work, it was a bitter pill to swallow but taken in the context of what some had to face in their lives, it was just a fact of le and a line was drawn. We all hunkered down and waited for the storm to pass.Little did we know then that a year later that we would still be under orders to socially distance, to work from homepossible and to avoid unnecessary journeys, etc.We would have found it hard to envisage how work and home le would be impacted and that sport would be universally curtailed.Initially we had rolled over all the entries from the  race to the corresponding date in , but in December it was obvious that a race in March would not be feasible.We took a decision to push the date back in the hope that a race in  would still happen. At that time, we chose June  as the new date, but the recent lsquoRoadmap to Recoveryrsquo has caused a rethink.The good news is that with the uptake of the vaccine and the fall in numbers regarding infection rates and hospital cases, things are moving in the right direction, but by stalling for a couple more weeks, we feel that there will be further easing of limits.We are awaiting the next Executive update in the hope that club training might be able to take place in the not too distant future and that competition will follow. So we have rebooked a date for Jimmyrsquos  mdash Sunday, June .All  entrants have been carried over and East Down AC greatly appreciate the understanding of the runners and other clubs.We know that it is not ideal that changes are made and we all prefer certainty and being able to train for a set goal, but we are trying to make the best out of a dficult situation.Racing has been thin on the ground in the last  months so organisers and athletes are equally keen to get back in action. might seem distant now, but the photos in the archives remind us of the good times.That year was a bumper entry and the race was a huge success. We have to hold on to those memories for now and tell ourselves that we will enjoy it all the more for the long wait.The club is very excited at the prospect of hosting old friends and new and it will be a happy day for all concerned.Once all the deferrals are accounted for, It is hoped that extra places will also go on sale.These will be advertised in the Down Recorder, as well as at www.eastdownac and on the EDAC Facebook page, so keep an eye out..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/17Mar2021-Peace.jpg","title":"Peace maze among top worldwide attractions  ","story":"THERE will be no surprise locally that the stunning peace maze in the sweeping grounds of Castlewellan Forest Park has been included in a prestigious list of post-lockdown international attractions.Previously listed among ldquoonce famous world attractions, the maze commands stunning views towards the majestic Mourne Mountains sweeping down to the Irish Sea.Travel website Loveholidays has been looking into Guinness World Record books to discover previous record-holding places to visit.The site, which lists eight attractions across Europe, Asia and North America, features Castlewellan Forest Park, where the maze is considered to have one of the most outstanding tree and shrub collections in Europe.And it is in good company in the list, joined by the CN Tower in Toronto and the Stade de France in Paris among others.

All of this, of course, at a cost to the public purse.Republicans loudly demand special treatment for their culture to be celebrated and acknowledge across Northern Ireland. At the same time they refuse Unionists space for a monument, at zero cost to the public, commemorating the state they jointly govern.One can only hope that unionists remember how their modest request was treated when the Irish language legislation comes before the assembly. That will be the time at which unionism in showing a united front, as it did when requesting the monument, can deliver something of substance for their community.Samuel Morrison, TUV Dromore, Co Down• Leaked DUP minutes show dismay at party’s direction——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

And there is.The Line of Duty webinar, which was hosted by journalist Rebecca Nicholson, involved creator and writer Jed Mercurio, producer Simon Heath and stars Vicky McClure, Adrian Dunbar and Kelly Macdonald. All six of them occupied their own little box on my laptop screen at the same time.All of the journalists on the call were hidden from sightand able to ask questions by typing them via the QA tab.

That chronological order just wasn’t possible because we were bound by location and safety.”She added: “There was talk of us doing our own makeup, I was sad that didn’t happen, evenjust for one day to see how it would have panned out.”Adrian commented: “Because it’s taken so long to do it, when I saw the trailer the other day it was quite a shock to me.World Productions - Photographer: Steffan Hill\" \"\" width\"\" srcset\"https:www.newsletter webimg TUFZMTINTINjY.jpg width w, https:www.newsletter webimg TUFZMTINTINjY.jpg width w\" layout\"intrinsic\" class\"i-amphtml-layout-intrinsic i-amphtml-layout-size-defined\" i-amphtml-layout\"intrinsic\"\"World Productions - Photographer: Steffan Hill\" fallback layout\"responsive\" \"\" width\"\" src\" img placeholder.png\" class\"i-amphtml-layout-responsive i-amphtml-layout-size-defined\" i-amphtml-layout\"responsive\"DS Steve Arnott World Productions - Photographer: Steffan Hill“Suddenly I saw the whole storyline compressed.

He obviously chilled out like we all did. “He had to self-isolate for two weeks because he was coming over from Vegas, production got him a bike for his flat and he just ate soup for two weeks.” This season’s guest star is Kelly Macdonald who plays DCI Joanne Davidson.She said: “I was completely aware of Line of Duty though I hadn’t watched it. It occurred to me the other day I spent a number of years in New York filming, and I missed a huge amount of British pop culture. “When I came back after I finished Boardwalk Empire, I missed a lot of TV, there was people I didn’t know, comedians I didn’t recognise that were really popular. Line of Duty happened while I was away as did Broadchurch.“When I got the offer I thought I should really sit down and see what [Line of Duty] is.”She admitted the technical dialogue has proven tricky: “I knew it was going to be great, dramatic, compelling. The shock really was when I was sent the first episode and I started reading it on a train up to Glasgow from London. I was happily reading then suddenly there was this massive long bit of dialogue about stuff I’d never heard of, then I turned the page and it kept going. It went on and on and on like that. “There was no doubt in my mind that I was going to say yes, but I did have to go over that obstacle in my mind. I did know it was going to be quite challenging.“We would be on set and we would go through a scene, there would be certain acronyms we would discuss at the time, also in hair and makeup there was a list pinned up that was quite helpful I found.“I’m not brilliant at it still but I sort of get by.”In terms of keeping storylines secret Kelly said: “People have been really excited from the get go and knew more about it than me. They were screaming in my face, ‘Am I H, Am I H ’ I didn’t know what it meant. I wear a chain with a K round my neck, I was thinking of getting one with an H just to mess with them.“Everybody asks, they’re desperate to know, but before you can even think how to respond they immediately say, ‘I don’t want to know’.”Line of Duty regular Vicky and this season’s guest star Kelly found they had a shared hobby which helped pass the time between shoots.Kelly said: “In the first few days we realised we shared the passion for jigsaws.“It’s so funny because lots of people got into jigsaws because of the worldwide pandemic, but we got into them before that.”“We’re so rock and roll,” said Vicky.She added: “Kelly brought in a jigsaw which will stress me out forever. It was the hardest jigsaw I’ve ever seen. We never got round to finishing it.”The girls described it as a mosaic of a woman on a balcony, mostly stonework, which was all the same colour.Kelly said: “That jigsaw was haunting my house forever. I kept bringing it out, I would attempt it, it would gather dust, I’d put it back in the box again.”Vicky said: “Sometimes in filming you’re standing round for half an hour waiting for something to be done, so it’s great we’ve got this jigsaw out on the table. “Literally there would be a piece that would be driving me nuts and they’d be, ‘Vicky, we need you on set’ and I’d be like ‘nooooooo’. It was consuming us. There were a few jigsaws we did, that was one we didn’t finish.”Some videos from the set of Vicky’s attempts to prank Martin have been shared.“I have handed a few of those over to the BBC for your delight,” said Vicky.“I love a blooper reel. I think it’s great that we’re quite open with the audience, going behind the curtain so to speak. “We have a laugh. With the phone that we’ve got now it’s impossible for me not to capture some of the funny things that go on on set.”Vicky also turned Adrian Dunbar into a TikTok sensation.Adrian said: “She just ambushes you. She says, ‘I’m doing this thing for charity, just say this, blah, blah, blah’. You do it because you trust her, sadly though on some occasions you shouldn’t. “On that occasion she just ran in and said, ‘I’m going to play this bit of music, dance along to it’. I thought what is this about... TikTok. Within three or four days a million people had watched it.”Discussing Ted Hasting’s idioms which have taken on a le of their own, Adrian said: “We do ask the audience, is there any you think Ted would say that’s a real Belfast idiom ”In the first episode of series six Ted orders Steve to ‘houl yer whist’. Adrian said: “They’ve taken on a le of their own, haven’t they “People are playing bingo games, drinking games, you can do all kinds of things with the ‘fellas’ and the ‘Mother of Gods’ and all that sort of stuff.“The ‘Mother of God’ comes from my dad, he used to say it all the time, it’s kind of a nod towards him.“The police always say they know someone like Ted, whether he’s originally from Edinburgh or Cardf, there was always someone who was a bit of a Ted and comes out with those idioms. Kind of like Sam Allardyce... DC Allardyce. All that kind of management stuff – Alex Ferguson, Bill Shankley – they all have their little sayings and phrases.”Given that the likes of Line of Duty, Bloodlands, Marcella, Hope Street have been filmed in NI, Jed was asked is there something about the Province that makes it the perfect place to film crime drama He said: “It’s a good place, definitely. You’ve got a choice of fantastic locations, great crews and great facilities. It’s brilliant to see that Northern Ireland is being represented so well on screen.”Jed did not rule out killing off one of the golden trio of Superintendent Hastings, DS Arnott and DI Fleming.The Line of Duty creator said: “It’s never far from my thoughts. We all get on brilliantly but everyone knows we’re serving something bigger than ourselves which is Line of Duty, and one of things about the show is that nobody is safe, it’s what keeps the audience on the edge of their seat. “I know it would be a sad day but all the main cast know that it’s possible. “We joke about it, it’s something no one would relish but everyone would understand.”Asked how he keeps track of a complex story that has spanned six series, he said: “We have a great team, we have the resources of the previous scripts and episodes, we all are very familiar with things that have happened in the past and the cast remember things the characters have done in previous seasons. “When we want to create a connection with the past, often the thing we don’t quite know straight away is the exact detail, then it’s just a case of going back into the script and we can see exactly what date something was meant to happen, and the locations where it was meant to happen. “Even betterwe’ve got some visual reference, an image that’s in the AC- files of the past, that’s something that we do in this season. “We do delve into past cases a little bit and the way that we do that, like any police unit they keep records, when we dig into those files, hey presto we see reminders of previous seasons.”One of the ways in which past events are recapped are via new member of AC- DC Chloe Bishop, played by Shalom Brune-Franklin. Adrian said: “Shalom is fantastic, she’s absolutely wonderful. Especially because her character was given a lot of the back story that our characters needed. She had to learn huge amounts of stuff and carry a lot of information into scenes. She was really contentious, really clear, and a really wonderful actress to work with. A bang on piece of casting.”The trailer for season six hints that a fourth corrupt officer operating under the ‘H’ banner. Jed was askedhe knows how the H storyline will conclude. “Yes,” he said dryly. “Just as well really.”• Line of Duty s to BBC One on Sunday, March  at pm and is also on BBC iPlayerA message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

In the first episode Terry Boyle, a character with Down’s Syndrome, played by Tommy Jessop is interviewed as a suspect. Later Supt Ted Hastings, played by NI actor Adrian Dunbar, refers to him as ‘the local oddball’.After last night’s show Mr Gamble, who runs an organisation focused on safeguarding children online, tweeted: “Especially on the day that it is but also on any day, the script writer of #LineOfDuty needs to reflect on the line referring to a suspect with special needs being referred to as the local odd ball.”Mr Mercurio defended the use of the term oddball saying it “has no connotation for learning dficulties”. He said: “It describes a loner, an eccentric. The drama is using the term to refer to the Dando case, not to learning dficulties.”Read More Read MoreLine of Duty cast and crew reveal behind the scenes secretsMr Gamble suggested that Mr Mercurio “speak to some people who’ve worked in policing and with vulnerable people and see what they think about connotation in this context”.Mr Mercurio said Line of Duty worked with numerous police advisers and the programme portrayed “policing with some of its failings.”Mr Gamble said the use of the term “was foolish to say the least and shows an utter lack of understanding”. He said: “If you’re saying the head of professional standards would say that you need new police advisors.”Mr Mercurio said: “OK, Jim, you keep up your rose-tinted view of policing. The events of the last week was clearly just a mass delusion.”Many on social media supported Mr Gamble’s assertion that the line was inappropriate while some said TV drama needed to reflect what people might say.NI actor Charlie Lawson said that “writing must be totally real and no rules applied”.He said: “I think that’s exactly what the character would say. Good writing shouldn’t offend in context.”A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

We were surprised to learn that they were not collecting this information though.\"This is why we have put together the biggest survey of our industry ever undertaken in Wales. Companies big and small, venues, events, and every inidual involved in even the smallest way can contribute now.\"By giving us as little or as much as people are prepared to contribute, we can then provide the government with the much talked about data they say they need to see how valuable our wide ranging industry is to the Welsh economy, and how important it is to get it open again as soon as it is safe to.Alongside the survey, the group have also recently launched their own website which gives sector colleagues access to wellbeing and financial advice, access to a database of Welsh event organisers, suppliers and iniduals, as well as a forum to chat and exchange ideas ndash resources that the team believe is vitally important during the pandemic.MORE NEWS:We Make Events Cymru is in regular dialogue with Welsh Government to lobby, and is part of the working party preparing for Covid-safe outdoor and indoor test events.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe road would link Sycamore Cross on the A with Junction  of the M. A -week public consultation last year raised concerns about the impact on the environment and local communities.Responding to those concerns, the Vale of Glamorgan council has now said transport planners must analyse further how the road would fit in with the new context of Covid- and the climate emergency.In a report to the councilrsquos cabinet, which meets on Monday, March , detailed responses were given to the main concerns raised in the consultation. The cabinet will be asked to approve further analysis, before moving on to writing up a full business case for the road.The case for the road is to improve transport across the region, including to Cardf Airport, St Athanrsquos Enterprise Zone, and new housing developments. It would likely cost around pound million to build, and is dependent on funding from the Welsh Government.However, the proposals have drawn criticism from villagers in Pendoylan whose houses would be knocked down, cyclists using country lanes which could be blocked off, and Coed Cymru which has warned ancient woodland would be felled to make way for the road.Two options for the new road were consulted on: one to the east of Pendoylan and one to the west. The report revealed transport planners are edging towards the western route, as it is better value for money than the eastern one.As well as suggesting further analysis, the cabinet report addressed the main concerns including the impact on the climate, environment, walkers and cyclists, and uncertain future of the financially struggling Cardf Airport.On cycling, the new road would include a segregated lsquoactive travel routersquo for cyclists and walkers, the report said. Country lanes blocked off could have bridges or underpasses for walkers and cyclists to cross the new road.     MORE NEWS:The report said: ldquoThere is currently poor infrastructure and local connectivity by walking and cycling through the study area, and there is potential to implement new cycle connections. An active travel route is an integral component of the concept options.ldquoShould a preferred option progress to the next stage of assessment and a need to block the lanes confirmed, access for non-motorised users to safely cross under or over the bypass would be accommodated as part of the design.On climate change, campaigners raised concerns a new road would increase private car journeys and carbon emissions.Both the Welsh Government and the Vale council declared a climate emergency in , pledging to reduce carbon emissions in an effort to prevent catastrophic increases in global temperatures.A big part of the plan to reduce emissions in Wales is changing how people travel: fewer journeys in private cars and more by walking, cycling and in public transport.The report said further analysis would include a lsquocarbon assessment and climate resiliencersquo report, and would explore how to reduce the carbon impact of the road.It did not mention what these methods could include.Several areas of ancient woodland would have ldquovery large adverse impacts according to the report. But further assessment would examine the exact effects of the loss of that woodland.The report said: ldquoThe environmental assessment would examine the loss of woodland in terms of its use in flood retention, water quality, social value, carbon capture, landscape value and cultural heritage value, as well as its value to bioersity.If the ldquovery large adverse impacts canrsquot be avoided by redesigning the road, new trees could be planted where to compensate for the loss of ancient woodland.This would include moving and replanting some of the old trees and soil.The next stage would also include a wider, detailed environmental impact assessment, and recommendations on how to mitigate potential impacts on the environment surrounding the proposed road.Another concern raised has been the uncertain future of Cardf Airport, which was recently bailed out by the Welsh Government with a pound. million grant.But transport planners pointed to plans to make it easier to get to the airport on foot, by bike, bus, train, and in private motor vehicles.The cabinet report said: ldquoWhile recognising that the basis of future studies would increasingly need to consider the emerging trends and patterns resulting from Covid-, it is understood that the long-term vision of the airport remains at this present time.Responding to the report, campaigners have renewed calls for the Vale council to scrap the plans for the road altogether.A spokesperson for Vale Communities for Future Generations said: ldquoWhy the Vale of Glamorgan council is persisting in wasting public money on keeping this outdated road plan alive is hard to understand. The sheer volume of recent objections to the proposal clearly indicates the public has other priorities.ldquoThe original  Vale council assumption was that the road was needed for better vehicle access to Cardf Airport mdash which was denied by the airport management.ldquoSince then the airportrsquos passenger numbers have shrunk, millions of pounds of public money has been spent by the Welsh Government on propping it up financially and the future of air travel globally is uncertain post Covid  pandemic.ldquoThese are hardly the circumstances under which to continue promoting an expensive and environmentally destructive road building plan that was developed before the Vale of Glamorgan council and the Welsh Government declared a climate emergency in .ldquoIt is time for this plan to be recognised as a prime example of outdated thinking, and finally scrapped so that Vale of Glamorgan council can prioritise spending on environmentally sound projects. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
