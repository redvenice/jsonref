Wade Supreme Court decision that made abortion legal in most circumstances in the U.S.Kavanaugh had previously stated that the Roe v. Wade decision was ‘settled law’ in the country.The Maine Senator previously voted to confirm Kavanaugh after he was nominated by former President George W. Bush for the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in 2006.Despite her previous confirmation vote in favor of Kavanaugh, Collins has faced intense pressure to vote against his nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court. A group of progressive activists has reportedly raised more than $1.75 million (£1.3m) in crowdfunding and vowed to release the funds to her future campaign opponents if she indeed votes in favor of Kavanaugh’s confirmation.Both the campaign funds and confirmation vote could have a key impact on Collins’s future Senate race, as polls reportedly showed that Maine voters were less likely to support Collins if she voted to confirm Kavanaugh – even before the sexual misconduct allegations against him surfaced.Senator Lisa Murkowski – Republican from AlaskaMurkowski, much like Collins, has become known as one of the leading moderate Republicans in the U.S. Senate.The 61-year-old Senator, who has been a member of the legislative chamber since 2002, has been known as an independent voice during her tenure, supporting abortion rights and, alongside Collins, helping to scuttle an attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act signed by former President Barack Obama.Murkowski’s self-imposed test on the Kavanaugh confirmation vote comes, not from perilous reelection prospects – she’s not up for reelection until 2022 in a reliably Republican state – but whether women who allege that a sexual assault took place against them should be taken seriously.‘We are now in a place where it’s not about whether or not Judge Kavanaugh is qualified. It is about whether or not a woman who has been a victim at some point in her life is to be believed,’ she said.Murkowski, who soon joined fellow Republican Senator Jeff Flake in calling for an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, does indeed have a political balancing act to do ahead of the confirmation vote.The Senator has long been supported by Native Alaskans, whose backing of her could falter after it was revealed by Hawaii Senator Mazie K. Hirono that Kavanaugh appeared to question whether Native Hawaiians were a legitimate protected group.          Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski has a history of crossing party lines in the U.S. SenateSenator Jeff Flake – Republican from ArizonaFlake, 55, has long been a thorn in President Trump’s side. A vocal critic of the President who’s served in the U.S. Senate since 2013 and previously in the U.S. House of Representatives, Flake’s vote is seen as crucial.Unencumbered by political pressure – he’s opted not to run for reelection this year – Flake has expressed support for Kavanaugh’s conservative views but cautioned that the confirmation process needs the support of the whole country, something very difficult in the face of the sexual misconduct allegations against Kavanaugh and the polarized political climate that’s gripped the United States in recent years.‘I want to support him. I’m a conservative, he’s a conservative judge. But I want a process we can be proud of, and I think the country needs to be behind it,’ he said.Flake, who said that the testimonies of both Kavanaugh and Ford left him with ‘as much doubt as certainty,’ voted to advance Kavanaugh’s nomination but was also the first Republican Senator to call for an official FBI investigation to the allegations made against President Trump’s Supreme Court nominee.He’s made his views known that he intends to ultimately vote to confirm Kavanaugh unless the ongoing investigation turns up evidence the nominee lied to the Senate Judiciary Committee or engaged in unlawful sexual conduct.Though he has a long history of bucking Trump’s demands, Flake did indeed vote to confirm the President’s previous Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch.Senator Heidi Heitkamp – Democrat from North DakotaHeitkamp, 62, has served in the Senate since 2013 and is currently locked in a tight reelection battle in a state won easily by Trump.The North Dakota Senator, who previously voted to confirm Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, appeared to express at least some degree of support for Kavanaugh before the sexual misconduct allegations against him arose, even praising him as ‘highly-qualified’ for the position of Supreme Court Justice.However, the allegations against the nominee may have given Heitkamp pause.At a recent campaign stop in Grand Forks, North Dakota, she said that Kavanaugh’s nomination should not be something that’s ‘beyond a reasonable doubt’ and also blasted her campaign opponent, U.S. Representative Kevin Cramer, for being critical of Ford’s allegations, denouncing the congressman as someone who has ‘a stunning lack of empathy for victims and the trauma they experience.’She’s also backed the ongoing FBI probe centered on the allegations made against Kavanaugh, saying: ‘We need to get politics out of this process and allow an independent law enforcement agency to do its job’  Heidi Heitkamp, left, is currently locked in a close reelection battle with Kevin Cramer, rightSenator Joe Manchin – Democrat from West VirginiaManchin, a 71-year-old conservative Democrat, is also facing reelection in a state overwhelmingly won by President Donald Trump in the 2016 election.Having first joined the Senate in 2010, Manchin voted to confirm Neil Gorsuch to the U.S. Supreme Court in 2017 and has sided with Republicans on a number of issues.However, the West Virginia Senator has cited healthcare as a key deciding factor for him when it comes to Kavanaugh’s nomination, as he’s said that he’d like to see U.S. courts preserve the Affordable Care Act’s protections for Americans suffering with preexisting conditions.So far, Manchin has dropped few hints as to whether he’d vote to confirm Kavanaugh or not, but has stated that the judge had ‘all the right qualities’ after meeting with him earlier in 2018.Manchin has also backed the FBI investigation on the allegations made against Kavanaugh and has indicated he’d base his vote on the judge’s credentials if no evidence was found backing up the accusations made against Kavanaugh.‘If there’s nothing conclusive, then it’ll be based on the merits of him being qualified,’ he said. \u0026#8216F*ck Kavanaugh\u0027 lipstick: Lipslut product aims to raise money for sexual assault victim charitiesVenom end credits scene explained: What is the link to Spiderman?Diana the musical: All you need to know about the Princess Diana theatre productionKhabib Nurmagomedov net worth revealed ahead of Conor McGregor fight at UFC 229National Lottery results: Lotto numbers for Wednesday 3rd OctoberFan Bingbing net worth: X-men star\u0027s wealth revealed after she went \u0027missing\u0027Who is Loni Willison?

It is imperative that we come out and let people know who we are and disabuse them of their fears and stereotypes.’National Coming Out Day ideasPeople in the LGBTQ community or allies of the community can show their support on National Coming Out Day in a number of ways.Many activists wear jeans to work or school to show their solidarity on National Coming Out Day while others may choose to donate to LGBTQ rights organizations such as the Human Rights Campaign.Other ideas to help show support on National Coming Out Day include studying the history of the LGBTQ rights movement and wearing pride symbols like the rainbow flag or the pink triangle.\u0026#8216F*ck Kavanaugh\u0027 lipstick: Lipslut product aims to raise money for sexual assault victim charitiesVenom end credits scene explained: What is the link to Spiderman?Diana the musical: All you need to know about the Princess Diana theatre productionKhabib Nurmagomedov net worth revealed ahead of Conor McGregor fight at UFC 229National Lottery results: Lotto numbers for Wednesday 3rd OctoberFan Bingbing net worth: X-men star\u0027s wealth revealed after she went \u0027missing\u0027Who is Loni Willison?

The first suggestion is for families to make time to bake, with the company saying that baked treats such as scones only take half an hour to make.Another tip is to get everyone involved as baking can require many hands. ‘Baking has lots of processes – be it choosing the recipe, buying the ingredients, weighing out the ingredients, mixing, stirring, lining tins, kneading dough, washing up or simply eating – so there is a job to suit everyone.’The site recommends people bake with their children: ‘Most of us have a story of baking with parents or grandparents that we remember. And there is nothing better than your own mum\u0027s cakes, pies and biscuits. Now it is our opportunity to create those memories for our own children or grandchildren.’Everyone is also encouraged to be creative during National Baking Week and make baking as easy or as complicated as they want it to be. ‘You can choose a recipe that has very few steps, or as your confidence grows you can push the boat out and make something that will take a little longer and use more skill’. People are also encouraged to play around with different ingredients.The site also provides a list of baking equipment essentials, which includes measure jugs, different-sized bowls, whisks, sieves, rolling pins, oven trays, greaseproof paper and more. National Baking Week also provides a list of recipes for keen bakers to use including simple recipes such as Crisp vanilla butter cookies.Crisp vanilla butter cookies recipe   To make Crisp vanilla butter cookies, follow the recipe below:Cream the Stork, icing sugar and vanilla extract until smooth. Then beat the eggs one at a time until they’re mixed and fluffy. Then the remaining dry ingredients (self-raising flour, baking powder, cinnamon, salt) should be added until they’re all blended.The cookie dough should then be shaped into a log, wrapped in baking parchment and left to chill for 3-24 hours.The oven should then be preheated to 350°C and the slices of cookie dough placed on a non-stick cookie baking sheet. Baking time should take 10-12 minutes or until the cookies are golden brown. Cool down the cookies before drizzling them with melted chocolate.For more recipes see the National Baking Week recipe page.\u0026#8216F*ck Kavanaugh\u0027 lipstick: Lipslut product aims to raise money for sexual assault victim charitiesVenom end credits scene explained: What is the link to Spiderman?Diana the musical: All you need to know about the Princess Diana theatre productionKhabib Nurmagomedov net worth revealed ahead of Conor McGregor fight at UFC 229National Lottery results: Lotto numbers for Wednesday 3rd OctoberFan Bingbing net worth: X-men star\u0027s wealth revealed after she went \u0027missing\u0027Who is Loni Willison?

The Palm Court Hotel, which closed last year, was one of the country\u0027s worst guesthouses with shocking reviews by unhappy guests on TripAdviser          Before being purchased for £500,000 by The Libertines last year, the hotel, with its badly patterned bedspreads, earned just one star out of five on TripAdviser  Put off by the garish decor, one guest complained about bedbugs while another blasted: \u0027This is a \u0027truly ghastly place to stay… we would have had better facilities if we had camped out\u0027A friend of the band has posted a series of YouTube videos of the building work in April, July and September showing how far the project has got to go.A recording studio being built in the basement and bars throughout look almost finished while other areas look some way off completion.  The group bought the five-storey hotel early last year and needed at least the same amount for extensive renovation work, which has been ongoing since the start of the year.According to approved plans submitted to Thanet District Council, the first, second and third floor will remain and the hotel will have seven en-suite rooms.The biggest difference is on the ground floor and basement, where there used to be hotel rooms and a dingy restaurant area for serving breakfast and evening meals. Now the ground floor will have one large and one small recording studio, both with control rooms, an isolation booth and a reception area.A new ground floor, single storey extension will house a bar with seats and tables.  The band have also been given permission to use the site for music from 8am to midnight, Monday to Saturday, and until 9pm on Sundays, which may concern some of the neighbours.A council environmental health report stated as such, saying: \u0027This appears to be a change of use from a building connected to a hotel to a music studio. My immediate concerns over this transfer are around noise transfer to surrounding residential.\u0027 Despite noise fears, planning consent was still given.Councillor for Cliftonville West, Emma Dawson, says that people shouldn\u0027t be scared of the band taking over the hotel.She says: \u0027It\u0027s really a good thing that artists who are famous are calling Margate their home. We\u0027re pretty tolerant in this area, people don\u0027t mind who they are, we need to have the new energy.\u0027Property is cheaper down here, it\u0027s right by the sea, they\u0027ve got a lovely outlook - what better setting to write songs? They have that freedom, the weather is better than anywhere else.\u0027People shouldn\u0027t be scared, obviously, we don\u0027t want to hear them until two or three in the morning. But I understand recording studios are cushioned and you can\u0027t hear anything on the outside. There\u0027s a few studios now in the area, it\u0027s becoming trendy and acceptable.          Since purchasing the guesthouse, Doherty has spectacularly revamped its grotty exterior (pictured) giving it a trendy black and gold look, and renamed it The Albion Rooms          Gone is the tired, old look and fans have been kept updated with their progress with a series of videos. According to approved plans submitted to Thanet District Council, the first, second and third floor will remain and the hotel will have seven en-suite rooms          The band have also been given permission to use the site for music from 8am to midnight, Monday to Saturday, and until 9pm on Sundays, which may concern some of the neighbours\u0027My only fear is that the roads won\u0027t be able to handle all the traffic, that\u0027s what makes residents really angry. And we have more fans coming down to try and see the band, we\u0027re going to get jams, there needs more space for car parks.\u0027The Thanet area is on the up and up.

So you need to look for that sweet spot.”The font was designed with year 12 students cramming for exams in mind but could also be used to help people studying foreign languages and elderly people grappling with memory loss.Blijlevens is keen to test the font in other contexts such as proofreading.Banham, who has created about 20 fonts, said the typeface would be best used for short texts.“God no, you wouldn’t want novels printed in it, it would probably induce a headache,” he said.The font took about six months to develop and there were three different versions tested.• Sans Forgetica is available free to download as a font and Chrome browser extension at sansforgetica.rmit"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3322dee3fd86208a64bf14b2d47dfae56e4543d2/0_0_1365_2048/master/1365.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=e1bc2c8646a656b6e647e3ce9a05d82d 1760w","title":"and the ocean was our sky patrick ness review","story":"What, Patrick Ness asked himself, if Moby-Dick was told by the whale? In Ness’s version, the cetaceans go a lot further than Captain Ahab’s nemesis in Melville’s epic. They fight back on a major scale, with ships and harpoons of their own. Their view of the world is the opposite of ours, hence the title – the ocean depths are their sky, and “below” them is the “Abyss” of air and land.Like Herman Melville’s novel, this is the tale of an obsessive quest seen through the eyes of an innocent, a young whale whose opening words – “Call me Bathsheba” – nod to one of the most famous first lines in literature. Bathsheba is a junior officer to the brutal Captain Alexandra, who leads the war between humanity and whales, a savage conflict where no quarter is given. The Captain came off second best in an encounter with the whale hunter Toby Wick, and has been searching for his white-hulled ship ever since. The plot gets going when the captain and her team find a whaling ship in strange circumstances. All but one of its crew are dead, and the survivor, a young man called Demetrius, has been left clutching a medallion bearing the initials “TW”, for Toby Wick. Cue a wild chase as the Captain follows more clues, while Bathsheba gets to know Demetrius and begins to ask why whales and humans are fighting at all.At first glance this heavily illustrated book looks more like Ness’s bestselling A Monster Calls than his Chaos Walking series and YA titles. But as in all his work, the writing is clear and often lyrical, and the story moves with plenty of pace. The themes of personal identity and difficult moral choices are also familiar Ness concerns. With their haunting, melancholy sense of the undersea world, Rovina Cai’s full-page and double-page illustrations are beautiful in their own right, but they’re a real enhancement to the story and perfectly integrated into the design. This is a book for all ages, although some scenes contain graphic violence, so it might be a little too strong for children under 10.

The map is mistaken for the land itself until bits wear out, exposing the reality underneath. The faithfulness of representation, Borges seems to be saying, can betray its subject by concealing and so displacing it. I was reminded of this warning when reading the thousand-plus pages of Ramachandra Guha’s account of Gandhi’s Indian career, which follows an equally lengthy volume devoted to his early years in Britain and South Africa.Guha trained as an economist and his early work was on environmental issues and cricket, subjects he wrote about with elegance and originality. Turning to India’s political past in more recent years, his lucid writing has made him into a celebrity historian there. He is a prominent voice for tolerance, his biographical volumes dedicated to making Gandhi into a liberal icon for a new generation. This is an urgent enterprise in contemporary India, whose caste and religious politics Guha sees as being violently illiberal in character.The problem with this laudable goal is that Gandhi was not a liberal, and Guha can only make him so by sticking to a familiar script. This involves a sensitive young man schooled into pacifism and vegetarianism among the dissenting Englishmen he met as a student in London, and later shocked into protest by the experience of racial discrimination as a lawyer in South Africa. Returning to India at the beginning of the first world war, he addressed the evils of caste and religious violence, while turning the Indian National Congress into a mass-based political party by focusing on the peasantry.Eventually, the Mahatma won the enmity of Muslim and Hindu bigots, and was assassinated by one of the latter when the country was partitioned and Pakistan founded. The British either connived in these events or were flat-footed. Apart from a number of minor, previously unknown details, then, Guha’s book repeats the narrative of Richard Attenborough’s 1982 biopic Gandhi. Guha presents no big argument, only small disagreements with Gandhi’s enemies and his own. The new volume’s unambitious character is clear from its subtitle, The Years That Changed the World, from which one cannot tell if the Mahatma created this change or was swept up in it.Gandhi’s early Indian biographers, Dinanath Gopal Tendulkar and Pyarelal Nayar, wrote even lengthier accounts than Guha’s, but their object was to make evidence available for the first time. Guha’s aim seems not to be to open up Gandhi’s life story, but rather to summarise it as a battle against imperialism on the one hand and religious fanaticism on the other. Yet given the Mahatma’s very public life, the only serious question it raises is whether a genuinely new biography of the man is even possible. The story of Gandhi’s life has taken on almost a ritual form in India, with readers proceeding step by step through a much-loved story as through the Stations of the Cross.Having traversed this Via Dolorosa and been suitably edified, one has to ask: what is this new account meant to accomplish? If we are to take Borges seriously, the answer might be to displace anything radical or at least illiberal about the Mahatma, the very thing with which genuinely new scholarship on him is concerned. But Guha doesn’t engage with this scholarship, seeking instead to defang Gandhi by downplaying the self-described “philosophical anarchist”, who stood for the remaking of social relations by the power of sacrifice.Confusing non-violence with pacifism, Guha passes over his hero’s difficult ideas in silence. Here is one such idea that undermines the usual view of Gandhi as an old-fashioned moralist: “In this world which baffles our reason, violence there will always be … we cannot escape it simply by running away from it like cowards. Anyone who prepares to run away would do better, instead, to kill and be killed.” Non-violence reclaims iniduals from abjection by having them risk their lives in a challenge more excessive than any violence their enemies can threaten.Guha can only praise his hero by diminishing him, confining his teachings to “normal times, normal places, and against normal rulers”, and in the process normalising both colonial rule and racial violence in such places as the pre-civil rights US and apartheid South Africa. He does so by contrasting them with nazism as an exception he thinks challenges Gandhi’s universal claims, and defining non-violence as an occasional instrument to protect life – the great liberal value. For Gandhi, however, truth was the ultimate value and life only its indirect consequence. He spoke of protecting truth at the cost of life, and made its sacrifice the very essence of non-violence.In his autobiography the Mahatma even downplays the Jallianwala Bagh massacre of 1919, when Reginal Dyer ordered his troops to mow down hundreds of unarmed men and women in Amritsar, and claims to be more horrified by the humiliation (and therefore untruth) willingly borne by Indians elsewhere in the city: “In Amritsar innocent men and women were made to crawl like worms on their bellies. Before this outrage the Jallianwala Bagh tragedy paled into insignificance in my eyes, though it was this massacre principally that attracted the attention of the people of India and of the world.”Guha’s book comprises three elements. First, there is a summary of the Mahatma’s political career, a narrative interrupted now and then by the second element – stories from his private life. Of these, Gandhi’s never-quite-erotic relationship with a married woman, Sarala Devi Chaudhrani, takes pride of place. There is not much to report, but this doesn’t stop Guha from bringing her into the story frequently and imagining what might have been, if only to show that his hero possessed secrets about which no previous biographer has known. The more salacious story about Gandhi involves his experiments, late in life, of sleeping naked with young women in order to test his chastity. Apart from provoking jealousy among his ‘bed partners’, these experiments do not seem to have been traumatic. Yet they were a scandal even at the time, with a few of the Mahatma’s male disciples leaving him over the issue. One of them, the anthropologist NK Bose, would later write that Gandhi’s wife and close friends having died, he no longer enjoyed any intimate human relationships. This was the only way he could shake off the solitude of his saintliness to become human and so fallible again.The views of Gandhi’s contemporaries make up the final element. Most important seem to be the impressions of westerners, an audience both represented in the book and addressed by it. There is no serious consideration of the Mahatma’s reception in other colonised societies, with the encomia of six African leaders squeezed into a single paragraph while Einstein gets two and even Malcolm Muggeridge has one to himself. In an anecdote revealing of the importance to him of a middle-class, Euro-American readership, Guha is surprised that a Dominican waiter serving him in New York could recognise a photograph of the great man.Why does the book need to demonstrate Gandhi’s importance to the west? Its author devotes nearly two pages to Time magazine’s choice of the Mahatma for its 1930 cover, from a list that included the golfer Bobby Jones, Sinclair Lewis, Joseph Stalin and Al Capone. Guha is at the same time touchy and craven in his attitude towards the west’s relationship with his subject and with India. Of all the extraordinary events in Gandhi’s life, he is “moved almost to tears” only by the good manners of an English judge sentencing the Mahatma for sedition in 1922.The narrative ends with an avalanche of testimonials, in which the contrition of Gandhi’s enemies after his assassination is matched by the righteousness of his friends. Left unreconciled are the Hindu nationalists whose ideological descendants rule India today, and against whom Guha appears to have written his biography. But having neutralised the Mahatma’s politics, Guha is unable to recommend his methods against them. His book does little more than veil India’s present with a fantasy of non-violence safely ensconced in the past.• Faisal Devji’s The Impossible Indian: Gandhi and the Temptations of Violence is published by Hurst.Gandhi 1914-1948: The Years That Changed the World is published by Allen Lane.

If that happens, then the current drop in UK car sales should level out in 2019, with some modest growth in 2020-22 that should help to tide the industry over any disruption.But the risks of a no-deal Brexit have risen in the past month, and that could make conditions in the auto industry much more difficult.”Sunderland Central MP Julie Elliott, who represents many Nissan workers, is concerned by the slump in car sales - and Nissan’s warning about a no-deal Brexit.Elliott (who supports the Best For Britain campaign to stop Brexit) says:“The warnings from the motor industry could not be clearer - a bad deal will damage large parts of the economy, risk jobs and create huge business uncertainty. Brexit fantasy is crashing head-first into reality.“I have said consistently for many years that we need a decent trade deal to protect the Nissan plant in Sunderland and the tens of thousands of jobs that depend on that plant.“Theresa May should urgently drop her ludicrous red lines on Brexit, and listen to businesses who are clearly spelling out that they need certainty when it comes to Customs arrangements.”It’s not just car dealers who are struggling to find buyers.It blamed a “exceptional downturn in market demand” over the summer (partly because it was too hot to go furniture shopping).DFS (no stranger to a sale) also warned that Brexit uncertainty is hurting consumers.Overall we expect the market to remain subdued into 2019, constrained by political risk and weak consumer sentiment...The group continues to face a particularly uncertain UK consumer market in the run up to Brexit in March next year.Chris Brook-Carter, managing director of Retail Week, says the drop in car sales is a worrying economic signal:He fears that Brexit uncertainly will hurt the industry in the months ahead:“We are now entering a crucial and unprecedented period for the car industry, as the next new number plate will be March 2019 when the UK is due to leave the EU. It’s likely to be a rollercoaster ride for new car sales figures for the foreseeable future, but it feels like we have just plunged into a deep canyon.“Brexit will start to weigh much heavier on the shoulders of the car industry over the coming months, particularly if a deal isn’t thrashed out with the EU. And either way, we don’t really know how consumers are going to react. “If already fragile consumer confidence is fractured by a no-deal scenario, then we are likely to see many big ticket purchases like new cars put on hold.“The car industry, just like any other business sector, needs certainty, and Brexit squabbles mean we are way off finding any sense of that at the moment.”September’s car sales shocker will have sent a “collective ouch” echoing through the industry, says Ian Gilmartin, Head of Retail \u0026amp Wholesale at Barclays Corporate Banking:With car manufacturers focused on ensuring they are in line with new regulations and given the reluctance of buyers to commit to big purchases, in part due to Brexit uncertainty, it does look likely that as year-end approaches we’ll be down on 2017 for full-year sales.”Disappointingly, even electric cars got caught up in the September malaise on Britain’s forecourts. Ian Plummer, Auto Trader director, points out that Brexit uncertainty has also hurt the car industry this year.“September’s performance was a matter of basic economics there simply weren’t enough cars on forecourts that met the new WLTP standards for retailers to sell....“2018 has been very challenging for both retailers and manufacturers, with the fuel debate and Brexit anxieties denting consumer confidence, and inflationary pressure on exchange rates, hitting profits.Other major carmakers also found September challenging, amid the struggle to meet new emissions tests."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45fb34a6e89bd13b8e8957859870b58d75c521ed/477_33_2837_1702/master/2837.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eac53c97dfcc1efd5e9dd83eeabc45e2","title":"theresa may austerity tories","story":"Put out more flags! Ring the bells and light the beacons, the austerity war against the people is over! The prime minister said: “The British people need to know the end is in sight. And our message to them must be: we get it.”But “getting it” doesn’t mean doing it: announcing it may be all that matters. Consider how easily her promised £20bn a year for the NHS has taken the ongoing crisis in hospitals and GP surgeries off the front pages, without a penny spent and winter approaching. Paul Johnson of the Institute for Fiscal Studies said today that, on top of this, £20bn extra by the end of the parliament would only stop further cuts, with the funds consumed by rising numbers of older people. That’s a sobering thought – such a large sum just to stand still.Look around at the wreckage of eight years of cuts, and the enormity of what they have done is daunting. This is the real deficit, the uncounted one, yet far more damaging than the one on the Treasury books, which is now below its peacetime average. The public sees it in potholes, dilapidated parks, the rarity of police, closing post offices and advice centres, vanishing public officials in railway stations and everywhere else. The collapse of high streets may be partly due to online buying, but as people have less to spend, those shuttered shops become the face of austerity and neighbourhood decline.Brexit uncertainty – crash or slow decline – makes any dip in austerity unlikely. How will the Treasury respond to another shock? As Keynesians, investing in public spending to avert recession, or like George Osborne, cutting deeper into the headwinds, maximising harm? With £500m a week of GDP already lost by Brexit, Whitehall is hiring 9,000 more civil servants, Defra is bringing in 1,200 more staff and Border Force is also swelling – pointless spending eating up funds that could ease austerity.Theresa May’s one vital anti-austerity announcement was ending the cap on councils’ borrowing to invest in house building, reversing Osbornomics’ craziest policy. Council housing is an asset that, through rents, yields a profit over the years. New towns made money, recouping investment: Labour’s great failure was bowing to the nimbyism that blocked their six promised new eco-towns. It matters not a jot how much is added to the national debt when it adds capital with a long mortgage: the government needs a clearer ide between good national debt arising from investment, and bad debt from increased current spending that only swells through fear of taxing enough to cover it.What’s promised at conference all too often stays at conference: May will barely ease austerity, if at all – but her words raise dangerous expectations. What’s more, she opens the buzzing box on difficult questions. Surveying the tree stumps of the public sector battlefield, where would you start unravelling austerity? Everywhere you look, outstretched hands beg for their cause.Once people ponder what comes first, Labour will find itself equally torn by urgent pleas to repair the damage. Would free student fees really still come top? With time to think before its next manifesto, is it right to guarantee old people’s triple-locked pensions while young families fall behind? If Bevan was right and “the language of priorities is the religion of socialism”, easing up on austerity will require extremely painful socialist decisions. But who comes first for generosity is a problem unlikely to confront this government, whose austerity would go on and on through the next decade, if they got the chance."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b839f97b2059881bf8a6b8b0bd8b5f35ce8c612f/0_209_6279_3767/master/6279.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=99689ce85a8d1dff5e953454f28d769f","title":"young people capitalism mcstrike unions","story":"A precarious and exploited workforce has had enough: young employees are joining unions and demanding to be heardThe day McDonald’s workers walked out on strike was the best day of Shen Batmaz’s life: she has even tattooed the date on her arm. “I was so tired and overwhelmed,” she recalls as she stood on a picket line outside a branch of the fast-food chain in Crawley. “I was standing there with people I worked with and loved we were working together to achieve something. It was the most powerful I’d ever felt in my life.” McStrike was born.This week, retail and hospitality workers at JD Wetherspoon, McDonald’s, Uber Eats and TGI Fridays will march out together in a coordinated strike. It is a battle that may determine the future of an increasingly precarious and exploited workforce.Batmaz is now a union official with the Bakers, Food and Allied Workers Union (BFAWU), having spent two years at McDonald’s. She experienced the misery bred by the insecurity of zero-hours contracts but this proved a catalyst for a fightback. She began signing up staff to the union, and staff convened a joint meeting of workers at the Cambridge and Crayford branches: US workers from the Fight for $15 campaign addressed them, and the fire was lit. “There was a moment in that meeting when we all looked at each other and decided: if we really are going to make an impact and change anything, we have to go on strike.”One of the challenges facing the fightback is cultural. In the hyper-exploitative sector of retail and hospitality, workers are made to feel worthless – undeserving of a proper wage and genuine security. “We have to start thinking: we deserve more than this,” as Batmaz puts it. “Everyone deserves to be able to live and have a good life.” These workers are treated as easily replaceable: they are told that if poverty pay and being treated with contempt isn’t their bag, there are always others willing to submit. “Their whole business plan depends on us being dispensable, that someone else can take our job,” says Alex McIntyre, 19, a striking Wetherspoons worker in Brighton.McStrike proved a detonator, inspiring young workers for whom unions were alien. Wetherspoons worker Katie Southworth, 22, speaks for many of Britain’s youth when she describes her impression of a union: “Old men sitting in a room debating issues that were out of date a generation ago.” When she saw young McDonald’s workers fighting for basic rights, it was an education: “They were under 30, we could relate to them.” Their demands – a £10-an-hour minimum wage, the abolition of discriminatory youth rates, and union recognition – are modest in their own right, but they require a radical change to a precariousness hardwired into Britain’s economic model.It was the young who helped deprive the Tories of their majority and plunge the government into crisis. It is that spirit that is shifting from the ballot box to the workplace. Thatcherism sought to break a sense of collective solidarity. The inidual would only better their conditions through their own efforts, went the mantra: those who failed could only blame themselves. But this dogma is rapidly colliding with lived experience. “I knew workers had never won better living standards and better conditions and power by relying on the generosity of any government or these companies,” Wetherspoons worker Chris Hepple, 29, tells me. “But until I actually saw it in practice, I didn’t realise it was something we could actually do.”In the 1980s, the trade unions suffered a series of calamitous setbacks. Mass unemployment terrified workers into not risking the wrath of bosses. Repressive anti-union laws stunted the ability of workers to organise and defend their rights. Devastating defeats, not least the miners’ strike, inculcated a sense of futility. There are other challenges today too: as the striking workers acknowledge, the huge turnover in their sectors makes organising very difficult. But after an era of retreat, a younger generation is offering leadership.In south London’s Ritzy cinema, exploited workers have fought a long battle for a living wage and union recognition. Deliveroo drivers are going to court to demand basic rights such as a minimum wage and paid holidays. These are green shoots they may well thrive.What gives hope is that young people are not simply looking at winning gains in their own workplaces: their vision is nothing less than the transformation of the entire sector, and society itself. “We’re not naive enough to think we’ll be handed everything straight away,” Hepple says. “But if we come together in the hospitality industry, we hope we can drive wages and conditions not just in our industry, but across society in general.”They don’t just want a decent wage and rights: they want a voice in their workplace too. Neoliberalism has left Britain’s boss classes drunk on triumphalism, paying themselves record salaries and bonuses while their workers are imprisoned by poverty and insecurity. It was never going to last. Hubris may well be about to meet its nemesis: an army of young, precarious, but determined workers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f54085b8502aec472737d67284987cd2177adf83/0_0_1544_927/master/1544.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d5a43ac26e47f1dfde52c2460068d14f","title":"paris fashion week springsummer 2019 16 key shows in pictures","story":"From Dior’s modern dance performance and Maison Margiela’s gender-fluid show to the beach set at Chanel, the Observer’s fashion editors Jo Jones and Helen Seamons pick the highlights from the collections."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b016ff9cfc88bdbffce74101b0df1c45a6619126/0_0_955_955/master/955.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=e8ce9413d60b8e7ac91a97a741730c7c 1440w","title":"22 july review paul greengrasss anders brevik","story":"Greengrass’s reconstruction of the 2011 terror attack in Oslo is well-intentioned, committed and intelligent, albeit conventional Paul Greengrass has made a decent, well-intentioned and well acted feature for Netflix about the terror attack in Norway on 22 July 2011 and its aftermath. It was an outrage perpetrated by Anders Brevik, an extreme-right self-appointed “counter-jihadist” and Nazi enthusiast who detonated a bomb in downtown Oslo and then opened fire on unarmed teenagers at a socialist summer camp on Utøya island, near the capital, killing 77 people. The film is as intelligent and committed as you would expect from Greengrass, but basically pretty conventional, like a very classy TV movie. It doesn’t have the radical simplicity, audacity and power of his 2006 film United 93, about 911 – or, in fact, another recent film about the Oslo attack, Erik Poppe’s Utøya July 22, which was clearly inspired by Greengrass. Very like United 93, Poppe’s film is a moment-by-moment ordeal in real time, seeking to recreate the attack from the viewpoint of its terrified and disoriented teen victims, lasting as long as the event itself, ending with the assailant’s capture but beginning with a deeply disturbing premonition of evil.Well, for understandable reasons, Greengrass may not have wanted something that would look simply like a repeat of United 93. Here he spreads his attention more widely, but more thinly, with an ensemble approach, looking at a range of the people involved but at the cost of not really investigating any of them very deeply.Anders Danielsen Lie (an actor who has previously played unsettling characters in Joachim Trier’s Oslo, August 31st and Olivier Assayas’s Personal Shopper) plays Brevik, very plausibly portraying him as the coolest of customers during the grisly attack, taking pills to keep himself calm just before heading out to Utøya, and then later, in his cell, as a smug and complacent self-promoter with grandiose fantasies about inspiring a new “Templar” uprising. Lie’s performance is very potent, although we are a bit close to fava-beans-and-chianti territory, and the film doesn’t quite convey why Brevik should have initially agreed to an insanity plea when it was surely clear that this would undermine his grotesque claims to political seriousness. The film implies that, at an early stage of questioning, Brevik did appear to be mad, claiming to be able to read minds, but the issue is left unclear. Rather exasperatingly, the film spends some time on how Brevik was able to buy guns and bomb-making equipment legally, but there is nothing on how he was able to get a very convincing fake cop uniform from the web – a vital part of how he got on to the island.Jon Øigarden plays Geir Lippestad, the socialist lawyer who with a heavy heart accepted the brief to act for Brevik, at the killer’s own request, out of a conviction that everyone deserves a defence and because this was part of precisely the democratic system that Brevik was trying to destroy. Lippestad’s paradoxical situation is fascinating and – as with so many of the constituent parts of this film – I felt Greengrass might have done better just to have concentrated on Lippestad’s story and his self-questioning anguish (or made it about the relationship between lawyer and defendant, like Spielberg’s Bridge of Spies or else perhaps singly about Brevik’s sinister life history, or about one victim’s courageous recovery, and made of any these the inidual key that would unlock the whole drama). Instead, despite a decent enough attempt from Øigarden, Lippstad remains an opaque and rather cursorily drawn figure, whom the film does not dwell on. Brevik claims that he chose Lippestad because he is part of the establishment, and even that they had met nine years before – a greater focus on Lippestad might have created room for a flashback to that bizarre moment.Elsewhere, Ola G Furuseth plays the prime minister Jens Stoltenberg, who emerges as a serious, concerned, self-critical figure – but again, without the film going into great depth. There is more power in Greengrass’s depiction of a representative victim, Viljar (Jonas Strand Gravli), a teenager, formerly a bit conceited, who through intensive and traumatic therapy recovers from serious bullet wounds, finds a new maturity and is able to make a fierce victim statement at Brevik’s trial.This is a heartfelt piece of work from Greengrass, but the blaze of passion is missing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2dbff4d11e89fd436f167d44cfc7f85c180ed968/0_46_1650_990/master/1650.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4ee79ff720b8c281f965b053ec79e2ed","title":"blindspotting review carlos lopez estrada","story":"This bold US indie about urban life and police violence owes equal amounts to performance poetry and knife-edge thrillers. There is nothing else quite like itThe title of this disarming wildcard indie – a word-of-mouth sleeper hit in the US – refers to the way the eye can become so settled on one aspect of any given image that it fails to register others. The film, a jolting showcase for writer-stars Daveed Diggs and Rafael Casal, refuses us any such complacency. True, it first bounds up to us as goofball knockabout, doing for Oakland in California what Ice Cube’s Friday movies did for LA, metabolising chewy racial issues into peppy, crowdpleasing gags. Yet without any wrenching gearshifts, it gradually drives its characters on to darker, meaner streets. The initial, appealing looseness proves to be latent instability by the finale, we hardly know where we’re headed, only that bad things seem likely to happen there. Still, try and take your electrified eyes off it. It’s practically 2018: The Movie.Blindspotting’s core steeliness can, in fact, be glimpsed early on, as Diggs’s man-with-a-van Collin – out beyond his curfew, two days before his probation ends – witnesses a cop shoot a fleeing suspect in the back. Should he report the incident, and potentially put himself back behind bars? Where a declamatory film would have made this quandary the whole show, director Carlos López Estrada pushes on. There’s hair that needs straightening receptionists to be wooed work for Collin to do alongside irascible white pal Miles (Casal), their moving business allowing close-up views of Oakland’s gentrification.But Collin’s internal tensions can only be sublimated for so long. The movie around him grows bristlier with every frame, as if reacting to world events in real time. When the anger is finally released, it transforms Blindspotting as it may yet transform that world, throwing up bold images – not least a Million Man March of the dead – and a finale that owes as much to performance poetry as it does to knife-edge thrillers. That we stay this tumultuous course is down to the leads’ ability to claw back sympathy for characters succumbing to their own worst instincts, and López Estrada’s assured direction. There may have been no easy or comforting way to end it, nor perhaps to sell it, save with the assurance that there is nothing else like it on our screens right now. Yet the film’s insidious crawl away from comedy into sweaty waking nightmare is arresting indeed. As is, finally, its insistence that some elements of American life remain too serious to joke about.

It’s rare even for young women get that opportunity, period. We kept being shocked that we were actually getting to do it.”Steenburgen, herself barely 65, is speaking down the line from California. The youngest (by seven years) and the most arthouse of the strikingly premium cast, her career has not followed the regular arc: a blast of young fame, a period of obscurity, then a partial reprise for mum roles. She is remembered for The Help (2011) as much as she is for her early Oscar (for Melvin and Howard, in 1980). Despite her friendship with Hillary Clinton and her longstanding support for civil rights (she once said of Arkansas: “Growing up someplace like that, you either become committed toward bigotry or against it. You can’t really sit on the fence”), her countercultural reputation was sealed relatively recently, with regular appearances on Curb Your Enthusiasm alongside real-life husband Ted Danson, to whom she’s been married since the 80s.But Book Club is as mainstream as the book the club is reading. Fifty Shades of Grey has “got me in a total tizzy”, Steenburgen’s Carol, mashing up a 90s teen and a 50s housewife, tells Diane Keaton’s Diane. “I could have put him in jail for any one of these things,” Candice Bergen’s Sharon intones of the Fifty Shades hero, because she is a federal judge. “But she’s having fun,” Jane Fonda’s Vivian points out, because she’s the fun one.Says Steenburgen of the atmosphere on set: “Everybody came to work hard. They were funny, and real, and I think part of what makes the movie work is that you see us genuinely becoming friends on screen, which we are and have been ever since.”Keaton and Fonda are more household-namey, but there was no box-office hierarchy . “I don’t know that I’ve ever been a a. I don’t think anybody has ever accused me of it, but maybe I’m kidding myself. I can tell you that it’s hard to believe that of any of them. I don’t know if it’s about being a woman, I don’t even know what the male equivalent is, but I don’t feel the accusation being levelled at men. We just have ugly words for female actors who are successful.”It’s not where you’d come for insights into the Fifty Shades franchise, but to be fair, neither are the Fifty Shades films. If you’re looking for committed performances, they’re here, possibly because the premise is so refreshing that everyone was prepared to just blast through the bits that were, ahem, a little less than fresh.“There’s the sexuality of it,” says Steenburgen, “but also just that people our age, you know, do new things. They try something they’ve never tried before, scare themselves to death, take a chance on love. When kids are young, we say to them: ‘You can do anything, don’t be afraid,’ and then there’s this mysterious unspoken moment where that is no longer true. And we don’t say it to ourselves. When Jane says in the film: ‘We’re not going to be people who stop living before we stop living.’ That very much is Jane Fonda. It’s perfect that that line came from her. But it’s true that all four of us felt that way.”Are old women still people? Do they still need physical intimacy, do they still have friends, interests, autonomy? This is what it boils down to. It’s not a bad question, and is so seldom asked. There is a lacuna more important even than sex, which is the absence of old women on screen with any definable self. They are always assigned either a rocking chair role (rock dispense wisdom recommence rocking) or what Stockard Channing once called a piñata part (be evil get hit with a stick explode colourfully).Says Steenburgen: “For us, the movie was very personal, very true to how we feel about ageing. Just the assumption that when you’re that age, you’re going to be so different from this. It’s assumed, after living for 65 years, one has nothing to offer. The reverse is true. Actually we have some really good stories to tell.”This would have been the time to cut in and ask for some of those stories, particularly since we’re talking about sexuality, and we’re post #MeToo, and the perspective of another generation would be extremely interesting: but she almost smells that question down the line, and rides right over it.“At the same time,” she hurries, “we’re all grownups, we feel grateful to the business, we’re not bitter about this stuff. We really want stuff to be the best it can be for women, but all four of us feel so grateful to be actors. I’ve paid my bills by being an actor since I was 24 years old. I feel blessed and lucky to do that.”Apart from the patriarchy, there’s one, better reason for the invisibility of old women in mainstream culture: they are really hard to write. How do you observe the conventions of the romcom, the insecurities, the pride before the fall, the fear of intimacy, the pratfalls, while introducing people who – just from the look in their eyes, never mind the arthritis – have clearly seen a thing or two? How do you square the wisdom of your cast with the silliness that you need for people to keep breaking up and getting back together again? The stuff of romance, since the dawn of time, has been the misunderstanding, otherwise it’s just a lot of people snogging. This cast understands everything.Yet, Steenburgen insists: “We didn’t take control of the vehicle, we’re too much old pros for that. Films don’t turn out well if you defy the director. There has to be somebody who’s thinking of all the stories at the same time and thinking of the overview. Where we were wild was in the garage of the house that we mainly shot in. All of our dogs were in there, and occasionally my husband, and we would just sit in there and tell the most hilarious stories about life in the business.” I’d watch that dialogue, in a shot: but Steenburgen is, as she says, a grownup and a pro. What happened in the garage stayed in the garage.• Book Club is out now on DVD and download"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a81a613a626b856346b97f62ac4c0c8042be345/0_353_2598_1558/master/2598.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f1ae8421e022565f0ff8f60e42dd8c3","title":"working girl power suits female ambition modern equivalent","story":"The 80s movie celebrated women striving to get ahead. Now 30 years on, Hollywood seems to want to put women in their placeThe women in Working Girl looked amazing in their power suits. How do professional female characters dress now? Cyrus, by emailI like the cut of your jib, Cyrus! Any man who spends his evenings not just watching but RE-watching Working Girl is welcome to sit by me. And you are right, women don’t wear power suits in movies any more, but that is because women in real life don’t wear power suits these days. In fact, one of the most interesting fashion stories told in Working Girl, aside from that it really is possible to pay $6,000 for an item of clothing and “it’s not even leather”, is that you can see the power suit changing shape in this late-80s movie, shifting to something decidedly more 90s. Whereas Tess (Melanie Griffith) and Cynthia (Joan Cusack) wear big shoulders and heavy jackets, Katherine (Sigourney Weaver), the woman with the real power, wears far more minimalist, slimmed-down suits. As Tess gains power, she does, too. In the last scene, Tess turns up to her new job, which she thinks is a secretarial position, in a heavily shoulder-padded jacket. But when she realises she is actually the boss, the jacket starts to slip off her shoulders. It’s 1988, baby, and a new era is beginning: no longer do big shoulders symbolise female power.(Whether then having Harrison Ford then pack Griffith’s ickle wickle lunch box for her, as if she were his toddler daughter instead of his extremely impressive girlfriend, symbolises female power is a question we shall have to save for another day.)But your question touches, I think, on something that goes beyond suits, Cyrus. The question isn’t what do ambitious women wear in the movies these days, it’s why aren’t they celebrated in movies the way they used to be?Fortunately, a film comes out tomorrow that illustrates the point. Now, you might have thought that if I had written a 2,500-word article on A Star Is Born last week for this paper I might have got that film out of my system. Well, you, my friend, have underestimated just how much I overthink popular culture. Now who’s looking like the foolish one?While the new A Star Is Born sticks very closely to the 1954 and 1976 versions of this movie, it differs in one huge and telling way: whereas in the earlier films the female character becomes more successful than the man because she is more talented, in the new version it is just because she becomes a creative sell-out. Instead of making Ally (Lady Gaga) a better singer-songwriter than Jack (Bradley Cooper), the movie has her jettison her songwriting skill in order to become a pop star who sings garbage pop songs, dyes her hair silly colours and puts up with cheesy people around her. Thus, Jack remains An Artist while Ally is just a plastic product.It is a fascinating twist, partly because Cooper directed the movie and this is a definite change to the franchise that flatters his character. It is also interesting to do this to the movie now, in an era when female pop stars are such a dominant force: Beyoncé, Taylor, Rihanna, Ariana and – oh yeah! – Lady Gaga. The whole thing feels like a reassuring pat on the shoulder to all the male artists left in their dust, and it’s very weird to see Gaga play a character who feels too close for comfort. But this also feels like the natural conclusion to the direction Hollywood movies have been going in for the past few decades. Once female ambition was normal – sexy, even. Most obviously, in 1940’s His Girl Friday, Hildy’s (Rosalind Russell) professionalism is what Walter (Cary Grant) loves about her and, even when they marry at the end, it’s obvious they are going to work on their honeymoon, and he is delighted by it. In Working Girl, female ambition is sexy, in the form of Griffith – as long as she doesn’t become more successful than the man,\u0026nbspa problem embodied by Weaver.Which brings us to the 21st century and all you need to do to see how bad things have got is to compare Kay Thompson’s character in 1957’s Funny Face with Meryl Streep’s in 2006’s The Devil Wears Prada: they are both fashion magazine editors, but Streep’s professionalism is mocked whereas Thompson’s is admired. (And, of course, in true 21st-century romcom style, the conclusion of the latter film is that the young female character should give up her excellent job and try to get her boyfriend back. Yay women!)The question isn’t what ambitious women should wear in movies but when will ambitious women learn their lesson and give up their jobs for their men? Ally doesn’t in the latest A Star Is Born and, well, we all know how that turns out. A salutary tale to learn from, ladies."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60104f6dba27c16988f27614287fff40278d7b21/0_323_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1419f9889e47876641ffb75c07a657d6","title":"eat more pollock and less squid conservation charity urges","story":"MCS’s Good Fish Guide also says unclear labelling on seafood products means shoppers should ask if their choice is sustainableConsumers are being urged by a UK marine conservation charity to eat more pollock and less squid in a fresh attempt to alleviate pressure on threatened stocks.Warning of a lack of clear labelling on packaging as well as menus, it also advises shoppers to ask their fishmonger, supermarket fish counter or restaurant whether their choice is sustainable.The MCS wants the public, chefs, retailers and fish buyers to refer to the Good Fish Guide to ensure they have the most up-to-date sustainable seafood advice.Native oysters (sail and oar)European hake (gill or fixed)Haddock (from Rockall or MSC-certified)Seabass (caught at sea)Dover Sole (from the Irish sea and pulse trawled)Plaice (from south-west Ireland and caught using pulse trawls)Squid (common or European squid caught in the English Channel with fishing gear other than jigs)“Choosing sustainable seafood is a complex issue not helped by a lack of clear labelling on most seafood products,” said Bernadette Clarke, programme manager of the Good Fish Guide. “That lack of information means consumers need all the help they can get. Using the Good Fish Guide will point people in the right direction and start the sustainability conversation with the fishmonger or restaurant. If consumers can start asking ‘Is that sustainable?’, seafood suppliers will need to have an answer.”Squid, a popular fixture on many restaurant menus and widely available on seafood counters and in supermarket freezer sections, is described as a “mixed bag” when it comes to consumer choice. The species is flourishing in the UK as the waters around the shores grow warmer.While squid caught using jigs (a type of hook and line that is very selective compared with trawling) – from the Channel and Scotland is rated a 3, meaning it is OK, elsewhere squid has the worst rating, a 5– which means consumers are advised to avoid it.Haddock remains a fish and chip shop staple and the newly rated Rockall fishery has been rated 1, making it a guilt-free “best choice”. Haddock from the North Sea and west of Scotland has improved from 3 to 2, meaning it can again be considered a “good choice” after fishing pressure has continued to reduce and stocks have increased.Meanwhile, consumers who fear that a fish burger may be nothing more than the scrapings off the factory floor may be reassured. Alaskan pollock, which is used in the McDonald’s Filet-O-Fish, is also rated a 1.Dover sole, often regarded as an upmarket fish, is rated 2 when it comes from the western Channel or Cornwall, or is MSC-certified from the North Sea. But if the sole on your plate comes trawled from the Irish Sea, or is electric-pulse-trawled from the North Sea, the MSC urges you to reconsider: it is rated a 5.In March the charity said less popular UK species such as dab, hake, herring and mackerel should be Britons’ fish supper of choice in order to support the UK fishing industry and help the seas. For the first time it suggested a “post-Brexit” UK top 10 including species of fish that are not household names. The organisation says that as the UK prepares to leave the EU and tries to secure a bigger share of the fish market, now could be the time to consider new options."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae903eba04cead6901d25c778bdf688ea3c558a8/0_511_4703_2822/master/4703.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=18933138bebdebc92911b02c1fdfe83e","title":"swansea oli mcburnie scotland socks shin pads interview","story":"The striker discusses cutting his socks for the perfect fit, why being a throwback works to his advantage and how playing for Scotland was inevitable despite being born in LeedsOli McBurnie has only heard the words “your style of play” at the beginning of the question and he is already roaring with laughter. “I can’t wait to hear what you’re going to say,” the Swansea striker adds as he stretches out that lean 6ft 3in frame with a big grin on his face.As it happens, McBurnie needs no prompting. “Everyone says I’m a throwback. The Steve Claridge shout – I get that one a lot. Obviously the way I look is not the way that everybody else looks on the pitch. Even the way I play – people say I look clumsy, leggy, all that sort of thing. I’m guess I’m unorthodox. But it just works to my advantage because I get underestimated all the time.”For those unfamiliar with McBurnie, the Scotland international is a fascinating character. He plays with his shirt out and his socks rolled down by his ankles, and wears shin pads that serve no purpose other than to comply with the rules. “They’re toddlers’ ones,” McBurnie says, when asked about the size of his pads. “They’re the smallest I can find. We never wear shin pads in training, and then you go into a game and wear them, so that feels alien to me.”The rather unusual dress code, McBurnie explains, is partly down to comfort but also a superstition that started with a loan at Chester, where the kit was so old that the elastic had gone in the socks. “I kept pulling them up and was getting sick of it,” McBurnie says. “I think it was the third game I played, Welling away, the pitch was horrific, they were kicking lumps out of us, and I thought: ‘I’m just going to see if it’s comfy with the socks down.’ I scored my first professional goal that day, so I’ve stuck with it ever since.”That was in January 2015, when McBurnie was on loan from Bradford. He joined Swansea that summer and it has been a long and winding road to get to the stage where he is wearing the No 9 shirt for his club and a mandatory pick for the Scotland squad. Swansea’s relegation helped his prospects at club level, for sure, but the real game-changer was last season’s loan at Barnsley. McBurnie scored nine times in 17 Championship appearances and won their player-of-the-year award despite being at Oakwell for only three months.McBurnie should have joined Barnsley five months earlier but “one missing signature – not mine” meant that the EFL rejected the transfer a week after it had been announced. “I was actually at a house viewing up there, for a place that I ended up buying – I’ve moved my mum in there now – and I got a call to say my loan hadn’t gone through. I thought it was a wind-up,” says McBurnie.When McBurnie returned from Oakwell for a second time, in the summer, he had a big decision to make. He had only 12 months left on his contract and was not short of offers elsewhere, but one conversation with Graham Potter, Swansea’s manager, was all it needed. “We must have spoken for an hour in his office,” McBurnie says. “That was the first day of pre-season and he was taking the time out to speak to me, saying he wanted me to be here, that he wanted me to be his No 9 and that he thought he could make me into a better player, and that he thought I could help us become a better team. I got out of that meeting, rang my agent and said: ‘I want to sign the deal.’”Potter’s arrival, McBurnie says, has reinvigorated the squad. “It’s just a good place to come into work every day,” he says. “And it’s such a good dressing room now, in terms of players wanting to learn, wanting to fight for each other, and for the manager. And I think you can see that when you look at some of the games.”In a season when he has played wide left and in the No 10 role as well as through the middle up front, McBurnie has two assists and four goals, including a superb double against Leeds that was especially enjoyable given he was playing against his hometown club. Not only that but a club who released him for – and it is hard not to smile at how ridiculous this now sounds – “being too small”.While a growth spurt in his mid-teens dramatically altered his appearance, nothing was going to change his international allegiances. Born in Leeds to an English mother and Scottish father, McBurnie could, in theory, have represented either country. The reality was rather different.Asked what say his mum had in his choice, McBurnie replies: “Zero. She tried her best but had no influence whatsoever. The second me and my brother were old enough, we were wearing a Scotland or a Rangers shirt. Looking back on it now, I can see why other people would think it was weird. Me and my brother, with broad Yorkshire accents, going into school on non-uniform days in Scotland shirts with our face painted in Scotland colours. I don’t know if people have had the experience of a dad who wants you to do something ... you don’t have much say in it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60478bdc559fa72fe4fe0ac09636f78df9f3cdb9/3_170_3910_2345/master/3910.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5aa52b66a5176c83eda64e688ed09b3c","title":"manchester united hammered sturridges stunner and hampden rumble football weekly","story":"Max Rushden is joined by Barry Glendenning, Lars Sivertsen and Mark Langdon to look back at the weekend’s action.

The best athletes in every sport give us a glimpse of something else, a remix of the usual physical laws. At Wembley this sensation had an extra depth as Lionel Messi produced a hall-of-fame performance but did so in a Barcelona team who were stretched at times even as the genius at the other end was scoring twice, hitting the post twice and helping to make the other two in a 4-2 win.More than ever watching Barcelona felt like a game within a game, two planes of sporting reality intersecting. In the game just below the surface a team of high-class bolt-on parts and ageing links worked hard at keeping its passing and pressing game on track. And in the other game, the one layered over the top, Messi simply took the night away from everyone else, producing irresistible moments of control and vision, and swiping the Spurs defence aside like a cobweb round a window frame.It did not take long for Messi’s first law of physics to assert itself. This is the law that says Messi can basically make it up as he goes along. With 90 seconds gone that familiar hunched figure picked the ball up in the centre circle and spun around, the Messi sonar already picking out the location and trajectory of every object within his range.At that moment the pass out to Jordi Alba did not really exist. There were bodies in the way. The line of sight was blocked. The pass was an idea, something scribbled on a Post-It note, talks about talks.Messi did it anyway, hitting the ball with just enough fade to glide through the narrow target area between Philippe Coutinho and Kieran Trippier as they ran back. Trippier was almost turned inside out, wrenching his neck round, corkscrewing himself into the turf. Hugo Lloris saw it too late, rushing out in a panic, arms waggling at his sides, like a man chasing chickens across a motorway intersection. The weight of the pass was perfect, offering Alba a half-volley inside to Coutinho, whose finish was ked through the covering bodies. With two minutes gone a single Messi pass had left the white shirts writhing about in their own area like the dregs from the last night-bus home.Messi’s passing has been a feature of his late-career bloom, that footballing spider-sense allowing him to freeze the movement in front of him, a snapshot within which he is free to do the most horrible things with his left foot. Left feet like these are often described as “cultured” or “educated”. On this scale Messi’s left foot is Stephen Hawking on caffeine pills, the nine‑year‑old maths prodigy who wins Countdown for a year, Coleridge just after he has finished reading every book ever written and thinks, right, time to get down to some real study.He did the other stuff, too. Messi may have lost some acceleration but he is a genuine dribbler, able to whisk the ball from foot to foot like a boxer unloading a three-punch combination. Two minutes into the second half he picked up the ball near the centre circle, glided into space, gave Lloris “the eyes” and then curled the ball against the near post.Four minutes later he made almost the same run and hit the same post. Five minutes after that he finally made it 3-1, playing a lovely pass out to Alba, taking the return and simply placing it inside that post, hitting the ball down into the ground, a man taking pleasure in the feel of the bounce even as he killed the game.It is hard to blame Spurs too much for any of this. How to assess this game, when one player has such a profound effect, illuminating his teammates with those ine little flashes? Spurs had come to Wembley seriously underpowered, without their best playmaker, their best midfield runner, their best midfield holder and their best defender. Faced with opponents who could keep a £130m sub on the bench (the entire home starting XI cost only £15m more) Spurs played well in the second half. Harry Kane pulled one back and moved with some of his old relentless energy. Érik Lamela made it 3-2 with 20 minutes to go. Perhaps in the minority report of this match Tottenham even won the game behind the game, the non‑Messi edit.But Messi still just seems to save a little of his best for the English. These were his 21st and 22nd goals against Premier League opponents, a night where once again his passing and his touches at close quarters were surely as good as anything ever seen in this country. Tottenham are in trouble now in Group B. The season will rush on. Barcelona will probably come unstuck at some point. But we should still treasure these moments, sparks of brilliance from a player so far ahead of everyone else it is at times tempting to take them for granted.Hugo Lloris Ill-advised bolt from the line on the opening goal, spread further panic with another one in the second half. 4Kieran Trippier Will feel he should have cut out Messi’s pass on first goal. Hands full with Coutinho. 5Toby Alderweireld Booked early on after being tricked by Coutinho, he suffered as Barcelona turned the screw. 5Dávinson Sánchez Guilty of lapses and continues to look vulnerable to the high ball over his shoulder. 4Ben Davies Thankless assignment with Messi roaming off his side. Stuck to his guns. 5Harry Winks Felt the pressure of Barcelona’s press. Tried to put fizz into his passes. Tough evening. 6Victor Wanyama First Champions League start since December 2016, might be a while before he gets another. Chased shadows. 4Luca Moura Denied space, unable to show electric pace but almost conjured stunning late equaliser. 5Érik Lamela Worked to inject urgency and creativity. Carried physical fight. Assist for Kane. Deserved luck on his goal. 8Son Heung-min Struggled to make any impression.

For almost a year, his mother, Iokarenhtha Thomas, who lives in the Six Nations of the Grand River indigenous reserve in Ontario, went to the local doctor for lotions for the boy. It worked, for a time. But the itchy red rash always returned. Thomas came to suspect the culprit behind the rash: water – or, rather, the lack of it.Thomas, a university student and mother of five, has lived without running tap water since the age of 16. Her children lack access to things commonplace elsewhere, like toilets, showers and baths. For washing and toilet usage, they use a bucket.It is a challenging existence, full of frustration, exhaustion and health problems, and reminiscent of life in some developing countries. But this is not the “third world”. It is Canada, which regularly ranks as one of the United Nations’ top places in the world to live. Moreover, this Native community is located in prosperous southern Ontario, 90 minutes from Canada’s largest and richest city, Toronto.Meanwhile, while Thomas and her family do without water, the beverage company Nestlé extracts millions of litres of water daily from Six Nations treaty land.Twice a week, Thomas and her husband grab jugs, pails and whatever else they have in the house, and drive 8km to a public tap to fill up. The water isn’t drinkable, however, so once a week they also drive 10km to the nearest town, Caledonia, to buy bottled water to drink.“When my husband isn’t here, it makes it difficult to do the dishes or anything because I don’t have the strength to carry all the jugs of water,” Thomas said.“When I start to compare my life to someone who isn’t living on reserve, I start feeling angry at the government,” she said. “Because our people don’t have running water. But that’s just the reality of living on reserve. You grow up being treated unfairly.”Ninety-one percent of the homes in this community aren’t connected to the water treatment plant, says Michael Montour, director of public works for Six Nations. Some, like the Thomas home, have no water at all. Others have water in their taps, but it is too polluted to drink.The Six Nations are not the only First Nations community in Canada with a water crisis. There are currently 50 indigenous communities with long-term boil water advisories, which means an estimated 63,000 people haven’t had drinkable water for at least a year – and some for decades. But this may underestimate the size of the problem, since some indigenous communities, such as Six Nations, have a functional water plant but no workable plumbing. The lack of water has been linked to health issues in indigenous communities including hepatitis A, gastroenteritis, giardia lamblia (“beaver fever”), scabies, ringworm and acne.“Why do white people live with water and we don’t?” said Dawn Martin-Hill, a Six Nations local and professor of indigenous studies at McMaster University. “They don’t have to live like we live. There’s a lot of environmental racism.”Canada’s bounty has made it an attractive destination for beverage brands such as Aquafina and Dasani, which pump and bottle the abundant freshwater. But the distribution is rarely according to need. Nestlé, the world’s biggest bottler, is extracting up to 3.6m litres of water daily from nearby Six Nations treaty land.Nestlé pumps springwater from the nearby Erin well, which sits on a tract of land given to the Six Nations under the 1701 Nanfan Treaty and the 1784 Haldimand Tract, said Lonny Bomberry, Six Nations lands and resources director.The Six Nations – Mohawk, Cayuga, Onondaga, Oneida, Seneca and Tuscarora – sided with the British during the American revolution as a reward they were given an area of approximately 3,845 sq km around the Grand River. Later, Ontario broke the treaty, reducing it to the current 194 sq km.The land’s legacy may be 300 years old, but for Six Nations residents, it is alive and present. Many are outraged at Nestlé’s practices, including JD Sault, a self-employed mother of two. Like the Thomases, she lacks drinking water in her home. She paid several thousand dollars for her house to be connected to a nearby well – then found the water too polluted to drink. There is probably sewage contamination from her neighbours’ septic beds, she said. She worries about E coli and other bacteria.No one disputes the existence or legality of the Haldiman or Nanfan treaties. If anything, their legality is finally being taken seriously, thanks to a shift in the national political climate toward greater recognition of indigenous rights, including several wins in the supreme and lower courts.But the question of who owns Canadian water is as murky as the water on many First Nations lands. In theory, the provinces have owned the water since 1930, when the federal government delegated ownership with the Natural Resources Transfer Act. According to that act, the provinces have the right to sell their water to whomever they want, including companies like Nestlé.But water is also supposed to be regulated by the federal government, which is responsible for the natural environment and Canada’s waterways. And, according to the Canadian constitution, the federal government has a “duty to accommodate and consult” First Nations and to make sure other parties do the same when extracting any natural resource, including water, from indigenous land.This legal ambiguity has allowed Nestlé to move in and extract precious water on expired permits for next to nothing. Nestlé pays the province of Ontario $503.71 (US$390.38) per million litres. But they pay the Six Nations nothing.In response, the Six Nations are suing the province, in a case before the superior court of Ontario.“We are working hard on developing our relationships with local First Nations communities, and look forward to working together,” Jennifer Kerr, director of corporate affairs for Nestlé Waters Canada, wrote in an email to the .“Everything has to do with the water,” explained Ken Greene, 53, who lives with his wife in a one-bedroom trailer without running water. “Because it has to do with the land. Land needs water. We need water. We can’t survive without it.”The disputed Erin well is located in a drought-stricken area, explained Emma Lui, a water campaigner with the Council of Canadians, a progressive not-for-profit that works on environmental causes. The drought has dried the wetlands surrounding Greene’s 10-acre property. It has also decimated the local populations of salmon, trout, pike and pickerel, Greene said.Martin-Hill told me that indigenous leaders can do little to address the drought because they are caught in a legal trap. Drought and other environmental problems are supposed to be addressed during the granting of new water permits. That’s when scientific and legal experts examine fish populations, vegetation and aquifer levels to decide how much well water can be safely extracted.It’s not happening. There’s been a moratorium on new permits since 2016 – yet, paradoxically, the Ontario government has also given companies the right to pump water on expired permits until 2019. (The permit for the Erin site expired in 2017.)Makaśa Looking Horse, 21, a student in indigenous studies at McMaster University, has organized a community-wide march for this fall. She has also organized a boycott of Nestlé’s products. “It’s hard to boycott Nestlé because they own so many companies that sell so many products,” she said. “It’s hard to pick and choose. You don’t always know what’s Nestlé and what’s not because they own so much.”This is not the first time Nestlé has found itself in such difficulties. In fact, numerous conflicts have surfaced related to their business model, according to Peter Gleick, co-founder and president emeritus of the Pacific Institute, a global water thinktank, and author of Bottled and Sold: The Story Behind Our Obsession with Bottled Water.Many of Nestlé’s competitors, such as Aquafina and Dasani, don’t use spring water, but filter and treat tap water, Gleick said. But Nestlé was founded in the 19th century on the idea that spring water might have incredible health benefits. Nestlé bottles its brands – including Arrowhead, Poland Spring, Deer Park, Ozarka, Zephyrhills, Acqua Panna, San Pellegrino, Perrier, Vittel and Buxton – from deep aquifers and natural springs, which can take decades or longer to replenish.For the past century, demand for freshwater has grown twice as fast as population growth, explained Steven Solomon, author of Water: The Epic Struggle for Wealth, Power and Civilization. The United Nations predicts that by 2025, 1.8 billion people will live with dire water shortages, and two-thirds of the world’s population could be living under stressed water conditions. That means a race to find untapped springs.Anticipating shortages, companies like Nestlé are trying to lock in as much of the world’s water as possible, explained Solomon. Bottled water is the world’s most popular drink, and its sales recently outstripped soft drinks, according to a study by Beverage Marketing Corp. The trend is expected to intensify. The higher temperatures predicted with climate change will lead to less water and more thirst. “Demand is rising,” Solomon said. “The curve is rising a lot. And they are trying to tie up supply.”“The fact that Nestlé is commercializing these natural resources in a community that doesn’t have access to reliable safe, affordable drinking water is a stunning example of the disparities we see around the world in access to safe water,” Gleick said. “The rich can pay for water and the poor get shortchanged over and over again.”The former CEO of Nestlé, Peter Brabeck-Letmathe, caused an international furor when he praised the commodification of water in a 2005 documentary, saying: “One perspective held by various NGOs – which I would call extreme – is that water should be declared a human right … The other view is that water is a grocery product. And just as every other product, it should have a market value.”While the lack of water in indigenous communities has been carefully documented, the full impact on the health and mental wellbeing of indigenous residents has not.Eager for answers, McMaster University professor Martin-Hill is conducting a three-year interdisciplinary study examining the impact of contaminated water and lack of water on humans, as well as fish and wildlife. “We need to know what is going on. Because what is happening with our water is a systemic, institutional assault on indigenous people’s lands and rights over those lands to protect and preserve them.”Martin-Hill believes that the exorbitant suicide rate among First Nations youth – five to seven times that of other Canadians, according to the federal government – is directly related to the lack of drinkable water. For a Six Nations person, water is sacred and a symbol of life. But the lack also has metaphorical significance, as it becomes representative of the myriad ways that indigenous Canadians are treated as second-class citizens.“The young people are upset, pissed and demoralized,” Martin-Hill said. “There’s a strong element of depression, sadness and hopelessness because it’s been going on for so long. Young people don’t see a future.”“We had to take out a loan for $12m to come up with the final dollars needed,” Chief Ava Hill said. “In addition, they have not provided sufficient operation and maintenance dollars for us to run the plant. The challenges of gaining money for infrastructure on reserves is that the federal government simply does not provide enough dollars even though they have the fiduciary responsibility to do so.”With the election of Justin Trudeau, the tide seemed to shift somewhat. The prime minister promised to improve First Nations prosperity and solve the bad water issue on indigenous reserves by March 2021.While there has been some progress, there aren’t sufficient funds. The Liberal government earmarked $1.8bn over five years to solve the water issue. But the real cost is estimated at $3.2bn, leaving the government more than $1bn short.For Thomas, the inequality between indigenous people’s access to drinking water and everyone else didn’t start with water, but far earlier, with land displacement and colonialism. For her, it is the latest example of an ongoing cultural genocide. When thinking about how she will survive another day without drinking water, she remembers how her family has survived in the past.“We are taught to be resilient,” she said. “It’s not right, but it’s just a reality. You have to tell yourself: ‘This is just the way it is.’ Otherwise you become angry and bitter.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a491d1e8c50c0a139670e81c3dfba3561d4a9a51/0_9_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5878353ab0f002b701df36f5258e0bbe","title":"why is gay leather scene dying","story":"Not long ago, many clubs catered to enthusiastic leathermen. But predatory property developers, changing attitudes to gender and the rise of rubber threaten the scene’s existenceIn a dimly lit sidestreet in London’s East End there is a black box of a building scrawled with graffiti. A CCTV camera perched above the door signals it probably isn’t a squat, but there is no signage. Inside, past three sets of doors and a changing room cordoned off with an old tarpaulin, is a shadowy warren of alcoves, cages and dark corners. Knee-high leather boots hang from iron chains looped through ceiling hooks like fetish bunting. Men kitted out in chaps and overcoats prowl the corridors, while others sip Foster’s, waiting for a nod and a wink. A gregarious barman greets regulars while hairy-chested musclemen appear on a small screen next to an ice bucket.This is the Backstreet, London’s only remaining gay leather bar. But after a 33-year run serving London’s kinksters, its days might be numbered. “The developers have been sniffing around us for years,” says Aaron the barman. “They want to build another high-rise.” Opposition from Tower Hamlets council and community activists has granted the club a brief reprieve, according to the staff, who all work under the assumption that any day could be the venue’s last.A string of closures has caused concern for those interested in a variety of fetishes, but the leather scene seems to have been hardest hit, particularly in London. Bars such as the Coleherne, the Anvil, Bloc, Substation and, most recently, the Hoist, have all disappeared into the annals of gay history, replaced with gastropubs, luxe apartments and identikit offices. Rising rents, competitor fetishes and competition from online dating apps have all been a turn of the screw. Aficionados fear its decline is another milestone in the gay scene’s slow descent into homogeneity.“If some people want to have their matching knitwear and a cocker iel, then I’m happy for them,” says Nigel Whitfield, director of the Breeches and Leather Uniform Fanclub, “but some of us don’t. For lots of kinky people, we knew we were kinky before we knew we were gay. Losing these spaces is a tragedy.”On today’s gay scene, leather denotes an aesthetic and, sometimes, a set of sexual practices. An entry-level leather fetish might just look like getting your rocks off in a well-cut bomber. But for the more committed, it’s a full look: boots, trousers or chaps, belts, shirts, jackets, overcoats, captain hats, all in premium, black leather. The sex tends towards BDSM, from rough horseplay to sadomasochism.“For me, it’s all about the sensory experience,” says Eder, a 34-year-old leatherman who moved to London from Mexico nine years ago. “It’s the look, the feel, the smell – combine it with sex and it just feels amazing.” He discovered leather five years ago and estimates he has spent “a few thousand pounds” on the gear to date. Leather matters to Eder: he ended a long-term relationship because his ex was “vanilla” – a term for people not into kink or fetish – and has since explored his tastes more extensively on Recon, the world’s largest fetish app for gay men. “It doesn’t define me, but it makes me feel so much more confident,” he says. “It’s not just the sex, there’s a community, a social element that provides you with a sense of belonging.”Eder’s story of stumbling upon leather online, exploring in real life, and discovering some form of community was common to the leathermen I spoke to, but it’s only the latest incarnation of a famed subculture that stretches back to the post-war boom of America’s coastal metropoles.Leather as a gay subculture traces its roots back to the appearance of US biker gangs in the 1940s and 50s. Leathers were practical, but the rugged masculinity of biker culture imbued the material with an allure that spoke to men interested in men. Among gay men, leather was also a rejection of the tropes of effeminacy and passivity that homosexuality had accrued since the mid 19th century, a disavowal of the “sweater queens” – well-to-do, preppy gay men – of the time. “Leather was everything that the self-consciously effeminate homosexuals weren’t. They were some of the first gay men to reclaim masculinity,” says Eric Chaline, author and historian of gay sadomasochism.International travel – at least for the wealthy – helped the US leather scene percolate across the Atlantic, notably to Amsterdam, Berlin and London.In the UK, leather subcultures first seem to have taken root in London in the late 50s, though the history of those years has largely been lost. Networks of wealthy and closeted gay leather fans hosted invitation-only private parties to avoid the glare of the authorities.(Homosexuality for those over the age of 21 was not decriminalised in England and Wales until 1967, and some S\u0026ampM practices remain illegal to this day.) The scene was necessarily limited to the middle classes: hosting orgies isn’t easy when you are crammed into a two-bed terrace with a wife and kids, and leather gear is rarely cheap.From the 70s onwards, fan clubs for leathermen popped up in London, Brighton, Manchester, Birmingham, Bournemouth and elsewhere under the guise of Motor Sport Clubs, disguising the gay fetish as a passion for biking. Around the same time, permanent venues rose to the fore. The Coleherne, a bohemian pub in Earl’s Court, became a lodestar for the leather scene. The horseshoe-shaped bar separated regular punters and a morass of leathermen. At the same time, Tom of Finland sketches of burly men in leathers and denim spread through nascent fetish communities pushing life to imitate art.The gay leather scene had reached its peak. Thousands of leathermen congregated in multiple micro scenes across London, while thousands more revelled at club nights and events further afield.Then came a crisis. In 1981, the New York Times reported a “rare cancer spotted in 40 homosexuals”. In San Francisco, one of the first Aids-related deaths was Tony Tavarossi, founder of the city’s first leather bar. Entire communities were eliminated. Bars closed. Hospitals swelled. The leathermen were some of the first to go.Kellan Farshea, a veteran sadomasochist and campaigner for sexual liberty, recalls the early years of the crisis in the UK. “The Aids crisis was very much based in the leather community because that’s where a lot of the sex clubs were. A lot of the people involved in Earl’s Court were wiped out completely.”But the virus wasn’t the only threat. “Every single leather S\u0026ampM club in London was raided by the police at least once, but they couldn’t get any convictions because juries wouldn’t convict us,” says Farshea. The high-profile conviction of gay sadomasochists arrested in Manchester in 1987, known as the Spanner case, drew lurid headlines and stoked public prejudice. A campaign to appeal the conviction, spearheaded by Farshea and others, went through the high court and House of Lords before being referred to the European high court. The ruling on the case holds to this day and it is still not possible to legally consent to a range of “extreme” S\u0026ampM practices.Decades of stigma, epidemic and state persecution haven’t killed leather, but the feeling that the scene – or at least its physical spaces – is in decline is widespread.“The internet changed everything,” says Farshea. Apps such as Grindr and Recon mean getting off doesn’t necessitate going to a club online hookups don’t come with a £15 cover charge and they are not limited to a venue’s opening hours.But the internet has also fractured, and democratised, fetish. Retailers and club owners were often guided by their particular tastes – leather boots, in the case of the Backstreet’s owner – that dictated what people had to be into in order to get access to the kinds of sex they were chasing. “Leather was the dominant practice and discourse of gay BDSM from the 1950s to the 80s,” says Chaline. If you wanted to get tied up of a Saturday afternoon, chances are you had to do so in leather.According to Farshea, leather’s hegemony in gay BDSM scenes was as much about its commercial saleability as some mysterious gravitation towards processed cow skin. When the full look can cost north of three grand, it’s perhaps not surprising that younger generations are opting for PVC or rubber, a scene that has “exploded” in the past 10 years according to Sandy Pianim, brand director at Recon. “The leather scene hasn’t modernised, it hasn’t evolved,” he says. Many leather nights still exclude women. Lesbian BDSM nights existed separate from the gay men’s scene, but no clubs have lasted. The scene also remains glaringly white, according to Pianim. And in a time when queer cultures are shifting to conversations around gender rather than sex, leather’s celebration of unfettered masculinity feels out of joint, he argues. “Leather is based on this archetype of hyper-masculinity that doesn’t resonate in the way that it once did. Our cultural archetypes have changed.”For all the speculation on the reasons for the leather scene’s decline, however, there is a much more mundane truth. Venues in London that cater to specialist audiences, from leather fetishes to the queer communities more broadly, have been buffeted by spiralling costs, predatory developers and councils turning a quick buck to survive swingeing budget cuts. People in other cities in the UK, where venues were sparse due to the difficulty of maintaining premises catering to a much smaller scene, now rely on one-off nights or travelling to fetish events abroad.For the leathermen who spoke to me, old-school bars can’t be replaced with Grindr-fuelled hookups or occasional events such as Folsom Europe, a continent-wide fetish and leather festival held annually in Berlin. Farshea fears the death of physical venues will make it harder for him to meet with fellow campaigners. Whitfield is concerned that the unique atmosphere of a leather bar will be lost to history. And Eder, who has accrued a “leather family” in his five years on the scene, fears that community bonds are weakened when that community has nowhere to meet.“It’s always been the freaks who have been the canary in the coal mine,” says Whitfield, whether in the fight for basic rights or in the ongoing closures of minority spaces.For now, the Backstreet lives on, throwing specialist parties for rubberists and occasional gigs to keep afloat. For how long, though, nobody quite knows."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98fedac3d45c16ac206d3641173b87b787a17709/0_280_6823_4093/master/6823.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=92fb4b584b5445b64b1895796fbb91a9","title":"cat power wanderer album review","story":"(Domino)Chan Marshall’s latest album adds Auto-Tune, Lana Del Rey and a Rihanna cover version to her folk, blues and American roots music. It’s the work of a woman going her own wayOf all the clearly doomed-to-failure schemes dreamed up by the music industry over the years, the one Chan Marshall claims her former record label devised for her a few years back takes some beating. Her ninth album as Cat Power, 2012’s Sun, had cracked the US Top 10, indicative of an interest in the 46-year-old singer-songwriter stretching beyond her usual devoted cult following. Emboldened by these developments, Matador apparently decided that Marshall’s next album should represent a concerted push for full-blown commercial crossover.You can’t blame them for trying to turn a buck, but there’s something mind-blowing about the concept of shunting Marshall towards vast fame and celebrity. Her story thus far has been peppered with stints in rehab, a stay in hospital occasioned by a psychotic breakdown, painfully frank confessional interviews and gigs that linger in the memory as perhaps the most uncomfortable experience one could have in a live music venue, short of the PA falling on one’s head. Marshall is keen to let the world know that she’s doing well and that reports of her being – as she put it – “fucking whack-o” happily belong to history. “The doctor said I was better than ever – man, you should have seen me,” she sings on Woman, the lead single from Wanderer. “The doctor said I was not my past, he said I was finally free.” Nevertheless, the notion that someone might look over her career to date and conclude that, yes, here is someone with the vaulting ambition and bulletproof confidence required to deal with mainstream success seems pretty fucking whack-o in itself.Still, you can see why people might think a commercial breakthrough is at Marshall’s fingertips, should she so desire. It’s a point demonstrated by Wanderer, an album she took elsewhere (to Domino) after the contretemps with her previous employer. It features a guest appearance from a heavyweight star – Lana Del Rey, another Cat Power admirer, who sounds noticeably more alive on Woman than she does when inhabiting the blank-eyed persona of her own albums – and a careworn piano cover of a big pop hit, Rihanna’s 2012 single Stay. A voice worn hard by the cynicism of the music industry might suggest that it is not merely lovely, but also much the stuff of which TV ad soundtracks are made.The songs are great, grounded in folk, blues and other American roots music – it’s not such a stretch to imagine the a capella title track stripped of its ghostly echo and performed by a church choir back in Marshall’s native Georgia – but they never seem reverent or forced. It feels instead as if Marshall is drawing on music that comes naturally to her and shaping it to her own ends. Black is rooted in the desolate folk storytelling tradition where a physical embodiment of death stalks the Earth, ready to trap the unwary, but Marshall warps its conventions to describe a drug overdose. You could draw a line between the brief, acoustic Robbin Hood and the eerie early 20th-century Americana collected on Harry Smith’s Anthology of American Folk Music, but it shares space on Wanderer with Horizon, a song decorated with spidery trails of Auto-Tuned vocals.Whether it seems like music that might have existed nearly a century ago or music that could only have been made in 2018, the sound of Wanderer is stripped back but inviting, intimate rather than austere. Marshall’s lovely malt-whiskey voice flows around the guitar and pianos, earthy, smoky and warming even when she’s singing some pretty chilling lyrics. The strutting, empowered confidence of Woman is at odds with the rest of the album’s emotional tenor. Horizon starts out sounding like a song about familial reconciliation and homecoming before nagging doubts creep in and continued estrangement seems a better option: you gradually become aware that the refrain of “I’m on my way” means the protagonist is headed in the opposite direction. There’s something very equivocal about the hard-won experience of You Get (“You will live in this world and you’ll get what you get”) and Nothing Really Matters, the latter’s repetitions of its title feeling alternately optimistic and glumly resigned. In Your Face clings on to the hope that a very Trump-like figure will one day find himself unable to face his reflection in the mirror, but something about the way she draws said figure suggests this hope is forlorn.These are complex songs, striking but low-key: their constant references to motion and travel seem to have as much to do with Marshall’s determination to go her own way artistically – whatever expectations others have of her – as they do with the peripatetic life of a touring musician. There’s a quiet confidence and poise about Wanderer that suggests Marshall is exactly where she wants to be.Afro B – Drogba (Joanna) (Team Salut and Toddla T UK Garage Remix)London Afrobeat pioneer beautifully remixed: the results recall that early noughties moment when garage briefly functioned as gleaming pop."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f1370bb0003774c3e34de01fc448cc5e06a93f04/0_2_1960_1176/master/1960.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=087bba64ca4ad9521c8bd8a2693cd0e2","title":"meet some of the women succeeding in stem","story":"There are women with flourishing science and technology careers, but work is needed to make this the norm rather than the exception. Here, industry leaders explain the importance of breaking through stereotypes and giving support and mentorship to the next generation of female Stem talentBut how do you bust the myth that Stem careers are only for the boys? And how do we nurture the next generation of female Stem talent?“I wish it wasn’t true, but I think gender stereotyping still plays a big part in deterring women from entering Stem,” says Dr Sian Morris, associate director for scientific communications at P\u0026ampG. A veteran of the company, Morris joined P\u0026ampG in 1992, and since then has worked in a plethora of roles, including developing cosmetics that are still on sale today, and working in the consumer understanding team to gain insight into who buys P\u0026ampG products across the globe. It’s been a erse and varied career, and one that has enabled Morris to gain a huge range of professional experiences. But Morris believes that many young girls might be deterred from enjoying a creative and fulfilling career like hers, due to the gendered expectations we instil in young girls. “There’s this idea of ‘pink jobs’ and ‘blue jobs’ that still exists,” she says. “It starts early in life, and if it’s nurtured in the classroom, then girls opt out of Stem.” It’s critical, Morris argues, to challenge the false expectation girls often have that boys are simply better at Stem. “Some girls simply self-deselect. Girls and women are naturally tough on ourselves, and that, combined with having to fight for airtime in a boy-dominated class, or being put down for your interests, can sometimes make you find a different path.”Of course, it’s not all about encouraging women to study Stem subjects at school and university: it’s also about helping them feel supported and nurtured in their career, and particularly helping them to navigate the challenges of having a family and working. Many of the women I speak to cite the importance of female mentors and role models early in their careers as pivotal to their success. “I’m lucky to have an inspirational mentor who provides great support and taught me the importance of making courageous choices, even when they’re unpopular,” explains Ilaria Ambrogio, principal scientist at P\u0026ampG. For senior IT manager Sinead Devine, being a woman in IT felt challenging, especially early on. “When I started, I was in the minority,” she remembers, “and I felt that even more when I had my first child, about four years into my career.” But Devine used that feeling of being one of the few, not the many, to help champion a better work-life balance for working parents at P\u0026ampG, with considerable success. “The number of female IT professionals is more balanced now, and there’s a better network to support women in all phases of their careers.”Some women still feel there’s a lot of unlearning you have to do to rise to the top as a woman in Stem, such as unlearning the social checks we place upon girls in adolescence that they carry throughout their adult lives: aim high, but not too high be successful, but never boast avoid confrontation or handle challenging situations by trying to please people, rather than forging your own path. These gendered norms may impede some women from achieving their full potential in Stem careers – which is why they need to be unlearned.“I’ve grown in confidence in my ability to have true leadership, which isn’t a quality I had when I was at college,” Devine explains. “I’ve learned to hold my own in more challenging situations, and not just to be louder than anyone else, but to be more strategic and really drive decisions.”What advice would these industry leaders give to young women looking to get into Stem? “Be receptive to new possibilities and break through stereotypes,” urges Ursula Heng of P\u0026ampG’s beauty delivery engineering ision. “If you’re encountering prejudice, educate others, but above all – find your voice.” Also, stay true to yourself. “Women are still a minority in Stem,” Heng acknowledges, “but that doesn’t mean you have to be someone else in order to thrive. P\u0026ampG is a great company to work for, because it genuinely values ersity, and that enables everyone to bring their true self to work.”Even though there are as many Stem careers as there are elements in the periodic table, many girls may continue to view the industry in terms of narrow stereotypes. “There’s this idea that a career in Stem means you’re either a white coat-wearing laboratory scientist, an engineer in overalls and a hard hat, or a slightly eccentric academic professor,” Heng says. “But there are many instances of engineers and scientists working in completely different environments on a range of applications that affect every aspect of our lives: digitisation, weather patterns, or transport systems. They are very important, fabulous, and extremely relevant!” Thankfully, things are changing. One recent study found that more women have entered Stem in the past 40 years than any other field. But further work needs to be done to help encourage these women to stay in the industry, grow, and support and nurture the next generation of female talent. Still, when reflecting on the next generation of young, female students, Morris feels ebullient.“They are enthusiastic, energetic, curious, fun, and eager to translate their passion for science and engineering into careers,” she says. “Now we just need to make sure that when girls do have that spark of interest in Stem, we foster it and fan it into a flame and keep it burning bright.”Many companies support programmes that see Stem ambassadors visit schools to help highlight the opportunities available and encourage young girls and children to explore a Stem career.

Here, LGBTQ+ employees detail their experiences and explain what can be done to improve inclusivityFor many, “coming out” is a slight misnomer. The phrase implies one definitive act – you’re in the closet, and then you leave it – whereas the reality can often be more nuanced. Coming out as gay, lesbian, bi or trans isn’t a one-off event: it’s something that can happen dozens of times. Perhaps you first come out to a friend, then a parent, and then your wider circle, before finally plucking up the courage to tell your gran (who says she’s always known, before carrying on with her Sudoku – if you’re lucky).Coming out at work can be an even more protracted process. The average person changes jobs 10 to 15 times in a working lifetime, and that’s without factoring in an ever-changing carousel of colleagues and clients. It’s probably unnecessary to announce your gender identity and sexuality to every contractor, freelancer and intern you encounter, but at some point the subject is bound to come up. Since most people are assumed to be cisgender (those whose gender identity matches the sex that they were assigned at birth) and heterosexual, how does it feel to tell your workmates otherwise?Vijay Sitlani, 43, is the finance director of P\u0026ampG. Born in India he worked for the corporation in India and Singapore, where he felt it was very difficult for him to come out. When he moved to Geneva, his attitude became more relaxed within a more inclusive environment. By the time he transferred to the UK business in 2016, he felt comfortable coming out as gay to his entire team and started helping other LGBTQ+ employees find their courage. “You don’t just come out one day and then you’re out, it happens in small, baby steps,” he says. “When I worked in Singapore, there were only a handful of colleagues who knew that I was gay, and that was mostly for logistical reasons such as arranging visas for my partner. At P\u0026ampG, when someone from management introduced themselves to a team, they’d usually show a slide with a picture of themselves with their wife and children. My slides would always be about my career history and nothing else.“Then, when I came to the UK, I was aware that it was more liberal than the other countries I had worked in. It took great guts, but when it was time to introduce myself to my new team, I put up a slide that included a photograph of my partner, my dog and me. Nobody batted an eyelid, which felt like a big milestone for me.”Others have had less positive experiences. “When I first started working, I used to dread answering questions about my personal life,” says Ruth Holland, a 31-year-old producer and director. “The responses were always so predictable. People would say: ‘Oh, really, I had no idea you were a lesbian!’ I’d think: ‘Why would you have?’ Once a male colleague asked if I had a boyfriend, and when I told him I had a girlfriend, he said: ‘You’re not a lesbian, you’ve got long hair!’ I don’t think he was being malicious, but you could have heard a penny drop, and I’d have appreciated someone taking the heat off me and telling him he was being ridiculous. Other people would ask really personal questions, such as ‘How did you come out?’ or ‘How are you going to have a baby?’ They aren’t conversations that you necessarily want to have in big groups, or with people you’ve just met.”Shon Faye, 30, is a Bristol-based writer, artist and standup comedian, but originally trained as a solicitor. “After coming out as trans, I applied for a job as a solicitor paralegal, which I found quite difficult,” she says. “It was quite early in my transition, so I didn’t look particularly feminine, and I felt quite anxious to turn up to a job interview where they’d be expecting a cisgender woman. In the end I decided to mention the fact that I was trans on my cover letter, and once I got the job I was asked whether I wanted my team to be told.“Everyone was perfectly nice about it, but there were a few awkward moments where well-meaning colleagues got their pronouns wrong, and said things such as: ‘My uncle became my aunt and we all respect him.’” Despite law being regarded as a stereotypically conservative industry, Faye says: “I’ve actually had to deal with more transphobia since working in the media. For instance, a television producer asked me lots of intrusive questions about what hormones I was on. I think it’s because lawyers are petrified of being sued, which is quite healthy in a way. The media has a more informal atmosphere, which can lead to more problems.”Thankfully, things do appear to be improving. “Workplace cultures have changed a lot, even in the past 10 years,” says Holland. “There’s a lot more awareness about what’s appropriate to ask an LGBTQ+ person. It’s one reason I think it’s important to come out at work, because visibility makes a difference. The more commonplace LGBTQ+ people are, the less you feel defined by your sexuality, rather than being good at your job.”Sitlani’s experience of coming out was helped by the fact that P\u0026ampG has a GABLE (gay, ally, bisexual, lesbian and transgender employees) affinity group, which runs training sessions exploring how straight employees can be good LGBTQ+ allies. “P\u0026ampG are making a lot of headway in inclusivity culture,” he explains. “People wear a rainbow badge, or have stickers on their laptop, to openly show they are allies.”As for the advice he’d give anyone thinking about coming out at work? “There is no best way to come out,” says Sitlani. “It’s entirely up to the inidual and how they feel about it. Everyone is on their own journey and you have to do what makes you comfortable.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93060d47c6b22656c5e087165cd3f31cbfc6f692/0_26_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=335263fc3162af73d9a0aa82116bf84c","title":"theresa may conference speech ambasts labour as she calls for tory unity","story":"PM makes several policy pledges in effort to show Brexit has not blown her off courseTheresa May has made a bold pledge to bring a decade of austerity to a close, as she appealed to the public over the heads of her squabbling party to back her to deliver a Brexit deal.Speaking in Birmingham on Wednesday at the end of the Conservatives’ annual conference, which was marred by repeated clashes over Europe, May cast aside the chancellor’s concerns about the health of the country’s finances and signalled Brexit would mark an end to public spending cuts.Despite widespread speculation about her future, May also made several domestic policy announcements in an attempt to show she has not been blown off course by Brexit or noisy critics led by Boris Johnson.But her most eye-catching pledge was the promise to bring to an end the decade-long programme of spending cuts imposed after the banking bailouts.“When we’ve secured a good Brexit deal for Britain, at the spending review next year we will set out our approach for the future,” she said. “A decade after the financial crash, people need to know that the austerity it led to is over and that their hard work has paid off.“There must be no return to the uncontrolled borrowing of the past. No undoing all the progress of the last eight years. No taking Britain back to square one. But the British people need to know that the end is in sight. And our message to them must be this: we get it.”Experts were sceptical about the idea of drawing a line under austerity in 2019. Torsten Bell, the director of the Resolution Foundation thinktank, said: “The public and most politicians are tired of austerity, but we’re a long way off from actually ending it.”Current government plans involve continuing to reduce the deficit until the second half of the 2020s, with significant cuts to many departments’ budgets pencilled in. May’s speech marks a significant change in rhetoric but actually ending the current era of public spending restraint will involve not words but significant tax rises and higher borrowing.The prime minister’s remarks were an effort to convince the public that “our future is full of promise” but they also appeared to signal Conservative anxieties that Jeremy Corbyn’s anti-austerity narrative has become “the new political mainstream”, as the Labour leader claimed in his own well-received conference speech last week.In a self-deprecating move aides later insisted was unplanned, May appeared on stage dancing to Abba’s Dancing Queen – and made a series of pointed calls for her party to unite.“It is no surprise that we have had a range of different views expressed this week. But my job as prime minister is to do what I believe to be in the national interest,” she said.The Treasury has been keen to stress that future public spending plans will depend on the exact nature of the Brexit deal Britain secures, with the chancellor and the business secretary suggesting a Canada-style approach would lead to slower economic growth.Hammond is also closely watching the financial markets, amid fears that the next few weeks could see sharp movements in sterling and share prices as the government battles to secure a deal.But No 10 sources said after the speech that May’s promise to end austerity in next year’s spending review, due next spring, was unconditional.The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell said: “Theresa May’s claim that austerity is over is a con. If the prime minister wants to back up her words with action, Philip Hammond should announce immediately that the cuts scheduled for the next four years will be cancelled.“If he cannot, or will not, then Theresa May’s announcement today was not just empty – it was clearly a deceitful attempt to trick the public.”A day after Boris Johnson told a rapt audience in Birmingham that her Brexit plans represented a “betrayal”, May told her colleagues that if they failed to back her, Brexit could unravel altogether. “If we all go off in different directions in pursuit of our own visions of the perfect Brexit, we risk ending up with no Brexit at all,” she said.She hit back at Johnson without mentioning the former foreign secretary by name, saying: “Leadership is doing what you believe to be right, and having the courage and determination to see it through, and that’s what I’ve been doing on Brexit.”Speaking about Brexit voters, she said: “We put our faith in their judgment. They have put their faith in us to deliver. I will not let them down.”May did not mention her Chequers plan, which rebel Tories have been urging her to “chuck”, speaking instead about “a free-trade deal that provides for frictionless trade in goods”, which would “protect our precious union”.Throughout the hour-long speech, May repeatedly returned to attacking the opposition. She sought to exploit isions in the Labour party, claiming she could see “the heirs of Hugh Gaitskell and Barbara Castle, Denis Healey and John Smith”, in today’s Labour party but not on the frontbench.“Instead, their faces stare blankly out from the rows behind, while another party occupies prime position: the Jeremy Corbyn party,” she said, claiming the Labour frontbench “rejects the common values that once bridged our political ide”.Corbyn has been criticised repeatedly from the platform by cabinet ministers this week, underlining the fact that senior Conservatives regard Labour as a serious electoral threat.May said that in contrast to Labour, the Conservatives should appeal to voters as “a party that is decent, moderate, and patriotic. One that puts the national interest first. Delivers on the issues they care about. And is comfortable with modern Britain in all its ersity.”May also bemoaned the toxic nature of public debate, citing the murdered MP Jo Cox’s argument that political opponents have “more in common than ides us”.“Rigorous debate between political opponents is becoming more like a confrontation between enemies,” she said. “You don’t have to believe in a word Diane Abbott says to believe in her right to say it, free of abuse.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb7006f41765e9aa734156b145c8b788219f71c0/0_38_899_539/master/899.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0967b2285eb18e14c0b43134b7468326","title":"no deal brexit could cause a recession says rbs boss politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments as they happenQ: Should Hunt resign over his comments?That’s not my problem, says Tusk.And that’s it.

It goes much further than the Canada trade deal on issues like security.This offer is still on the table, he says.And he criticises what Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, said in his speech to the Tory conference.Comparing the European Union to the Soviet Union is unwise at it is insulting.Jens Stoltenberg, the Nato secretary general, has posted this tweet about today’s revelations about the GRU.Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, has recorded a clip for broadcasters with his response to the new revelations about the GRU attempted cyber-attack against he Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. He said:If anyone had any questions in their mind about Russian military involvement in the Salisbury attacks, this will put to rest those doubts because we have evidence of the Russian military launching a cyber-attack on the very international organisation in the Netherlands set up to investigate those novichok attacks. And why would you do that if you weren’t the guilty party?The reality is that this is part of a pattern of cyber-attacks in the UK, the US, Malaysia, Switzerland, now the Netherlands, and the Russian government needs to know that if they flout international law in this way, there will be consequences, they will be exposed, and people will see the Russian government for what they are, which is an organisation that is trying to fester instability throughout the world, and that is totally unacceptable.At the briefing in The Hague Peter Wilson, the British ambassador to the Netherlands, confirmed that Porton Down, the military research laboratory, was targeted by the GRU. He said:Another of the cyber actors identified as the GRU was Sandworm, which was active in the wake of the Salisbury attacks. I can reveal that they were behind the following attempted intrusions: in March, straight after the Salisbury attack, the GRU attempted to compromise UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office computer systems via a spear fishing attack. And in May, GRU hackers sent spear fishing emails which impersonated Swiss federal authorities to target OPCW employees directly and thus OPCW computer systems.General Onno Eichelsheim, head of the Dutch intelligence service, told the briefing in The Hague:The Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova has dismissed the new hacking accusations from the UK as “big fantasies”. The Dutch authorities released pictures of the Russian agents as they arrived at Schipol Airport. The cyber-experts, who were accompanied by two operational support operatives, travelled on diplomatic passports with consecutive numbers under the names Aleksei Morenets and Evgenii Serebriakov. They hired a Citroen car and were picked up by the Dutch authorities with all the equipment in the boot. A senior British security official said: “For the GRU to get caught in this way would be considered a pretty bad day”.Theresa May and her Dutch counterpart, Mark Rutte, have issued this statement about the revelations about the GRU’s attempted cyber-attack against the OPCW. They said:We have, with the operations exposed today, further shone a light on the unacceptable cyber activities of the Russian military intelligence service, the GRU. It has targeted institutions across the world, including the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) in The Hague.This attempt to access the secure systems of an international organisation working to rid the world of chemical weapons, demonstrates the GRU’s disregard for the global values and rules that keep us all safe. The GRU’s reckless operations stretch from destructive cyber activity to the use of illegal nerve agents, as we saw in Salisbury. That attack left four people fighting for their lives and one woman dead.Our action today reinforces the clear message from the international community.

He has posted some of the main revelations on Twitter.Here are the passport pictures Corera is talking about.At a press conference in The Hague, the British ambassador to the Netherlands, Peter Wilson, said: The disruption of this attempted attack on the OPCW was down to the expertise and the professionalism of the Dutch security services in partnership with the United Kingdom.

Either way, people in the UK are concerned that empathy is on the wane, with more than half of the population believing Britons’ ability to sense, understand and share the feelings of others has declined over the last year.It amounts to “an emerging crisis of empathy”, according to the Scout movement, which commissioned the research. Bear Grylls, the explorer, TV presenter and chief scout, has warned that if the trend continues “we risk more ision in our communities and increasing alienation among young people”.The findings follow research by Cambridge University that found empathy is a largely learned trait, although it can be passed on genetically in a minority of cases.But they come amid other indications of rising solidarity, at least among some groups. Support for increased taxes to spend more on health, education and social benefits is at its highest since 2002, according to the survey of social attitudes in Britain by the NatCen centre for social research.But there are splits in British society along generational lines about how much others need help and on issues such as climate change.Two-thirds of people aged 18 to 25 want the government to top up low-earning working parents’ wages, compared with less than half of people over 65. Equally, eight out of 10 of this younger group want low-earning single parents’ wages to be topped up compared with less than six out of 10 of the older group, according to the latest British Social Attitudes survey.Grylls said: “In a world that sometimes feels fractured and insular, empathy and kindness are more important than ever. When society is polarised we need to work twice as hard to understand each other and find ways of working together. I believe young people have a right to develop key skills such as empathy and kindness and we urgently need more adult volunteers to help us do this.”Ben Page, the chief executive of Ipsos Mori, said studies had shown that people born before 1945 and the establishment of the NHS and the welfare state were more empathetic towards the poor than each subsequent generation.Matt Hyde, chief executive of the Scout Association, said: “There is a worrying decline in empathy in the UK. We have a polarised politics and I don’t think social media helps. People are retreating into their own friendship circles and not engaging with people different to them.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/13d051198a268c89ed7083ee16f32d9cb7ff1d18/0_77_4262_2557/master/4262.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4ed9586b1fe81aa683e3dbf3bc6337fb","title":"conor mcgregor khabib nurmagomedov ufc 229 las vegas","story":"The Irishman is UFC’s biggest earner but his recent behaviour has been erratic and provocative. But in Dana White’s world, money is kingOn a chilly Thursday afternoon in April, Conor McGregor stormed into the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York, and proceeded to wreak havoc. The Irishman snuck into the building with the intention of confronting Khabib Nurmagomedov, who was scheduled to compete for the vacant UFC lightweight title that weekend. McGregor, accompanied by an entourage, entered the building’s parking lot and began vandalizing a bus full of fighters before throwing a dolly through one of the windows. Several fighters were hospitalized and removed from their scheduled bouts. The entire scene was captured on video, immortalizing one of the most embarrassing moments in UFC history.McGregor later turned himself in to New York police and was charged with assault and criminal mischief (prosecutors later dropped the two felonies and related charges following a plea deal).McGregor’s actions that week had a lasting impact. UFC lightweight Michael Chiesa suffered lacerations after the dolly smashed through the window, while fellow UFC fighter Ray Borg suffered an eye injury from shattered glass. Both men were hospitalized and removed from their respective fights. Others, including UFC straw-weight champion Rose Namajunas, were left shaken by the experience. Even UFC president Dana White – who knows the Irishman hauls in big gates and pay per view numbers – appeared disgusted by McGregor’s actions.“Do you want to be in business with Conor McGregor right now?” White said during an impromptu media scrum following the incident. “Do you want to chase this guy around for interviews and buy his fights? Do you? I don’t think anybody is going to want to right now. I think everybody is going to be pretty disgusted with Conor McGregor right now.”The bus incident earned McGregor a significant amount of negative publicity. However, the outrage surrounding the melee died down over the coming months, particularly after McGregor reached a plea agreement in July and pleaded guilty to a single violation of disorderly conduct.For their part, and despite White’s earlier bluster, the UFC opted not to take any action against McGregor. Instead, they have now repurposed the entire incident to help promote arguably the biggest fights in UFC history.At a press conference for UFC’s 25th anniversary in early August, White announced that Nurmagomedov would fight McGregor at UFC 229 in Las Vegas. The announcement took place less than a month after the Irishman struck his plea deal, and was capped off with a promotional video that used footage from the bus attack.In fairness, Nurmagomedov-McGregor is a dream fight for UFC fans, and one that many did not expect to happen. McGregor’s brash style and outlandish persona are in stark contrast to Nurmagomedov’s subdued demeanour and intimidating presence, which only adds more depth to an already compelling contest. It is also a fight that is, according to White, expected to break the UFC’s previous pay-per-view record.It should be noted that four of the UFC’s top five most profitable PPV events were headlined by McGregor. In McGregor’s absence over the past two years, the UFC has failed to recreate those figures and has struggled on PPV. The only exception was UFC 207, which featured the return of Ronda Rousey, who has since left for WWE. Given these figures, it is clear why UFC jumped at another McGregor fight.While Nurmagomedov-McGregor is a financial boon for the UFC, it remains a risky venture. The Irishman and his entourage have already caused havoc during the Barclays Center incident. A handful of those men may be present with McGregor this time around, and given that Nurmagomedov also walks around with a sizeable team that has been known to intimidate and confront fighters, the lead-up to the PPV may be explosive.McGregor has also spent the last few weeks stoking religious and ethnic tensions. He posted pictures on social media with captions referencing him “chilling in Jahannam” (the Arabic word for hell) – Nurmagomedov is Muslim. He also posted a picture of one of Nurmagomedov’s training partners, Chechen fighter Zubaira Tukhugov, with the caption: “A true Chechen would never take orders from a Dagestani man.” Nurmagomedov is from Dagestan.Given the loaded statements McGregor has incorporated into his fight promotion, the disdain between the fighters’ teams and their respective fans will be palpable come Saturday night. According to a source close to the event, the UFC is taking steps to ensure the appropriate levels of security are in place for the event. While it remains unclear what this entails, it will likely include increased police presence at the arena, which could potentially limit any clashes between fans.Potential fights are far from the only security concern facing the UFC 229 main event. During a press conference to promote the fight, McGregor attempted to play mind games with Nurmagomedov by referencing some of the shady characters that have been associated with the UFC champion. One of the controversial figures mentioned was the Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, who invited Nurmagomedov to host seminars at his fight club in 2016. McGregor has called Kadyrov a “crazy dictator” and those comments were not well received in Chechnya, where Kadyrov rules with an iron fist. One of the fighters who represents Kadyrov’s fight club posted a video warning McGregor that he will “answer for his words” before demanding a public apology. This was followed by an official statement from the Chechen minister for press and information, who questioned McGregor’s mental health before calling him an “outrageous clown” who acts like a “Mexican rooster.”While the intimidation tactics used by Kadyrov and his henchmen have been well-documented over the years, few expected him to target one of the most recognizable athletes on the planet. Though Kadyrov has not personally commented on McGregor or the upcoming UFC 229 event, the statements uttered by the dictator’s mouthpieces should be enough to raise security concerns for the Irishman.The UFC’s decision to place McGregor in this weekend’s main event emphasizes the promotion’s willingness to forfeit punishment for profit. Perhaps more significantly their decision to push ahead with the main event despite the threats directed at McGregor and the rising tension between the Irishman and the Russian’s teams shows UFC is willing to gamble on high-risk situations in order to reap its rewards."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/838ac5f05d637180974d2ac9bb71c7d4714c758e/0_53_2027_1216/master/2027.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a648ed8619389705cdf2e4adfe86a251","title":"lewis hamilton mercedes team orders f1 title japanese grand prix","story":"Lewis Hamilton has insisted the use of team orders that ensured his win at the last round in Russia would not detract from a great sense of satisfaction should he go on to take the Formula One title. Speaking before the Japanese grand prix, Hamilton said he was not comfortable with team orders but felt proud of how he had driven this season. His Mercedes team-mate Valtteri Bottas confirmed that he would support Hamilton again should it be required.Bottas gave up his place in Sochi to ensure Hamilton took victory, although the Finn had secured pole position and was in a commanding position to take his first win of the season. However he has no chance to win the championship and Mercedes wanted to ensure that Hamilton maximised his points gain against title rival Sebastian Vettel.With Vettel finishing third in Russia, the victory gave Hamilton a 50 point lead in the world championship but the use of orders was not popular with many. When asked if it would take the shine off winning his fifth title, Hamilton was unequivocal. “For me personally no,” he said. “Everyone has a right to their own opinion but I have given my hardest throughout the year and conducted myself in the right way. This has been the best performing year so far in my career.”The team have used orders tactically before but this was the first time Mercedes have employed instructions that reversed positions to ensure a win for one driver over another. Hamilton, who has always been adamant he has never wanted to win through team orders, admitted he did not feel comfortable with their use.“You don’t get your mind around it, you just have to accept it and move forwards,” he said. “I am definitely split about it. But it has happened and it is done and dusted and as a team we stay united through the experience. I was at the factory and the support was amazing and the respect for Valtteri. We had a toast to Valtteri, 900 people standing there was really awesome.”Mercedes have said that they may employ orders in specific situations but until now have allowed their drivers to compete without intervention. Before the race however it had been made clear to Bottas that he may be required to sacrifice himself given the intensity of the championship battle with Ferrari and Vettel.Hamilton has established a strong lead, winning five of the last six races but many have been against the head with Ferrari having the stronger car. The competition has been so strong there was concern at Mercedes that any error or retirement could put Ferrari back in the fight.The team have since made it clear to Bottas that similar circumstances could mean further use of instructions. “Yes, I will be supporting Lewis,” he said. “It will depend on the situation because we don’t want to risk certain things. It definitely could happen again. It will always depend on the situation and it is what I expect. It will go case-by-case.”Mercedes had used orders at the Hungaroring this year, with Bottas giving way to Hamilton so he could attack the lead. However when he was unable to take the place, Hamilton gave the position back to the Finn. At Suzuka Bottas said he accepted it is part of the sport but insisted it had not detracted from his desire to win.“I am a team player. It is what I do,” he said. “When it is time, and I am allowed to win, I will do it. For us, as a team, that race result is the best outcome we could have ever hoped for. I will do it again. It doesn’t mean that I am not a racer and I don’t want to win. Winning is everything, but that time will come later.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93e60ce20facb2b6b219ed99ce631b5b88c56731/0_58_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f3debb9df6706309f5976ccf89d61f8","title":"prix de larc de triomphe draw gives enable chance of rare repeat feat","story":"The draw suits last year’s winner, who could become only the second horse since 1978 to take successive runnings of the raceEnable, last year’s winner of the Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe, has been given an ideal draw in stall six ahead of her attempt to become only the second horse since 1978 to take successive runnings of Europe’s most prestigious race. The ballot was not so kind to the second-favourite Sea Of Class, however, and James Doyle will be leaving stall 15, towards the outside of the 19-strong field, on William Haggas’s filly.The draw can be highly significant in big fields at Longchamp, where horses caught wide can lose vital ground, for instance as the field turns into a “false” straight for about a furlong before rounding the home turn. Four horses were quoted at 20-1 or shorter for Sunday’s race before the draw – Enable, Sea Of Class, Andre Fabre’s Waldgeist and the St Leger winner, Kew Gardens – and Enable was the only one of the four to get a single-figure stall towards the rail. Waldgeist will start from 13 while Kew Gardens and Ryan Moore are drawn 14.Enable has already been trimmed from 5-4 to 11-10 following the draw, and she could well set off as an odds-on favourite on Sunda. Sea Of Class is a 7-2 chance while Waldgeist is 7-1, Kew Gardens is 12-1 in a place and it is 33-1 bar the four.There is a distinctly autumnal – indeed, almost wintry – feel to the domestic cards, with two meetings over jumps and two on the all-weather Flat. And there is also, for only the second time since October 2014, a walkover on a British track after two of the original three declarations for the beginners’ chase at Warwick were taken out of the race this morning.It is not difficult to imagine a few conspiracy theories swirling around as, astonishingly, the owner of Dan Skelton’s Desirable Court, the last horse standing, is none other than Craig Buckingham, victim of the fiasco at Nottingham on Wednesday when his runner Magic Pulse was mistakenly taken out of a valuable sprint handicap.Buckingham will pick up just over £5,000 so long as Desirable Court gets to the track and proves she is sound. The way his luck is running at the moment, though, what price the horsebox breaks down?The walkover is disappointing for racegoers, who expect to see at least six races on any card in Britain. It is also a little embarrassing for the sport that any race can attract such a meagre turnout, regardless of whether it then loses two-thirds of the declarations. Prize money is supposed to be the reward for helping to put on a show, not dished out when there’s no show at all.But the older punters among us will recall that one-horse races have never been commonplace, walkovers are a much rarer occurrence now than they were in the past. This is the first since April 2017, while the most recent walkover before that was in July 2012. And there were four in 2011 alone. In this respect at least, the efforts put into making the racing programme more competitive in recent years seems to have paid off, and that includes investments in watering systems and turf management that have effectively banished very firm and hard ground from the racing lexicon.In the races that actually have some runners at Warwick, Lissycasey (2.10) and Chieftain’s Choice (3.50) should both go well, while So Hi Class (3.25) and Silver Swift (4.30) are solid picks on the all-weather at Lingfield and Molten Lava (7.45) is an interesting 6-1 chance at Chelmsford.Tips by Greg Wood"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e9ce0b3167cbc1347df729b43b634fa3accd2c5/0_0_2232_1488/master/2232.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=da38ad9c52ddae1dedc2bfbd7739e058 480w","title":"apple iphone xs review battery life camera design performance","story":"The iPhone XS hasn’t broken mould like the iPhone X, and it has weaker battery life, but its camera, design and performance are class-leadingThe iPhone XS isn’t the only all-screen iPhone on the block this year, but with its balance of large screen and small body, is it still the iPhone to buy?To say that the iPhone XS looks exactly the same as the iPhone X is somewhat of an understatement. Apart from a pair of new antenna lines and asymmetric holes in the bottom, the phone is an identical metal and glass sandwich. Unless you buy the new gold colour.Fortunately that’s not a bad thing this generation, as it maintains everything that made last year’s iPhone X so good. That includes the large screen squeezed into a small body, the luxurious feel and top-notch new design that ditched the home button.The 5.8in OLED screen is one of the best ever fitted to a smartphone and makes watching movies and TV shows on the commute a joy. The speakers are now louder, but there’s still no headphone jack nor a lightning to 3.5mm adapter in the box this time round.Weighing 177g, the iPhone XS is 3g heavier than the phone it replaces, 3g lighter than the Huawei P20 Pro but 14g heavier than the Samsung Galaxy S9. It’s also thinner than most at 7.7mm thick. All of which is to say it’s easy to pocket and handle, with either one or two hands.The iPhone XS has the same internals as its bigger sibling, the XS Max, and unsurprisingly performs exactly the same. With the six-core A12 Bionic the phone is responsive, smooth and likely has more raw power than most will need, until some magical new app comes along to take advantage of it.Game performance is also excellent, while the improved AI processor speeds up AR experiences and other machine-learning systems.Unfortunately, like the iPhone XS Max, the iPhone XS marks a step backwards in terms of battery life for Apple. Where the iPhone X lasted 30 hours between charges, the iPhone XS only just scrapes 24 hours.That means if I take it off the charger at 7am on day one, it’ll only just make it to my alarm at 7am the next day without being plugged in, meaning you will definitely need to fully charge it at least once a day. On heavy days it would be on its knees as I made it to bed.That was while using it as my primary device sending and receiving hundreds of emails, messages and push notifications, listening to five hours of music on Bluetooth headphones, watching an hour of Netflix, and shooting about 10 photos a day.A full-day’s battery is the bare minimum that’s acceptable in 2018, and competitors can last closer to double that.While there are many factors that affect battery life, it’s worth noting that the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max were affected to a greater extent by cellular network congestion, such as that experienced on commuter trains and in packed stations, than competitors.Both phones bounced around between Edge, 3G and 4G more often than the iPhone X, Google’s Pixel 2 XL and a OnePlus 6, and even with full 4G signal the iPhones struggled to pull down data and got hotter where the competitors still managed to load sites and emails, albeit slowly.The iPhone XS runs iOS 12 out of the box, which is a refinement of last year’s iOS 11 rather than a massive shakeup. It still has the same problems of status icons being lost because of the notch in the screen, but it has made big improvements with grouped notification handling and now has integrated wellbeing tools so you can keep an eye on your smartphone usage.Apple has also added a prominent banner on the lock screen when you have Do Not Disturb active, which makes it much harder to forget to deactivate it when you wake up.Face ID returns as Apple’s only biometric option on the iPhone XS. It works just as well as it did last year, identifying me without fault, unveiling my notifications and unlocking the phone.It can have problems with certain sunglasses, and it would also be nice to have the option of using my fingerprint to unlock or pay for things.The iPhone XS has the same camera system as fitted to the XS Max – two 12-megapixel cameras on the back, one with a wide-angle lens and the other a 2x telephoto lens.New for this year is better detail capture, particularly when images are viewed at full resolution, and better low light performance. But it is Apple’s improved “Smart HDR” function that is most noticeable, making images with extremes of contrast such as those shot into the sun much more usable.The portrait mode has also been improved, now with the ability to adjust the level of background blur after capture, which is fun.The selfie camera is good, but not quite the best on the market for preserving skin detail. Some have complained that it smooths skin and makes them look orange, but that’s not something I could see in photos.The iPhone XS comes in your choice of black, silver or gold, costing £999 for 64GB of storage, £1,149 for 256GB or £1,349 for 512GB.The 6.1in iPhone XR will be released in October costing £749 for £64GB of storage.The iPhone X set a new bar for what an iPhone could be. It was a massive step forward for Apple and put it ahead of many competitors in smartphone design and function.The iPhone XS maintains the forward-looking design and function, feeling wonderful in the hand, has a noticeably better camera and is still arguably the best phone on the market right now at balancing screen size with usability.But it’s certainly not perfect, with weaker battery life than last year and a still eye-watering price. With the cheaper 6.1in iPhone XR around the corner, it might be worth waiting to see what it’s like before shelling out £999, but the iPhone XS is still great.Cons: no headphone socket, no fingerprint scanner, glass will break if dropped, very expensive, no fast charger or USB-C cable in the box, no headphones adapter in the box This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Staying in Gijón or Oviedo beforehand means easy access to the airport, and buses run from there to Cangas de Onís or Cabrales where you can pick up supplies – although the park’s nine refugios are well-stocked with beer, blue cheese, chorizo and stews. They are also relatively cheap, but camping just outside is free. • elanillodepicosAdánEvery week we ask our readers for recommendations from their travels.

The Senate judiciary committee chair, Chuck Grassley, is first at around 8am ET, followed by ranking Democrat Dianne Feinstein, and then other colleagues, either inidually or possibly in groups. Grassley on Thursday confirmed the committee had received the report.No copies will be made of the report, as is standard, so senators will have to go to the room to learn what is in it. They are not supposed to ulge its contents to the public.“If you want people to be candid when they talk to the FBI, you ain’t going to make that public,” Grassley said on Wednesday.The report will review allegations from Deborah Ramirez, who says Kavanaugh exposed himself to her at a party when both were students at Yale.Kavanaugh has angrily denied the allegations. The limited FBI investigation was begun late last week when Jeff Flake, a Republican hold-out on the judiciary committee, signalled he would not confirm Kavanaugh without further checks.Trump ordered the FBI to report within a week. On Wednesday night, he reiterated his support for his nominee. “Wow, such enthusiasm and energy for Judge Brett Kavanaugh,” he tweeted. “He is a fine man and great intellect. The country is with him all the way!”The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, has signalled he plans to force a final vote on Kavanaugh’s nomination as early as Saturday, following an initial cloture vote on Friday.Republicans hold a 51-49 majority in the Senate and a simple majority is needed to advance his nomination. A handful of Republican and Democratic senators are undecided on whether to support Kavanaugh and their votes will decide whether he is confirmed.In short, cloture is a way of cutting off debate and ending a filibuster on a particular issue before the US Senate – part of a multi-step process that culminates in a final vote on legislation or a nomination.\u0026nbspIn the case of judge Brett Kavanaugh, the Senate Majority leader, Mitch McConnell, must first file for cloture, which will set the stage for a final vote on Kavanaugh\u0027s supreme court nomination.\u0026nbspOnce McConnell files for cloture, the motion must “ripen” meaning that it cannot be voted on until a full legislative day has passed. For example, if he filed for cloture on Wednesday, a cloture vote would not take place before Friday.\u0026nbspThe cloture vote – as opposed to the final vote – is often where the real drama happens. Republicans have a narrow 51-49 majority in the Senate and could vote to invoke cloture without support from a single Democrat. If only 50 senators agree to end debate, Vice President Mike Pence would be brought in to break the tie. If the motion, fails McConnell could try again or he could opt to pull the nomination.\u0026nbspInvoking cloture for supreme court nominees once required 60 votes but was lowered in 2017 to a simple majority threshold last year during the nomination fight over justice Neil Gorsuch. Sixty votes are still required to approve legislation.\u0026nbspOnce cloture is invoked, debate on the matter is limited to an additional 30 hours. After that, the full senate would proceed to a final vote. Lauren GambinoFord’s lawyers have criticised the limited scope of the re-opened investigation. They pointed out that the additional FBI background investigation did not include interviewing Ford or the witnesses they say corroborate her testimony.They said they were “profoundly disappointed” that those directing the probe “were not interested in seeking the truth”.Trump on Tuesday inflamed tensions over Kavanaugh’s nomination by mocking Ford at a Republican rally in Mississippi.Three key Republican senators condemned Trump’s remarks. “I wish he hadn’t have done it and I just say it’s kind of appalling,” Flake told NBC. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who are seen as swing votes on the Kavanaugh nomination, also rebuked Trump.The rising tensions have led to heightened security at the Capitol, with some senators using police escorts to shield them from protesters eager to confront them. Collins was escorted out of a hearing on Wednesday by three police officers.Fresh questions have been raised about Kavanaugh’s temperament and the evidence he gave to the judiciary committee last week. Several high school and college classmates have come forward to challenge his characterisation of his teenage years and his drinking habits.In an opinion piece for Slate, one of Kavanaugh’s roommates at Yale, James Roche, said the judge “stood up under oath and lied about his drinking and about the meaning of words in his yearbook”.“His willingness to lie to avoid embarrassment throws doubt on his denials about the larger questions of sexual assault,” Roche wrote, adding that he would be willing to speak to the FBI.During the hearing Ford accused Kavanaugh of attempting to rape her during a drunken gathering when they were in high school. Two other women have accused him of sexual misconduct, charges he has stridently denied."},{"url":null,"title":"few us politicians working class","story":"Contrary to the ideal of a government of and by the people, new research shows Americans are almost always governed by the very privilegedThis year at least two races for seats in the US House of Representatives will feature high-profile candidates with significant experience in working-class jobs – the manual labor, service industry and clerical jobs that make up over half of the American labor force. In Wisconsin’s first congressional district, the Democratic nominee is a delivery-driver-turned-ironworker named Randy Bryce, nicknamed “Ironstache”, who takes credit for “scaring off” Paul Ryan. In New York’s 14th congressional district, a former bartender and waitress named Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez recently made headlines for her stunning primary-election upset over incumbent Democrat Joe Crowley.Candidates like Bryce and Ocasio-Cortez – politicians with significant experience in the kinds of jobs most Americans punch in for every day – are genuine anomalies in 2018, and in US politics more generally.I have been researching this issue for the past 10 years, and the results, published in my new book, The Cash Ceiling: Why Only the Rich Run for Office – and What We Can Do About It, are clear. Contrary to the cherished ideal of a government of and by the people, Americans are almost always governed by the very privileged.So why are so few workers running? In a democracy like ours where almost any citizen can stand for elected office, why are the vast majority of candidates drawn from the ranks of white-collar professionals, and usually affluent or wealthy ones at that?First, the bad news: there are no easy answers here.It would be convenient, for instance, if we could sidestep this question entirely by saying that the social class backgrounds of politicians don’t really matter, that politicians always do their best to work for the common good regardless of where they come from (This was Alexander Hamilton’s argument in the Federalist #35).Unfortunately, politics doesn’t usually work like that. Just as working-class people in the general public tend to be more pro-worker (and business owners tend to be more pro-business, farmers tend to be more pro-farm, etc), politicians from different social classes tend to bring different perspectives with them to public office, especially when it comes to economic issues. In confidential surveys of state legislators, leaders from the working class in both parties are 20 to 50 percentage points more likely to support policies such as social welfare programs, regulation of the private sector, government-backed healthcare and efforts to reduce economic inequality. In scorecards that rank how members of Congress vote on economic legislation, those from the working class consistently earn significantly higher marks from pro-worker groups like the AFL-CIO and lower marks from business groups like the Chamber of Commerce.These differences, coupled with the virtual absence of working-class people in our political institutions, ultimately have enormous consequences for public policy. States with fewer legislators from the working class spend billions less on social welfare each year, offer less generous unemployment benefits and tax corporations at lower rates. Towns with fewer working-class people on their city councils devote smaller shares of their budgets to social safety net programs an analysis I conducted in 2013 suggested that cities nationwide would spend approximately $22.5bn more on social assistance programs each year if their councils were made up of the same mix of classes as the people they represent. Unfortunately, we can’t write off white-collar government as politically inconsequential. As the old saying goes, when the working class isn’t at the table, it’s often on the menu.Nonetheless, they seldom run. But researchers and reformers are starting to understand why – and to identify interventions that might give working-class Americans more of a seat at the table in government.In my book, I analyze every available source of systematic data that can shed light on why so few people from working-class backgrounds run for political office, including several original surveys of candidates, party officials and ordinary citizens. Across this wide range of datasets, there appear to be two main obstacles facing workers.First, workers seldom run for public office in the US because of the fundamental personal burdens associated with campaigning – doing so always takes a great deal of time and energy, and working-class Americans are far less likely to have the time and energy to spare. When I surveyed seemingly qualified working-class and white-collar citizens, the biggest gap in their reported concerns about running wasn’t a fear about being able to raise enough money, or a difference in raw political ambition, it was a more fundamental concern about losing out on income and work in order to campaign. As one worker (who herself had run for city council and won) put it, “When you are working 40 hours a week and working 40 hours on the campaign, it’s too much.”White-collar government isn’t caused by voters, or some deficiency on the part of workers or even the soaring costs associated with political campaigns. It is caused by the simple reality that campaigning requires taking time off work and getting help from political elites, and working-class Americans often can’t do either.From a reform standpoint, that is actually good news. Making public office more accessible to a broad cross-section of the economy won’t require significantly changing our laws or electoral institutions. People who work in and around government just need to devote more attention and resources to qualified working-class candidates.A half century ago, women were anomalies in congressional elections, and in American political institutions more generally. Today they aren’t. Ironworkers and restaurant servers don’t have to be either."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6bf26ae5b96cb6f7b0f4e7a328bf040a8a2ee1e7/0_74_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8ba0e9feba72fe6be456f13519d5eb4d","title":"bosnia herzegovina gears up for vote amid political frustration","story":"Hope for change dwindling ahead of Sunday’s elections for bewildering number of posts in ided countryOn a tree-lined riverbank in the Sarajevo district of Grbavica, Rabina Baltić pauses at her stall selling tubs of sweetcorn, and gestures in disgust.“Future?” she asks. “There’s no future here! I have a university degree, but look how I work … We’ve lost hope. Every election it’s all mixed, religion and politics.”Twenty-three years after the end of its internecine war that left 100,000 dead, Bosnia-Herzegovina votes on Sunday to elect a bewildering number of national and sub-national presidencies, parliaments, and assemblies. Ethnic-nationalist parties representing the three main communities – Bosniak (Muslim), Serb, and Croat – are expected to top the polls as they have at most previous elections since the current political system was set up by the Dayton peace agreement in 1995.But political frustrations are just as significant. People strolling the streets of Grbavica, a middle-class suburb once on the wartime frontline, express helplessness and bemoan the failure of Bosnia’s leftwing and multi-ethnic parties. The leading parties are accused of stoking tensions, while stuffing state-owned companies and the public administration with their supporters.Adil Osmanović, minister of civil affairs and a member the Bosniak nationalist Party of Democratic Action (SDA), which leads the government and tops the polls among Bosniaks, argues that the government has raised economic growth, created nearly 21,500 new jobs in the past year, and made progress in preparing the way for an application for EU membership.But even some party loyalists are losing the faith. Husein Hrapović, 75, was one of the first members of the SDA when it was founded in 1990, joining it “because it was a kind of Muslim movement”.“There have been scams and vote theft,” he says in the shop in Sarajevo’s bazaar district where he has worked for 55 years. “Now the party has its own people, who get jobs in state-owned companies. I don’t believe there’s a future there are a lot of poor people and a lot of corruption. There could be another war in the next 10 years.”Not everyone is so pessimistic. Denijal Šahinović, a young businessman who runs a small print shop in Sarajevo, says he works across the country with business partners and customers of all ethnicities with no animosity.“I am optimistic that if we trade enough, we can fix this country,” he says. “But international people used to come to our classrooms and say that we were the future, and then people saw the easy route to jobs and money through the system.”Bosnia-Herzegovina has fewer than 3.5 million voters. But thanks to the complicated web of ethnopolitical structures put in place by the Dayton peace agreement that brought the 1992-95 war to an end, next month’s elections will choose a national parliament, three members of the national presidency, the parliaments of the country’s two entities – the Serb-dominated Republika Srpska (RS) and the predominantly Bosniak and Croat Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina – and 11 other assemblies.A citizen can only be a member of the presidency if they declare themselves to be Bosniak, Serb, or Croat – barring those who declare as Jewish or Roma or merely Bosnian from becoming head of state.“Dayton installed software that is outdated and has served its purpose,” says Osmanović, pointing out that thanks to the level of devolution, the country has 14 ministries of agriculture. Yet others see it as the price to pay for peace.Attempts to change the status quo, with international support, have run aground. Plans to reform the political system were shelved and a new “reform agenda” focusing on economic liberalisation was launched by the EU and international financial institutions in 2015, with the UK and Germany the leading proponents. This has failed to meet expectations, and one international diplomat in Sarajevo refers to the EU’s attempts to grapple with Bosnia as “fucking useless”.Meanwhile, concerns have grown about Russia’s influence in the Republika Srpska. Milorad Dodik, who has been effective leader of the RS for over a decade and is the leading candidate to be the Serb member of the national presidency, met Vladimir Putin in Russia on 30 September, reportedly securing the Russian president’s backing for his election.But the RS government and Aleksandar Vučić, the president of neighbouring Serbia, have accused western powers of “meddling” in the Bosnian elections.Similar claims are levelled at another neighbour, Croatia. Šefik Džaferović, the presidential candidate for the Bosniak nationalist SDA, has attacked Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović, the president of neighbouring Croatia, for alleged interference in Bosnia’s internal affairs.Many ethnic Croats in Bosnia feel the political system discriminates against them. While ethnic Serbs have their own entity, the Republika Srpska, Croats and Bosniaks must share the other, the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, where tactical voting can allow the Croat member of the presidency to be chosen by Bosniak votes.Dragan Čović, the nationalist Croat member of the presidency, has lobbied for a third, Croat, entity. He argues this would put his ethnic group on an equal footing with Bosniaks, but critics fear it would further add to Bosnia’s centrifugal forces.These concerns have been amplified in recent months by a potential partition or “land-swap” deal between Serbia and Kosovo, which some fear could set a precedent for the Republika Srpska to leave Bosnia.Dodik has repeatedly called for the RS to break away, although he has recently toned down his rhetoric. He is also under mounting pressure due to continuing demonstrations over the mysterious death of a 21-year-old.“Dodik doesn’t know how to do politics without tensions,” says Branislav Borenović, the leader of the RS opposition Party of Democratic Progress. “He doesn’t talk about education, agriculture, everyday life. We don’t have time or energy to waste on new conflicts.”In Istočno Sarajevo, part of the capital that lies in the RS, many support independence, but without great enthusiasm, with day-to-day concerns weighing more heavily.“I think it’s definitely a good idea to ide, because things just aren’t the same after the war,” says Zeljana Vasković, a 24-year-old unemployed woman. “Even the youth are ided. People naively vote thinking they will change things, but politicians only know how to steal money.”• This article was amended on 4 October 2018.

Nordea, the Nordic region’s biggest bank, also said it was not under investigation over alleged money laundering in the Baltics.In a sign of the impact that criminal and regulatory investigations in Estonia, Denmark, Britain and now the US are having, Danske Bank said it would end its share buybacks after reassessing its capital targets.Last month the bank said in an internal report commissioned by Borgen that payments totalling €200bn, many of which it described as “suspicious”, had been moved through its Estonian branch between 2007 and 2015.The findings of the report led to Borgen taking “ultimate responsibility”, although he said he was cleared from a legal point of view, and prompted renewed action by regulators.Danske’s board has asked Denmark’s financial supervisory authority to approve the appointment of its head of wealth management, Jacob Aarup-Andersen, as its new chief executive, the Danish business website Finans reported, citing several unnamed sources.The FSA is due to make a decision next week, Finans added. The regulator and Danske Bank declined to comment.Politicians in Europe are calling for stricter measures to prevent money laundering after the Dutch financial group ING was fined €775m last month after admitting criminals had been able to launder cash through its accounts."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f818d05371d1b85072f958905733a07382cb6d6c/0_44_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a43d6f18a92d537b29c639debb527f2f","title":"osaka drops san francisco as sister city over comfort women statue","story":"Mayor of Japanese city says memorial for women used as sex slaves in Japan is not historically accurateThe city of Osaka has ended its 60-year “sister city” relationship with San Francisco to protest against the presence in the US city of a statue symbolising Japan’s wartime use of sex slaves.Osaka’s mayor, Hirofumi Yoshimura, terminated official ties this week after the US city agreed to recognise the “comfort women” statue, which was erected by a private group last year in San Francisco’s Chinatown district, as public property.The statue depicts three women – from China, Korea and the Philippines – who symbolise women and teenage girls forced to work in frontline brothels from the early 1930s until Japan’s wartime defeat in 1945.Campaigners and some historians say as many as 200,000 women – mostly Koreans, but also Chinese, south-east Asians and a small number of Japanese and Europeans – were forced or tricked into working in military brothels between 1932 and Japan’s defeat in 1945.In his 10-page letter to San Francisco’s mayor, London Breed, Yoshimura noted that historians disagreed about the extent of the Japanese imperial army’s involvement in the running of wartime brothels, and described claims included in the statue’s inscription as lacking historical evidence.The inscription reads: “This monument bears witness to the suffering of hundreds of thousands of women and girls, euphemistically called ‘Comfort Women,’ who were sexually enslaved by the Japanese Imperial Armed Forces in thirteen Asian-Pacific countries from 1931-1945. Most of these women died during their wartime captivity.”Yoshimura added that the focus on Japan’s wartime conduct ignored the widespread sexual abuse of women by other countries during the second world war and other conflicts.“I am in favour of activities to protect the dignity and human rights of women,” he said. “However, if the purpose is to protect the human rights of women, I would suggest that some of the special attention currently being given to Japan’s ‘comfort women’ issue should be broadened to memorialise all the women who have been sexually assaulted and abused by soldiers of countries in the world.”Breed’s predecessor, Edwin Lee, accepted the statue in 2017, prompting Yoshimura to complain the move had destroyed the spirit of mutual trust built up over six decades. However he postponed the formal severing of ties following Lee’s death last December.In a statement Breed’s office said it was “unfortunate” that Yoshimura had decided to end the port cities’ relationship, which began in October 1957.The statue in San Francisco is one of dozens erected in South Korea and overseas in recent years but the first to appear in a major US city.The city of Glendale, which has one of the biggest Korean American populations in California, erected a similar statue in 2013, triggering an unsuccessful legal attempt to have it taken down by local residents Michiko Gingery and Koichi Mera, who were hoping its removal would “defend the honour of Japan”.Campaigners accused Yoshimura of attempting to rewrite history. “Breaking the relationship over a memorial is outrageous and absurd,” said Lillian Sing, co-chair of the Comfort Women Justice Coalition. “It shows how afraid the Osaka mayor and Japanese prime minister are of truth and are trying to deny history.”The use of public spaces to memorialise the comfort women has sparked criticism in Japan, which claims that it contravenes the spirit of a 2015 agreement between Tokyo and Seoul that was supposed to settle the controversy “finally and irreversibly”.The agreement included an apology from Japan for the women’s ordeal, but it refused to accept legal responsibility, maintaining that all compensation claims had been settled by a bilateral peace treaty in 1965.In addition Japan set up the Reconciliation and Healing Foundation, a 1 billion yen fund to care for the dwindling number of surviving women. South Korea’s president, Moon Jae-in, last month described the fund as “dysfunctional” since it was not widely supported by South Koreans and warned that the money could be returned to Japan."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3651446.1538652419!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"teenager had no idea she was pregnant before giving birth on kitchen floor","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMother Milaois, baby Harper and partner Jack.

Video: Conservative Party\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritain’s prime minister Theresa May greets delegates after giving her keynote address on the  final day of the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham on Wednesday. Photograph:  Stefan RousseauAFPGetty ImagesThe Government expects the British government to table new proposals on Brexit shortly which could break the logjam in the negotiations ahead of the European Council summit in two weeks.With the British prime minister Theresa May having successfully come through her party conference yesterday, officials and politicians believe that long-awaited British proposals on the border backstop – which guarantees an open border in Ireland – will be made in the coming days.While the EU will await the detail of the British proposals before evaluating whether they match expectations, there is a belief Ms May is preparing to make concessions which will arouse opposition among Brexiteers and in the DUP, according to four senior sources with involvement in the process in Dublin.There have been private signals to the Irish Government in recent weeks, while DUP fears evident at the Conservative Party conference this week have encouraged Dublin to believe that Ms May is planning a significant move on the backstop.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar travels to Brussels on Thursday for a meeting with the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier, at which the two men are expected to discuss the progress of the negotiations and the prospects for a breakthrough before the forthcoming summit, scheduled to take place in Brussels in a fortnight.On the basis of briefings from Mr Barnier, EU leaders will decide at the summit whether to convene a special summit in mid-November at which a deal could be clinched on a withdrawal agreement. This would avoid the prospect of a no-deal Brexit which would see the UK crash out of the union next March.If a withdrawal agreement – along with an agreed declaration about the future trading relationship – is concluded in the coming weeks, the UK will enter a two-year transition period next March during which its relationship with the EU will remain unchanged.However, the EU has consistently made clear that this can only happen if there is agreement on a legally binding Irish backstop.Irish sources expect that the forthcoming British proposal will abandon the previous British idea of a “time-limited” backstop, which would expire after a set period, in favour of an “event-limited” backstop, which would only expire on agreement between the EU and the UK on a future trading relationship that maintained the current open Border.If sufficiently clear and legally enforceable, this could solve the backstop problem from the Irish point of view, though other aspects of the British proposal, including Britain’s relationship with the EU’s customs union, could still be problematic for the EU.The Irish Government could also object to any suggestion from Ms May that future regulatory ergence between the North and the rest of the UK would have to be approved by the Stormont Assembly, as Dublin believes it would amount to giving the DUP a veto.However, Government sources remain cautious until they see the text of British proposals, though Dublin believes that Ms May’s successful conference will strengthen her hand to make compromises. On Wednesday, in her speech to the conference, she criticised hardline Brexiteers who rejected any compromise with the EU on the withdrawal deal.“The people we serve are not interested in debates about the theory of Brexit – their livelihoods depend on making a success of it in practice. A Brexit that might make Britain stronger 50 years from now is no good to you if it makes your life harder today,” she said.Appealing for unity, and implicitly warning of derailing the Brexit process if her government falls on the issue, she said, “If we all go off in different directions in pursuit of our own visions of the perfect Brexit we risk ending up with no Brexit at all,” Mrs May said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Cyril Byrne President Michael D Higgins has described as “outrageous” media reports that he used part of a €317,000 allowance to “top up” the pay of a special adviser. Mr Higgins said the claim, made in a Sunday newspaper, was slanderous and hurtful to the inidual involved. “I just want to say I found the suggestion that it was used for anything other than what the Act specified absolutely outrageous. The suggestion that I used it to top up an employee’s salary, that was simply wrong and it was not true,” he said. He added: “I was really hurt for a member of my staff who was very unfairly treated and suggested that he had somehow or another benefited. “That was an outrageous slanderous comment to make.”He again maintained the allowance was spent only for the purposes for which it was intended – largely to host events at Áras an Uachtaráin – and that there would be a balance of unspent monies from this allowance which he would return to the exchequer at the end of his seven-year term.“At the end of the period, the month of November, we will make a full return. Everything is receipted. There is a statement. There is stock-taking in relation to the kitchen.“In exactly the same way at the end of the first term, I will be sending the balance straight back to the exchequer.”He continued: “I can say that every single euro has been properly spent and every single euro will be accounted for.”He said he would be open to a new mechanism to show spending in future but insisted he had done nothing differently from any of his predecessors. The President was speaking during a walkabout of Grafton Street on Wednesday afternoon. He also disclosed that he would participate in three broadcast debates between now and polling day on October 26th. They will be Saturday with Cormac Ó hEadhra, RTÉ Radio 1, on Saturday, October 13th a debate with Pat Kenny on Virgin Media 1 on Wednesday, October 17th and a PrimeTime debate on RTÉ 1 on Tuesday, October 23rd.Mr Higgins also said he and the secretary general to the presidency, Art O’Leary, had sat down in July to confirm which presidential events he would attend during the course of the campaign. He said he had not reduced the number of events but had not agreed to new requests once he had decided to announce his candidacy.“There are constraints on what I can do. There are also obligations. “I intend to honour every obligation I made some time ago. We are not accepting new ones. Those that are on the diary at the moment came out of discussion with the secretary general of the president’s office and myself. “They will stay. I will honour all of this.”He confirmed that no new events were included from July but also said he had not reduced the number of public engagements. Asked about DUP leader Arlene Foster’s comments that the Good Friday Agreement could be amended, Mr Higgins said the agreement was an important base for rights that could be availed of by all communities across Ireland. Asked to gauge the mood of the country at present, he said in 2011 there was a sense that there were “many people with disappointed expectations and many people in great distress”. “One of the innovations was on State visits I would give a substantive address,” he said, saying that led to the series of speeches he made critiquing the economic model. He said matters had improved since then but there were still great challenges, saying he had taken the opportunity of addressing the issues of equality, and the country was currently concerned about what was happening in housing. “There is a debate about whether or not housing can be resolved by the market or not,” he said, adding that he would address this issue within the limits of his office.Read more news, analysis and comment from the race to the \u0026Aacuteras"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3651584.1538655478!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit varadkar meets eu leaders with time running out","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar (right) and  EU Council president Donald Tusk meet  in Brussels on Thursday. Photograph: EPA Taoiseach Leo Varadkar is to meet senior EU leaders in Brussels this afternoon as Brexit negotiators look to break the deadlock over the Irish border.Mr Varadkar will meet the European council president, Donald Tusk, the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, and members of the European parliament.With the British prime minister Theresa May having successfully come through her party conference yesterday, officials and politicians believe that long-awaited British proposals on the border backstop – which guarantees an open border in Ireland – will be made in the coming days.There is a growing sense that the gap between the British and Irish governments over the border could be closing, with Mrs May prepared to accept some checks on goods travelling between Britain and Ireland, but away from the border.In tweet today Mr Varadkar said the negotiations are entering a critical phase, and time is running out but that he believes “ an agreement is possible”.While the EU will await the detail of the British proposals before evaluating whether they match expectations, there is a belief Ms May is preparing to make concessions which will arouse opposition among Brexiteers and in the DUP, according to four senior sources with involvement in the process in Dublin.The DUP has threatened to pull the plug on Mrs May and vote against any deal that would place a border in the Irish Sea, but sources say all efforts are being concentrated on persuading opponents that these checks would not be in the “Irish Sea”.“A lot of this is about language: if the checks are not being done, for example, in transit, on vessels, this is not the border,” said a Dublin source.The taoiseach can expect a show of support from EU politicians, who have long insisted there will be no Brexit orce deal without agreement on the Irish border.The meetings are also a chance for the EU to assess next moves on the biggest obstacle to a deal before a make-or-break EU summit on 17th-18th October.British and European officials are redrafting different versions of the backstop, which would swing into place if the two sides fail to resolve the issue through a future trading agreement – the UK’s preferred option.Well-placed sources say the EU’s new text for the backstop will be “substantially different” from the March one, which incensed May by tying Northern Ireland indefinitely to the EU customs union and single market in the event of no other agreement.In an attempt to “dedramatise” the issue, the EU has revised its backstop plan so that customs, VAT and market-standards checks could be done at company premises or via trusted-trader schemes, therefore making the presence of EU law in Northern Ireland less obvious.However, the EU will not compromise on checks on animals, food and plants, fearing the bloc’s safety and welfare standards could be diluted. Northern Ireland would therefore be required to sign up to some EU single market rules and the EU customs union.Officials are also working to “improve” the link between the backstop and a future trade deal, in an attempt to convince the British the backstop would never be activated.The British are also revising their backstop plan, with Britain’s Brexit secretary Dominic Raab, expected in Brussels in the coming days to present the new offer.In a sign that there are hopes of a breakthrough to end the impasse, there are expectations in Dublin that the much-anticipated British text will drop its requirement that the backstop is time-limited.The UK backstop plan outlined in June would see the whole of the UK remain aligned with the EU customs union for a limited time. But the EU wants a Northern Ireland-only backstop and deems the time limit unacceptable.Sources have told The  the British will switch to an “event-limited” backstop, which would only expire on agreement between the EU and the UK on a future trading relationship that maintained the open border. - AgenciesDeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Yves HermanPoolAPThe Government has boosted Theresa May’s hopes of breaking the impasse in Brexit talks by backing her emerging plan for an all-UK customs union with the EU.Ahead of a crucial EU summit this month, the British prime minister is seeking to resolve a dispute over the “backstop” to avoid a hard Border on the island of Ireland. One of the proposals she is working on – to take effect if no other solution to the Border issue is found – is for the whole UK to participate in a customs union with the EU.Michel Barnier, chief EU negotiator, has rejected the idea, but officials in Dublin privately argue it could settle the Border question and open the way to a deal.The Irish intervention will help Mrs May in the run-up to the EU summit on October 18th as she attempts a delicate diplomatic docking exercise on Brexit. The prime minister may have more freedom to manoeuvre, now that her ruling Conservative party has concluded its conference.She will offer to meet the EU halfway on the vexed issue of the Irish backstop, agreeing to Brussels’ demands that Northern Ireland stay part of the single market regulatory area of the bloc.But in return she wants the EU to concede to Britain’s demands that under the backstop plan the whole UK – rather than just Northern Ireland – would stay in the customs union for a limited period, until a UKEU trade deal was finalised.The “temporary” extension of the customs union would prevent Northern Ireland being carved off from the rest of the UK into a separate EU customs territory. Some British ministers predict the arrangement might in practice extend well into the next decade.The main attraction of the plan for Leo Varadkar’s Government is that it would remove the need for customs checks on the Border. It would also avert the need for customs checks on Ireland’s €65bn annual trade with Britain.But Brussels is reluctant to give its legally binding agreement to provisions that could keep the UK in a customs union with the bloc after Brexit, since it is concerned this could serve as a back door into the EU’s trade and regulatory regime with none of the obligations of membership.Mr Barnier has also argued that the customs relationship should be settled in the second phase of Brexit talks on Europe’s new trading relationship with the UK.The hardening stance of the DUP, whose support Mrs May needs for her parliamentary majority, is a further source of anxiety in Dublin.Arlene Foster, DUP leader, has insisted she would not accept new regulatory checks in the Irish Sea that would still be required under Mrs May’s new bid to revive the talks. Mrs Foster warned at the Conservative conference that the DUP’s red lines were “blood red”, raising fresh questions over the all-UK customs proposal from the prime minister.But, by keeping the whole UK in a customs union with the EU, Mrs May’s plans would avert any requirement for custom checks between Britain and Northern Ireland, one of the DUP’s prime concerns. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2018"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3651588.1538655913!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"d%C3%BAn laoghaire harbour company a gift and a jewel for locals","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe harbour at Dun Laoghaire. Photograph: Frank MillerThe The people of Dún Laoghaire Rathdown are getting “a gift and a jewel” in the transfer of the Dún Laoghaire Harbour company to the county council, Minister for Transport Shane Ross has insisted.He confirmed that he had on Wednesday formally signed the transfer of the harbour company’s functions to the county council.Mr Ross rejected claims that the company had €33 million in liabilities and insisted it was closer to €10 million which would extend over a long period of time for repairs and maintenance.He stressed that it will not affect local property tax or local projects and the transfer included a “seven-digit cash reserve”.The Minister was speaking during a heated Seanad debate on the company’s transfer.“It’s a gift and a jewel being given to the people of Dún Laoghaire Rathdown,” he said. “This is a great deal for the citizens and residents.”Green Party Senator Grace O’Sullivan said that since the ferry service ended in 2015 “the harbour company has attempted a number of far-fetched money making schemes. There was the floating hotel, the floating swimming pool, the floating housing estate and a cruise ship dock that would have filled the harbour.“All these schemes failed, leaving a trail of debt,” she pointed out and expressed concern that a “cash-strapped council would have to cover these costs rather than the exchequer since it was a State entity that ran up these bills”.Independent Senator Victor Boyhan hit out at the Minister and his predecessors Leo Varadkar and Paschal Donohoe, claiming that all three as minister for transport “were aware that this company had major financial issues and major governance issues”.In an angry outburst he told the Minister “you know there are corporate governance issues with this company. You were the man that made a lot of money in the Independent writing about government and preaching and lecturing us about corporate governance and finance.”Fianna Fail Senator Gerry Horkan was concerned that up to the signing of the transfer there had not been full sight of the assets and there was “an estimated of maybe €33 million in liabilities in pensions and other infrastructural costs”.There was also a €800,000 annual maintenance cost. “How is that to be absorbed without closing libraries, not repairing footpaths, not improving traffic lights, maybe not building swimming pools.”Fine Gael Senator Neale Richmond asked if there would be an indemnity for the council on claims already underway against the harbour company. He also queried why the port company was subsumed rather than a transfer of the shareholding function.Sinn Féin Senator Fintan Warfield called for new consideration to be given to proposals for a new national diaspora centre and to engage with the Genealogical Society about the issue.Labour Senator Kevin Humphreys said “this smells to the high heavens” and he asked if it was the case that Dublin Port Company was approached to take over the harbour company but that when it did a risk assessment it “walked away and now the council is being stuck with the risk”.But the Minister described the Senators’ complaints as “politically opportunistic” and “deliberately mischievous” when local councillors had voted by a massive majority to support the transfer.They were handing over an asset rich company of up to €40 million with a single asset worth €12 million.“It’s a gift and a jewel being given to the people of Dún Laoghaire Rathdown but it just doesn’t suit some people to acknowledge that.”"},{"url":null,"title":"art student jessie earl disappeared 38 years ago has mystery","story":"On Wednesday 14 May 1980 Jessie Earl, a 22-year-old student at Eastbourne College of Art and Design, walked into a telephone box on the seafront to call her parents at their home in south London.

Following his resignation in 2015 he was convicted of fraud and embezzlement, sentenced to 15 years\u0027 imprisonment and ordered to pay the bank approximately 39 million US dollars.As a result the NCA obtained two UWOs against his assets on the grounds the funds used to purchase the properties were bought with cash stolen while he was working for a state bank in their home country.The NCA has the power to seize assets if officials believe the owner is a politically exposed person (PEP) - someone from outside the EEA in a position of power that makes them liable to bribery or corruption - or someone with suspected links to serious or organised crime, and they are unable explain the source of their wealth.Mrs A yesterday lost her appeal against the two orders after Mr Justice Supperstone dismissed her application to discharge the UWOs.He stated that three separate loyalty cards were issued to Mrs A by department store Harrods, where she spent more than £16 million between September 2006 and June 2016, which the court heard was far in excess of her husband\u0027s income.Each week the woman spent tens of thousands of pounds on luxury goods, while her child has a share fund worth £15m.James Lewis QC, for Mrs A, said that her husband was a fat cat international banker whose wealth covered his wife\u0027s expenditure.Sitting at the High Court Mr Justice Supperstone also discharged an anonymity order preventing the identification of the couple, the non-EEA country, the bank, the two properties and Mr A\u0027s lawyers in the non-EEA country.Mr Justice Supperstone said he was not satisfied that the anonymity order was necessary in order to protect their interests.He concluded that identification of Mrs A and her husband, the non-EEA country involved and the state-owned enterprise that employed him are all matters of very real public interest.However, he directed that the anonymity order stay in place until noon on October 10, pending the outcome of an application for permission to appeal over both the ruling on the UWO and on the anonymity order.Indicating that Mrs A would seek to take the case to the Court of Appeal Mr Lewis said the case raised clearly important issues.Donald Toon, NCA director for economic crime, said: I am very pleased that the court dismissed the respondent\u0027s (Mrs A\u0027s) arguments. This demonstrates that the NCA is absolutely right to ask probing questions about the funds used to purchase prime property.We are determined to use the powers available to us to their fullest extent where we have concerns that we cannot determine legitimate sources of wealth.Legal commentators say that if the UWO against Mrs A stands, it is likely to pave the way for more orders against suspects, including Russian oligarchs with property in Britain.Comment: Theresa May is leading the dance out of the EU as Brexiteers wait in the wingsPutin slumps to lowest poll rating since 2012 as controversial increase in pension age becomes lawEngland\u0026#39s Green Belt suffers biggest reduction in eight years as councils remove protections to build housesTaiwan issues travel alert after case of Zika imported into countryWife of ex-Malaysian prime minister charged with money laundering after luxury items seizedDaylight Saving Time: When do the clocks change, why do we use GMT – and do we still need to?Two \u0026#39pest controllers\u0026#39 dead after chemical spill at chicken factoryThe UK\u0026#39s highest paying degrees, according to graduate salaryBest independent schools in 2018: Full league table for A-Level results Best independent schools in 2018: Full league table for GCSE results Brett Kavanaugh vote: the two scenarios that could make or break Trump\u0026#39s legacyGrenfell Tower survivor tells the inquiry \u0026#39people\u0026#39s lives could have been saved\u0026#39Theresa May will have to find at least an extra £20bn to fulfil \u0026#39end of austerity\u0026#39 pledge, says IFS chiefThe Apprentice 2018, episode 1 review: after 14 years, is it time this show was fired?BBC Radio 2 DJ Mark Radcliffe tells listeners he has cancer and is taking time off for treatmentUS Senate pushes ahead with Brett Kavanaugh confirmation votesWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/10/03/TELEMMGLPICT000176767973_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqNJjoeBT78QIaYdkJdEY4CnGTJFJS74MYhNY6w3GNbO8.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"have astronomers found first exomoon 8000 light years away","story":"An artist\u0026#39s impression of the exoplanet Kepler-1625b, transiting the star, with the newly discovered exomoon in towAstronomers may have found the first moon outside our solar system, a gas behemoth the size of Neptune.Plenty of planets exist beyond our solar system, but a moon around one of those worlds has yet to be confirmed. Two Columbia University researchers presented their tantalising evidence for a moon on Wednesday.The potential moon would be considerably larger than Earth - about the size of Neptune or Uranus. The planet it orbits is as big as mammoth Jupiter. This apparent super-size pairing of a gaseous moon and planet is 8,000 light-years away.Researchers Alex Teachey and David Kipping evaluated 284 planets outside our solar system that had already been discovered by Nasa\u0027s Kepler Space Telescope. Only one planet held promise for hosting a moon, one around the star known as Kepler-1625, which is about the size of our sun but older.So last October, the pair directed the Hubble Space Telescope at the star in an attempt to verify - or rule out - the possibility of a moon orbiting the planet Kepler-1625b. They were on the lookout for a second temporary dimming of starlight. The main dip in stellar brightness would be the planet itself crossing in front of its star. Another dip could well be a moon - known as an exomoon outside our solar system.The more powerful and precise Hubble telescope detected a second and smaller decrease in starlight 3 ½hours after the planet passed in front of the star - like a dog following its owner on a leash, as Kipping put it. The observation period, however, ended before the moon could complete its transit. That\u0027s why the astronomers need another look with Hubble, hopefully next spring.Despite the evidence, Teachey stressed we are urging caution here.The first exomoon is obviously an extraordinary claim and it requires extraordinary evidence, Teachey said. Furthermore, the size we\u0027ve calculated for this moon, about the size of Neptune, has hardly been anticipated and so that, too, is reason to be careful here.He added: We\u0027re not cracking open Champagne bottles just yet on this one.If indeed a moon, it would be about 2 million miles (3 million kilometers) from its planet and appear twice as big in its sky, as the moon does in ours. The astronomers are uncertain how this potential moon might have formed, given its size.If confirmed, this finding could completely shake up our understanding of how moons are formed and what they can be made of, Nasa\u0027s science mission chief Thomas Zurbuchen said in a statement.According to the researchers, another compelling piece of evidence in favour of a moon is that the planet passed in front of its star more than an hour earlier than predicted. A moon could cause that kind of an uncertain, wobbly path, they noted.Kipping said that\u0027s how the Earth and moon would appear from far away. This particular planet - or exoplanet - is about the same distance from its star as Earth is to the sun.Another planet could cause the same gravitational nudge, the researchers noted, although Kepler observations have come up empty in that regard. Kepler-1625b is the only planet found so far around this star.For Teachey and Kipping, the best and simplest explanation is that Kepler-1625b has a moon.We\u0027ve tried our best to rule out other possibilities, Kipping told reporters. But we were unable to find any other single hypothesis which can explain all of the data we have.Their findings were published in the journal Science Advances . The journal\u0027s deputy editor, Kip Hodges, praised the researchers for their cautious tone, given the difficult and complicated process of identifying an exomoon.If this finding stands up to further observational scrutiny, it represents a major milestone in the field of astronomy, Hodges said.The Columbia astronomers said they may be able to clinch this as early as next year, with more Hubble viewing. In the meantime, they\u0027re encouraging other scientists to join in and embracing the scrutiny that\u0027s sure to come.Whether confirmed or not, the subject offers insight into how rare - or how common - our own solar system might be.Moons are abundant in our own solar system, with close to 200. Of the eight planets in our solar system, only Mercury and Venus have none.Given that both the planet and its potential moon are gas giants, no one is suggesting conditions that might support life.But going forward, I think we\u0027re opening the doors to finding worlds like that, Teachey said.Please review our commenting policyComment: Theresa May is leading the dance out of the EU as Brexiteers wait in the wingsPutin slumps to lowest poll rating since 2012 as controversial increase in pension age becomes lawEngland\u0026#39s Green Belt suffers biggest reduction in eight years as councils remove protections to build housesTaiwan issues travel alert after case of Zika imported into countryWife of ex-Malaysian prime minister charged with money laundering after luxury items seizedDaylight Saving Time: When do the clocks change, why do we use GMT – and do we still need to?Two \u0026#39pest controllers\u0026#39 dead after chemical spill at chicken factoryThe UK\u0026#39s highest paying degrees, according to graduate salaryBest independent schools in 2018: Full league table for A-Level results Best independent schools in 2018: Full league table for GCSE results Brett Kavanaugh vote: the two scenarios that could make or break Trump\u0026#39s legacyGrenfell Tower survivor tells the inquiry \u0026#39people\u0026#39s lives could have been saved\u0026#39Theresa May will have to find at least an extra £20bn to fulfil \u0026#39end of austerity\u0026#39 pledge, says IFS chief£16m Harrods customer loses bid to keep her £22m homesThe Apprentice 2018, episode 1 review: after 14 years, is it time this show was fired?BBC Radio 2 DJ Mark Radcliffe tells listeners he has cancer and is taking time off for treatmentWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 4 october 2018","story":"A woman cleans the sculpture \u0027Tennis Player\u0027 during the launch of Gunther von Hagens\u0027 Body Worlds museum in London.

A further four came from Thailand, two infections were from the Philippines, a similar number originated in Malaysia and single cases were reported from Indonesia, Singapore, St Lucia, the United States and Angola, according to CDC statistics.Newsletter promotion - global health security - end of articleProtect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health SecurityComment: Theresa May is leading the dance out of the EU as Brexiteers wait in the wingsPutin slumps to lowest poll rating since 2012 as controversial increase in pension age becomes lawEngland\u0026#39s Green Belt suffers biggest reduction in eight years as councils remove protections to build housesWife of ex-Malaysian prime minister charged with money laundering after luxury items seizedDaylight Saving Time: When do the clocks change, why do we use GMT – and do we still need to?Two \u0026#39pest controllers\u0026#39 dead after chemical spill at chicken factoryThe UK\u0026#39s highest paying degrees, according to graduate salaryBest independent schools in 2018: Full league table for A-Level results Best independent schools in 2018: Full league table for GCSE results Brett Kavanaugh vote: the two scenarios that could make or break Trump\u0026#39s legacyGrenfell Tower survivor tells the inquiry \u0026#39people\u0026#39s lives could have been saved\u0026#39Theresa May will have to find at least an extra £20bn to fulfil \u0026#39end of austerity\u0026#39 pledge, says IFS chief£16m Harrods customer loses bid to keep her £22m homesThe Apprentice 2018, episode 1 review: after 14 years, is it time this show was fired?BBC Radio 2 DJ Mark Radcliffe tells listeners he has cancer and is taking time off for treatmentEarthquake, tsunami and liquefaction: how a third disaster swallowed up whole villages in IndonesiaWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/fashion/2017/06/23/TELEMMGLPICT000131280141_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqLu9Do1yttyce9giDiWKPd70A8uG62qxKflOjPKk4Cfo.jpeg?imwidth=","title":"women shouldnt have choose make up metoo","story":"The idea that females who want to be taken seriously should not watch Love Island is ludicrous As the PM proves, you can both be clever and love clothes When I left magazines in the late 90s for the cut and thrust of newspapers, I was shocked by the number of women there who considered fashion – and caring how you looked – beneath them.

By supporting beoutQ\u0027s widespread and notorious infringement of the intellectual property rights of beIN and its partners, Saudi Arabia is setting a dangerous new precedent, said David Roney, a lawyer at Sidley Austin LLP who is leading the arbitration on behalf of beIN.\u0026nbspBeIN will pursue all available legal remedies to protect its rights and secure full compensation.BeIN also claims that Saudi Arabia has initiated a series of abusive measures aimed at forcing the Qatari sports network out of the local broadcasting market and destroying the value of beIN\u0027s investments in the country.This includes allegedly banning the importation and distribution of beIN set-top boxes and blocking access to beIN\u0027s websites and call centre.The alleged measures stem from a diplomatic dispute between Qatar and Saudi Arabia, which has resulted in a trade boycott of the tiny gulf state.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 43Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Designed by Pierpaolo Lazzarini from Italian company Jet Capsule.

Dieter Zetsche, outgoing head of the brand, told Paris Motor Show attendees that he had begun negotiations with Nissan regarding potentially using its Sunderland plant to build Mercedes-Benz cars. “Before Brexit there was one project where we were looking at an option of producing cars in Sunderland together,” he said. Mercedes-Benz owner Daimler formed an alliance with Nissan and Renault in 2010. Earlier this year, Nissan announced that it was cutting hundreds of jobs at the Sunderland operation, due to falling demand for diesel vehicles. Mr Zetsche shared no further details about the now-abandoned plan, the Times reported. A number of other car makers issued warnings at the Paris event, with Toyota stating that a no-deal Brexit would lead to a temporary stoppage in UK production, primarily at its Burnaston plant. Toyota warns no-deal Brexit would stop UK productionAston Martin cuts target share price for stock market listingUK car manufacturing falls again as industry demands Brexit safeguardUK car sales plunged 20 per cent in SeptemberThe Japanese company’s Europe president, Johan van Zyl, said it was difficult to predict how long the stoppage period would last. Meanwhile, Maxime Picat, executive vice president for Europe at Vauxhall owner PSA, said leaving the EU with no deal would disrupt production. “We’ve been doing all we can to develop our UK business, restore Vauxhall and Opel profitability, reinvesting in Luton and improving our sites’ competitiveness in order to help them face up to an uncertain future,” he said. “But there are limits. Those limits are customs barriers, and the loss of freedom of movement, for people and goods. If we get to that point, we will be obliged to take measures.“If we suddenly have to start manufacturing for the UK in the UK, and for Europe in Europe, there will necessarily be an impact on UK production.”Several car makers have called for Brexit negotiators to avoid a no-deal scenario, warning that such a departure would hit production and investment in the UK market. BMW recently said it would bring a planned shutdown of its Oxford plant forward to begin on the same day the UK leaves the EU, in a bid to minimise the potential disruption a no-deal Brexit would create.Meanwhile, Honda has said that a no-deal Brexit would cost it tens of millions of pounds, while Jaguar Land Rover has moved workers at its Castle Bromwich plant to a three-day week because of “continuing headwinds impacting the car industry”.Ralf Speth, Jaguar’s boss, has previously warned that tens of thousands of jobs in the UK motor industry are at risk if a no-deal Brexit goes ahead.He also said the current lack of clarity around Brexit means he does not know if his plants will be able to function after 29 March 2019, and added that interruptions to production could cost up to £60m a day.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

But its workers have not traditionally organised to demand better pay and conditions, making the current strike\u0026nbspsignificant, despite its small scale.Shadow chancellor John McDonnell backed the action and reiterated Labour\u0027s plan to give all workers a living wage of £10 an hour.\u0026nbspI am giving my support to the striking workers in Wetherspoons, TGI Fridays and McDonald\u0027s today, he said.These are workers that have been ignored by their employers and are simply asking for a wage they can live on and the same basic rights at work we should all be entitled to.Boni Adeliyi, a TGI Fridays waitress in Milton Keynes said: “We’re striking on 4 October to show the strength we have when workers come together. The movement is growing and change is coming. All young workers should join a union – it’s important to know your rights and how to fight for them when they’re being ignored. Together we are stronger.”\u0026nbspStriking McDonald’s worker Lauren McCourt said the industrial action could transform the sector for the better.“The days of poverty pay, insecure contracts and lack of respect for workers are numbered. A living wage of £10 an hour for all ages, security of hours, and our right to a union are the basic rights we are fighting for,” she said.\u0026nbspThe strikers plan to convene a rally in Leicester Square on the day of the industrial action. They say they will be joined by hospitality workers from across the UK as well as from four continents.A growing movement of low-paid workers, particularly in the fast-food industry, has come together over recent years, catalysed by the Fight for $15 campaign in the US.A McDonald’s spokesperson said the company was “disappointed” to hear about planned UK strikes and said the numbers of people involved represented an “extremely small proportion” of its 120,000 workforce.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Britain\u0027s Prime Minister Theresa May dances a few steps as she takes to the stage to give her keynote address on the fourth and final day of the Conservative Party Conference at the International Convention Centre in BirminghamBoris Johnson warned that Theresa May’s “cheat” Brexit plans would leave the UK in “manacles” and lead to the dominance of the far right and far left in British politics during his speech at a fringe event at the Conservative Party annual conference in BirminghamScottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson speaking at the Conservative Party annual conference at the International Convention Centre in BirminghamProtestors set off on an anti-Brexit march, organised by the \u0027Best For Britain\u0027 campaign group, in central Birmingham Royal Navy Commander, Nathan Gray lands his F-35B onboard HMS Queen Elizabeth for the first time.Headteachers from across England and Wales hold signs in Parliament Square, London, as they prepare to march on Downing Street to demand extra money for schoolsFormer leader of the English Defence League Tommy Robinson (C) arrives at the Old Bailey Courthouse in London, Britain, 27 September 2018.

In the year to date, car sales are 7.5 per cent behind where they were this time last year.The SMMT said the decline in September followed an “unusually high August and a turbulent first eight months of the year as the market responded to a raft of upheavals”\u0026nbspmainly changes to diesel policy after new emissions standards were introduced. UK car sales drop as manufacturers warn Brexit is hurting industryUK car sales drop as diesel demand plummets for 14th month in a rowUK car sales expected to drop for two years, warns motor industry bodyMike Hawes, SMMT chief executive, said: “With the industry given barely a year to reapprove the entire European model lineup, it’s no surprise that we’ve seen bottlenecks and a squeeze on supply. These are exceptional circumstances with similar declines seen in other major European markets. “The good news is that, as backlogs ease, consumers and businesses can look forward to a raft of exciting high-tech cars and a market keen to recover lost momentum.”Ian Plummer, Auto Trader director, said 2018 has been “very challenging for both retailers and manufacturers, with the fuel debate and Brexit anxieties denting consumer confidence, and inflationary pressure on exchange rates hitting profits”. However, he added: “Despite the many economic uncertainties, there is some positive news on the horizon for 2019 too. The plethora of new electric and hybrid vehicles that are on display at this week’s Paris Motor Show are not far from hitting forecourts, giving consumers some great new choices in this emerging fuel type which grew again last month.“What’s more, as more consumers move away from traditional ownership to usership models, the appetite for finance remains exceptionally strong.”However, Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said consumers were unlikely to begin buying cars in great numbers in the near future. “Finance costs likely will continue to rise gradually, while the recent rise in motor fuel prices might dissuade some first-time buyers. High levels of saving intentions also suggest that buyers will be cautious when considering major purchases. Accordingly, the chance of a substantial revival in car sales over the next six months remains slim,” he said.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

It’s a wartime story in which, for a change, the men are relegated to supporting roles. It follows in a tradition of French rural family sagas like Jean De Florette or Manon Des Sources. The landscapes and the changing seasons play as much of a part in the story as the main characters.Dark River offers little such consolation. It has some lyrical and delicate moments but the mood is generally overwhelmingly bleak and lugubrious. Incest and abuse don’t leave much space for any comic interludes. This is a powerful film with a grinding intensity about it. Light relief it isn’t but Dark River still has quite an impact.Late on in Argentinean director Lucrecia Martel’s startling, highly original new feature, Zama, a character who has just had both his arms cut off, is advised to “shove your stumps in the sand … if you don’t bleed out, you’ll survive.” It’s a grisly, darkly humorous moment in a film that continually surprises us with both its brutality and its lyricism.The most dispiriting aspect of this otherwise enrapturing Oscar-nominated animated feature is that its storyline still seems so current. The film depicts an Afghan society in which women don’t have a face. It is set during the Taliban rule, which lasted from the mid-1990s until late 2001, but this doesn’t feel like a period piece. Seventeen years after the Taliban were ousted from power in Afghanistan following the US invasion, the plight of women in the country appears hardly to have improved. Spike Lee’s work sometimes risks sensory overload. He fires off so many different ideas and storytelling styles that audiences can become bamboozled by his scattergun approach. BlacKkKlansman is one of his very best films because the digressions are as entertaining as ever but don’t get in the way of the main story.Much of the pleasure in Aardman films has always lain in their gently ironic, Alan Bennett-like humour. They take very exotic characters and subject matter but then deal with them in a matter-of-fact fashion. They make a virtue out of their own relative modesty. Early Man isn’t the flashiest animated feature that you’ll see this year but it is certainly the most likeable. 715 Isle of DogsLike all of Wes Anderson’s work, Isle Of Dogs is very stylised, very offbeat and characterised by its extremely dry and often ironic humour. This Japanese-set stop-motion fable is also gorgeous to look at – packed full of intricate visual detail. It deals with some weighty themes (ethnic cleansing, fascism and corruption) but does so in an idiosyncratic fashion.815 Three Billboards Outside of Ebbing, MissouriWriter-director Martin McDonagh has a host of award-winning plays behind him but his movies haven’t always lived up to his stage work. This one certainly does. It shares some of the dark and nihilistic humour found in McDonagh’s previous film, Seven Psychopaths.In an era of wearisome poltergeist movies, haunted house stories and torture porn, A Quiet Place is a refreshingly pared-down and very original affair. Director John Krasinski relies on editing, sound effects and off-screen action to crank up the tension. We do see the creatures from time to time, sometimes even in extreme closeup. They are very grotesque, bigger versions of the polyp-like succubus which exploded out of John Hurt’s stomach in Alien. However, the most terrifying moments here come when the humans are waiting for them to appear, desperately hoping that they won’t. Lady Bird is one of the best American coming-of-age films since Barry Levinson’s Diner. Written and directed by Greta Gerwig, it offers an utterly winning mix of humour, poignancy and sharp-eyed social observation. Gerwig approaches her subject matter with the same tenderness and affectionate irony with which the adolescent Lady Bird regards Sacramento. Gerwig also shows Lady Bird’s heroism as the young heroine strives against the odds to become the very best version of herself she can be.If Phantom Thread is indeed Daniel Day-Lewis’s final film as an actor, he is going out on a wondrously bizarre note. This must be the oddest film in his career, one in which he gives a typically commanding but very idiosyncratic performance. Almost everything here is jarring – but generally in a very positive way. It is not so long ago that Paul Schrader seemed to be giving up on cinema. The American writer-director (whose credits include Taxi Driver, American Gigolo and Affliction) had taken to making movies like the sour Hollywood satire The Canyons with Lindsay Lohan and the cartoonishly violent Dog Eat Dog, shot cheaply, aimed at a VOD audience. The former had a montage of closed-down movie theatres. In interviews, Schrader struck a gloomy note about the future of the industry. This is why First Reformed is so refreshing. This is not just Schrader’s best film in a very long while. It is also a re-affirmation of the director’s belief in the medium.Oscar Wilde goes to ruin in Rupert Everett’s debut feature as director. Everett also wrote and stars in the film, giving a grandstanding performance as the Irish writer at the end of his life, after his release from prison, where he has been doing hard labour for “gross indecency”. This is a moving and surprising biopic that squeezes out every last drop of pathos from its subject matter. Black Panther is not only one of the most entertaining recent superhero films but has an intelligence and a political dimension that such inchoate offerings as Suicide Squad and Justice League completely lacked. It is an action movie which touches on Pan-Africanism and which owes as much to Malcolm X as it does to Batman or Captain America. Sicilian Ghost Story is a genre-bending affair that combines elements of teen romance, gothic psycho-drama and political thriller. It is loosely based on a true story of a boy called Giuseppe Di Matteo whose father, an ex-member of the Sicilian Mafia, turned “grass” against his erstwhile associates. The Mafia responded by kidnapping Giuseppe and keeping him in captivity for nearly 800 days. From its slow-burning beginning, s develops into an epic melodrama.

The company\u0027s two founders left in recent days amid rumours that it disagreed with Facebook over how the company should be run.And after the Facebook hack was revealed over the weekend, it emerged that Instagram users and accounts might also have been caught up in it if they had used their Facebook log-in to create their Instagram account.Some of the accounts caught up in Facebook\u0027s hacks appear to be trading on the dark web, with cyber criminals able to buy access to people\u0027s accounts for just a few dollars, according to listings seen by\u0026nbspThe Independent.It\u0027s not thought that those issues have anything to do with the current outage, which is almost certainly simply a technical fault.

Nick Johannsen\u0026nbspexplains how even urgent action may not be enough to\u0026nbspsave this stately beastClick to followThe IndependentThe fungus causes leaf loss, lesions in the wood and on the bark, and ultimately the dieback of the tree\u0027s crownAs a child growing up in East Anglia, two mighty elm trees were anchors in my world.\u0026nbspEven more feral than my own children, wherever we wandered above the Dedham Vale, two gigantic elm trees signalled home. Without warning these beautiful twins were quickly and ruthlessly cut down by Dutch elm disease. Our welcoming elms became giant, gloomy monoliths, quickly felled, logged and stacked.\u0026nbspDutch elm disease was good for the chainsaw and log stove market. Across Britain there ensued the removal of dead and dying elms on a drastic scale, which created a dramatic diminishment of much loved landscapes. In my own East Anglian clay land, the change was appalling, lanes which were once tunnels of cathedral-like elm trees became scrappy hedges field trees felled and not replaced, woods completely altered, the landscapes changed forever. When my father died nearly 40 years later he had not finished burning the logs he cut and stacked even from our tiny farm.And now for ash, perhaps our most graceful tree, the die seems cast. Ash dieback was first recorded in Britain in 2012, although there is speculation that it\u0026nbspwas here years before. Also known as\u0026nbspHymenoscyphus fraxineus, is a fungal pathogen and a most serious disease of ash trees. It\u0026nbspis stealthier than Dutch elm the death of ash trees is slower: there are moments of apparent recovery, but the eventual decline seems irrecoverable. The estimates are that between 95 per cent and 98 per cent of our ash trees are threatened\u0026nbspthis would seem to be borne out by what we are witnessing in some of the ash dominated woodlands in east Kent.The strange story of Sheffield’s tree massacreSo great is the threat that common ash (Fraxinus excelsior), the everyday tree of our streets, hedges and woodlands, is now listed on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List.\u0026nbspAsh dieback was first identified in Europe in Poland, in 1992, where it is believed that it arrived on commercially imported ash from East Asia. In its native Asia, the fungus will have co-evolved with the Asian species of ash, on which it therefore has limited\u0026nbspimpact European ash has far less immunity.\u0026nbspThe fungus lives in the leaf litter and has a delicate if peculiar beauty. Thousands of airborne spores are released and can disperse naturally on the wind over tens of kilometres. Continual cycles of infection and reinfection from the leaf litter below produce trees punch drunk with pathogen.\u0026nbspAsh dieback is well described: the effect of the fungus is to block the water transport systems in trees causing leaf loss, lesions in the wood and on the bark, and ultimately the dieback of the crown of the tree. Young trees succumb quickly in older trees the decline can take between six\u0026nbspto 20 years. When the fight is lost, the weakened tree succumbs or is attacked and ultimately killed by another pest or pathogen. The elegant, luxuriant deep green of a late summer venerable ash is reduced to a threadbare tangle of branches and twigs. Desperate new “epicormic”\u0026nbspgrowth emerging from the trunk and branches changes the form and elegance of the tree, once more diminishing our landscapes.An ash tree is a whole ecology: almost 1,000 species use ash as a habitat, including wood mice, liverworts, wrens, blue tits, bats, lichens, fungi and beetles. Bullfinches will eat ash keys in winter when food is scarce. The caterpillars of many kinds of moth feed on ash leaves.\u0026nbspMany lichens are hosted by ash. Lichens are not a parasite and they do not feed off the tree, but use it as a support. According to Oliver Rackham, author of the brilliant book The Ash Tree, the ash is the last refuge of many declining tree lichens, especially those that once grew on elms before they fell victim to loss of habitat through Dutch elm disease. King Alfred’s Cakes (Daldinia concentrica) are specific to ash, and a number of beetles that live only on this fungus are dependent solely on ash for survival.It is true to say that some ash trees appear to be able to resist or tolerate infection. There is a significant scientific effort going into studying the genetic factors which make this possible so that tolerant ash trees can be bred for the future. Interesting and exciting developments in the science are occurring all of the time and the Living Ash Project reports big steps in collecting, grafting and growing from trees that are identified as being “putatively tolerant to ash dieback”.\u0026nbspDespite the extent of devastation already witnessed elsewhere in Europe and in certain parts of Britain, scientists from the Earlham Institute have found an incredibly limited genetic ersity in the fungus. It would seem that the original infection in European ash may have come from just one or two mushroom-like fruiting bodies.\u0026nbspAccording to the Natural History Museum the ersity of the fungus found across Europe is just an eighth of that found in a single Japanese woodland, so is likely to be a just a tiny fraction of that found across Asia. Imagine what might happen if more of that Asian genetic ersity is brought into Europe.The ash dieback story is bleak, but\u0026nbspfor the beleaguered ash tree\u0026nbspanother\u0026nbspperhaps even more serious\u0026nbspthreat approaches from another invasive species with its own surprising beauty. The Emerald Ash Borer beetle, again a native of Asia, was imported accidentally to North America, thought to have been\u0026nbspon something as apparently innocent as wooden packing material. The impact in North America has been widespread and devastating, killing hundreds of millions of trees since the 1990s.\u0026nbspEmerald Ash Borer has now been found in Russia and is moving westwards and southwards at a rate of around 25 miles a year.The extreme vulnerability of our trees to imported pests and diseases is most dramatically illustrated by the loss of elm and ash. Our trees have such long lives our treescapes take such a long time to recover from these attacks that managing the risk of importing further diseases and pests must be a critical issue for the future.\u0026nbspThere are a wide variety of other tree diseases, which are known threats:\u0026nbspwhile many websites have listings of the top things to do, see or visit, rather sadly the Forestry Commission website has a list of “top tree diseases”.Ash dieback is just one of a list of 14 top diseases, and the borer beetle one of the eight\u0026nbsptop pests.\u0026nbspThe loss of a single beautiful tree can be felt deeply and personally we face the loss of hundreds of millions of trees from Britain’s treescapes, the forces for change are enormous and the response should be in equal measure.Earlier this year the government produced a 25-year plan for the environment, an ambitious initiative that\u0026nbsphas signalled a strong intent to leave the environment in a better state than it was found. The “at a glance”\u0026nbspsummary includes the need to protect our many plants, trees and wildlife species in its very first line. One of the first, most tangible early outputs of the plan is the Tree Health Resilience Strategy. The strategy sets out an integrated approach, which seeks to significantly strengthen biosecurity in\u0026nbspprocurement and practice, deploy the best science and evidence to understand and respond to the risks in an informed way and to increase the extent, connectivity, ersity and condition of our trees and woodlands.The strategy recognises that there is a real need to increase the resistance of our treescapes so that there is no further substantial change or loss, and to support the recovery and adaptation of our landscapes in what will inevitably be a most difficult future.There is a scientific, technical and conservation response to ash dieback and it is vital that there is, but what is the cultural response?\u0026nbspWhat about the little boy who lost his elm trees and is now working to try to conserve and enhance the Kent Downs, one of Britain’s finest and most ash dominated landscapes what is the emotional response?\u0026nbspA fully grown ash can reach a height of 35 metres and can live to 400 years or more. The trees can be easily recognised by their\u0026nbspblack buds and clusters of seeds – which can be a menace for gardeners proud of their lawns. Native to Europe, Africa and Asia, ash is dominant in many parts of the UK and provides the perfect habitat for various wildflowers on the woodland floor, as well as numerous bird species which\u0026nbspnest in its branches. In days gone by the ash was believed to have healing properties – in Viking mythology it was known as the ‘tree of life’.The hills and valleys of this enchanting quarter of Kent are punctuated by ash, our most common tree. Ash is intrinsic to the place, it is in the names of the villages, towns and woodlands one of the most affected woods has two names, Asholt Wood and Ashley Wood a single remarkable ash tree is marked on the Ordnance Survey map for Ashford.\u0026nbspWe expect that we will lose almost all of our ash trees and so we feel that it is vital that we record and celebrate what we have before it might be lost. We want to do this in extraordinary and enduring ways so that we connect more with our trees and treescapes and provide a record for the future. For elm, Gerald Wilkinson wrote Epitaph for The Elm. Hastily put together and almost too late to record fine elm trees in the landscape, it is a saddening record.\u0026nbspOur idea is to salute the tree, as well as mark the loss.\u0026nbspThe Ash Project, which is funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund and the Arts Council of England, combines a major new sculptural commission by internationally recognised artists Ackroyd \u0026amp Harvey with a wide-ranging programme of walks, talks and exhibitions.\u0026nbspWe have created a temporary archive that records both the extraordinary utility of ash and celebrates ordinary ash objects that we all might know.The Ash Archive involves\u0026nbspexisting objects and art works and new commissions across a range of art forms, and the public is invited to add to a growing, collectively generated collection. Our approach has been to collaborate across conservation and scientific research work to develop new languages with this massive environmental change. It is our hope that, through the Ash Project, we will preserve our memories of the tree for the generations who will live with the loss.The cultural celebration is also supported by a collaboration with the Woodland Trust and a number of Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, in which ash is dominant, to work with author Archie Miles to publish a monograph. Titled Ash, this new publication pays tribute to the ash tree in all of its glorious manifestations across the landscapes of the UK. The book, on sale now,\u0026nbspis a loving homage to the ash tree.On a practical basis we are working with a wide variety of organisations to support a Kent-wide plan for landscape restoration. We have produced guidance for landowners in order to plan wide scale recovery and to ensure we retain much of the bioersity that ash supports, but surely more must be done across the country to prevent further landscape and environmental loss.Campaign plants trees every time Trump tweets about climate changeHere’s why we’re planting trees in northern SyriaCouncil ‘reliant on police’ to carry out tree-felling workAs the summer wanes the impact of ash dieback is at its greatest. At this time of year in Kent we see the ink-like blackening of the leaves of affected trees, with leaf fall occurring as much as a month or two earlier than it should, bringing the bleakness of winter to the landscape all too soon.It is in this season that we have chosen to present Ash to Ash\u0026nbsp– a monumental art work by Ackroyd\u0026nbsp\u0026amp\u0026nbspHarvey. Standing high on the scarp of the Kent Downs, two giant monoliths stand proud, almost defiant. One the bright white of newly cut ash wood, the other charred and blackened like the inky leaves of an affected tree. These extraordinary pieces, made from ash dieback stricken trees, are pierced by more than 10,000 arrows, handmade from coppiced ash. They act as marker trees, on the edge of the North Downs Way.\u0026nbspOverlooking a landscape already damaged by ash dieback, they will be a striking reminder of all that we stand to lose. Unlike the giant elm monoliths of my childhood, this extraordinary artwork both memorialises and celebrates the ash.\u0026nbspIn Kent and East Anglia the impact of ash dieback is already, in places, devastating.\u0026nbspThis seems likely to be the story across the country over the next 10 to 15 years.Ash is perhaps most closely associated with some of our most valued landscapes, the Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty and National Parks. Places such as\u0026nbspthe Cotswolds, Chilterns, High Weald, Lake District, Dorset, Yorkshire Dales, White Peak and Snowdonia are, in part, defined by their relationship with the ash tree, there is a great need to document and celebrate these landscapes also.We plan to take the work\u0026nbspwe have started in Kent to a national platform, to collaborate across Britain with landscape managers, artists, scientists and ecologists to ensure we mark and honour the graceful Venus of the woods, the tree of life, before it is lost to us.Nick\u0026nbspJohannsen\u0026nbspis director of the Kent Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty Unit.

By Patrick KingsleyClick to followThe IndependentAt the Morecambe Bay Foodbank, the number of children receiving at least one parcel of free food has almost doubled in the last yearIt’s half past eight, and the school day is just starting at Morecambe Bay Primary, a state-run\u0026nbspschool in northwest England. Siobhan Collingwood, the headteacher, points\u0026nbspto a cheerful boy munching his way through two slices of toast – his first meal of the day.Teachers, she says, sometimes find him sifting through trash cans for discarded fruit. “He’d eat his way through whatever we put in front of him.”Some students trickle\u0026nbspthrough without stopping they’ve\u0026nbspalready eaten. But a few dozen head\u0026nbspstraight to the food counter. Of 350 students, roughly one in three would not have breakfast unless the school provided it, Collingwood reckons.Brexit wasn’t caused by austerity, and here’s the proofDuring Collingwood’s 13 years as headteacher at Morecambe Bay Primary, there have\u0026nbspalways been a few hungry children. But two years ago, the staff noticed an increasing number of youngsters returning undernourished after spending school breaks at home.Initially, Collingwood and her staff were puzzled.\u0026nbspMany parents held jobs, even if they struggled to cover the bills. Then it dawned on them that the rising number of hungry children at Morecambe Bay coincided with sharp reductions in welfare benefits associated with the clumsy introduction of a new welfare programme.“As we spoke to parents,” Collingwood says, “it became clear that for many of them, it was caused by changes to the benefit system rolled out in recent years, which were forcing families into crisis.”Across Britain, the number of children living in poverty has jumped sharply in the past six years, a trend that critics blame in part on the\u0026nbspgovernment’s policy of austerity, the budget-slashing response to the 2008 financial crisis\u0026nbspsteadily reshaping British life.And there is no immediate relief on the horizon. The County Councils Network, a group of local governing bodies, warned recently of £1bn\u0026nbspin budget cuts nationwide next year, draining more money from social services, including some for children.To be clear, Britain is not Venezuela. Reports of hungry children showing up in Morecambe doctors’ offices with rickets have proved false. But that is cold comfort in one of the wealthiest countries in the world, one that over the years has made a strong commitment to child welfare.While hunger is not the only social pathology associated with childhood poverty, it is perhaps the hardest to conceal. In that respect, it is a flashing signal of a deepening problem.For children, the consequences of poverty can be severe. In the short term, poverty elevates the risk of illness, hunger and social stigma. In the long term, it can create a vicious cycle from which a child struggles to escape, especially in class-conscious Britain.British teenagers from disadvantaged backgrounds are roughly a third as likely to achieve good GCSE\u0026nbspgrades, according to government statistics.They are then roughly half as likely to go to university, according to a separate set of government data. Those who do make it are less likely to get a better paid job within six months of graduation than those from more privileged backgrounds. And they are less likely to make it into high status professions, such as finance, law or medicine.Even those who do crack the “class ceiling” earn an average of 16 per cent less than more privileged peers, researchers at the London School of Economics found.The government likes to focus attention on workless families, but there’s hardly any left. That’s a problem of the pastAnd those from poorer backgrounds are likely to die around five years earlier than those who are not, government data suggests.Before the financial crisis in 2008 and the subsequent budget squeeze, successive British governments, both Conservative and Labour, achieved progress on childhood poverty. The number of minors living in “relative poverty” – families with an annual household income less than 60 per cent of the national median, after housing costs – fell by roughly 800,000\u0026nbspto 3.5 million\u0026nbspbetween 1998 and 2012, or 27 per cent of all Britons aged 16 or younger.But the same year that parliament passed the Welfare Reform Act, a central plank of the austerity programme, the trend began to reverse.\u0026nbspSince 2012, about 600,000 children have fallen back into “relative poverty”. During the same period, the number of children requiring food handouts from the Trussell Trust, the country’s largest network of food banks, more than tripled, to over 484,000 from nearly 127,000.Overall, since returning to power in 2010, the Conservatives have announced more than £30bn\u0026nbspin benefit cuts and abandoned prior targets to substantially reduce child poverty by 2020.By 2021, roughly 35 per cent of all minors in Britain are predicted to be poor, according to forecasts by the Institute for Fiscal Studies. And the country’s pending departure from the European Union may deepen the problem, because of rising living costs and the sudden loss of funding from Brussels for young people, according to a joint assessment by seven leading children’s charities.In November, the United Nations special rapporteur on extreme poverty\u0026nbspPhilip Alston will make an official visit to Britain to research the connection between the austerity programme and the rise in poverty – the first such visit to Britain by a United Nations special rapporteur on extreme poverty.“It’s increasingly evident, particularly to people working with children, that we’re in a child poverty crisis,” says Alison Garnham, chief executive of the Child Poverty Action Group, a British charity. “And it is primarily to do with the massive cuts to benefits.”The Conservative Party leaders who pushed through the austerity programme\u0026nbspdispute that it is the cause of rising child poverty, or that child poverty is increasing. They argue that universal credit – the\u0026nbspnew system that bundles most payments into one –\u0026nbspis an improvement.The new system is “infinitely better than what it replaced”, says Iain Duncan Smith, the Conservative former cabinet minister who oversaw the changes. “The process of stepping into work is easier.”That rationale is being questioned. Though unemployment has been more than halved under the Conservatives, the overall child poverty rate has risen. And roughly two-thirds of poor children have at least one parent who works, the Institute for Fiscal Studies says.“We tell ourselves completely the wrong story about poverty in the UK,” Garnham says. “The government likes to focus attention on workless families, but there’s hardly any left. That’s a problem of the past.”Created with Sketch.Greeks slide deeper into poverty Show all 12Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Retired teacher and volunteer Eva Agkisalaki clears tables at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church in AthensPeople eat at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church in AthensThe monthly food supplies that were given out in February by an Athens Municipality-run centre are pictured in AthensAn elderly man sells chestnuts in front of the parliament during a demonstration to demand tax reductions and compensation in AthensPeople make their way outside the main fish market of AthensA butcher waits for clients inside the main meat market of AthensAn elderly woman searches through donated clothes at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox churchChildren\u0027s clothes to be donated to impoverished Greeks are arranged in a stock room at an Athens Municipality-run centre A man waits to have his clothes washed by the Ithaca mobile laundry service for the homeless in central Athens, GreecePeople line up to apply for a social benefit from the Directorate of Social Welfare and Health of the Municipality of AthensFood is laid out on a table at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church Poverty stricken area of Perama Retired teacher and volunteer Eva Agkisalaki clears tables at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church in AthensPeople eat at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church in AthensThe monthly food supplies that were given out in February by an Athens Municipality-run centre are pictured in AthensAn elderly man sells chestnuts in front of the parliament during a demonstration to demand tax reductions and compensation in AthensPeople make their way outside the main fish market of AthensA butcher waits for clients inside the main meat market of AthensAn elderly woman searches through donated clothes at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox churchChildren\u0027s clothes to be donated to impoverished Greeks are arranged in a stock room at an Athens Municipality-run centre A man waits to have his clothes washed by the Ithaca mobile laundry service for the homeless in central Athens, GreecePeople line up to apply for a social benefit from the Directorate of Social Welfare and Health of the Municipality of AthensFood is laid out on a table at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church Poverty stricken area of Perama Working, but poorJust outside Morecambe, a tourist town that no longer draws so many tourists, George McCullough, a single parent to a six-year-old son, is\u0026nbspin financial meltdown. His rent has\u0026nbspfallen into arrears, and he can\u0026nbspno longer pay the family’s utility bills. He’s started\u0026nbspto dip into his overdraft, incurring further bank charges.He’s\u0026nbspstopped socialising and sometimes skips\u0026nbspmeals to ensure that his son eats\u0026nbspthree times a day. But he can\u0026nbspno longer afford to give the boy a balanced diet or a new school uniform, or take him to see friends.“He basically can’t go to any of his mates’ parties or houses,” McCullough says. “I literally can’t afford to pay for a gift, or even to take him there.”What\u0026nbspthrew\u0026nbsphis affairs into crisis was the transition to universal credit. Before the welfare changes, McCullough received around £685\u0026nbspevery month to supplement the roughly £500\u0026nbspa month he earns as a bus driver for disabled children.It’s\u0026nbspnot just that he now receives\u0026nbsproughly £40\u0026nbspless a month, though for a family that was already struggling to stay above the poverty line, the cut – the cost of a week’s groceries – was painful. (Others have experienced worse: the average working family has lost more than £75\u0026nbspa month, according to calculations by the Child Poverty Action Group.)What has really hurt McCullough\u0026nbspis\u0026nbsphow that loss is\u0026nbspcompounded, severely, by the problematic rollout of universal credit in 2016.Under the new system, all claimants have to wait at least five weeks for their first payment –\u0026nbspa dangerously long delay for families living hand-to-mouth. In McCullough’s case, the delay was long enough to throw him into a vicious cycle of debt.By this May, the family had almost climbed from the hole when they were hit by a second quirk of the universal credit system. After his employers paid him early, giving him two payments in one month, officials wrongly concluded that his salary had doubled and cut his benefits. For several weeks, they refused to admit their mistake, plunging him back into debt.In Morecambe, the problem is compounded by cuts to local children’s services. Before austerity, schools could quickly refer vulnerable families to a local state-funded children’s centre“If this is going to be a regular occurrence,” McCullough asked, “where is the incentive to work?”McCullough’s experiences are not unique. The government’s own research into the system found that nearly half of claimants needed help to fill out the application form, while four in 10 were still facing financial difficulties eight months into their time on universal credit.Duncan Smith, who was the secretary of state for work and pensions between 2010 and 2015, acknowledges\u0026nbspproblems with the way the system has been put into effect.\u0026nbspHe even resigned in 2015 because the finance minister at the time, George Osborne, cut an additional £4bn\u0026nbspfrom the welfare budget. “I thought that was too much,” Duncan Smith says.But “the system itself is the right system,” he adds. “Though a large number of working families are still in poverty, they were in deeper poverty when they were out of work. As they move into work, they’re better off.”Back at McCullough’s, the father’s eyes well\u0026nbspup as his phone buzzes\u0026nbspwith debt notices from the local water board, and he describes\u0026nbsphow he struggles\u0026nbspto provide his son with some of the basic things in life – like fresh vegetables, new clothes and haircuts.McCullough voted Conservative in past elections and says he would do so again if an election were held tomorrow. Despite his travails, he supports the party’s cautious approach to state spending, and he thinks there are too many people expecting handouts for nothing.But he no longer believes that restructuring benefits will get more people into work, or more children out of poverty.“Until you walk a mile in someone’s shoes, you can’t know,” McCullough says. “Until you’ve seen how it works, you don’t understand.”In Morecambe, the area’s Conservative MP\u0026nbspDavid Morris\u0026nbspsays in an email that child poverty had fallen in his constituency, and blames\u0026nbsp“left-wing political activists” for any suggestion to the contrary. In previous interviews, he has accused headteacher Collingwood of having political motivations for speaking out.But the demand for free breakfasts at Morecambe Bay Primary is not the only warning sign.The relative child poverty rate in Morris’s constituency rose to 25.9 per cent from 2013 to 2017, up from 24.2 per cent, according to research by the Centre\u0026nbspfor Research in Social Policy at Loughborough University. That may not sound like much, but the rise has produced marked changes on the ground.How social supermarkets are filling a gap in austerity BritainAt the Morecambe Bay Foodbank, for instance, the number of children who received at least one parcel of free food has almost doubled to 1,229 in 2017-18, from 656 in 2013-14. At the local branch of Citizens Advice the number of food vouchers distributed to children in the same period increased sixfold, to 1,336 from 222.In Morecambe, the problem is compounded by cuts to local children’s services. Before austerity, schools could quickly refer vulnerable families to a local state-funded children’s centre, where social workers would work with children and parents to solve their problems.Since 2010, however, roughly 1,000 of these centres have been closed across Britain after about £990m\u0026nbspin funding cuts. Those that remain – such as those in the Morecambe area – have substantially reduced their capacity.“The caseload is growing, and the system\u0026nbspby which we would have supported them is diminishing,” Collingwood says. “We feel much more like an island.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Today, little has changed on the islandsClick to followThe IndependentIn the 1950s, transportation on the islands was by a pony-drawn cart and even today there are few carsThe last time I saw Bridin Concannon, she was walking towards me along the narrow road on the westernmost edge of the island of Inishmaan, off the west coast of Ireland.“Were you out at Synge’s Chair?” I called out as she approached.The sun behind her hung, unmasked by clouds, low and long in the Irish early summer sky.“I was,” she said. Her voice was strong, clear – the way one’s voice can be when exhilarated. “I’ll start writing a play soon.”Trump cancels trip to Ireland after massive protests plannedWe both laughed loudly, and strode past one another. She was headed back towards the village and I towards the cliffs over the North Atlantic, to a perch of limestone that the author frequented during his time here, a spot known locally as Synge’s Chair.The Irish playwright JM\u0026nbspSynge (1871-1909) first came to the Aran Islands in the summer of 1898 looking for inspiration and to learn the Irish language. Over the next several years he would return again and again, growing more connected to the people and the wind-and-sea-battered land they inhabited.Synge’s most famous work\u0026nbspPlayboy of the Western World\u0026nbspwas inspired by a story he heard while on the islands, and caused riots in Dublin when it was first staged in 1906. The foremost playwright of the Irish Renaissance – a movement inspired by strong political nationalism and a revival of Celtic traditions – Synge was co-founder of The Abbey Theatre, also known as the National Theatre of Ireland. All six of his plays are either set in or heavily influenced by his time in Aran.The three remote Aran Islands of Inishmore, Inishmaan and Inisheer hide in plain sight in the mouth of Galway Bay. They are still predominantly Irish-speaking, insular and, as even in Synge’s era, considered a place lost in time.It was the poet William Butler Yeats who suggested that Synge come to these islands. “Go to Aran,” Yeats told his friend. “Live there as if you were one of the people themselves express a life that has never found expression.”Synge grew more attached to the islands over time, and I had a notion that repeat trips might similarly enhance my appreciation of Aran’s more subtle charms. I decided to visit the islands over a period of several months, from early spring to high summer. I hoped that my repeated act of return and departure would elicit in me the sense of investment, as well as illuminate details and patterns of day-to-day local life that are the deep appeal of such places as Aran, places not needy of a traveller’s attention.Synge took a steamer from Galway that sailed at the mercy of the tides, on the rolling sea, and transferred into a currach, a small canvas-covered fishing boat, to make it to shore. These days things are slightly easier, with a daily ferry schedule as well as light aircraft service.My initial impression of the largest island of Inishmore from the ferry was not dissimilar to Synge’s:.\u0026nbsp“A dreary rock appeared at first sloping up from the sea and into the fog,” the author wrote in The Aran Islands –\u0026nbsphis classic account of his time here, first published in 1907. “The place looked hardly fit for habitation. There was no green to be seen, and no sign of the people.”Part of the considerable allure of Aran lies in what it lacks. There are no cinemas and few cars electricity only arrived in the 1970s. Seventeen-year-old Thomas Kennedy summed it up for me within minutes of my arrival when he said:\u0026nbsp“There’s no facilities here – you rely on the people.” And while much has remained unchanged since Synge’s time, society has reached the islands. Synge wasn’t confronted with the dozen or so glamping structures visible on arrival, for one. And the pierside Atlantic Hotel, where Synge resided while on Inishmore, has been transformed into the Aran Sweater Market.But beside the shop, three pubs, one food shop, a restaurant and a handful of bed and breakfasts, there is little else in the way of commerce. The 12 square mile island is home to roughly 760 people, most clustered around the main settlement of Kilronan, with the vast majority of terrain given over to small parcels of grazing and farmland, delineated by Aran’s most dominant feature, its dry-stone walls.“You have to be OK within yourself to live here,” Melissa Gillian told me as I stood eavesdropping on a wedding reception outside the Aran Island Hotel. A Maine native, she married a local man and has lived on Inishmore for 10 years. Gillian was one of only a handful of outsiders I met over the months – all are married to locals her sentiment was one I heard often, on all three islands.Most visitors stay only a few hours, travel a well-worn circuit and hustle back onto the boats for the comparative metropolis of Galway or the pubs of Doolin. But it is during the early morning hours, and again later in the afternoon once the last ferry of the day has gone, that the island’s deeper appeal emerges.If you’ve seen one image of the Aran Islands, it is likely to be an aerial shot of Inishmore’s Dun Aengus, semicircular stone walls that abut a 300-foot sheer cliff above the Atlantic. The initial walls of this ring fort – one of seven to be found on the islands – date back to 1100BC, and it is next to impossible not to gravitate to the site while on Inishmore. A visit at daybreak was rewarded by absolute solitude, as the wind whistled over the stones. Birds caught thermals below the cliffs. Clouds raced across the sun. Time stretched.As I was leaving, the buses began to arrive. I sat on a wall eating a Nutella crêpe\u0026nbspand watched coach after coach deposit people with fanny packs and (unneeded) sun hats. Though watching the human drama of group tourism from a slight remove has its own rewards, I had a date with a magic well.Early on during Synge’s first visit to Inishmore, he met a man who told him a story. A Sligo woman, it seems, had a dream that her blind son might be made to see if she travelled to a particular well out on the Aran Islands. She did so, and upon touching the well’s water to her sightless child’s eye, he exclaimed, “O mother, look at the pretty flowers!” Synge would use this story and his visit to the site as the inspiration for his play\u0026nbspThe Well of the Saints.My local map indicated the well as a tiny dot not far off the road, yet I’d cycled past it twice without luck. Finally I caught sight of an old sign that directed me over one stone fence and then another, through several fields, until I came upon the ruin of a tiny building:\u0026nbspThe Church of the Four Beautiful Persons\u0026nbsp(no one I met on the island could explain the origins of the name). I stepped over cow pats and entered. The sun emerged and the grey stones brightened. At that moment, a cow poked her head inside to see who was on her turf.Created with Sketch.Pope Francis visits Ireland – in pictures Show all 55Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Pope Francis celebrates the Holy Mass at the Phoenix Park, in Dublin Pope Francis arrives at Phoenix Park for a Papal Mass of the World Meeting of Families in DublinA vigil takes place at the site of the mass grave which contained the remains of 796 named babies from the Bon Secours Mother and Baby home in Tuam.

A tin cup had been left beside it, and someone had tossed in a small crucifix. A small pile of stones, similar to the ones that covered the well’s floor, sat next to it, apparently meant to be thrown in the well. As a long-ago lapsed Catholic, this ritual seemed to me somehow more pagan than Christian. I tossed a few in, thinking of my children.Back in town, the crowds were converging for the afternoon ferry to the mainland. On impulse, I grabbed my bag, deciding again to follow Synge’s lead – this time to another of the islands.After only a brief stay on Inishmore, the playwright headed for Inishmaan, of which he noted:\u0026nbsp“Gaelic is more generally used, and the life is perhaps the most primitive that is left in Europe.”I wondered how much things had changed, and as I headed to the ferry for the short crossing to the middle island, Loraine Conneely, an Inishmore native, read my mind. “You’ll see,” she said. “It’s still the same over there. It hasn’t moved.”If the traveller is greeted with a (relatively) bustling arrival on the big island, no such welcome – in fact, no welcome at all – awaits the visitor in Inishmaan, which is less than four square miles. The ferry dock is a half-hour walk to what passes for a village (there is one shop and one bar). Life, as it did in Synge’s time, revolves around the caprices of weather and the ties of community.Little energy is spent looking outward – exactly how the 160 inhabitants prefer things.Over my months of coming and going, I encountered many of the same people again and again on Inishmaan: Ciaran O’Ceallaigh, who was raising his son on the island because he wanted him “to grow up in a true Irish-speaking environment” Bartley Conneely, who owned 21 acres and six cows, and could easily be persuaded to give a visitor a lift to the ferry and the pair of ladies I often saw when out walking, who cautioned me against staying too late up at the ring fort of Dun Fearbhai, lest the fairies interfere with me.Synge noted many stories of strange happenings on the island. “These people make no distinction between the natural and the supernatural,” he wrote. But he also eloquently described a people living a hard-scrabble life very close to the elements: “Of beings who feel their isolation in the face of a universe that wars on them with winds and sea.” Synge encountered people who carried themselves with workaday dignity and offered a humble, sincere welcome – exactly what I found on Inishmaan 120 years later.“We’re ambivalent about tourists on this island,” the restaurateur Ruairi de Blacam told me. “You’re left to go about your business. Get a map – you’ve got shoes – and off you go.” De Blacam is a local boy who made (extremely) good. In 2007 he and his wife, Marie-Therese, opened Inis Meáin, the singular high-end restaurant and inn on the islands.“It’s unlikely, if not impossible, we could have done this if I wasn’t from the island,” he said as I sipped some of his delicious lobster bisque and watched a setting fireball sun slash light across the limestone just outside the restaurant’s picture window. “You need the people’s support.”He continued: “We’re on a precarious perch out here in the ocean. People lean on each other in all sorts of ways. When I was a kid, I went around with a candle and people still dressed in traditional clothes. Ireland was 20, 30 years behind the rest of the world, and Aran was 20, 30 years behind Ireland.”The sun dropped, as Synge wrote of a similar sunset a century earlier, “like a lozenge of gold flame into the sea” and the ocean was cast in a purple hue.“But things are moving fast we’re catching up a bit,” de Blacam smiled and placed a dish of scallop ceviche with toasted almonds in front of me.“What you have to understand is that the people here live a very simple life. And we’re here by choice. There’s an understated pride, and the legacy of Synge is certainly a part of that.”Very much so: The cottage to which the playwright returned each year – a small, whitewashed, thatch-roof affair – has been preserved as a museum of sorts. Though it’s technically open to the public, hours vary, and it took some doing, to track down Ciaran O’Faherty, whose great-grandparents had offered Synge a bedroom in what was then their home. Once I finally cornered him in the pub, O’Faherty was happy to oblige me with a look. On this island that insists on existing out of time, the cottage’s green front door was a portal through the century things inside remain as Synge had described: “My room is at one end of the cottage … There is a kitchen with earth floor and open rafters … It is full of beauty and distinction.”As much as Synge relished his island home, he spent most of his days out walking the land. Over on the far western side, atop high cliffs, he found a stand of rock looking out over Galway Bay and Inishmore that he would return to again and again. “As I lay here hour after hour, I seem to enter into the wild pastimes of the cliff,” he wrote.This was when I found myself headed out to Synge’s Chair. The semicircle cluster of limestone created a natural barrier against the elements, cradled the visitor and invited lingering. Each of my visits was similar time slipped the way time can when there is nowhere to go: at first excruciatingly slowly, then in a blink, the day would be gone.With just the one pub for action, nights on Inishmaan are quiet and even a loner can yearn for society. As Synge did, I made the short crossing to the smallest island of Inisheer (on two occasions I was the only ferry passenger from Inishmaan). Upon coming ashore, Synge was confronted with a man –\u0026nbsp“a drunkard and shebeener” – who lived “with the restlessness of a man who has no sympathy with his companions.” Upon my arrival I was met with an only slightly less distressing social challenge.As on Inishmore, the day tourist trade had taken hold. There were horse and trap rides, coffee carts and stands selling local fudge. But just beyond the flurry of town, Inisheer, with its 250 residents, is perhaps the most physically picturesque of the three Aran Islands, and its three square miles make it easy to navigate on bicycle. (Bikes were readily available directly off the ferry on both Inishmore and Inisheer. Not surprisingly, there was no bike rental on Inishmaan.)Atop the island’s highest hill, beside the ruin of O’Brien’s Castle, Aine O’Graiofa had put a few tables out in front of her home and called it a restaurant. I took a seat in the driveway and settled in for one of Ireland’s staple country lunches – ham and cheese on toasted white bread – while looking down across Galway Bay to Connemara in the distance.Inisheer boasts three pubs, one shop and a church.“The priest died four years ago and they haven’t sent another,” O’Graiofa told me. “We’re left to our own devices.”We chatted of the decline in the church’s dominance over the people throughout Ireland.“Sure it’s their own fault,” she said. “We have the old schoolteacher who goes up and leads folks in the rosary that’s all we need.”Watching a ferry cross the bay down below, I asked if it was heading for Inishmaan.Businesses call for gay marriage to be legalised in Northern IrelandHIV rates rise in Northern Ireland – despite falling across rest of UKThe motley crew lining up to contest the Irish presidential election“I doubt it. You go over there and you don’t see a soul they’re all hiding behind the stones.”We laughed, but soon enough I made my way down to the dock.Back on Inishmaan I walked past the old graveyard from which Synge took inspiration for his play Riders to the Sea, and continued up the hill, across from Synge’s cottage and up over five stone fences and through five small fields to the ring fort of Dun Chonchuir. Synge would “often stroll up there after a dinner of eggs or salt pork, to smoke drowsily on the stones.”Like Synge, I had sat on these walls and viewed the sea in nearly every direction, but on this evening, a fog rolled in. The air became moist. Summer changed to autumn in a matter of minutes. I could barely make out the far end of the small fort enclosure. With no wind, a heavy silence hung in the mist. The century that separated me from Synge seemed suddenly trivial, and a world beyond these dry stone walls didn’t matter at all.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Earlier this year, Nissan announced that it was cutting hundreds of jobs at the Sunderland operation, due to falling demand for diesel vehicles. Mr Zetsche shared no further details about the now-abandoned plan, the Times reported. A number of other car makers issued warnings at the Paris event, with Toyota stating that a no-deal Brexit would lead to a temporary stoppage in UK production, primarily at its Burnaston plant.

Meanwhile, Maxime Picat, executive vice president for Europe at Vauxhall owner PSA, said leaving the EU with no deal would disrupt production. “We’ve been doing all we can to develop our UK business, restore Vauxhall and Opel profitability, reinvesting in Luton and improving our sites’ competitiveness in order to help them face up to an uncertain future,” he said. “But there are limits. Those limits are customs barriers, and the loss of freedom of movement, for people and goods. If we get to that point, we will be obliged to take measures.“If we suddenly have to start manufacturing for the UK in the UK, and for Europe in Europe, there will necessarily be an impact on UK production.”Several car makers have called for Brexit negotiators to avoid a no-deal scenario, warning that such a departure would hit production and investment in the UK market. BMW recently said it would bring a planned shutdown of its Oxford plant forward to begin on the same day the UK leaves the EU, in a bid to minimise the potential disruption a no-deal Brexit would create.Meanwhile, Honda has said that a no-deal Brexit would cost it tens of millions of pounds, while Jaguar Land Rover has moved workers at its Castle Bromwich plant to a three-day week because of “continuing headwinds impacting the car industry”.Ralf Speth, Jaguar’s boss, has previously warned that tens of thousands of jobs in the UK motor industry are at risk if a no-deal Brexit goes ahead.He also said the current lack of clarity around Brexit means he does not know if his plants will be able to function after 29 March 2019, and added that interruptions to production could cost up to £60m a day.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

If confirmed by follow-up Hubble observations, the finding could provide vital clues about the development of planetary systems and may cause experts to revisit theories of how moons form around planets.The new moon is far bigger than any of the nearly 200 natural satellites that have been found in our own solar system. It is comparable in size to its\u0026nbspplanets, roughly the same size as Neptune – orbiting a planet as big as Jupiter.The two are floating around their own star 8,000 lightyears away.Nasa releases statement about bizarre International Space Station leakIt was found in the same way that scientists discovered those thousands of exoplanets: watching for the small dips that happens when they move in front of their star, and working out from those how big it is and what its orbit might be like.They looked at data from\u0026nbsp284 planets found in that way by the Kepler Space Telescope and tried to find those that had anything strange about their orbits.One of those planets, known as Kepler 1625b, seemed to be behaving strangely.\u0026nbspWe saw little deviations and wobbles in the light curve that caught our attention, Kipping said.They watched the planet for some time, and noticed that soon after it passed in front of its star, there was another dip of light, which appeared to be a moon trailing the planet like a dog following its owner on a leash.It also seemed to be passing in front of its star slightly sooner that might be expected, which would be consistent with the kind of wobble that would happen because of a moon\u0027s gravity.\u0026nbspAn extraterrestrial civilization watching the Earth and Moon transit the Sun would note similar anomalies in the timing of Earth\u0027s transit, Kipping said.It is possible that the strange behaviour could also be caused by another planet in the system, and hope for further data from space telescopes to confirm their findings. But at the moment a companion moon is the most convincing explanation for the dip in the light and the change in the orbit, they said.Exomoons are so difficult to find because they are so small, and as a consequence the dip they cause in the light coming from the star is much weaker than a larger planet. Their orbits also shift as they move around their star, because they orbiting their planet.The new moon was probably found first because its larger size made it easier to see.Both of the planets are within the habitable zone, where they are close enough to their star to get heat and support life but not so close that it would be killed by the intensity. But both planets are gaseous and so are unlikely to support life.The gaseous nature of the planet also lead to questions about where its Moon might have come from. Our Moon, for instance, is thought to have been formed when an earlier collision shot off material that would go on to become the rock we see today, but that could not happen if the two objects are made up of gas.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

As a rule, they are so far away that they prove difficult to observe directly from Earth.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s most stunning pictures of space Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.130 Earth from the ISSFrom the International Space Station, Expedition 42 Flight Engineer Terry W.

But the entire episode remains completely mysterious, as both space agencies scramble to find out how the apparently drilled hole could have been made in the outside of the space station.Nasa has refused to announce any of the findings of those investigations so far. But it released the statement after reports in Russia that the hole had been drilled on purpose, since it was not a manufacturing defect.Russian media recently reported that General Director Rogozin said the hole was not a manufacturing defect. Ruling out a manufacturing defect indicates that this is an isolated issue which does not categorically affect future production, it wrote.This conclusion does not necessarily mean the hole was created intentionally or with mal-intent. NASA and Roscosmos are both investigating the incident to determine the cause. The International Space Station Program is tentatively planning a spacewalk in November to gather more information.Nasa\u0026nbspalso said that one of its astronauts as well as Russian Cosmonaut will be heading to the International Space Station in October. During that launch, Nasa\u0027s\u0026nbspAdministrator Jim Bridenstine will speak\u0026nbspwith Mr Rogozin, in their first in-person meeting, during which the leak will presumably be discussed.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

But its workers have not traditionally organised to demand better pay and conditions, making the current strike\u0026nbspsignificant, despite its small scale.Shadow chancellor John McDonnell backed the action and reiterated Labour\u0027s plan to give all workers a living wage of £10 an hour.\u0026nbspI am giving my support to the striking workers in Wetherspoons, TGI Fridays and McDonald\u0027s today, he said.These are workers that have been ignored by their employers and are simply asking for a wage they can live on and the same basic rights at work we should all be entitled to.Boni Adeliyi, a TGI Fridays waitress in Milton Keynes said: “We’re striking on 4 October to show the strength we have when workers come together. The movement is growing and change is coming. All young workers should join a union – it’s important to know your rights and how to fight for them when they’re being ignored. Together we are stronger.”\u0026nbspStriking McDonald’s worker Lauren McCourt said the industrial action could transform the sector for the better.“The days of poverty pay, insecure contracts and lack of respect for workers are numbered. A living wage of £10 an hour for all ages, security of hours, and our right to a union are the basic rights we are fighting for,” she said.\u0026nbspThe strikers plan to convene a rally in Leicester Square on the day of the industrial action. They say they will be joined by hospitality workers from across the UK as well as from four continents.A growing movement of low-paid workers, particularly in the fast-food industry, has come together over recent years, catalysed by the Fight for $15 campaign in the US.A McDonald’s spokesperson said the company was “disappointed” to hear about planned UK strikes and said the numbers of people involved represented an “extremely small proportion” of its 120,000 workforce.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Britain\u0027s Prime Minister Theresa May dances a few steps as she takes to the stage to give her keynote address on the fourth and final day of the Conservative Party Conference at the International Convention Centre in BirminghamBoris Johnson warned that Theresa May’s “cheat” Brexit plans would leave the UK in “manacles” and lead to the dominance of the far right and far left in British politics during his speech at a fringe event at the Conservative Party annual conference in BirminghamScottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson speaking at the Conservative Party annual conference at the International Convention Centre in BirminghamProtestors set off on an anti-Brexit march, organised by the \u0027Best For Britain\u0027 campaign group, in central Birmingham Royal Navy Commander, Nathan Gray lands his F-35B onboard HMS Queen Elizabeth for the first time.Headteachers from across England and Wales hold signs in Parliament Square, London, as they prepare to march on Downing Street to demand extra money for schoolsFormer leader of the English Defence League Tommy Robinson (C) arrives at the Old Bailey Courthouse in London, Britain, 27 September 2018.

In the year to date, car sales are 7.5 per cent behind where they were this time last year.The SMMT said the decline in September followed an “unusually high August and a turbulent first eight months of the year as the market responded to a raft of upheavals”\u0026nbspmainly changes to diesel policy after new emissions standards were introduced. UK car sales drop as manufacturers warn Brexit is hurting industryUK car sales drop as diesel demand plummets for 14th month in a rowUK car sales expected to drop for two years, warns motor industry bodyMike Hawes, SMMT chief executive, said: “With the industry given barely a year to reapprove the entire European model lineup, it’s no surprise that we’ve seen bottlenecks and a squeeze on supply. These are exceptional circumstances with similar declines seen in other major European markets. “The good news is that, as backlogs ease, consumers and businesses can look forward to a raft of exciting high-tech cars and a market keen to recover lost momentum.”Ian Plummer, Auto Trader director, said 2018 has been “very challenging for both retailers and manufacturers, with the fuel debate and Brexit anxieties denting consumer confidence, and inflationary pressure on exchange rates hitting profits”. However, he added: “Despite the many economic uncertainties, there is some positive news on the horizon for 2019 too. The plethora of new electric and hybrid vehicles that are on display at this week’s Paris Motor Show are not far from hitting forecourts, giving consumers some great new choices in this emerging fuel type which grew again last month.“What’s more, as more consumers move away from traditional ownership to usership models, the appetite for finance remains exceptionally strong.”However, Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said consumers were unlikely to begin buying cars in great numbers in the near future. “Finance costs likely will continue to rise gradually, while the recent rise in motor fuel prices might dissuade some first-time buyers. High levels of saving intentions also suggest that buyers will be cautious when considering major purchases. Accordingly, the chance of a substantial revival in car sales over the next six months remains slim,” he said.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The self-appointed “voices of British business”, iniably dominated by large corporate interests, push every day for more and more Brexit concessions.Yet as last week showed, Labour’s unreconstructed Marxism is a far more serious threat to future prosperity than any kind of Brexit.It’s time for big businesses to play their part in building a better Britain, rather than refighting a referendum which was as much a vote against them as the political establishment.Eeyore Hammond must encourage them to invest in Britain’s future.She survived last year’s election catastrophe only because Remainers feared a true Brexiteer such as Boris Johnson might replace her.Hammond has since deployed his Treasury reach to capitalise on her weakness and box us into BRINO — Brexit In Name Only. Mrs May is the willing captive of passionate Remainers in Downing Street, Whitehall, the Cabinet Office and, crucially, the all-powerful Treasury.Since the departure of close aide Nick Timothy, there is nobody within earshot who voted Brexit — including Mrs May. Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, like his predecessor David Davis, has virtually no say in negotiations.Hammond now calls the shots, backed by panic-stirring Business Secretary Greg Clark and Europhile Cabinet Office minister David Lidington.Brexiteers fear this Unholy Trinity is ready for more concessions over issues including migration, EU benefits and Britain’s vital financial services industry.Never forget, it was Hammond who blocked all spending and therefore all serious preparation for No Deal, a prospect now apparently facing this nation. In fact there was never a chance of No Deal.We will end up with a form of Chequers, but one even more pro-Brussels than the proposal which saw David Davis and BoJo storm out. Remainers are back in full Project Fear mode.European car firms are happily pouring billions into Britain — despite Brexit. Yet Greg Clark triggered last week’s chorus of fake alarm from Toyota, claiming its “just-in-time” supply chain would grind to a halt.This ignores the whole point of “just-in-time”. It is designed specically to cope with delivery glitches and operates worldwide in all circumstances under global trade rules.It was also Clark who handed Brussels its biggest anti-Brexit card by promising those shroud-waving car giants the UK would remain under EU rules. That led directly to Mrs May’s surrender over the Northern Ireland border, which has plagued negotiations ever since.It is a tragic fact — but no surprise — that we are now heading remorselessly for a deal on EU terms at our expense.EU leaders were never going to see us thrive outside. They insisted we will not be better off after Brexit.Anyone who hoped we might be set free to compete on equal terms should read ex-Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis’ story of his own country’s punishment beating.It was Varoufakis who compared Brexit with the Eagles’ hit: “It’s like Hotel Calornia — you can check out any time you like, but you can never leave.” And we can blame Phil Hammond for blocking the fire Brexits.But Ms Jourova, a Czech raised under Soviet rule, wants Corbyn-style “regulation” of the free Press.The apple never falls far from the tree.PS.

It was a quiet week, so I watched the first four episodes and, to my surprise and delight, I hated Press even more than I expected.The set-up’s the deal-breaker, of course. We’ve got a right-wing red-top called The Post, that’s very obviously meant to be The Sun, and a left-wing broadsheet The Herald, which is equally obviously , house Bible of the BBC.The former is edited by soul-selling clone Duncan Allen, played by the brilliant Ben Chaplin, who does actually resemble a couple of ex-colleagues.By rights then, the female lead should be The Herald’s editor, Amina Chaudury, played by Priyanga Burford.But she can’t act, so the responsibility’s fallen to Charlotte Riley as northern, working-class brick of Deputy News Editor Holly Evans, who fits the social profile of your averagewoman about as comfortably as Roy Chubby Brown fits a mankini.Next weird thing you probably notice about Press is that nearly all the characters are giving speeches, rather than talking normally to each other.Especially the insufferable broadsheet hacks, who never stop reminding each other “we speak the truth to the powerful”, and that “people buy The Herald for the truth”.Why do people buy The Post Sun It’s never really occurred to writer Mike “Doctor Foster” Bartlett, who clearly didn’t read our newspaper before he sat down to type Press, at his desk on the summit of Mount Olympus, and has probably never met a tabloid reader either, without telling them: “Keep the change.”How can I be so sure Because it’s got almost every single professional and technical aspect wrong, from Duncan’s insistence he’s going to do a spread “On page five and six” , to the week one headline The Post produced about the gay, blackmailed footballer who committed suicide: “Parents never knew their son.”Which is the sort of meaningless, esoteric b******s that would get thrown back at a student newspaper sub.That’s another unconvincing thing about Press, incidentally. No one swears. And I wouldn’t mind so muchthere were some decent stories to see us through, but there aren’t.There’s a Katie Hopkins figure floating around, a few cut-and-pasted bits of very old tabloid legendand some deep state conspiracy cobblers, which the BBC’s probably got written into Raa Raa The Noisy Lion these days.Duncan also has the vague hots for Holly, until such time as Ed off the newsdesk tells him she likes having it off in a grey vest.That’s about your lot, though.As always happens when British TV tries to dramatise the Press, the writer’s left-of-centre political agenda and prejudices trump everything .This is why Americans do it so much better, andyou want to see how newspapers really operate you’ll get a much better idea from Billy Wilder’s  film The Front Page than you ever will from Press.I’ll say this for the BBC production team though, they might not have much of an ear for newspaper dialogue, but they’ve got a hell of an eye for interior design and have duplicated one item of our office kitchen crockery perfectly.Mugs.“I don’t bend in the middle any more, to be honest.”Then just slap him around a bit.Improvise, woman.FURTHER proof,it were needed, there’s not a single television format that can’t be improved by the presence of one or two of the Happy Mondays arrived on Friday.A special BBC Music Day edition of Bargain Hunt, featuring Bez and Rowetta versus Pulp’s Jarvis Cocker and Candida Doyle, which will go down in daytime TV folklore.Attempting to keep them in some sort of order, at the Kent showground’s antique fair, was BH regular Charlie Ross, who didn’t get very far with his preliminary question: “How did it all start with the Happy Mondays, Bez ”“You really don’t want to know.”So you really couldn’t blame him for looking a bit nervous when he sent the pair of them away with £ in used notes.Half an hour later, though, Bez and Rowetta were back, with three items, including a biscuit tin and a to-die-for rustic, bygone horse collar mirror that’s yours for just  quid.It made them a respectable £ profit at auction, as well, and flattened Pulp’s efforts in the process.At which point things got a bit dark.Charlie noted “an irregularity”, the Mondays were hauled back on set, like guilty schoolkids, and the host was forced to explain that the winsome and very obliging woman at the back of the auction hall, who kept bidding for his items was in fact: “Bez’s girlfriend.”Not angry, Bez, just disappointed.IF you’ve never seen the brilliant Simpsons episode where Homer gives Pinchy, his pet lobster, a really hot bath, Google it as soon as you can.Then immediately after, watch Channel ’s darkly funny latest episode of Celebrity Island With Bear Grylls, where a pig wandered into camp, on Sunday night.Even more obligingly it then started fattening itself up on the celebs’ leftovers and inviting the obvious by crapping its load everywhere.While some sensed dinner, Towie’s Pete Wicks had a better idea.He named the pig Colin, took it for a walk and then tethered it with a rope to some rocks.Whereupon Colin, with the sort of demonic squeals and grunts you last heard on Deliverance, promptly strangled himself to death.Presented with this tragedy, you or I or Martin Kemp from Spandau Ballet, might’ve drawn the obvious conclusion and, like Homer Simpson, tucked in Not this lot.Instead Colin was buried at sea, with full military honours, to avoid “hurting Pete’s feelings”, floating off into the sunset like a warning to humanity.This MorningSemra Haksever: “I call myself an eclectic witch, so I take dferent little bits of magic from all over the place.So it’s all b******sOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In contrast, the over-s are positively chipper: Only  per cent of this group reported feelings of isolation.Now, I’m  and, depressingly, these statistics don’t surprise me.At first glance, it looks like young people have it easy when it comes to making friends.At  or thereabouts, more than  per cent of them will be packed off to university where they’ll move in with a group of like-minded people of the same age and be encouraged to drink and party like there’s no tomorrow.Which, when you’re only required to stumble out of bed for one pm lecture, there essentially isn’t.Rather than relying on friends of tenuous friends for dubious introductions, young people these days can simply download an app and get the details of thousands of eligible strangers delivered straight to their mobile phones.Add into the mix social media ­— which allows its users to connect with everyone they’ve ever met instantaneously at any given moment — and it’s hard to imagine how any young people could possibly be lonely, let alone  per cent.But there are two sides to every coin.University — though a godsend when it comes to meeting new people — can be a problem when it comes to staying in touch with them. Saddled with bottomless debt, young graduates simply don’t have the cash to socialise.When a round for six at a London pub will set you back  quid, is it any wonder that more and more young people are opting to stay at home Dating apps, too, come with their pitfalls. Yes, it’s nice to have a database of singletons in your pocket, but the ubiquity of Tinder and Bumble mean it’s now considered almost socially awkward to speak to someone you fancy in person.A friend of mine, who has absolutely no problem propositioning women on Tinder, hasn’t yet found the courage to ask for his next-door neighbour’s number, four months after she moved in.As for social media, young people like me are increasingly discovering that “staying connected” is a mixed blessing at best. With no excuse to lose touch, my generation holds on to friends we’ve outgrown, leaving us with no time to make new ones. It may sound callous, but there’s an art to shedding friends, and thanks to our social media addiction, we seem to have lost it.What’s more, earnest  to -year-olds seem to be taking to heart the faddish health advice that adults have been merrily ignoring for years, making it even harder for them to socialise because they fear alcohol, and even food.At the end of a recent party I got chatting to a fun young woman, so I suggested some pub grub at a boozer to round off the evening. How wrong I was.She explained in detail she was vegan and on a gluten-free diet , so the pub menu would not cater for her needs.I decided not to pursue it.So I say it’s time snowflake millennials took a bit of responsibility for their own feelings of isolation.Last month commentators wagged their fingers at the big tech companies after a survey by charity YoungMinds revealed a greater number of young people view social media as having a negative impact on the way they feel about themselves than those who report a positive impact.But it was never suggested depressed young people should simply put away their phones and do something .Mollycoddled millennials believe having a thriving social circle is a human right, rather than an ongoing project.Instead of popping to the pub for a pick-me-up with whoever happens to be around, a lonely young person will all too often turn to the internet for a spot of indulgent self-reflection, or to the gym for Insta-friendly self-improvement.As a result, pubs are closing at a rate of  a day, and sites such as Tumblr are overflowing with posters instructing users to “forget the haters” and “shine like the star that you are”.Of course, social media is made to be addictive. But surely putting down a phone can’t be an insurmountable challenge for an educated generation of young people  Dwelling on yourself is the surest route to a lonely lestyle, so instead of posting doleful, introspective memes on social media or clinging to tired old friendships, lonely young people should find the guts to get outside and look outwards.Making and keeping real friends takes work, and it’s time young people started putting the hours in.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She’s about as charismatic as an underdone crumpet on a wet Sunday. But she doesn’t need to be Ginger Rogers. She’s the Prime Minister.And you have to give her credit for doggedly sticking to that role. EvenI’m not convinced she’s been doing it terribly well.But on Brexit — God, how mind-numbingly boring the whole thing is — she has a good point.I’m not a fan of her Chequers deal for us to leave the European Union. I think we’re giving too much away. I’d rather have a no-deal exit.But time is pressing. And I’m aware that while we Leavers won the referendum, the margin was comparatively small. So we ought to be gracious and accept a little bit of a compromise. Try to strike a respectable deal with those gangsters from insignicant countries.And a little further down the line, tweak the arrangements a little to suit us better. In the meantime, just strike the deal.And that means getting behind May and presenting a united front to Europe. Most of the Conservative MPs understand that, even the arch-Brexiteers like the excellent Michael Gove.But Bfo the Blundering Bear does not. I’m talking about Boris Johnson. Now he IS fun and good company. But he’s about as likely to become Prime Minister as I am to cop off with Emily Ratajkowski after a few pints and a quick meal at the Chicken Cottage.He has very little support among his political colleagues. He has a lot more among Conservative activists. But very little among voters north of Watford.And yet Bfo was at it again this week. Taking the p**s out of the Prime Minister. And making a rousing speech to his hardcore supporters. Demanding we tell the EU to stuff it.Well, there was a time when we should have told the EU to stuff it — two years ago when we first started negotiations.That time has passed. A lack of confidence from the Government and a ided party let us down.Now is the time to show a bit of unity and wring a deal out of the deathly bureaucrats. Maybe not the Chequers deal — May didn’t mention the word at all during her speech — but a version of it.Otherwise we’ll have a General Election on our hands. One the Tories will lose.

And the same goes for all those hyped-up talent shows where people with no talent – just a lust for fame – get judged on their appalling performances by people with no talent.Kids need to know the dference between fame for fame’s sake – and real achievement.Its horrible that Corine Remande has lost the sight in one eye after she was hit by a golf ball during the Ryder Cup.The poor woman was standing among spectators when Brooks Koepka’s tee shot hit her in the face.She’s now threatening legal action against the organisers.

It falls to our party to lead our country through it.”Top of Mrs May’s list of fresh ­policy offers was a major move to get thousands more frustrated families on the housing ladder.She announced the Government is to scrap a long-standing cap on how much councils can borrow against their current housing stock to build more homes.There are .million households on the waiting list, but only , homes were made available in .Explaining the change in thinking, Mrs May said: “We cannot make the case for capitalismordinary working people have no chance of owning capital.Solving the housing crisis is the biggest domestic policy challenge of our generation.“It doesn’t make sense to stop councils from playing their part in solving it.”The state will also spend more from next year while still keeping the nation’s finances under control, the PM pledged.In answer to pleas for more cash to ease the pressure on Britain’s crowded schools, stretched hospitals and creaking defences, she promised that “support for public services will go up”.Mrs May added: “Because you made sacrices, there are better days ahead.“A decade after the financial crash, people need to know that the austerity it led to is over and that their hard work has paid off.”Issuing her final plea for unity, the PM ended her address with the declaration: “When we come together, there is no limit to what we can achieve.”Her speech brought a long standing ovation from the audience in Birmingham — appearing to have won over sceptical Tory activists for now.Only minutes before Mrs May began her address yesterday lunchtime, one angry Brexiteer MP issued a withering demand that she resign.Ex-minister James Duddridge wrote to the backbench Tory  Committee to call for a no confidence vote in the PM.Branding her incapable of leadership, he said: “Blind loyalty is not the right way forward.”And hours later, Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom refused to back Mrs May to lead the Tories into the next general election.She told ITV’s Peston show: “I just think politics is a short-term game. A week changes a lot.”But loyalist Cabinet ministers were delighted with her performance.Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab hailed it a “speech laden with leadership”.Torbjörn Sohlström — ambassador for Abba’s homeland of Sweden — was among those to see Mrs May’s attention-grabbing entry to the hall. He tweeted: “I can only say ‘bravo’.”The PM’s robotic dancing became a worldwide phenomenon in August when TV images of her trying to join in with children in Africa went viral.However, councils and campaigners were more impressed with the scrapping of the borrowing cap and the fresh trust ministers were placing on local authorities.Homeless charity Shelter’s boss Polly Neate called it “a major reform that shows real intent to back social house-building”.. Theresa May has a good sense of humour. She stunned Tories by entering the stage dancing to Abba’s Dancing Queen and making gags at her own expense, including a risque nod to steamy BBC drama Bodyguard.. She really cant stand Boris. The PM couldn’t even bring herself to use his name when she swiped out at him over reports he said “f*** business” in response to their Brexit concerns.. Her Chequers Brexit proposal is so toxic she couldnt say the word once in her -minute speech. She also name-checked the NHS more than Brexit -  times to .. She made it clear who wears trousers between her and Downing Street neighbour Philip Hammond, pinching his two big Budget announcements on fuel duty and a house building splurge, plus beating the Chancellor to it to declare an end to austerity.. Mrs May has no intention of standing down soon despite the Cabinet jockeying for her job by trying to renew her domestic vision so it lasts long after Brexit. But Lib Dem Sir Vince Cable, who appeared on a Strictly special in , said: “As somebody who takes dancing seriously, I was delighted to see Theresa May show that she is developing her new hobby.“But she was dancing on the head of a pin, confronted by an audience full of people plotting to oust her.”Labour’s Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell dubbed her claim that austerity is over as “a con”.ligtGOT a story  Ring The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or email exclusive@the-sun.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is dirty and unhygienic — a report out this week said it is a breeding ground for bugs.There is even a version of Monopoly with debit cards instead of notes. And last month we told you of the  century The Boot pub in Freston, Suffolk, the first boozer in the country to go cashless.This looming death has been around for a while. In August, the Bank of England said it was considering phasing out p and p coins. And ATMs are closing at a rate of  a month.Just  per cent of payments are cash, down from  per cent in . And those payments only account for three per cent in terms of the value of how much is spent.Paying on card has been on the rise ever since Barclaycard launched in , but cards too face being eclipsed by payments on mobile phones. Either way, both mean we need cash less. And that is not a bad thing, right Getting rid of cash would hit criminals and tax evaders hard as they do business in cash to make it harder for authorities to track the movement of money.Businesses would rejoice because they would not have to pay security guards to transport money and would not have to spend ages counting and bagging it.Some also reckon it is easier to keep a tab on finances when spending on cards or apps. You might forget buying that extra round at closing time in the pub, but your phone will always remember. And of course, you get consumer protection when using a credit card, along with reward points or cashback offers.Credit card firms make their money not just from interest payments but from taking a small fee for each transaction — so they offer us incentives to choose their cards. Use an Air Miles card and before long you could have a free flight to Paris or New York.More than a quarter of clothes in the UK are bought online — and you can’t use cash over the internet. As we move even more to buying online and via smartphone apps, cash will be needed less and less. Whether cash dies out in five years or  or  just depends on technology.But many are in no rush to see the back of it — and not just because of nostalgia for their old piggy banks. One consideration is: Can we entirely trust the banks to look after our money  Fraud is soaring as criminals take advantage of security issues around online banking. Banks blame customers but critics say banks need to take responsibility.We have featured victim after victim on The Sun Money columns, and they all say bank staff have turned their backs on them. There are millions of others who need cash simply because they rely on it to pay for things day to day. And it is the less well off or elderly who rely on it the most.Consumer magazine Which  — which has been campaigning against the loss of banks and ATMs — has produced research showing poorer families and older folk are hardest hit.Gareth Shaw of Which  said: “ATM and branch closures are threatening to leave behind the millions who still rely on cash. Our research highlights lower-income families and older generations will be among the worst hit.”In June, services from Visa, one of the three main card providers along with Mastercard and American Express, went down with technical issues — highlighting the risk of being solely reliable on cards and phones. “When the trolley came around on the train and the card payment wasn’t working, the only people who could eat were those with cash,” one banker explained.And what about hospitality workers  The Government has said all tips, evenon cards, must go to staff — but we all know some unscrupulous bosses will not do that. Like many, I prefer to give my tips in cash so I know the waiter or waitress gets it all.Charity collectors often have card machines now but collections for most churches, schools and small local good causes still rely on tins and the rattle of coins.Cash may well be dying out, but I still make sure I always keep some coins in my pocket just in case. And I have older relatives who still feel most comfortable with coins and notes.So until we have a population where everyone feels happy when using a card or phone, I will be rooting against a completely cashless Britain.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The venom is not particularly potent.“The schools are being treated and fumigated and we are working with the schools to ensure that children can continue to receive an education whilst their school is closed.Pupils are being set work via the schools and will remain in contact with schools.“We are asking all our schools and nurseries to proactively check their premises carefully for these spiders andthey see any signs, then contact environmental health or pest control.”False widow spiders are distinctive for their shiny, black flesh, bulbous bodies, thick legs and skull-like patterns.Millions of  widows, Britains most venomous spider, have been found across the UK and the population is believed to be growing.The species has a brown bulbous abdomen with cream markings that look like a skull. They have long legs and can reach about mm in size.Also known as steatoda nobilis, the spider is frequently confused for the black widow, which has deadly venom."},{"url":null,"title":"moment 30000 litres of prosecco bursts from tank after an explosion at italian winery","story":"Prosecco lovers around the world wished they could have raised a glass – or even a bucket – to help scoop up the bubbly waterfall.The pressurised tank exploded in Conegliano, Veneto, in the province of Treviso, with video footage of the wasted wine posted on Facebook by the Lenoteca Zanardo Giussano winery.But instead of being popping mad, the Prosecco producers simply confessed there was “too much must in the silos”.Must is freshly crushed wine juice that contains the skins, sees and stems of grapes, which is used for fermentation.Seeing the popular Italian sparkling wine cascading onto the floor was too much for some Prosecco fans, with one posting that people should “observe a minute of silence” while others described it as a “tragedy” and a “waste”.More than million people have watched video footage of the , litres of booze overflowing after Zanardo Guissano posted the dramatic event on its Facebook page.Among them was Shane McLeod Brennan, who said: “I would grab as many containers, bottles, bags, cups and the report would be ‘Shane died doing what he loved the most’ attempting to drink a , litre bottle of wine.”Upset Prosecco fan Marco Cerizzi said: “Noooooo.

The desperate PM jigged on stage to Abbas Dancing Queen as she admitted for the first time that the Tory civil war over Brexit is harming her ability to get a good deal. Introduced by booming-voiced Tory Geoffrey Cox, she poked fun at Brexiteer Boris Johnson, heaped praise on business and free markets and fearfully attacked Jeremy Corbyn as he inches microscopically closer to power. But with all the over-the-top theatrics in Birmingham, you may have missed some big new policies - that will directly affect your le.  Promising to finally bring an end to eight years of savage Tory cuts, the Prime Minister pledged a poundbillion housing boost and a poundmillion fuel duty freeze. There was also a poignant tale of her goddaughter behind introducing a new cancer screening regime. Here are the things you actually NEED to know from todays big event.  Theresa May announced the first details of a new cancer strategy after poignantly revealing her goddaughter died of the disease. She pledged that by , , more people will be alive five years after diagnosis than today. The age for full bowel cancer screening will drop from  to  in a bid to raise the early detection rate, currently around %, to around % by . Currently a one-off screening is available from age  but screening every two years is only available from age . The NHS will invest in new scanners and build more Rapid Diagnostic Centres – one stop-shops that help people get treatment quicker.  Theresa May’s spokesman said more details of her cancer strategy - including how much it will cost - will only be revealed by the end of the year, when the NHS’s future plan is published. My goddaughter was diagnosed with cancer, she revealed. It came back and last summer sent me a text saying she was hoping to see another Christmas. “But she didn’t make it.” No further details of Mrs Mays goddaughter, including her age or name, have been released, on request of her family. . Fuel duty is frozen for the th time - while other groups suffer  The Tory government will freeze fuel duty for the ninth year in a row, in a move that will cost taxpayerspoundmillion. Scrapping the planned p-a-litre rise will be in the Budget in four weeks time. This is the very first policy from that Budget that weve had confirmed. It will benefit hard-pressed motorists. But it comes as other groups continue to struggle - with working-age benefits still frozen for four years to . Tory officials suggest the average motorist has gained about pound, in total from all the freezes since . Now compare that to the utterly astronomical cost.  The Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates the cumulative effect of all those freezes is now costing the Treasury poundbillion a year. Thats more than the affordable housing budget and more than DOUBLE the amount gained by the government by freezing millions of peoples benefits. Greenpeace campaigner Morten Thaysen said: Instead of subsidising diesel and petrol May should be incentivising the take up of cleaner electric vehicles, and ensuring cheap and reliable public transport for all.  The borrowing cap imposed on local councils will be scrapped completely in a move that is expected to raise an extra poundbillion a year for housebuilding. It is a victory for councils after they spent years calling for the move, only to be rebuffed by the Tory government. But it wasnt immediately clear today whether the changes will have to be approved in Parliament.  Housing groups gave a cautious welcome. Chartered Institute of Housing director Gavin Smart said: “This is excellent news and we look forward to seeing the detail. The Federation of Master Builders branded the decision a victory for common sense. Ruth Davison of the National Housing Federation said: For years, everyone who builds affordable homes – both councils and housing associations – have argued this cap on council borrowing puts the brakes on building more homes. . Foreign home buyers will face a new tax  Mrs May revealed plans to slap an extra tax on foreign buyers of UK homes - and pour the proceeds into the governments rough sleeping strategy. A consultation will be launched on putting an extra rate of stamp duty on those who buy a home in the UK, but do not pay tax here. Tory chiefs said a higher % charge was already added to second and buy-to-let homes worth between pound, and pound.million. The new rate has not yet been set. But it would supposedly help youyoure trying to buy a home by wiping out unfair, foreign competition. . Austerity is over - but with a huge catch  The Prime Minister declared austerity is over after eight gruelling years. This isnt a concrete policy but,she keeps her word, itd have a huge impact on your family. The Prime Minister vowed to invest in public services and renew the NHS in her address to the faithful in Birmingham - despite benefits remaining frozen and cuts hitting Universal Credit. But there was a catch. She phrased her speech to say austerity will end AFTER she gets a good Brexit deal. That leaves open the suggestion thatshe DOESNT get a Brexit deal, austerity could simply power on. She said: When we’ve secured a good Brexit deal for Britain, at the Spending Review next year we will set out our approach for the future.

Tory austerity was an ideological choice by the Conservatives and communities were kept behind, not left behind, during the past eight grim years. And how dishonest of the Prime Minister to pretend the financial fatwas over when benefit cuts alone, including the imposition of Universal Credit, will make poorer lower paid workers in and out of jobs.  Equally the condemnation of horric abuse suffered by Labours Diane Abbott, the countrys first Black woman MP, sounded decent and smart except the Tory Party deliberately target the Shadow Home Secretary.  Where was the apology for Mays racist “Go Home” vans whipping up bigotry  We didnt hear one. Where was the apology for Mays role in the Windrush scandal  We didnt hear one. She and the Tories are clearly spooked by Jeremy Corbyn capturing the zeitgeist for change, people yearning for hope and greater power over their lives. Delivering a better speech than last year was a low bar after the coughing, P and falling letters.  It was about hanging onto her job after Boris Johnsons treachery yet it was noticeable she avoided the C-word: Chequers.

Workers at two pubs in Brighton will walk out on Thursday to demand a pound an hour wage - joining staff at a small number of McDonalds and TGI Fridays branches. While a number of Uber Eats and Deliveroo couriers are also striking. The Bakers, Food and Allied Workers Unionarranged the joint strike to call out what they call pay injustices. But multimillionaire JD Wetherspoon chairman Tim Martin stopped short of agreeing their demands when the Mirror caught up with him - at a Tory conference debate on making work pay. Instead he said: Weve got , employees and  are going on strike.  They obviously feel very strongly about this and its important for us to look into the issues which are being raised, which were happy to do. Whether its right to use that type of gunboat diplomacy is another matter. It came despite Mr Martin using the event to launch an impassioned defence of his workers, saying they shouldnt be labelled low skilled and he would love to see a barrister try and survive in his kitchens. Mr Martin, who is worth poundmillion, earns a pound, salary and has million Wetherspoons shares, also laid into some pretty dire directors out there earning tremendous amounts of money which seems to lack social justice. But askedhis workers should get pound an hour, he told the Mirror it was a complex question because Wetherspoons also pays its workers bonuses.  He added: What I think should be taken into account is the amount we pay in bonuses which – a lot of companies which have eliminated bonuses and other benefits and have then increased the rate per hour. So we could certainly do that and get to the level that is being suggested. But I think the scheme weve got with ious benefits were talking about is better. Mr Martin appeared to suggest the firm could have to shut pubshe gave a widespread pay rise. Obviously people know thatyou put in a wage thats too high, there are already a lot of pubs and restaurants closing every week, he said. And you mayyou get it wrong cause more to close.Askedhe was confident the action would not spread he said: Running a business you cannot be confident about anything really, your number one point is to listen in a fair way. Whether this is the correct way to ask us to listen is the big debate.  Tory Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey shared a  with Mr Martin at the event.She hailed Wetherspoons and backed the government working with the pub brand. She said: The next step is working more with businesses, about how do we multiply and have many more Wetherspoons within that sector.If its a great idea, why dont you model it, copy it, format it, see what it does, and increase that  Pro-Jeremy Corbyn group Momentum is urging members to picket outside McDonalds stores including in Newcastle and London as part of the fast food shutdown. Navendu Mishra, Momentum spokesperson, said: “Fast food workers are amongst the lowest paid of any industry. Their contracts are often precarious, and many face disgraceful working conditions.The firms involved in the strike all already pay at least the legal minimum. But activists say a pound wage would give workers a fairer quality of le.John McDonnell, Labour’s Shadow Chancellor, said: These are workers that have been ignored by their employers and are simply asking for a wage they can live on and the same basic rights at work we should all be entitled to."},{"url":null,"title":"dad 47 plans marry girlfriend","story":"NewsDad, , plans to marry girlfriend despite -YEAR age gap and his daughters disowning himBruce Nelson, , from Wisconsin, USA, plans to wed -year-old nursing student Marissa Almanza despite his daughters objectionsShareCommentsByElaine McCahillRebecca Drew:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT NewsBruce Nelson, , from Wisconsin, USA, plans to wed -year-old nursing student Marissa Almanza despite their -year age gap \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA dad, , plans to marry his girlfriend despite their -year age gap and his daughters disowning him over the union. Bruce Nelson, , met manufacturing operator and nursing student Marissa Almanza, , from Wisconsin, USA, at work almost five years ago. Neither of them was looking for a relationship at the time and say that it wasnt love at first sight when they met. But they soon became each others favourite co-worker and made plans to take their dogs for walks, go fishing, and on food dates outside of work. Marissa was first attracted to Bruces smile and laugh, whilst he was first attracted to her passion for le and honesty.  Since falling in love, the pair havent let their -year age gap come between them and are planning to tie the knot next year. Marissas mum and dad were unsure about their daughters choice of partner at first but after seeing how well Bruce looked after her, they warmed to their relationship. The majority of Bruces family have welcomed Marissa with open arms but his three daughters from his previous marriage, aged ,  and , have chosen not to be in his le since the couple started dating four-and-a-half-years-ago.  For Marissa and Bruce, their relationship is the same as any other other without an age gap, with neither of them prepared to turn off their feelings based on someone s opinion. We met at work, he was my co-worker and I loved that he was always so kind, understanding, and had such a positive attitude, said Marissa. He quickly became my favourite co-worker and we started making plans to spend time outside of work taking the dogs for a walk, fishing, boating, and food dates here and there. Upon first meeting, we did not have the love at first sight thing because we were at work and we both werent looking for a relationship at the time.  I love his smile and his laugh, its still my favourite thing today and his beautul blue eyes. Bruce says that he was first amazed by my beautul smile and he loved my passion for le and animals. What got him was my ability to be honest in any situation and it truly blew him away even when I was in the wrong. At first my mum and dad were judgemental about it, for like a week, but they saw how happy he truly made me and how he treated me and how playful and lovey we are so they quickly changed their minds. My whole family has never been rude or judgemental to him or us, which I am so thankful for.  Bruces mum, step dad, dad, and step mum and his cousin have all been wonderful to me and open armed. The relationship was a bit rocky with his brother, but weve noticed they are finally coming around slowly but surely. Sadly, Bruces three daughters from his previous marriage choose not to be in his le at all since they found out he was dating me. Busy planning their wedding, the couple arent sure about children just yet as Marissa wants to finish her nursing training but is aware that Bruce isnt getting any younger. Finally, Marissa hit back at people who dont understand her relationship and laughs off strangers who mistake them for father and daughter.  We actually just picked our wedding day and plan to get hitched next year, she said. Kids Im still on the fence about, I feel Im not ready for kids now, I want my degree and have a nice savings built, but Bruce isnt going to get any younger. So, Im not sure whats going to happen with kiddos, she said. To those who dont understand the relationship, this answer changes with what they have an issue with. If someone is weirded out by the age gap I just tell them Im an old soul and Bruce is a young soul. I dont feel an age gap, I only see it. Im not a gold digger by any means, I dont have daddy issues, and the relationship is not strictly intimate or anything of that sort.

The chef says when he finds a bare patch of skin in the shower, he gets it covered as soon as possible - and he wants to get his genitals tattooed. But he admits that his face tattoos - which he started getting done in  - have left him open to ridicule and he often hears people say “look at the state of his face”.  However Chris, from Bangor, Co Down in Northern Ireland, doesn’t regret any of his artwork - in fact he’s booked in for another six hour session next week. He wants to get every inch of himself covered in tattoos including his eyeballs, the soles of his feet and his even his penis. It comes despite his eyelids swelling up so much when he got them tattooed that he was ‘blind’ for three days. Chris said: “I’ve always wanted to be covered in tattoos.” “I never considered how other people would perceive me. I’m fascinated with the pain of tattoos and the dferent levels of pain.  “For example I got my eyelids tattooed - and I was blind for three days. People are so blatant about [criticising me]. “I walk down the street now and they don’t even wait for me to walk past, they’ll just openly say ‘look at the state of his face’. “The impression was,you had tattoos it was gang-related. Especially in Northern Ireland where gangs are associated with terrible violence. “Just because I’m covered head to toe in tattoos it doesn’t mean I’m in any way a violent person. “Sometimes people will come up and speak to me - by the time we’ve finished they’ll say ‘I was completely wrong about you.”  Chris says he has had  hours of tattooing on his face alone,  hours on each arm and an excruciating  hours on his left leg. His first tattoo was tribal skull design but the ‘turning point’ was when he had a skull inked across his face. “Once you go to the face it does completely change the way you look,” he said. “But I still feel the same as I did before I had it done. I forget I have the tattoos on my face. I’m the same person inside.” Chris said he never expected his tattoos would make him such a target for judgement. “It never even crossed my mind,” he said.  “I didn’t think about how people would react. If I’d sat down and thought about it I might have done it dferently. “It was what I wanted to do, I just didn’t think about what other people thought.” However Chris doesn’t regret any of his artwork - in fact he’s booked in for another six hour session next week. He says the most painful of all his tattoos was his eyelids, in after which he was blind for three days. “I drove to get them done,” Chris explained. “I got out of the tattoo shop and I was completely blind. I walked into a lamp post on the way home. I couldn’t find my way to the car. I was stranded in Belfast for four hours until my partner came to get me. “It was scary being blind, putting frozen cucumbers and ice packs on my eyes.”  Despite the ordeal Chris says he wants to get his eyelids tattooed again. “I enjoy the pain,” he explained. He said that he finds peace when he’s under the needle. “My daughter has had health problems. At the time getting tattoos was almost a coping mechanism,” he said. “She was going through such pain in hospital. I’d go into the tattoo shop and say, ‘what’s the most painful place to get tattooed ’ and they’d say the face so I’d say, ‘give me that then’. “It sounds silly but I felt like I was taking a bit of pain away from her because I was inflicting it on myself.” “Its not self harm. I love it - it’s art and when she gets better I’ll go on getting tattoos.”  The only thing that could ever stop Chris’ tattoo habit is love for the kids. “As the kids grow up,my tattoos ever affect their le I’ll get them all laser removed. It’s something I wanted to do for myself butthey didn’t like me doing it I would go to the extreme of getting every single tattoo removed.” But that doesn’t seem likely, Chris says his two-year-old daughter likes to colour-in his few remaining bare patches of skin with felt-tip pens. “Jamie, he’s seven - he was four when I started getting tattoos - he’d love seeing my new tattoos.

Paulie Pittman needed le-saving treatment from paramedics after suffering an allergic reaction to the stings. The first time the three-year-old was stung he was playing outside his house in Brierfield, West Lancashire. His mum, Asher, had tried to fight the allergic reaction with an Epinephrine Injector but couldnt make it work, reports Liverpool Echo. Instead, an ambulance was called, by which time, Asher said, the shock was so severe that Paulie had to be lted upside down as the medics searched for a vein to inject. He was then taken to hospital for further monitoring.  Afterwards, she feared the problem was so bad she made him sleep in her bed as she couldn’t risk him being stung while asleep. She said: “It was terrying. It only takes four minutes for the sting to kill him. The source of the wasps was traced to a nest in ivy on the side of the young family’s council-owned house. But when Asher called the council she was told that no-one would be able to visit the property for three weeks – and West Lancs Borough Council would charge pound for the call-out alone. Asher, who has lived in Skelmersdale her whole le, said that, as a single mother, she could not afford to pay. She criticised the local authority’s response as “disgusting” and said she had to borrow money from her ex-partner to pay a private contractor to safely remove the nest on Monday.  When the nest was removed, she and Paulie were trapped in her bedroom as several wasps had once again entered the house. She said: “I’m livid. They put my son’s le at risk. If I hadn’t found a contractor to come that day, he could have died. “My dad had to come round with a spray to kill insects just so we could escape the house. He’s my baby and the council wouldn’t help him, it’s disgusting.” Paulie was also unable to start nursery at Bishop Martin for three weeks as all staff had to be trained on how to give an Epipen injection in the event of an allergic reaction.

Former beauty therapist Magdalena Honour, , had been blooming in the days before her daughter was born but after the birth she mistakenly believed she could not cope when breastfeeding her, it was told. The inquest also heard from her mother who revealed she was concerned she would be taken from hershe accepted treatment.Magdalena was prescribed antidepressant medication for so-called baby blues but it was claimed healthcare professionals were either dismissive or regarded her a nuisance and she began to self harm .Last February , just seven weeks after the child was born, Magdalena was found hanged in the bathroom of her home in Bredbury, near Stockport, Greater Manchester by her mother-in-law who assumed she had been taking a shower.  At the time Magdalenas husband Tom, also , who runs a powder coating company was officiating as best man at a friends wedding. At an inquest which Mr Honour was too upset to attend, his mother Louise criticised the care her daughter-in-law received. Polish born Magdalena had met her husband through friends in  and married six years later. Her mother-in-law told the Stockport hearing: She was an extremely positive, warm and generous person who loved to travel and was very family orientated, and loved her family. She was my daughter-in-law and my best friend. She and Tom were so much in love and very close, and both worked very hard to get their first house together. She just really loved le and really wanted to have a baby and was over the moon when she became pregnant.  She had a wonderful time during her pregnancy and really looked forward to having the baby. She had lots of family and friends around her and was a very active person with lots of energy. On the Friday before the baby was born we had been out for a meal and she said she could stay pregnant forever because she felt so well - she was blooming. On th January her daughter was born and there were no physical problems with the pregnancy and they were allowed back home the next day. For the first couple of days Magdalena was just tired due to having a new baby - but she got more anxious and hyper vigilant. She wanted reassurance and she wasn’t sleeping very well. We tried to get her to have a rest but she felt she had to be watching the baby all the time. Initially she was breastfeeding and thought she was feeding for too long or not enough. She felt that she wasn’t doing it right. She would be sitting up right and couldn’t relax. She had a look of worry on her face at all times. She did take advice about breastfeeding but when she felt she couldn’t go out for Toms birthday, that rang alarm bells and she became more dependent on me to be there at the house. She stopped communicating with friends and family in Poland and it was out of character for her.  A health visitor did a depression screening with her which lead to a GP visit and she was given a prescription. She wasn’t keen on taking it but I encouraged her to and made no change in her condition. She thought she wasn’t able to care for her baby and wanted to go back to Poland so her sister and friends could help her. She became persistent about getting a passport for the baby and she needed encouragement to eat and drink. One time when I got to the house she was stood at the top of the stairs and the baby was asleep. She said I have been stood here for ages because I dont know what to do and I knew her decision making had become impaired. I phoned the GP on th February and tried to get an appointment but they said there wasn’t any.  They said they had a prescription ready for her so I picked it up for her, but they were antibiotics. I voiced my concerns about her deteriorating mental state and seemed like a psychosis. They give her some tablets to sleep as she was absolutely exhausted. The GP said get her to see me sooner but he was dismissive of my concerns. I wasn’t listened to. The inquest heard on February  Magdalena cut her wrist and was referred to a RAID mental health team who referred her to a psychiatrist over fears for her wellbeing but embarked on a course of home treatment. Mrs Honour added:  I think she had lost insight into how she was. Her beliefs became very fixed, about being able to look after her daughter. She was concerned she would be taken from her and me and Tom would be in trouble. A health visitor did come after she cut her wrist but came only once that week - it was grossly inadequate. She telephoned them in a very distressed state, she said she was underfeeding and over feeding the baby. She was very frustrated and that she wasn’t being listened too. The heath visitor was trying to get her off the phone like she was a nuisance. She was unable to relax at all - she looked tormented.  Her beliefs were getting very fixed over a delusional matter and she wasn’t making sense. We talked about bottle feeding and she had to stop breastfeeding due to medication. She was very worried about things being contaminated. She started to talk about that she wasn’t sleeping but she was. Magdalena was given diazepam and tablets to help her sleep but the tragedy occurred the morning after she declined to attend a family friends wedding where Mr Honour was officiating as best man. Mrs Honour agreed to stay over with her daughter-in-law and added: I told her that there’s no way we could have managed without her and we have got a beautul little girl. Her sister in law was coming from Poland on the Tuesday and we would get her through this. I had sent a text on the previous Thursday and it was like the old her was back. The text said she was sorry for being a pain and she loved me. I told her everything would be okay. To me it was more than low mood and depression and anxiety.  On Friday everything I purposely tried not to take over the care of the baby, I let her do it. I wanted to show her that he ability to take care of her was good. But she couldn’t recognise that she was caring for her so well. She didn’t want to be admitted for hospital. It fit into her belief that she thought their daughter would be taken away. She didn’t want them to come every day. She found it very dficult and didn’t engage with them. The hearing was told Magdalena was found dead after her mother in law became concerned about theof time she was in the bathroom and used a p piece to open the lock from the outside. GP Robert Beardsell told the hearing: Magdalena was very anxious about the baby and kept checking she was breathing. I would agree she was in a hyper vigilant state. Her sleeping was very poor but at the time I had no concerns over her harming herself. She was suffering with post partum depression with anxiety known as baby blues but I was concerned enough that she needed treatment. I gave her medication to help but she didn’t want to take it because of the breastfeeding. On February th I was requested to ring Mrs Honour back which I did but there is an issue of confidentiality when talking to family members of patients. That’s when I called back to see what she wanted to share.  She told of her anxiety and the lack of sleep but there was no information about suicidal thoughts. I believe I did listen. The bond is important from breast feeding so I felt it was important for her to continue. I didn’t get a strong sense that she was suffering with psychosis or illusions. Health visitor Hazel Wilson said: Magdalena was caring towards the baby and happy and the baby was responding to her well and gazing at her. She said the baby was unsettled at night and not wanting to be put down in the Moses basket but there were concerns she wasn’t coping. Post natal depression affects about -% of new mothers. By February  she was struggling with the baby as she was unsettled. She was quite anxious about putting her down and reluctant to ask for help. I was telling her that she was doing really well and was showing her how she was doing well. There were no concerns from me about weight gain or feeding but she needed more support to settle the baby and needed reassurance about her ability with the baby, and suffering with depression and anxiety. I invited her to a baby clinic and breast feeding group. It was to reassure her that she was caring for the baby effectively. I was concerned that she was suffering with post natal depression but the training I have in mental health is not what the home service can offer.

But her housing association has seen its attempts to evict her fall on deaf ears after both a county court and high court judge ruled in her favour.Curo first tried to evict the mum last year but were told by a county court judge that the problems were mainly because the building they both lived in had a serious problem with sound insulation. The housing association appealed and took the matter to the High Court in London insisting the mum of two small children should be evited.But High Court judge Mr Justice Birss agreed with the county court judge in Bristol and said while Ms Walker admitted most of the noise was coming from her flat in Keynsham, she shouldn’t be evicted, reports Bristol Live The High Court heard that Ms Walker’s downstairs neighbour Jamal Azami was driven mad from the noise from Ms Walker’s flat upstairs, but the judge decided he was mistaken in thinking the noise was directed at him and his family. Many of the complaints against Ms Walker related to banging on floors, which the young mum put down to the noise of her ‘very active’ two small children. At the county court in March last year, Judge Paul Matthews said Ms Walker had breached the terms of her tenancy, but refused to order her out of the property in Durham Grove. Having heard recordings of the noise, he said there was a serious problem in relation to the buildings sound insulation.  It meant ordinary everyday activities - including talking and using the toilet - could disturb neighbouring residents. Appealing against the ruling to the High Court, the landlord argued that Judge Matthews was wrong not to evict Ms Walker. But dismissing the appeal, Mr Justice Birss said that, although Judge Matthews thought disturbances were likely to continue, further breaches of the tenancy were by no means inevitable. The judge had held that much of the disturbance he had identied was not caused by any breach of the tenancy agreement or nuisance by Ms Walker, he said.

But as they get older they will be expected to follow all the rules and protocol that comes with being a royal . Kate and William are doing their best to give their kids as normal an upbringing as possible, but they are well aware of the unique future they have ahead of them. So a royal etiquette expert believes the Cambridges will be training George, Charlotte, and Louis when hes old enough from a very early age. Myka Meier, from Beaumont Etiquette, told Cosmopolitan the initial training would probably be done by Kate.She said: Prince George and Princess Charlotte’s etiquette education likely started as soon as they could attend events with their family. It would probably begin with simple training like how to shake hands and curtsy around the age of two. Initial training would likely be given by their mother, The Duchess of Cambridge. George and Charlotte have been regulars at big family events since a very young age, and theyve already been on Royal Tours and stood on Buckingham Palaces balcony for Trooping of the Colour.  Theyre normally very well behaved, and there have only been a couple of wobbly moments so far.Unlike newbies to the royal family like Meghan Markle , who have to learn everything at once to bring them up to scratch, children born into the family can pick bits up slowly.Myka adds: Growing up in the Palace would mean that training is much less a course or official training, and more day-to-day observation and gentle lessons right before an event or when meeting an important guest to help prepare them.

And in another message, she said: Shes taking the Mick now. Ellie-May Minshull-Coyle was  months old when she died after being forcibly restrained face down by ligatures on her bed, jurors heard. She was tied to the mattress of the bed, which had been turned into a cage, with ligatures across her chest and legs, Liverpool Crown Court was told. The little girl was full of le before she woke up around midnight and a duvet was allegedly placed over her and her ankles were bound together.  Prosecutors claim, at some point, she vomited onto her bedding and pillow, before eventually her heart stopped beating and she stopped breathing At the time of her death on March  last year, Ellie-May was living with Coyle, the mum’s boyfriend Reece Hitchcott, , and lodger Connor Kirby, , in Preston, Lancashire. All three are on trial at the court and all deny manslaughter. Coyle is said to have sent the Snapchat message to her friend at some point in the hours before her daughter was pronounced dead. During the course of the night, the toddler was placed in a very dangerous sleeping environment, the court was told. By mid-morning, she was dead, prosecutors said. Opening the prosecution case yesterday, QC Christopher Tehrani said the three defendants, each in their dferent ways, were responsible for or took on the responsibility for the child’s care and welfare.  He alleged Hitchcott built the cage, which he described as “a monstrous structure”, against the two sides of Ellie-May’s toddler bed. The jury of six women and six men were shown photographs of the bed which showed slats and sides from her cot had been attached to it with towels and sheets draped over them so the child could not see or get out. It is alleged the little girl had been forcibly tied to the bed on more than one occasion and restraint marks on her body showed she had had at least one wrist and one ankle tied. The prosecution said the duvet placed over the tot would have impacted on her ability to control her body temperature, causing her immense suffering, distress and upset. Mr Tehrani said: “By being restrained in her bed in a face-down position the prosecution say Ellie-May’s breathing would have become compromised. She would not have been able to move off her front due to being restrained to allow her to resume breathing properly.  “Ellie-May at some point, say the prosecution, vomited onto her bedding and pillow. Eventually, her heart stopped beating and she stopped breathing. The placing of the duvet over her body would have complicated matters further and may well have resulted in hyperthermia. The prosecution’s case is that Ellie-May’s death was unnecessary, pointless and wholly avoidable. The court heard Coyle and Hitchcott had been in a relationship for about three months and lived in a two-bedroom flat. Hitchcott’s friend, Kirby, had been lodging with them for a number of months, sleeping on the sofa. During the night of  to  March , Ellie-May appears to have been unsettled, claimed Mr Tehrani. At some point during the course of the night, Ellie-May was placed in a very dangerous sleeping environment...and by mid-morning on March  Ellie-May was dead,” claimed Mr Tehrani.  Mr Tehrani said on March , Ellie-May had been “full of le and mischievous” and had a good appetite. Evidence suggested Hitchcott, assisted by Kirby, put her to bed about . pm and she slept well until shortly after midnight.The prosecution said Coyle sent the Snapchat message to her pal saying: This child is p***ing me off tonight.In messages to her dad, Sean Coyle, she told how she had left the child to cry for two hours as she’s taking the Mick now. He told her not to have a go at Ellie-May and to grin and bear it, the court was told.Sean Coyle called round sometime between  and .am to check on his daughter and grand-daughter and she told him to be quiet as Ellie-May was sleeping, it was said.When he went into her bedroom, Hitchcott was crouched over her bed in a gap between the end of the bed and the wall. He believed he was trying to wake Ellie-May, who was lying on her back. He askedshe was okay and he replied: “Yeah I think so.”  Mr Tehrani suggested: “You may think that was an unusual response, he had got to know her and treated her asshe was his own daughter.” Mr Coyle realised something was not right and when he askedshe was breathing Hitchcott shook her arm, the court heard. “When Mr Coyle looked at Ellie-May her eyes rolled back into her head and she looked ‘clammy’, the prosecution said. Mr Coyle now knew that something terrible had happened to Ellie. An ambulance was called and after ing to the bedroom, Mr Coyle told Hitchcott to get Ellie-May, who still had the duvet over her, out of bed. Hitchcott pulled the covers about half way down the bed and put his hands under her torso and pulled and lted her up. Mr Tehrani queried whether he was struggling to do so as her feet and legs were tied by the pink blanket and other material and he had not had time to unbind her. Mr Coyle and paramedics tried to resuscitate Ellie-May. She was taken to Royal Preston Hospital and was declared dead at .am.  Mr Tehrani told the jury that after her collapse the police attended and it was found that a pink and a blue blanket had been used as ligatures going under the mattress. The blue one - which would have corresponded with Ellie-May’s chest area - was undone but the pink one - which would have corresponded with her legs - was knotted and tied so tightly the sides of the mattress were raised off the bed frame by cm, it was said.Coyle later told police Hitchcott had been binding her daughter across the chest with the blue blanket since mid-January saying it would help her settle into a sleep routine and stop her banging her head on the wall. She said she did not approve of the action and never did it herself. Coyle had also been given ‘safe sleep’ practice by a health visitor and told to put her to sleep on her back. Kirby said Hitchcott had built the cage and attached it with his help in January last year. Hitchcott allegedly told a friend after the child’s death that he had restrained her in her bed on the night of March  by tying the blue blanket around her.

The young girl was pictured sitting in a ride-on car outside a charity shop in Hull. In the snap, she can be seen looking into the window of the shop with no adults in sight. It was posted in the Hull Crime Watch Facebook page after being taken on Wednesday, and has been commented on hundreds of times. The woman who took the picture said she was so concerned she reported it to Humberside Police and was told officers will patrol the area.  She said: We were in the car at the traffic lights waiting until they changed. People came out the shop and the child was just sat there. The little girl tried to lean to open the door at one point. People was just walking past her as well, but she looked about two -that. Since posting it people have said they have seen her on her own before so the police said they will patrol the area and check CCTV. Many parents shared the same concerns and said a child that young should never be left alone. But others pointed out that years ago it was the norm. Katherine Ness said: What a joke. Shouldnt be allowed kids. Rachael Jackson said: You just wouldn’t risk it! Bet she wouldn’t park her car outside with the keys left in the ignition! And personally I’d rather do that then leave my child outside, just my opinion but think the authority’s would probably have something to say too.

Newham Council has evacuated two primary and two secondary schools to treat the invasion of  widow spiders immediately before the eggs start hatching. Thousands of kids in the east London borough stayed home while pest control experts scoured the schools in a bid to curb the killer menace. False Widow Spiders, the UKs most poisonous arachnid, are dark-coloured with globular bodies and range from . to  mm in size. Although named because of its physical similarity to the killer black widow spider, the species bites rarely cause death but can be very painful.  Symptoms include severe pain radiating from the bite and fever - but could prove fatala young and vulnerable child was bitten in an especially sensitive location. Four schools in the east London borough are facing weeks without lessons, including Lister Community School, Star Primary, Ellen Wilkinson Primary and Rokeby Secondary School. Headteacher at Star Primary, Lisle Von Buchenroder, said the school was forced to close so pest control can exterminate the eggs before they start hatching. In a letter to parents Wednesday she said: I am writing to update you regarding the current school closure. It was with much regret that I had to make the decision to close the school yesterday as the safety and well-being of pupils and staff is always our number one priority. I was made aware of an infestation of noble  black widow spiders which was discovered during a routine check by Newham’s Environmental Team. They believe that the infestation is contained to the outside of the building and that this needs to be treated immediately before the eggs start hatching. I want to reassure all members of our community that these are precautionary measures and that we are very lucky to have found out in time to take action to remove them. After speaking to the Environmental Team this morning, I do regretfully have to inform you that I am advised the school treatment plan will happen in two phases, starting tomorrow.

Her condition was so bad she could only go to the toilet once a week. Sleepless nights were spent curled up on the bathroom floor in agony while multiple doctors failed to correctly diagnose her problem.Kayleigh said: It was so annoying because everyone just assumed I was pregnant and wouldnt leave that alone - I was definitely not pregnant!Id wear tights or anything like that which normally fit me for the whole day. By the end of the day, Id be very uncomfortable and Id have pressure marks from my trousers or tights imprinted on my skin.  “It was pretty painful, which affects you mentally. You feel like you just dont want to go out anywhere. Id often find Id experience diarrhoea on nights out and that is obviously pretty embarrassing. So many times I wouldnt feel like going out. Because I was constipated, Id be going to the toilet only once a week. That in itself is disconcerting because youre thinking in the back of your head why havent I been to the toilet . I probably endured the problems all through my s, even at university. Id been to see my GP mainly because of constipation problems and Id get given fibre gel drinks, she says. Kayleighs situation came to a head when she graduated from Heriot-Watt University, in Edinburgh, and moved from Scotland to Northern Ireland that week.  “The stress of that culminated in my first visit to AE. I was really worried I wouldnt be able to fly back for the graduation ceremony because I was in so much pain. I was just curled up on the bathroom floor, because it was cold and the best place to be.” Tiredness and depression, caused by her painful and irritable symptoms, had became part of daily le for the then -year-old.Doctors put the symptoms down to Irritable Bowel Syndromeand prescribed a drug they thought would help.Kayleigh went home and had her first nights sleep in - days, but she developed an allergic reaction to the drug and had to rush back to AE. On most occasions [at the GP] I dont know whether it was ignorance or easiness, I always got these fibre gel drinks which I used for quite a while until another GP told me to come off them because they were not a long-term solution.But then Kayleighs personal trainer mentioned food intolerances and said she could fast-track an elimination diet with a test which analyses IgG antibody reactionsto up to  food and drink ingredients provided by the company YorkTest .Kayleigh said: My trainer was intolerant to a few things and didnt know until she took the test. Since she has eliminated those things from her diet, she has felt so much better.” Kayleighs husband, Robert, has ME [chronic fatigue syndrome] and was also going through a rough time but couldnt understand why. Kayleigh says: Hes had a few allergy tests, but never any intolerance tests. He had already eliminated gluten and cows milk from his diet. His lunch consisted of a chicken breast, potatoes and an egg every day.  “Interestingly when he took the intolerance test, which I got for him as a Christmas present, he found he was intolerant to eggs! So as soon as he eliminated the eggs he felt better as well.” Although Robert had around  intolerances, from eggs to raspberries, the message from specialists was not to panic - and even that some intolerances can be reintroduced six months after eliminating them from a diet. Kayleighs test - the YorkTest FoodDrink Scan programme - also threw up several surprises, revealing she had reactions to cow’s milk, egg white, lentils, yeast, buckwheat and gluten. “I’m not surprised by cow’s milk or gluten and avoided them as much as possible, because I knew that they didnt agree with me. I was surprised by lentils - I loved making lentil soup and sweet potato and lentil stew - and of course lentils are seen as healthy,” she says. My borderline list had things like walnut, rhubarb and avocado, which I ate all the time as well. What the experts advise is to eliminate everything over a period of six months then you can start to reintroduce things. We dont necessarily do that, but we can enjoy things on occasions and not suffer because were not eating them every day. The test involves sending a finger-prick blood sample to a laboratory for analysis followed by up to two consultations with a nutritional therapist.  Kayleigh says: “I found the nutritional consultation very helpful. Particularly when it came to finding alternatives, especially for garlic! “She was able to provide much more specic information on what to avoid based on food groups and gave some great alternatives and recipes,” she says. As soon as Kayleigh started her elimination diet, she immediately felt better. “As I had already removed gluten, wheat and cow’s milk from my diet, I found it relatively easy to remove the remaining foods. The one I found most dficult was yeast. “I definitely feel much better, and I know when I have eaten something that I am intolerant to immediately. I havent been constipated since, I bloat much less, and I don’t experience the same stomach cramps, provided I steer clear of my trigger foods. I do eat the odd food I probably shouldnt, but at least I know the reason for any discomfort. I am so much happier, consistently comfortable and have regular bowel movements, too.

That was one year ago, now she’s sold thousands of products in her own, mainly monochrome, designs and is planning to expand into wholesale supply and take on staff. She said: “It’s all pinks and blues for kids on the high street, I didn’t realise how common it is many parents want to dress their children in unisex. “Everyone takes a dferent line on it now.”  But it was only once she started selling personalised designs that things started to take off. “Once I got the idea out there, it took a couple of weeks for people to start looking at it,” Emily added. “I introduced personalised stuff - and as soon as I brought that out people just jumped on it. “I was working from my kitchen, but I’ve moved into a bedroom now.” Her latest design - tops sporting the logo Future Changer - is another take on personalisation.  “People have the option to add whatever they want, so my son’s says ‘Future Paleontologist’ because that’s all he ever talks about. “I thought ‘why not have what children aspire to be when they’re older  I’m donating % of the sales to World Vision UK, a charity that helps children create their own futures. “And I wanted something you couldn’t get on the high street. “I never expected this, my friends say ‘we just can’t believe how it’s taken off’ - but when I’m sat crying on my office floor because I’m so tired, I don’t really think about it. “Some nights I don’t get to bed till am, then I get up for the school run, but it just works. “And my partner, Joey’s dad, helps me a lot with day-to-day stuff like school drop-offs and bed times.” "},{"url":null,"title":"nurses give organ donor guard","story":"NewsNurses give organ donor guard of honour as hes wheeled through hospital before le support is switched offThe moving scene took place at St. Lukes Hospital in Meridian, Idaho, USA, in what staff call a Walk of RespectShareCommentsByToby MeyjesLuke Kenton:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT Newsthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video nurses-give-organ-donor-guard-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailEmotional hospital staff lined corridors as a silent mark of respect in a guard of honour for a dying organ donor on his way to have his le support switched off.

Milaois Murphys mum Victoria thought she had appendicitis until she went into labour and her waters broke. The -year-olds baby girl, Harper, arrived at just  weeks as an ambulance was en route to her Dublin home in the middle of the night. Milaois told the Irish Mirror that the baby literally slid out into my trousers - and hailed her mum actions in resuscitating the newborn as heroic.  The teen said: “She was born on the kitchen floor. “When she came out she let out a little cry and then she stopped breathing so me Ma had to resuscitate her. “The baby was only the same size as her hand. She was just a pound .If it wasn’t for her, she is a super Mammy. I think the ambulance men were telling her how to do it.  “The ambulance and the fire brigade were just amazing. They did kind of scare me a little bit when they said they had to put the baby in a plastic bag to keep her warm. “At that time, I didn’t even know what I had. I had so much adrenaline going around my body, I didn’t feel pain anymore.” Milaois had been getting sick all that night but had no idea she was pregnant. She said: “I had back pain and I couldn’t sleep but that was my only symptom. I thought I was getting a bit chubby. “The baby could have been kicking but I didn’t know because I never had a baby and I thought it could be wind or something.  “That night, I was vomiting and vomiting and I said, ‘Ma, I need to go to the hospital’. We thought it was my appendix and we rang the Mater at about  o’clock. “Within seconds I felt pressure and my waters broke everywhere. “Me Ma knew straight away and told me to relax and called my sister and the baby literally slid out into my trousers. She was born on my kitchen floor. I was brought to the Rotunda. “I was so numb with the shock it didn’t click with me until the next morning that I had a baby. “Then I went up and I saw her and the mother instinct immediately kicked in. Then I rang her father and we went up and picked her name.”  RTE series, The Rotunda, airing on Thursday at .pm, catalogues the long and dficult road for baby Harper who was in intensive care for months. Consultant Neonatologist Adrienne Foran said the arrival of the baby at one pound and  ounces was a huge shock to Milaois and her partner James Mulligan. She added: “Harper was smaller than a bag of sugar. She was about  minutes old when I met her, she had come in with no heart rate but responded well to initial resuscitation. “We had to ask Milaois after having that big shock to express her own breast milk which was the best thing for the baby.That’s an awful lot to ask a girl who five or six hours earlier went to bed with not a care in the world to find out she was in labour, had a baby she wasn’t expecting who is potentially very sick, very premature.” "},{"url":null,"title":"designers from across europe heading for dundee","story":"Hundreds of designers from across Europe will head to Dundee University in April for an international conference, when the European Academy of Design event Running With Scissors takes place.Designers, businesses and researchers will discuss topics such as the future of healthcare, articial intelligence, entrepreneurship and ethics.Delegates will be encouraged to “take contrary views” to shed new light on challenges.Dr Louise Valentine, head of entrepreneurship, enterprise and employability at Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art and Design, said: “We’re bringing one of the world’s most influential design conferences to one of the world’s most interesting design cities.“Dundee is the ideal location to debate the future of design given its strong heritage, entrepreneurial school of art and design, world-leading design research and its international status as a Unesco City of Design.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/10/5bb4861670cde-821x564.jpg ","title":"dundee shopping centre accepting donations for foodbank month","story":"Dundee’s Overgate has launched an initiative for Foodbank Month with The Trussell Trust, the UK charity that runs a network of more than  foodbanks providing emergency food to people referred for support.In the last year, foodbanks in The Trussell Trust network gave ,, three-day emergency food supplies to people in crisis.Running throughout October, a number of activities will support the initiative which aims to boost Christmas supplies for foodbanks in Dundee, Angus and Fe.A drop-off point has been created at the customer service desk in the Overgate where people can donate items such as tinned or dry foods, food in jars and adult and baby toiletries, including nappies.There’s also a selection of food goods available to buy and to donate to the appeal.Overgate retailers and centre staff are filling donation boxes with supplies for the appeal, and centre management are volunteering at local foodbanks.The Trussell Trust will be holding an awareness campaign in the centre on October  and ."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/07/image.jpg@1.90694.jpg ","title":"dundee united fans to have chance to meet league winning stars","story":"Dundee United fans will have the chance to meet heroes from the  league-winning at a special night being held in the city.Whitehall Theatre will host ‘An Evening With The Tangerine Terrors’ on Saturday November  to celebrate the th anniversary of their achievement.Former players including John Holt, Maurice Malpas, Paul Hegarty, Hamish McAlpine, Eamonn Bannon, John Reilly, Davie Dodds and Paul Sturrock will be there on the night.The former teammates will be brought back together for a night of stories and memories from from the unforgettable season # which climaxed by clinching the league title at Dens Park in a - win over Dundee.The show will have an added bit of interest as it will be hosted by Keith Haggart who is the grandson of George Fox # the former long-serving club director.Tickets can be secured on Friday via dundeebox"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/10/5bb486cb67878-488x564.jpg ","title":"embarrassed freddy frans confident dundee united can recover","story":"Dundee United defender Freddy Frans admits he felt embarrassed to have led the side during their - home defeat at the hands of Ross County which, ultimately, spelled the end for Csaba Laszlo.Frans captained the side on the day as Csaba was relieved of his duties as manager in the wake of the Tannadice hammering.His No  Laurie Ellis has taken interim charge and will likely be in the dugout as United travel to Somerset Park to face league leaders Ayr United on Saturday.And, although he is still hurting after the County calamity, Belgian centre-back Frans believes they can bounce back straight away.“People should look at themselves, we don’t need to talk about somebody , we don’t need to talk about the manager or other players,” he said.“We need to look at our own performances and I feel embarrassed.“Especially in an important game like this against one of our title rivals.

It comes from nowhere,” he added.“I think we started really well. We had a great chance at the beginning and, obviously, we miss it.

What’s more, eventhey don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in , a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now,  years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species."},{"url":null,"title":"red star exit cup after disappointing performance","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Red Star crashed out of the Scottish Cup on Saturday after an error-strewn replay performance was punished by a clinical Southside team.As in the original tie, Red Star got off to a terrible start, finding themselves two goals down inside  minutes after sloppy errors. To make things worse, defender Luke Naisby was forced off with a hamstring injury.Star tried to play their way into the game but their passing was rushed and it was Southside who added to their tally before the break after a long ball over the top resulted in a breakdown of communication at the back and the striker had the simple task of rounding Kalache and placing the ball into the net.Star pulled a goal back in the second half thanks to an excellent inidual effort from Cammy MacDonald. Chances followed for Star, but Aaron Moore#s shot was blocked by the Southside keeper and Gregor Peacock shot just wide of the far post.The scoring was completed by the visitors in the th minute when Star failed to clear a corner and the striker shot past Kalache from close range to seal a - victory.Star will look to bounce back in another tough tie on Saturday September  when they take on Uddingston at home in the first round of the West of Scotland Cup.

I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute. It is our country’s most pressing public health issue – one we must address now, collectively.Scotland has made a lot of progress over the past  years, including a guarantee of a year’s post-diagnostic support, better education and training for staff in health and social care and better standards of care for people with dementia in hospitals.There is still, however, an unacceptable gap between national policy and dementia care and support in our communities.

She explained her fascination with how each portrayed the concept in very dferent ways, from the peaceful portrayal of moonlit nature to expressions of personal  emotion, struggle and grief.The first work Anna played was Scriabin’s second Sonata, Sonata Fantasie. The ‘moonlit’ first movement was exquisite and the execution of the theme and pianissimo accompaniment at the end was stunning: the helter skelter finale was brilliant.Chopin’s Fantasie in F min, which followed, took us into the realms of personal struggle and, with Anna’s innate musicianship, she made cohesive sense of what can appear a somewhat fragmented work.To end the first part of the recital we heard a flawless rendition of Beethoven’s much-loved Moonlight Sonata, and despite the high octane speed of the finale one could hear every single note.After the interval came Mozart’s D min Fantasia. This deceptively easy-looking short piece, executed perfectly by Anna, demonstrated how dficult it is to play his music where every note and phrase requires minute attention.To conclude her recital, Anna chose Schumann’s great Fantasie in C. This work, while dedicated to Franz Liszt is, in the first movement at least, more an outpouring of his frustration at being denied the hand of his beloved Clara with all its sudden changes in mood. The very technically demanding second movement – a march – is more of a dedication to Liszt and was a thrilling listen. The final slow transcendental movement, which could well have been inspired by the opening movement of Beethoven’s Moonlight Sonata, took us into a world of ethereal tranquility.After much applause Anna gave us Rachmaninov’s Prelude in G# min. Op. No. as a fitting encore.After this ‘fantasy’ journey one could only join with those who have been so impressed by the depth and power of Anna’s musicianship. Her ability to squeeze the last drop of emotion from every phrase was very special and a privilege to experience. Finally, to walk out into the clear night air and see the moonlight reflected off the sea like shards of silver seemed an apt end to an evening of fantasy.PIC:Pianist prodigy, Anna Feorova.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

Torrential rain did not dampen spirits or performances and once again the organisers upheld their reputation as a sporting event that promotes local community participation balanced with fierce and friendly sporting competition to attract some of the best triathletes from across Scotland. Affiliated to Tri-Scotland, the national body for triathlon in Scotland, the event is now a regular fixture on the national event calendar.It was not a day for personal bests being set, but all athletes exceeded their expectations spurred on by tremendous support from friends, families and club mates adding to the atmosphere.The winners of the inidual event were:MMale Senior st male # Craig Ross of the Glasgow Tri Club: ::Female Senior st female –Lucy Fraser ::Female Veteran – Louise Ross of Glasgow Tri Club ::Male Veteran – Mike Donaldson of Glasgow Tri Club :..Male Super Vet – Alasdair Ireland – ::Female Super Vet – Maggie Darroch of Glasgow Tri Club ::Male Vintage – Alan Duff of Glasgow Tri Club – ::Female Vintage– Sue Allen of Mid Argyll Tri Club ::Male Super Vintage– Douglas Wood of Stirling Tri Club ::st Mid Argyll Female Finisher – Kirsty Duff, Bridgend ::st Mid Argyll Male Finisher – John Anderson, Kilmartin ::The winner of the adult team category was Glasgow University Dream Team with a time of  hour  minutes and  seconds and or the junior teams the winner was BFG Lochgilphead made up of Felix Maddox, Gregor McGeachy and Ben Smith.In the inidual race categories there were some great performances. Mid Argyll Triathlon Club’s Sue Allen in the vintage categoryput in superb performances to dominate this category. This was a complete performance by Sue which saw her retain her title for the third year in succession. In second place was Gillian Kennedy of Perth Triathlon Club and in third place was Marjorie Leighton of the Mid Argyll Tri Club.Doug Wood in the super vintage + age group and won by over  minutes from his nearest rival with his cycle over the -mile course being very impressive.In the male vintage raceAlan Duffs performance particularly in the bike and run was very strong rewarding his impressive consistency with the win.The accolade for being the fastest male and female triathlete in the race was also clearly going to be very tightly fought contest.The stand out performance on the day was from Lucy Fraser, the fastest lady and first senior. Lucy had the third fastest swim at  minutes and  seconds, she then pulled away on the bike from Kathryn Grfin in second place by a powerful display of cycling, which gave her a lead of four minutes heading into the run. In fact she only lost one minute to Kathryn on the run to win by nearly three minutes.The fastest male triathlete on the day was Mike Donaldson in the + veteran category, holding off the youngsters to be the overall winner in the male race by  seconds. His faster swim and bike and very solid run over the four-mile distance saw him hold off Craig Ross who recorded the fastest run of the day of  minutes  seconds to take the overall title.The remaining age group category competition between the clubs was spiced up with lots of banter and friendly, fierce rivalry.In the Super Veteran Male Category , Alasdair Ireland had a very impressive performance across all three disciplines of the triathlon, recording the fastest swim, bike and run to win. There was a closer battle for second and third place with John Anderson, Phil Dye and Sandy Ross swapping positions in the swim, bike and run. However, Mid Argyll Tri club John managed to get a lead at the end of the bike and a fast transition saw him record a  minute  second run being  seconds quicker then Phil Dye and  seconds than Sandy to claim second place.The female Super Veteranfemale category was similar to the men with Maggie Darroch from Glasgow Tri Club being fastest in the swim, bike and run to win by an impressive margin of just over nine minutes, improving her position of second place from last year. Melanie Peacock-Chimelewska of Mid Argyll Tri Club was second with her excellent swim proving the dference over Elaine Crichton in third.The female veterancategory saw Sarah Grfin of Mid Argyll Tri and Cycle club fastest in the swim and out on the bike, but a very strong bike and a phenomenal run of Louise Ross of Glasgow Tri meant she took the win for the second year running, pushing Sarah into second place and Jenner Reid of Campbeltown running club to third.The first place local male and female categories is always a bit of fun with local Mid Argyll Tri and Cycle Club members battling for bragging rights.The first local male triathlete home was John Anderson from Kilmartin with a time of ::, with Colin MacFarlane in second place at :: and Iain MacNicol in third place ::. All three are members of the Mid Argyll Triathlon and Cycle club.The first local female triathlete home was Kirsty Duff at ::, in second place was Sarah Grfin at :: and Louise Gibson at :: in third place.Team EventThe team race is always the first heat away and this year there were  teams battling for the podium and hearing the starting air horn and whistles from the pool the excitement soon built for the team cyclists. There was some great rivalry banter between the relay team members as they eagerly looked forward to the relay change.This was the year of the youngsters as Glasgow University Triathlon club came with two teams and had clearly come with intent of winning the race. First out of the water with the fastest swim of the day was Glasgow Uni Dream Team with a blisteringly quick time of  minutes  seconds, followed only  seconds back by Glasgow Uni Freshers Team and only one second behind Team BFG .Well there was certainly nothing separating the top three teams at the end of the bike as they all came in virtually together with only  seconds separating them. It was all down to the run and the Glasgow Uni Dream Team pulled out the second quickest run of the day to win the by three minutes, from the Glasgow Uni Freshers team with the BFG our local junior team in third.The BFG team made up of Felix Maddox, Gregor McGeachy and Ben Smith took the junior trophy and can be rightfully proud of their overall performance in the competition.The team’s competition always provides a great balance between the spice of competition and the balance of having great fun and allowing everyone to participate across the three disciplines. This is best epitomised in the team names, reflecting not only who they were representing but also good humour. Teams included: ‘No Direction ., ‘Splash Flash and Dash’, ‘Ormsary Orbits’, ‘ Years On’, ‘Coia and Associates’, ‘HIE Tri-ers’, ‘Yes Lube’, ‘Team Try-Athletes’ and ‘Sepa Mums’.Thanks, and FeedbackMid Argyll Triathlon club once again appreciated all the many words of thanks and praise from competitors to the organisers, marshals and volunteers for the event, its organisation and smooth running, the great goodie bags, medals and sports performance T-shirt provided by our sponsors, without which the triathlon could not happen.Karen Graham said: ‘Love it!

Luckily Batman, PH’s Mr Rory Hall sprung into action to free the cute creature. The superhero was accompanied by sidekick Robin- or rather the school’s janitor Brian Robb. The pair worked together to prise open the window and get the winged animal to safety, while other staff members stood below with a safety net. And the Pipistrelles bat even received some special treatment of a cosy box and a well deserved drink before the Bat Society team popped along to get the animal back to Gotham City.  Janitor Brian said: “We knew it was there during the day but we just thought it was hanging there. “But parents said to me later on that it was still there. “We contacted the Bat Society to see what we should do as we knew they were protected. “It’s wing had actually been caught, so I had to go up beside Mr Hall and prise the window frame open with a screwdriver. “We put it into a box then Mr Hall gave it some water and later on that night we released it.” Rory added: “I spent a couple of hours and stayed with it to make sure it was calm and relaxed. “I gave it a solution of salt, sugar and warm water, which the Bat Society gave us, and it was like an energy drink for him. “Half an hour after that, I took it out and hung it out at the sensory garden and off it flew.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13347961.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_nip_rgr_041018flowers_1JPG.jpg","title":"caring toryglen grans who set","story":"NewsCaring Toryglen grans who set up club for pensioners are honoured in new Reformer competitionShareByNiki Tennant:,  OCT NewsCathy and Suzanne were delighted with their flowers, presented by Cathys daughter Meika \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribingSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTwo caring grans, who have opened up a new world of fun and friendship for Toryglen pensioners, have become the first recipients of stunning bouquets in the Reformer’s new Say it with Flowers competition.When Meika Thomson read that the Rutherglen Reformer wanted to say ‘thanks a bunch’ every week to unsung heroeswho make a real dference to their community, she didn’t hesitate to nominate her mum Cathy and best friend Suzanne Curran for a beautul bouquet from Burnside florist, Stems.Cathy and Suzanne, who have run the Toryglen After School Care club for  years, refused to turn the other cheek when they saw pensioners from a neighbouring sheltered housing complex staying indoors, living in isolation and lacking company and companionship. Saying hello to Cathy and Suzanne as they passed the Geoff Shaw community centre where the after school club meets was often the only interaction some of the pensioners from the Thistle Housing complex had. When Polmadie Fire Station donated a snooker table to the club nearly three years ago, Cathy and Suzanne saw it as an opportunity to persuade elderly residents to leave their armchairs and drop into the centre for a game of snooker and a chat. A resident from the housing complex spread the word among his neighbours and soon eight men were going to the centre to while away their afternoons and evenings with a game of snooker and friendly banter. Glasgow Le’s Mark Hudson suggested establishing a sports hub in the centre and advised Cathy and Suzanne how to apply for funding. Thanks to the two grans, carpet bowls, team tennis, boccia, badminton, sitting tai chi and computing classes were soon added to the list of activities on offer at the centre for Toryglen pensioners. “We had a marvellous time getting to know them,” said, Cathy, , of King’s Park.  “At first, they were gentlemanly, but within two weeks, they’d come out of their shell and were just being themselves.” Before she and Cathy stepped in, Suzanne said elderly residents from the housing complex on Kerrylamont Avenue would pass each other as strangers on the way to the local shops. Now they are friends who are in and out of each other’s homes. “It is just wonderful, seeing the dference in their lives,” said -year-old Suzanne, of Toryglen. “Seeing them from hardly walking to totally changing is marvellous. One man did not go out the house after losing his we a couple of years before, and he just loved the company.” Volunteers Cathy and Suzanne organised a bus to take the neighbours on a day trip to Ayr - and the appreciative group paid for the pair’s seats to the seaside. The two women are now planning their annual pensioners’ Christmas lunch at which kids from the after school club will delight diners by singing carols. In nominating her mum and Suzanne, Meika told the Reformer: “Some of these men had not even been outside their doors in over a few years, so this got them back into the community. Most recently, they have set up a memories group where they meet and talk about the past. “These groups have created a great feeling and the residents have created a great relationship with Cathy and Suzanne and also give the kids from the after school a wee hello when they pass by.” Choking back the tears as Meika presented them with the Stems’ bouquets, Cathy said: “I am speechless. We don’t often get a pat on the back. That’s not what we do this for. But to be acknowledged like this is simply wonderful.” To nominate someone for a hand-crafted bouquet from Stems, send your name, address and contact number, the name of the person you wish to nominate and information about why you think they deserve to receive the Bouquet of the Week to: Say It With Flowers competition, Rutherglen Reformer, One Central Quay, Glasgow G DA, or email news@rutherglenreformer.

Thankfully the ninth Duke, Arthur Charles Valerian Wellesley, has much less of a fight on his hands. His battle is to gain planning permission to add a fine conservatory to his listed country manor. Bardrochat House and estate lies deep in the Stinchar Valley just outside Colmonell.  But the big house came with a tacky plastic conservatory which was put in during the s. The Duke, now , and known as Charles, wants to flatten it and build an elegant stone replacement befitting of his house and surrounding shooting and fishing Dalreoch Estate. But he has to gain listed building consent first. Architect Luke Moloney said: “This relatively recent extension to the house is incongruous for its comparative lack of quality, in both detailing and materials, and has therefore deteriorated to a point where its continuing repair becomes uneconomical. “The existing conservatory, however, is of no such signicance, but rather detracts from and compromises the fine architectural quality of the rest of the house.” The new building is masonry, partly harled, and with simple stone dressings, to match the spirit and fabric of the main house. The report by the architect to South Ayrshire Council adds: “Metal windows, and patent glazing to the roof, continue the long traditions of the British domestic conservatory. Cast iron rainwater hoppers drain the roof.” The Duke also enjoys the title Marquess of Douro and is married to a Prussian Princess. Bardrochat had been home to generations of the McEwen family from  to  and was a secret haunt of Princess Margaret. Inside, the pile is noted for a galleried, timber led entrance hall with barrel vaulted ceiling. Decorative plaster ceilings to the music room and drawing room are particularly fine.

And the ‘hey presto’ thing of the past has moved on a bit. A young magician is climbing up the magicians’ ladder. Fraser Stokes, , has just ed from a convention in Southport run by the International Brotherhood of Magicians with two awards. He reckons he is the first Scot since  to win one of them – the giant Dittia Shield. Fraser, who lives in Straiton, said: “This shield is only ever given to someone who demonstrates excellence in manipulation and I am delighted. Manipulation is classed as the highly dexterous sleight of hand on stage.” It is a heady rise since performing his first magic ‘gig’ aged eight at Straiton Gala Day. Fraser admits: “I thought then it was a volume thing and I think I cleared Tam Shepherds trick shop in Glasgow of most of the stock. “I had three tables which took about half an hour to build. “Fortunately now the quality has gone up a bit and the quantity well down.” The former Carrick Academy pupil is now trying to make a full-time professional career from his magic shows on stage and at kids parties and is attending business courses to help market himself. And he has ed from Stockport with a real spring in his step. Fraser said: “There were world-class performers there including Richard Cadell from the Sooty Show and he said my technique was world-class. “Also the first European champion of magic, Dion, came to me to say ‘I love your work, your performance made me emotional’.”As a BA Hons Drama student and member of Ayr acting troupe Fib, Fraser enjoys putting some theatre into his act. He said: “Just doing tricks is not really that enthralling –I think the audience needs to be spellbound .”Dad David, mum Alison and elder brother Calum – who works with the UN in Thailand – have seen most of his work, from the faltering first steps at the kitchen table in Straiton, to real magic on stage. The family moved to the village from Barassie when he was eight. Fraser, a member of Kilmarnock Magic Circle, said: “I have always loved magic but it was  years ago I started serious practice. “For birthdays and Christmas I always asked for money for my visits to Tam Shepherds. “These days there are loads of actors but hardly any magicians so I really hope to make a full-time career out of it. “Theatrical magic is my speciality, not the sawing a woman in two stuff. “It is a challenge, but I work long and hard trying to master the moves for my cabaret acts and for the competitions.” One day Straiton Gala, next the Las Vegas strip, with a little magic of course.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr NewsTheatre"},{"url":null,"title":"new property company mystery over","story":"NewsNew property company mystery over Ayr Station HotelMalaysian owners sets up new firm for \"buying and selling of own real estate\"ShareByStephen Houston:,  OCT NewsStation Hotel Safety work continues \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribingSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA new property company linked to the Station Hotel in Ayr has been set up.

Mr Ung nor Miss Ung could be contacted for comment. He bought the Station Hotel eight years ago for pound, as an investment. Since then South Ayrshire Council has tried and failed to negotiate with him in an attempt to keep the rat-infested building safe. Two dangerous building notices were issued. Finally they were forced to seal off the area on public safety grounds, effectively banning longer electric trains. And such is the present danger close to the road bridge, no diesel trains have been able to head south to Maybole, Girvan, Barrhill and Stranraer. The  bed railway hotel opened for trade in  and later had a succession ofowners including Stakis, Quality and Swallow.

Strictly Come Dancing has been watched by millions across the country since  with viewers voting for their favourite celebrity to be crowned winner. But before the television dance contest took over our Saturday night evening watch, viewers got their ballroom fix from the series Come Dancing, which later reformed becoming the follow-up show we know today as Strictly. Back when the show aired on and off on the BBC from  to , it featured professional contestants and not celebrities. Doonfoot’s Janet Stirling danced on the original Come Dancing series as a member of the West of Scotland formation team. Now the dance queen is displaying her gowns at a special showcase in the Carnegie Library in Ayr for fans of the series. Looking back on her time on the series, Janet relived her dancing days. She said: “We trained twice a week - on a Thursday evening and a Sunday afternoon for two and a half to three hours. “And the whole team met up to do that. “There was  in a team all dancing in unison.  “So the men had to keep in line with each other and when the girls went out to curtsy we all did that at the same time. “It was a bit nerve-wracking knowing that millions of people were watching you. “And you didn’t want to make a mistake because in a formation team,you did, you’d stick out like a sore thumb.” When Janet started to dance she was  years old and in her teenage years she achieved her bronze, silver, gold, British Medallion and Blue Ribband medals in ballroom. She then went into formation dancing on the series when she was , under the reign of trainer Jim Graham. The Jim Graham formation team were Scottish Champions for three years and represented Scotland at the British Open Amateur Championships in Blackpool until the team disbanded when Jim emigrated to Canada. And the ballroom beauty even met her late husband through the art of dance. Janet said: “George and I were actually dancing at that same time. And that was how we met. “I was dancing with the team at the Albert Ballroom in Glasgow, which is no longer there, and he walked up and spoke to me. “It wasn’t very often you got chatted up by a man in white bow tie and tails.”  Although George never danced on TV, he was Janet’s partner when the pair competed together in amateur competitions. And she even learned a new style to compete alongside her love. She added: “I remember we were also having private lessons because he had done Ballroom and Latin American but I didn’t know anything about Latin American so we went for lessons so we could compete in the Latin American status as well.” Janet remembers nervously waiting for her team to appear on television, as the formation dancers were the last to feature. She said: “In the original Come Dancing there was a modern ballroom section, where somebody danced the Waltz or the Foxtrot or Tango. “And then there was a Latin American section and they either did the Cha Cha, Rumba or another dance. “The Jive was in the off-beat section and that got points as well. “And then the formation team were the last to go on. “Now they don’t do it that way. “But we were dancing against maybe north east England or south of England, and they were filmed in their ballroom and we were filmed in the La Cava in Glasgow. “The dresses that I wore were the team dresses but when the team was disbanded nobody said ‘give us them back’ or whatever as the trainer went to Canada.”  Now the dancer will display a few of her dresses for fans of the original series or for those with the Strictly fever. On display will also be Janet’s yellow dresswhich she wore when she danced as an amateur with husband George. “There’s a wee bit of history to that dress,” said Janet. “My formation team trainer Jim Graham was actually the Scottish Open professional champion in Ballroom. “And he and his we May competed and that was May’s dress so I bought it from her. Looking back on her time on the series, Janet added: “There’s a lot more dress than flesh in these days. “They were big and puffy and layers and layers of net and jewelled skirt. “Now when you watch it, although I enjoy it, they’ve not got much dress on! “I think I preferred it my way but I suppose that’s natural. Janet admitted Ballroom was always her favourite style of dancing, and she was sad when the Come Dancing series had come to an end. She added: “I missed it but I still enjoy watching it.” You can view Janet’s dresses at the Carnegie Library until October .

Cruel yobs smashed the front window of hair and beauty salon Head Kandi on Dalrymple Street. But after recent news that CCTV cameras are in working order, salon owner Claire Taylor was told the opposite - meaning the heartless vandals may get away with it. And now she is calling for action. Claire, , told the Post: “The police woke me up at three in the morning and said “your windows been smashed in”. “I was in shock. “The police told me it happened between am and am and it was a traffic cone that got put through it. “The cone was further down the street so somebody’s lted it and brought it up. “And they told us that CCTV, there’s one right at the corner, doesn’t work. “I’ve heard from people in the town that they have been going from shop to shop for their CCTV in hopes that one has picked it up.  “Luckily it was only a smashed window but something really serious could have happened and there’s no CCTV in the town to pick it up.” The salon owner has only recently moved to her new salon, having been open less than two months. Claire added: “We’ve actually only been open six weeks as I just moved premises. “I’ve spent the past four months doing it up and then this happens. “I was pretty gutted. “A couple of weeks ago when previous vandalism happened, everyone said “oh aren’t you lucky it wasn’t yours” and then that happens. “We had shutters on the windows but took them off because they were damaged when we got the property. “And everyone kept saying “oh you should get shutters back up”, but I thought in this day and age nobody smashes windows  “And how wrong was I. “I definitely would like to see them get punished and fined to teach them a lesson. “They can’t go round and do that.  “And the time and money that’s went in- they should be punished for that.” Now the business owner of eight years is calling for proper working CCTV. She added: “But the camera situation definitely needs something done about it. “It’s  now, we should have some sort of better technology. “A couple of weeks ago councillors confirmed the CCTV does work but the police told me it doesn’t - so we’re unsure what the issue is. “We’ve now went and arranged to get CCTV put in the shop ourselves in case of further vandalism, but we shouldn’t really need to do that.” A Police spokesman commented: “Police Scotland received a report of a vandalism to a business property in Dalrymple Street, Girvan during the early hours of Saturday, September . “PC Munro of Girvan Response policing team is conducting robust enquires into the matter. “Anyone with information is requested to contact  and quote incident number  of September ”. Girvan Community Council will be discussing the issue at this month’s meeting.

Reports that some of their friends had been seen near the town made the magistrates fear that they may try to help the prisoners escape.But what was troubling them more was the ldquoburdensome cost and inconvenience of incarcerating so many people. A decision on their fate was needed quickly.The town authorities had followed the law by putting them in prison. In fact, the law was clear that they should all be executed.But since there were women and children among them the Haddington authorities had hesitated to carry this out.They needed guidance and instruction from the Privy Council, and so a rider was dispatched with a letter asking for instructions, and the prisoners had to wait to hear of their fate. What had these people done to be under sentence of death It was nothing they had done. Their crime was who they were. They were gypsies just to be a gypsy was a capital offence.It was Arthur of Whittinghehame who had apprehended the families. The scene of this raid is not recorded.Was it a night raid, dragging women and children from their tents  Had they been families passing en route or camped nearby. Whole families were taken, but perhaps some escaped.Those who fled were perhaps the ones later seen near Haddington, worried and concerned about the fate of those imprisoned. No resistance seems to have been offered, forit had, the violence would have certainly been noted and used against them.They were accused of no crime other than that of being gypsies. It was a Privy Council edict in  which first declared the death penalty for being a gypsy in Scotland.It was written into statue by an act in .The Act called on all ldquogood subjects to apprehend gypsies and for the local authorities to imprison them and ldquoexecute to death the said Egyptians, either men or women. .And so these families were victims of a law that aimed to ethnically cleanse Scotland of gypsies. The Act was motivated by racist hatred and the only evidence needed to condemn someone to death was a Gypsy name, being known as a gypsy, or just associating with known gypsies.When the reply from the Privy Council arrived it was brutally clear in its instructions.It said there was a need to set an example to ldquothe rest of that infamous byke, thereby comparing gypsies to a nest of wasps or hornets.It continued: ldquoThe lords of secret counsel ordains the sherf of Haddington or his deputes to pronounce doom and sentence of death upon the men, and the women without children ldquothe men to be hangit and the women to be drowned.The women with children were to be spared death, but were to be ldquoscourgit threw the burgh of Haddington and burnt on the cheek.They would then be banished from Scotland. The Provost and bailies of Haddington were ordered to speedily carry out this sentence as stated. We can only assume these instructions were adhered to with little delay. If so, the executions will have been in public, and must have been a scene of horror, possibly witnessed by the friends and relatives.They were not the first gypsy families to suffer this persecution. In fact a number of gypsy families living in the Roslin area of Midlothian had previously been rounded up in . They had committed no crimes and kept a low profile. The Privy Council even complained that they were living ldquoasthey were lawful subjects. Their crime however, was to be ldquopart of an outlawed race and they were taken to Edinburghrsquos Tolbooth. The men were hanged and the women and children were banished from Scotland forever under pain of death.The aim of the persecution was to rid Scotland of Gypsies all together. So Gypsy families found themselves living like the wolf, hunted and in constant danger of capture. The Act of  was only part of it. An even earlier edict had empowered the masters of salt pans and coal mines to capture and enslave gypsies and other ldquovagabonds for servitude in the mines and salt pans.Many miners and salt panners at that time would have been enslaved gypsies. In many ways, their experience of state persecution and social discrimination mirrored that of the MacGregors, a Highland clan who were proscribed at much the same time.And like the MacGregors many gypsy families changed their names to avoid being identied.Others felt forced to changed their lestyle and hide their true identity, while some lived on the edge, with a constant risk of imprisonment or death. This was why there was a concentration of gypsy families close to the English border, as the laws were dferent in England.The attempt to exterminate gypsies from Scotland failed, they survived despite the persecution.But most of the misery and injustice caused remains unrecorded by history, although is not unforgotten by the gypsy community.In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries gypsies often shared the road with other travellers, many from the Highlands or Ireland, creating a gypsy traveller tradition with distinct cultural dferences between them, but a shared ldquonon-settled lestyle.But even when the laws were no longer enforced, the social attitudes towards gypsies and then also travellers excluded them.They were too dferent in the way they looked and dressed, and especially in the way they lived their lives. They had their own language and didnrsquot fit in. So I was told when I was wee.I grew up with derogatory comments in the playground about lsquoTinksrsquo and lsquoGyposrsquo. Such attitudes had been passed down by adults. Without knowing it I absorbed the idea that they were a people not to be trusted or liked. It was all self evident to me at the time because so many people were saying it.The truth is, of course, no community is all good or all bad, and choosing to select something bad to justy a blanket prejudice of a people is racism and intolerance of dference. I was angry later that I had been taught to demonise a people I knew nothing about. I discovered their history, not just their persecution, but their cultural and economic contribution to our country. Gypsies and travellers are rightly proud of their traditions, and I believe they are not ldquoother, but an important part of Scottish le and culture.It is sad that so many gypsy and traveller families, even today, hide their identity because of the discrimination they may face. And that discrimination still remains entrenched I think. I overheard a very loud ldquodiscussion about gypsies on a bus last week in which derogatory terms were used to describe them.It reminded me of things I was told when I was younger, and which I once believed to be true. It echoed the language used in the  Act and made my spine shiver.I didnrsquot challenge these comments, but I think I should have, constructively and politely. But to be honest I was afraid to.Irsquom ashamed about that ndash silence is the ground on which intolerance and hatred can grow."},{"url":null,"title":"bid-brewing-for-coffee-shop-and-drive-through-takeaway","story":"The Motor Fuel Group has applied to East Lothian Council for planning consent for the outlet on land to the west of the existing Shell petrol filling station on Edinburgh Road.

In our view, putting this substation on the foreshore will detract from the possibility to fully develop the site.The Reporter will now consider they representations before making a decision on the next stage of her investigation.Local ward Councillor Lachlan Bruce praised the community council representatives for their presentations to the Reporter.He added: ldquoI was very disappointed by the applicantrsquos dismissive views on what has been suggested for by the local communities for the site.ldquoLots of ideas have been put forward that would create jobs and opportunities on the site and they should be given all due considerations and not just knocked to the wayside so that they can build their big shed that will create no real employment opportunities for the local area.ldquoIrsquom still confident that the Reporter will find that this isnrsquot the best location of substation at Cockenzie and I can only hope that Scottish Government Ministers will make the best decision for the people of East Lothian which is for rejection of this application, I have my doubts that they will."},{"url":null,"title":"our-community-kitchen-tackling-social-isolation-in-haddington","story":"Our Community Kitchen was formed earlier this year as an intergenerational project, which was developed by Dementia Friendly East Lothian.The group was awarded funds from The Big Lottery, with the project, which meets each Tuesday at Haddington Bowling Club, on the townrsquos Wemyss Place, now looking to branch out to become its own organisation.Elaine Gale, from the project, said: ldquoOur Community Kitchen has been incredibly popular since beginning at the bowling club in February this year.ldquoWe have been offered a home within the club including full use of kitchen facilities plus a large area for dining.ldquoWe have developed a wonderful relationship with the committee at the club who are supportive and committed to Our Community Kitchen sharing the space with them.The kitchen currently operates each Tuesday from .pm and plans to expand to three or four days each week from January.Donations of homemade bread, napkins and juice have been made to the group, as well as fruit, which has been turned into jam and pies.The group has also been supported by Haddington and Lammermuir Area Partnership .Funding was awarded to enable the group to continue into the New Year, with plans being drawn up serve a Christmas meal and purchase a new oven at the bowling club.Craig McLachlan, the area partnership chairman, said: ldquoHaddington and Lammermuir Area Partnership are focused on addressing inequalities and poverties across our area and these ambitions are being addressed through the work of our area plan.ldquoOne of the main inequalities that we are seeking to address is around social isolation.ldquoOur area has a growing elderly population, where one in five residents is currently aged  and over and, in addition, there are many new houses being built in and around the town so we need to find ways to help these new residents become involved in, and part of, our community.ldquoOur Community Kitchen are doing excellent work to address this, and other inequalities.ldquoHaddington and Lammermuir Area Partnership are therefore delighted to give them our full support."},{"url":null,"title":"leuchie-houses-retiring-ceo-mairi-okeefe-praised-by-politicians","story":"Mrs OrsquoKeefe will stand down from the helm of the national respite centre next month, south of North Berwick,  years after she took on the role.And Iain Gray MSP and his Westminster counterpart Martin Whitfield MP have both praised her work.Mr Gray, East Lothianrsquos representative at Holyrood since , told the Courier: ldquoIt has been a great pleasure to work with Mairi at Leuchie House over the last few years.ldquoFrom campaigning to save Leuchie from closure to securing signicant funding to keep it going, she has been the driving force behind the unique facilityrsquos success.ldquoMairi and her team have also helped put North Berwick and East Lothian on the map, with many hundreds of people from across Scotland and beyond remembering it fondly for the warm welcome and superb care and hospitality they enjoy at Leuchie.ldquoI know that Mairirsquos retirement as CEO will not mean the end of her involvement at Leuchie, but she will certainly be a very hard act to follow and I wish her all the very best for the future.And Mr Whitfield praised Mrs OrsquoKeefe for her ldquopassion, knowledge and commitment to Leuchiersquos success.He told the Courier: ldquoWhat she and her team have achieved in establishing Leuchie as a very well thought of independent charity is remarkable and she fully deserves all of the praise and plaudits she has received over the years.

It reflects the critical role the Carbon Metric has come to play in measuring and reducing the environmental impacts of Scotlandrsquos waste, something that Terry ArsquoHearn, SEPA Chief Executive, has said it will ldquohelp us target our efforts to deliver One Planet Prosperity.Food waste contributes more to Scotlandrsquos waste carbon impacts than any other waste type, so itrsquos important that we avoid wasting food, and recycle the waste we canrsquot avoid. Food waste comprised % of household waste in . Despite an overall reduction in household food waste, Scots recycled more food waste than ever before, up % from just one year earlier.In total, Scottish households prevented almost , tonnes of food waste from going to landfill through food waste recycling.The increase in recycling rates is due to more household food waste recycling collections being rolled out by Scotlandrsquos local authorities ndash good news in terms of preventing food waste, which could be turned into energy through anaerobic digestion, from heading to landfill sites where it emits harmful greenhouse gases.Zero Waste Scotland has also published the  Carbon Metric, which contains data on both household and commercial and industrial waste. Importantly, as it includes all data for  this report demonstrates the disproportionate impact of household waste on the carbon impacts of Scotlandrsquos total waste.While household waste only made up % of Scotlandrsquos waste by weight, it accounted for % of total waste carbon impacts. This makes preventing and recycling household waste especially important. The Carbon Metric shows the progress that is being made in Scotland on recycling and the real impact that is having on tackling climate change.Those changes come in part from improvements and extensions to household recycling services offered by local authorities, but itrsquos also testament to the extra efforts that people in Scotland are going to, to make sure more is being recycled. If we are to make meaningful headway in tackling climate change, the Carbon Metric shows that waste prevention and recycling are crucial, and in that, each one of us has an important role to play.In association with ...The Scottish EnvironmentProtection Agency A non-departmental public body of the Scottish Government oversees environmental regulation, monitors and reports on the state of the environment, raises awareness of environmental issues, and resolves environmental harms.Zero Waste ScotlandA publicly-funded organisation working towards a society where resources are valued and nothing is wasted.

But it is thought that most of the regulatory checks would be done at company premises or via a trusted-trade scheme.Tomorrow, Mr Barnier is due to meet politicians from Northern Ireland in Brussels. Dominic Raab, the Brexit Secretary, is expected to travel to the Belgian capital in the next few days to present the Governmentrsquos new Chequers Plan.Yet whatever deal the PM brokers with Brussels has to get through Westminster, where the majority leans to a softer Brexit approach. If Mrs May is to succeed, it could be that in the final vote, and with MPs faced with her deal agreed with the EU or no-deal, she has to rely on Labour Remainers, defying Jeremy Corbyn, to push her agreement through.Despite all the dficulties, there appears to be real optimism in Brussels that a Brexit deal can be done by the October   summit. One senior EU diplomat said: ldquoIt will be long hours and it may get messy but there will be a deal. The cost of no-deal is just too big."},{"url":null,"title":"strike-ballots-likely-as-teacher-pay-talks-stall","story":"Teaching unions said ballots for industrial action were now \"likely\" after the Scottish Government and council umbrella body Cosla refused to improve the latest offer.Teachers are currently being offered a three per cent pay increase which has been described as \"derisory\" by unions.In addition, the Scottish Government is offering an extra pound million to fund a wider shake-up of pay structures which would mean more money for teachers at the top and bottom end of the scale.However, teaching unions are campaigning for a ten per cent increase for all staff, arguing pay has been eroded signicantly over the past decade.They also want improvements to salary scales to make teaching more attractive, but argue this should be in addition to a signicant increase for all teachers.A spokesman for the teachersrsquo side of the negotiations - which includes the Educational Institute of Scotland and the Scottish Secondary Teachers Association - said: \"We are extremely disappointed that both the Scottish Government and Cosla have rejected the proposals put to them by the teachersrsquo side, which would have kept negotiations going, and have opted instead to end discussions.\"In a week when the Scottish Government found the money to pay upfront a . per cent offer to Scottish police officers, it now claims to be unable to find any additional money for teachers.\"The statement said teaching unions would now consider the outcome of todayrsquos talks \"with member ballots being likely\".The salaries committee of the EIS, which has already unanimously rejected the offer, is set to hold an emergency meeting next week to discuss the consultative ballot of members.Larry Flanagan, general secretary of the EIS, said: \"It is shameful that Scottish ministers have walked away from the negotiating table in this manner.\"The EIS, and other unions, had offered constructive proposals for Government and Coslato consider, but in rejecting them out of hand, ministers have effectively dismissed the concerns of Scottish teachers.ldquoThe prospect of industrial unrest in Scotlandrsquos schools has moved a signicant step closer as a result of the governmentrsquos abandonment of talks.The Scottish Government and Cosla have been contacted for comment."},{"url":null,"title":"charity marks opening of new headquarters","story":"A north east charity held an official opening ceremony last week to celebrate its new headquarters.Community organisation Grampian Opportunities recently made the move from Inverurie’s High Street to its new location on West High Street.The organisation had been located on the town’s High Street for the last  years.The new premises was officially opened by George Ross, founder and executive chairman of JG Ross Bakers, on Friday, September .Mr Ross cut the ribbon and he was assisted by Grampian Opportunities director Ray Strachan and chairman Morris Perkin.Speaking to the Herald at the event, Mr Strachan said: “This is the start of a new era for Grampian Opportunities.“Now we have the room to facilitate a lot more volunteers and clients as our last office was too small - as the workloads increased we found that we were beginning to climb over each other.”Mr Strachan added: “This new office gives us everything that we need, including disabled access.“It will also give us a chance to help more people not just in Inverurie but across Grampian.“Our staff have been brilliant and we wouldn’t have managed to get here without them, and I would like to extend my thanks to Mr Ross for opening the new building and donating our refreshments here today.”Before the opening event, Grampian Opportunities held a coffee morning in aid of Macmillan Cancer Support and it raised around £.data-src\"https:res. jpress image fetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..!

His parents, Josiah and Margaret , had lost  children in infancy.Josiah had two spells as provost of Wick and succeeded Robert Innes of Thrumster as agent for the Commercial Bank.

This places Orkney third nationwide in terms of the highest empty property rates — behind Shetland and Western Isles specically.Councillor Rob Crichton, chair of the council#s education, leisure and housing committee, said: #Empty homes represent a signicant drain on rural communities, affecting their ability to rejuvenate and grow. They can, however, be utilised to directly counter the issues they once caused.#An empty home brought back into use as a primary residence represents another family in the community, potentially more children in local schools, and more money spent at local businesses.#The document is available at http:www.orkney.gov.uk Council C empty-homes-strategy-consultation.htm and is under consultation until Wednesday, October , at pm.Any comments should be submitted to Rachael Bowes, Empty Homes Development Officer via email rachael.bowes@orkney.gov.uk.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The access road also features a bell-shaped junction at its far end, opening up the possibility that nearby land may also be developed in the futurethe site went ahead.The Fortrose and Rosemarkie Community Council has unanimously opposed the proposals, citing concerns over its location within a designated buffer zone that is designed to keep Fortrose and Rosemarkie from merging into one.Chairman Tom Heath said the community council felt the application fell foul of two elements of the local development plan, the first of which was its location.He added: ldquoThe second is that we were concerned of the effects it would have on the rest of the High Street and the viability of the remainder of the businesses on High Street [ it relocated].Those reactions have been shared by some residents, who have been responding to a consultation launched by the community council.While many welcomed the prospect of a larger Co-op store and greater iety on its shelves, others raised fears that the existing High Street shoprsquos off-street car park could be lost in the move ndash forcing cars to park on the main road and putting greater pressure on this notorious traffic bottleneck.Others shared the community councilrsquos argument that the development is on land zoned as off-limits in the local development plan.Fears had been raised that a decision last year by Highland councillors to approve a new poundmillion care home within this buffer zone would set a precedent that opened up the wider area to development. It was passed despite the objection of planning officers.And this concern was shared by some of the public.Responding on Facebook to the community councilrsquos call for comment, Gail Paterson said: ldquoIt will kill Fortrose High Streetallowed. The care homehas set a precedent so canrsquot see how this can be knocked back and from there on in the land will go to housing without the infrastructure being sorted out.Bridget Gerstner added: ldquoThe shop would be nice but not there. This is the foot in the door. Once we agree to this site, there will be no stopping building on the land between Fortrose and Rosemarkie.Mr Heath said the community council had taken fears over the care homersquos impact on the buffer zone to council officers last year, and that they had been given assurances that its approval would not set a precedent.- Share your view.

A report to councillors explained how monitoring of public buildings fitted with solar  was incomplete and that some ldquodata was calculated for two sites that had actually been deleted from the process the previous year.Worse still, despite previous agreed management action, ldquono record of eligible sites has been established, the report stated. It added: ldquoThere is no definitive site list. There is no robust system in place to capture meter readings for renewable energy from photovoltaic solar .Mr Black offered an apology for the auditrsquos revelations.Council leader Margaret Davidson told colleagues: ldquoOur carbon emissions are more than they should be and itrsquos costing us a lot of money. That canrsquot be changed unless wersquove got accurate management and record keeping.She said she would request that officials review the processes, how decisions are made within the relevant department and the scrutiny of the work it does.Speaking afterwards, councillor Roddy Balfour, a colleague in the minority independent administration said it amounted to ldquogross incompetence.He said he hoped the audit and scrutiny committee, which is chaired by opposition SNP councillor Graham MacKenzie, would ensure that the issues would be urgently addressed and keep the council within national guidelines associated with climate change policies.Highlands and Islands Green MSP John Finnie, a former councillor, said: ldquoThe councilrsquos latest bungle is seriously concerning. Itrsquos failed to collect data which is necessary to assess its contribution to tackling climate change. A commitment that lsquoit would not be allowed to happen for a fourth successive yearrsquo is cold comfort.

Brian Ferguson meets the team behind Long Shadows # including the latest Rebus # ahead of its Scottish runIt has been more than  years since Inspector Rebus cracked his first case.Now Ian Rankin is preparing for the prospect of seeing his creation in the flesh for the first time.Fans of the grizzled Edinburgh detective will be able to see him in a whole new light from this week when the character finally makes his stage debut.Long Shadows, the first Rebus story to be penned with another writer, has seen Rankin collaborate with Rona Munro, the Aberdeen-born playwright best known for her epic historical trilogy The James Plays. The show, which will premiere at Birmingham Rep tonight before a King’s Theatre run on Rebus’s home turf next month, is not only a brand new Rebus story. Devotees of the retired detective will also get the chance to see him lock horns on stage with his long-time nemesis, Maurice “Big Ger” Cafferty.The characters will be brought to le by Coronation Street veteran Charlie Lawson, the Northern Irish actor known to millions of viewers as Jim McDonald, and Scottish Game of Thrones star John Stahl, with award-winning actress Cathy Tyson, who shot to fame in film debut Mona Lisa, playing Rebus’s long-time sidekick Siobhan Clarke.Long Shadows is Rankin’s second venture into the world of theatre after writing Dark Road, which Rebus was noticeably absent from, for the Royal Lyceum Theatre in Edinburgh five years ago with then artistic director, Mark Thomson. Rankin and Munro, who had never previously met, began working together on a story after the author was approached by London-based producer Daniel Schumann with the idea of a Rebus stage play.Rankin says: “I felt it would be an awful lot of work and didn’t feel confident writing for the stage on my own, but told him I would be happy doing it with someone .“He mentioned Rona Munro to me. I was a huge fan of her work like The James Plays, but didn’t know her at all. We met up a few times and got on like a house on fire. “She was a fan of the books, which helped, but we decided early on that we didn’t want to adapt any of them. “You can tie yourself up in knots trying to adapt something that wasn’t specically written for the stage. The Rebus novels usually have -odd characters, three or four twisty sub-plots and are hundreds of pages long.“I came up with the outline of a story and we would go for cups of tea and lunches and just brainstorm it. Once we had what we thought was the right plot she went away and did the dialogue.”Munro, whose previous stage plays include The Last Witch, about the last woman to be executed in Britain, and has written Doctor Who stories for TV, jumped at the chance to work with Rankin. She says: “My mother was a monster Ian Rankin fan. I resisted reading them for such a long time. I always felt I was such a disappointment in comparison!“Crime is a genre that I enjoy reading, but I’m picky. The ones I like I absolutely love, but there is an awful lot of rubbish out there.“But Ian writes proper novels and Rebus is such a complicated character. If you read the books you get the opportunity to follow him over all those years and I think that’s part of the attraction. I actually went back and re-read all the novels which featured Cafferty in preparation for working on the play.“I’ve never done anything like this, which is writing in another writer’s style with another writer’s characters.“The writing of it was over a year ago, but it felt quite easy at the time, I think because I had someone ’s plot to lean on. I can do dialogue and character any day of the week, but having a tight plot is something I struggle with. It was a bit of a dream in that sense.”Long Shadows, which is described by Rankin as a “psychodrama,” sees Rebus and Cafferty thrust together again after the daughter of a murder victim turns up on the doorstep of the retired detective, who has been investigating cold cases for several years.Rankin explains: “I really like the idea of a crime that has happened in the past suddenly rearing its head again in the present.“There’s some unfinished business between Rebus and Cafferty over an old case and an investigation Siobhan is working brings it to light again, which leads to Rebus and Cafferty locking horns.“It is really a psychological game, with these two heavyweights kind of dancing around each other.“I love the idea of being able to see Rebus in the flesh and actually be physically in the same room as him, especially to see him slugging it out with Cafferty. “They are two big meaty roles – two men who are at a certain point in their lives where they are starting to ask big questions about what is left for them and their place in the world.”Lawson adds: “Rebus and Cafferty’s ‘friendship’ has been built up over  years. They’re very much like Holmes and Moriarty. You can see there is grudging respect for each other, but by the same token they are also battling like two bulls in a ring.”Lawson freely admits he has come to the role without reading any of Rankin’s novels and knowing nothing about the character.But the -year-old is more than familiar with Rebus’s home city – and his favourite watering hole – since his first visit early  years ago.“I have actually known the Oxford Bar since .“My cousin Sandy, who was actually my best mate as well, lived on Heriot Row and used to drink in all these haunts like the Ox, the Hebrides and the West End Hotel. I remember Willie Ross, the landlord of the Ox, didn’t allow any women in the bar and would quite easily fling people out at the drop of a hat.“I met loads of retired police officers there. It was full of very smart alcoholics who did The Scotsman crossword.“I appeared at the Assembly Rooms during the Edinburgh Festival in  in a show called Diary of a Hunger Strike and have been to Edinburgh many, many times, since then – it’s honestly my favourite city in the world.”Lawson concedes that all he knew about the character of Rebus when he was offered the part in the play, without the need for an audition, was that he had been played by John Hannah and Ken Stott in the TV incarnations of some of Rankin’s early novels.He adds: “It was one of those things that was a ‘yes’ straight away. You don’t turn something like this down. You need to really challenge yourself now and again as an actor.“I’m quite glad I was unfamiliar with the character. You don’t want to bring baggage like that with you to a role. I approached it with a blank sheet of paper from day one. I’m right in the thick of it now.“The complexities of Rebus are obvious. We’re not doing some existential piece. His faults are all there, warts and all, from page one.”Rankin is at pains to point out to his fans that the new play is set in a “parallel world” to the one created in his novels.He adds: “There are basically going to be two audiences – people who know and love Rebus and people who just want a good night out at the theatre and might never have read any of the books.“It slots into the Rebus universe. You get a bit more of Cafferty’s back story and a bit more of Rebus’s working relationship with Siobhan Clarke.“It’s a really great cast and \u2028it will hopefully bring in people who know them but might \u2028not know me. I might get a few new fans out of it, you never know.”A LIFE OF CRIME: REBUS IN PRINT AND ON SCREENInspector John Rebus made his debut in Ian Rankin’s second novel, Knots and Crosses, which was published in March .The Fe-born author had begun writing novels while he was supposed to be working towards a PhD in Scottish literature at Edinburgh University.Rankin was said to have been surprised that the first Rebus thriller was classied as crime fiction when he had set out to write a modern-day version of Robert Louis Stevenson’s Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.Rankin has admitted Rebus was actually killed off in the first draft of Knots and Crosses and he was persuaded by his publisher to revive the character in another novel.The character has appeared in a further  novels since then, despite an apparent swan song more than a decade ago in Exit Music, which signalled his official retirement from the force.However, after a five-year hiatus, Rankin has gone on to revive the character in another four novels, which have seen Rebus help serving detectives to investigate unresolved “cold cases.”As well as the new stage play, Rankin is about to publish a brand new Rebus novel, In a House of Lies.More than  million Rebus novels are believed to have been sold around the world, while the books have been translated into  dferent languages to date.The most recent Rebus novel, Rather be the Devil, topped the best-seller charts for hardback fiction when it was released in November . New Rebus novels are said to sell as many as half a million copies within just a few months of printing.Rankin, his publisher Orion and the Edinburgh International Book Festival marked the th anniversary of the detective last year by staging a three-day festival in the character’s home city.The first “RebusFest” included masterclasses, workshops, tours, live music and film events, and an exhibition of rarely-seen archive material.Rankin’s novels have previously been adapted for television by STV Productions, with John Hannah and then Ken Stott playing the leading role.However production was brought to a halt in  amid reports Stott had decided he did not want to continue in the role.It was announced last year that Gregory Burke, the writer of the hit plays Gagarin Way and Black Watch, was working on a new “contemporary adaptation” of Rebus for TV. Speaking at the Edinburgh International Book Festival this year, Rankin revealed that a much younger actor than Stott was likely to play the role when Rebus s to the nation’s TV screens. The character was said to be  when he first appeared in Knots and Crosses.Other actors to play Rebus include Ron Donachie, who starred as the detective in Radio ’s dramatisations of some of the novels, while James MacPherson, who is best-known for his long-running role in Taggart, has narrated audiobook versions of the novels.Rankin, who was awarded the OBE in  for services to literature, has been the recipient of honorary degrees from the universities of Abertay, St Andrews, Hull and Edinburgh.Rebus: Long Shadows opens at Birmingham Rep tonight, and will be at the King’s Theatre, Edinburgh from - October www.capitaltheatres and His Majesty’s Theatre in Aberdeen from - November www.aberdeenperformingarts.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4802813.1537437079!/image/image.jpg","title":"massive tapestry depicting games of thrones goes on display in glasgow","story":"A huge Game of Thrones embroidery commissioned by the producers of the series has gone on display at a university in Glasgow.The tapestry, measuring five metres long and four metres tall, took more than , hours to produce and involved  volunteers.The piece was produced by The Embroiderers’ Guild after HBO Home Entertainment TV Network, the company which produces Game of Thrones, contacted them and asked for a special artwork to form the backdrop to the DVD release of the show’s fth series.They stitched a tapestry featuring an intense battle scene - the massacre of Hardhome - and featuring a White Walker, one of the show’s central antagonists.• : Emmys: A win for Claire Foy as Game of Thrones retakes crownThe embroidery goes on display at Glasgow Caledonian University ’s Saltire Centre from September  and will remain on show to students, staff and members of the public until it is put up for auction in February .Anthea Godfrey, Embroiderers’ Guild artistic director and project manager, said: “This has been an amazing project that truly has brought the embroidery community together across the whole of the UK.“We are really proud to have been involved.”• : HBO teases fans with Game Of Thrones footage ahead of final seasonThe Embroiderers’ Guild has close links with GCU dating back  years, especially through its fashion programmes.John Cook, GCU media professor, added: “Game of Thrones is one of the biggest TV shows on the planet right now.“Aside from those who avidly consume it in box-sets, many even stay up half the night to watch when each new episode drops on UK TV.“I’m sure this embroidery will attract a great deal of interest  particularly from those who can’t wait until  and the release of the final season of GoT.”©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4809528.1538591932!/image/image.jpg","title":"tom peterkin on this issue richard leonard must stand up to corbyn","story":"Richard Leonard should stand up to the Labour party in London over the defamation case against Kezia Dugdale, writes Tom Peterkin.Kezia Dugdale may no longer be the leader of Scottish Labour but she has retained a knack for grabbing the headlines.Perhaps it should be no surprise that the Lothians MSP has failed to slide unobtrusively to the relative obscurity of the backbenches. She is, after all, the politician who decided that drinking an ostrich anus smoothie with a bunch of Z-listers in the jungle was preferable to supping from the poisoned chalice that became the Scottish Labour leadership. But unlike her controversialappearance on ITV’s “I’m a Celebrity”, the latest stushie to engulf Ms Dugdale is not one she wished upon herself.As her recent outbursts demonstrate, the £, defamation action she faces from the pro-independence blogger Stuart Campbell is a complication that is causing her much anxiety.Aside for the personal toll the legal action is taking on Ms Dugdale, her travails have serious repercussions for her successor Richard Leonard.Ms Dugdale’s defamation drama is rapidly turning into Mr Leonard’s leadership crisis.The turn of events that has raised questions about Mr Leonard’s stewardship of the party is a convoluted tale that has its origins in a column written by Ms Dugdale for the Daily Record.In one of her weekly contributions to the tabloid newspaper, Ms Dugdale described a tweet posted by Mr Campbell, the author of the “Wings Over Scotland” website, as “homophobic”. Mr Campbell’s tweet referred to the Tory MSP Oliver Mundell, the son of David Mundell, the Scottish Secretary who revealed that he was homosexual around two and a half years ago. According to Mr Campbell’s tweet, Oliver Mundell was “the sort of public speaker that makes you wish his dad had embraced his sexuality sooner”.: David Mundell says he’ll support Kezia Dugdale in legal battleMr Campbell took umbrage at Ms Dugdale’s characterisation, denies his remarks were homophobic and is set to challenge the Labour MSP in court.As those who have been following this saga closely know, the Daily Record offered Ms Dugdale legal support when Mr Campbell’s action was launched. But then the newspaper’s lawyers met with Labour officials, who were adamant that the party should deal with it. Labour took on an agency, assembled a team of lawyers and told the Record to step aside.Things began to go awry for Ms Dugdale when it was revealed that, after paying out £,, the UK Labour party had decided to stop paying Ms Dugdale’s legal costs. She gave a series of interviews in which she talked about feeling crushed by her own party. Should the case go against her, she revealed she feared losing her house or even going bankrupt – an outcome that would cost the Labour MSP her job. Jeremy Corbyn was accused of ignoring her approaches for help as she suggested the decision was down to Jenny Formby, Labour’s new general secretary who happens to be close to the UK leader. This unseemly row was the cue for all manner of internal wrangling with allies of Ms Dugdale questioning why Labour was abandoning one of their own, mid court case. In response, the UK party has said it has a responsibility to all its members to spend party funds responsibly – the suggestion being that the cash would be better spent on campaigning in anticipation of another snap election.Since Labour pulled the plug on financing Ms Dugdale’s case, the Daily Record has said it has “reinstated” legal support for the former Scottish leader, although reports suggest Ms Dugdale could remain liable for Mr Campbell’s damages and costs should she lose.: Labour hits back in Kezia Dugdale legal fees rowRegardless ofand how Ms Dugdale’s costs are met, there is an important point of principle at stake here. Surely a political party should back its politicians to the hilt, particularly when being challenged by an online opponent who specialises in highly provocative blogs.But to the dismay of many Labour MSPs, Mr Leonard’s has remained tight-lipped about the whole sorry state of affairs. His silence reached deafening levels at a meeting of MSPs this week where Ms Dugdale’s supporters clashed with a noisy minority of left-wing members who are said to back the decision to halt the legal funding.Apparently Mr Leonard asked Ms Formby to reverse the decision, but was given short shrt. It is not a good look for an elected leader,he is unable to change the mind of a paid official. Furthermore, the Scottish Labour leader asked for a statement indicating his MSPs’ support for Ms Dugdale to be altered so that it did not include a specic call for the party to meet her full legal costs.None of this bodes well for Mr Leonard’s leadership. Whatever one’s views of Ms Dugdale – and it is true to say she is not everybody’s cup of ostrich anus smoothie – she deserves much better than this.Granted there are those who found her resignation as party leader and jungle-antics unhelpful. But this is an effective and elected LGBT Labour politician who stepped up to the leadership when few others wanted the toughest job in Scottish politics. For that, she should receive credit and protection.By failing to stand up for his predecessor, Mr Leonard does little to dispell the notion that he is in thrall to Mr Corbyn and his party is little more than a “branch office” of London. And what of the left’s much-vaunted commitment to solidarity  As one Labour MSP put it: “This should be about solidarity, rather than hanging someone out to dry.”©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4799827.1538641690!/image/image.jpg","title":"rbs boss says no deal brexit could spark recession","story":"The chief executive of the partly taxpayer-owned Royal Bank of Scotland has said a no-deal Brexit could lead to recession.Ross McEwan, appointed CEO in October , told the BBC any dip in growth would affect the bank’s profits and share price.UK Government Investments holds a .% of RBS shares after the  bailout and subsequent disposals.: No-deal Brexit could lead to break up UK, it is claimedMr McEwan told the broadcaster: “We are assuming -.% growth for next year butwe get a bad Brexit then that could be zero or negative and that would affect our profitability and our share price.”He added that the bank was becoming more cautious with its lending - and large companies were delaying investment decisions.: Theresa May says good Brexit deal will end austerityHe said: “Big businesses are pausing, they are saying that in six months time I’ll have another look at the UK and I might come back, butit’s really bad I’ll invest where - that’s the reality of where we are today.”Last month, the potential consequences of a no-deal Brexit were spelled out by Bank of England governor Mark Carney at a special meeting of the Cabinet when he warned ministers of a % crash in house prices over three years in a worst-case scenario.Speaking in Dublin after the meeting, Mr Carney said the Bank had used its “stress test” to ensure UK banks could continue toin the event of a “disorderly” Brexit.“The Bank of England is well prepared for whatever path the economy takes, including a wide range of potential Brexit outcomes,” he said.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4808321.1538471984!/image/image.jpg","title":"search on for next batch of oil and gas tech pioneers","story":"Aberdeen#s Oil  Gas Technology Centre has pushed the button on its latest TechX Pioneers programme # one of the biggest of its kind.The accelerator and incubator initiative is backed by more than  industry partners and mentors and will allow a select group of start-ups to take their technology to the global oil and gas market more rapidly.Applications have now opened for the Pioneer programme which will provide up to £, for early-stage tech ventures with no equity or payback, with the developers retaining all intellectual property.BP Ventures has confirmed that it will be the strategic partner for the programme for the second year running.

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work.

Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking.

On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a - win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.Hunter also played in the legendary - victory in Orkney  years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.Sinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and  in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late s and early s is something .From  to  he played in just over  matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.Sinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in , apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.Another who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented  wins in  matches, the only blip being a - draw in Orkney.Then he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.Len Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on  caps and how he went out on a high.But the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.That is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely dferent.: : : : : : : :Did the best team really win the World Cup  That question has been asked theand breadth of the country after France’s - victory over Croatia on Sunday.Personally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it - was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced. predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.France were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.As for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.After England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twitever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.A group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team  I don’t think so.It happened at the World Cups of , ,  and , and also at the European Championship in . I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.Speaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.There were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great inidual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.My team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut CourtoisBenjamin Pad , Raphaël Varane , Diego Godín , Ivan StrinicIvan Perisic , Luka Modric , Jordan Henderson , Eden HazardCristiano Ronaldo , Edinson Cavani .If anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the ing Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.: : : : : : : :Several metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.Among them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.England quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.MaybeShetland wins the Milne Cup th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street” Or did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen  raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the th anniversary of the Milne Cup.Sadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.Many supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.While it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.But despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The - scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.Molloy’s introduction  minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubtanyone  in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.But the damage had been done in the first half – at - down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.Some have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.I felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.Two years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a - defeat in Kirkwall.There is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s th birthday.It’s just a pity we have to wait a whole  months until a chance of revenge.: : : : : : : :A couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.There are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.A score of - was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.The Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.A few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.I would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.: : : : : : : :Orkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening#s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John CouttsThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over  guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.Unfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.The speeches which followed,anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.It was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.Sinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous  game when he hit the back of the net five times in the - victory.: : : : : : : :And finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.On Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.Helped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.Robert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did -odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.The others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.The final score was a - win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate - football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"big turnout to welcome the eighth serene to whalsay ","story":"The latest Serene arrives at the pier at Symbister.

They are enormous and look awful.Worth recalling that the perceived size of the blade sweepincreases as the square of the radiuse.g. increasing the bladeby . times doubles the perceived size of the blade sweep, or, increasing bladeby % increases perceived size by %John, the longer blades will increase the electrical power that each turbine can generate, giving VE more revenue.That’s as may be, but revenue does not equal profit, and by the time the unsustainable level of subsidy has been removed, the SCT have been suckered in to paying for the export cable, and SSE have ensured their pound of flesh is as great as they can get away with,Shetland will never see its money back.More of nothing is still only nothing.If they are increasing the height of the turbines,does this mean that they would need to increase the size and depth of the anchor points at what extra cost and who will pay Presumably, these are the latest models with towers and foundations redesigned, accordingly The changes should improve cost-effectiveness and presumably, VE’s intention is to improve competitiveness for the auction, which requires cutting costs to the bone and squeezing every last drop of revenue from the project to keep it viable.Given that the last round of auctions produced winning ‘strike prices’ of £.

The thought is that one MW turbine will cost less to install, own, and maintain than two MW turbines.Mr Innes, Project Director for Viking Energy, is quoted where as saying #Viking is now competing against a new generation of wind farms, including those offshore, where tip heights of m or more are now available.#In that case why doesn#t he just put these turbines offshore as well.Kay. Just a thought.Aircraft technology has advanced too and ‘planes get bigger and bigger. I suspect that miniaturisation , so beloved of the Japanese, whose watches, cameras , radios and a host of other products lead one to believe that for items to improve in performance , they need to get smaller.

And it could yet be trebles all round for PJ MacKintosh’s men who are just one win away from clinching the premiership title to make it a hat-trick of senior trophies in , having already lted the MacTavish Cup earlier in the summer.After a frantic, but fairly even opening spell in which both goalkeepers made saves Newtonmore edged ahead on  minutes, and never looked back.Evan Menzies twisted away from his marker to rle in a shot from  yards which beat Stuart MacDonald, the Lovat keeper, at his near post. It was a bitter blow for a Lovat side striving to learn the lessons from defeat in last year’s final, when a slow start proved costly.Greg Matheson, the Kiltarlity side’s talisman, had the ball in the net but his effort was rightly ruled offside in what was a frustrating day for the Lovat attack.Newtonmore continued to make better use of the ball, and the wide spaces of the Mossfield pitch, and two goals on the stroke of half time all but settled the outcome.The second goal summed up the gulf in quality over the  minutes. The danger came after Lovat’s Craig Mainland shanked a shy on the right touchline, handing Newtonmore’s Jamie Robinson the opportunity for a hit-in of his own. From there his long looping effort was flicked to Glen MacKintosh who fashioned just enough space to steer a low bouncing effort beyond the ing MacDonald.Seconds later Menzies drilled in the third – another daisy cutter which crept in at the near post.When Marc MacLachlan, who had looked Lovat’s most likely goal threat, limped off after twisting his knee early in the second half the game was up for the Kiltarlity side.Newtonmore’s defence, in which youngster Crag Ritchie excelled alongside Rory Kennedy, Andy MacKintosh and Norman Campbell, held firm and keeper Kenny Ross would enjoy a largely trouble-free afternoon in what, at the grand old age of , was his first final.MacDonald made a terric save to deny Menzies a hat-trick, but the striker’s day was complete when he was awarded the Albert Smith medal as man of the match.He said: “Once we got our noses in front, with the defence we have we were always going to be tough to break down.“Hopefully there’s more to come – two points in the next game against Oban and we win the league, and that’s our target.”Lovat manager Fraser Gallagher conceded his team had been second best.“We didn’t have enough aggression in our defending in the first half, and put ourselves under pressure,” he added. “If anyone is going to knock them off the top it’s not because Newtonmore slip-up. Other teams are going to have to raise their standard.

I wouldn’t be hereit wasn’t for the defibrillator at the community centre and someone being able to use it on me.”Three days after Cherill’s collapse, on Tuesday th June, -year-old father-of-three Ian MacLeod was out at Dores beach when he too suffered a cardiac arrest.“I’m a cub scout leader and was doing the register with another leader when I hit the dirt,” he said.“A couple of Spanish tourists who were on the beach at the time performed CPR on me and got the defib from the Dores Inn and kept on going until the ambulance arrived. It took  to  minutes to get me to Raigmore Hospital.”After being admitted on Tuesday evening, Ian was fitted with a ‘stent’the next day and was out of the hospital on Thursday to pick his children up from school.Having served in the forces and kept himself in good psychical the condition, Ian believed there was no rhyme nor reason for his illness: “I have never been overweight and I’m in decent shape, so it just shows you it could happen to anyone.”During his  years as a security guard in the Eastgate Shopping Centre in Inverness, Ian was on the other end of a defibrillator — having used one at work — and was keen to stress that when it comes to using the device there shouldn’t be anything to fear. “You can’t do any more harm to a person by using a defib, as they are in effect already dead. “I am forever grateful. All things considered, I could have died and there would be three kids left without a dad.”On Wednesday th June, in Port of Ness in Lewis, -year-old John Burgis wasn’t feeling his usual self and his we Carol soon became concerned about his wellbeing.“John hadn’t been  per cent the day before, which rang alarm bells for me,” she said. “He had been a bit breathless, and we went to the surgery. They took his blood pressure and said he was fine but — given he was  — to take it easy, so we came home# We went to bed about  o’clock.”“I don’t remember anything apart from waking up in the hospital,” said John. “Carol apparently found me making funny noises at about one o’clock in the morning and then realised I was unconscious.”Carol quickly called for an ambulance: “I dialled  and when I was on the phone he stopped breathing. Then I did what I was told to do – I got him off the bed and on to the floor and did CPR until the responder arrived.“Fiona, the responder alongside whom I had trained about  years earlier came from Cross with the defibrillator – it was lucky she was the one on call and didn’t live far away. She got the kit out straight away. I put the stickers on his chest, she shocked him, and he started breathing again.”John was admitted to hospital in Stornoway before being transferred by helicopter to Queen Elizabeth ICU in Glasgow. He was then admitted to the Golden Jubilee Hospital in Clydebank where he was fitted with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator . He was back home just over a week later.“One reason for my quick recovery was that I actually went into hospital quite fit,” said John. “Even though I was unconscious, my body itself was in a fit state. We had regularly been going to the gym near our house here which has a scheme free for pensioners that is great – it encourages some of the old folk to go. We regularly go out on our bikes or walk up to the Butt of Lewis, so we do lead quite active lestyles.”Carol added: “It was our wedding anniversary recently which was very poignant as I could have been sitting here by myself – I wasn’t, and it’s all good.“We have a very strong faith and that has helped us accept what has happened and be extremely grateful that John is still here.”Dr. Steve Leslie, consultant cardiologist and clinical lead for heart failure at Raigmore Hospital, believes the work undertaken by LuckyBhere is “truly le-saving”.“Without defibrillation, a cardiac arrest is almost always fatal,” Dr. Leslie said. “For every  seconds in which defibrillation is delayed the chance of success is reduced by  per cent. This means that for defibrillation to be successful it needs to be delivered as soon as possible. CPR prior to defibrillation can buy time.#The approach taken by LuckyBhere to encourage communities not only to provide community-based defibrillators but also to engage with training is lesaving.”Established in , LuckyBhere was set-up by Skye resident Ross Cowie who suffered a cardiac arrest in  but was saved due to the presence nearby of an ambulance which had lesaving equipment.In view of his own experience, Ross decided to raise funds to purchase a defibrillator for the Skye Camanachd shinty clubhouse in Portree which was where he fell ill. What began as a small local gesture has since blossomed into a national charity – LuckyBhere and its team of volunteers have provided training to thousands of people in communities across theand breadth of Scotland, from Cullivoe Hall in Shetland to Burrowhead Holiday Village near the Mull of Galloway.Last year the charity linked up with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar to provide ELS training — including how to operate a defibrillator — as part of the curriculum in all  primary and secondary schools across the Western Isles. In total, there are currently  public access defibrillators in the Western Isles from the Butt of Lewis to Barra, and more than  across Skye.Ross Cowie said: “We always said at LuckyBhere thatwe could help to save one le that would make all efforts worthwhile. Several people have survived but, for three to be saved in five days, is extraordinary.“Much of this success is due to the trainers who give their time freely to train thousands of people across Scotland in lesaving skills. Training takes only two hours and what better skill could be learned than the ability potentially to save someone’s le.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_20180804_190022_01.jpg","title":"mallaig and kyleakin prepare for championship","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineLeague newcomers Mallaig face reigning champions Kyleakin in Broadford on Saturdaywith the  Skye and Lochalsh Football League Championship at stake.This season#s champions will be determined by virtue of a winner-takes-all, title-deciding playoff after both sides finished neck-a-neck on  points in the table # as goal dference isn#t factored in.Mallaig secured their place in tomorrow#s showdown after recording a fantastic - away victory against Sleat and Strath in the final game of the campaign in which their goalkeeper Mark Johnston pulled off a late penalty save to seal the victory.Kyleakin, meanwhile, took the spoils with a well-deserved - home win in their crunch match against fellow title contenders Portree Juniors thanks in part to a splendid showing by goalkeeper Craig Wilson.With the teams having scored  goals between them in the league this season # *including  in their three encounters so far, Saturday#s match-up promises to be a fitting finale to what has been a thrilling and unpredictable campaign.Having gone from - up to - down, the Blues rallied with goals from substitute Brett MacMillan, who drew his side level and then from Andy Cunningham who struck a late winner to seal the points.Mallaig led twice, first through Marc MacLean, and then Angus MacNaughton but were pegged by Graham Campbell#s side.Just as it appeared a vital three points would slip through the net, Jamie MacGregor# side struck a third in injury time as Ryan MacDonald set up Andy Cunningham for the winner.With only a win guaranteed to keep them in the hunt, Mallaig stepped up when the pressure was on to put in an excellent away performance against DL MacKinnon#s men.Ross Douglas scored a brace to help fire his side - ahead but Connaire Yoxon found the back of the net with a fine finish to halve their advantage.With less than ten minutes remaining Sleat were awarded a penalty and the chance to equalise. However, despite having been beaten from the spot earlier in the match, Mark Johnston ed to his left to thwart Ben Yoxon#s effort and with it seal his side#s playoff berth.After succumbing to a - defeat at the hands of their rivals the week before in the Ross Cup, Kyleakin came storming back with a confidence-boosting - win which brought them right back into contention, while also ending the hosts# unbeaten run in the league in the process. Gordy Mccarroll opened the scoring with a well-taken effort from a freekick, with Cameron Thompson scoring the second from close range.In stark contrast to his display in the cup game the week before # which saw him earn a red card # Mccarroll put in a man of the match performance with a tireless showing and a goal to boot.The south Skye side churned out an important win as they overcame a tough nut in Northwest.Kyleakin were far from their best in the first period but a Stewart Johnston goal before the break gave them a  to build on. Clinical second-half strikes from Innis Thompson and Gordy Mccarroll sealed a victory which had looked far from certain for large periods of the game.With Mallaig having finished the season on  points, and Juniors holding a one-point advantage over the Reds going into the match, David Butcher#s side knew it was win or bust in terms of their title defence.What followed was a fine team performance by the  winners with goals from Cameron Thompson, Stuart Gillies, and a brace from Gordy Mccarroll. Their victory was punctuated by some outstanding goalkeeping by Craig Wilson # including an incredible stop to deny Juniors as they threatened to turn the tide early in the second half. #I feel our team have performed very well this year and are still learning in every game we play in this league. I’ve been impressed with the dedication shown by everyone to make sure this season went as smoothly as possible.##The team has certainly had its ups and downs this year, we have been caught napping in a couple of games that most people would expect us to win, but on the flip side we have stepped up in all the big games and have onlyone defeat in the league so far, so I can’t be too critical.# #It was great to see a four-way battle for the title but our lads needed no motivation. To be in that position was fantastic and we knew how hard the task would be against a Sleat team who themselves have had a great season this year. I have to say, it’s the most focused I’ve seen the lads and that’s including the two finals we’ve missed out on this year.#I don’t really think it gave me the extra motivation as I don’t really look at what other teams are doing, I knew after we beat Sleat that we were in pretty good shape to at least get a playoff but I didn’t think it would be against Mallaig # so credit to them for a great run-in. Whoever comes out on top on Saturday will be worthy winners.# #This might sound silly, but no, I was fully confident with the boys at the start of the season. Our aim was the title, although we liked keeping it too ourselves, so we could get our heads down and show what we can do on the pitch. I’ve been surprised by the ersity of the league. Every club has a completely dferent style and it’s not a case of setting up the same each week. We#re still learning and hopefully improving.# #It’s definitely a dferent challenge trying to defend the title as you are the team everyone wants to beat, so teams probably lt their game a wee bit against you and you have the added pressure of people#s expectations of you.# #I have always used the same approach to every game since I’ve started managing Kyleakin and I don’t see why that should change. Doing anything dferent could just add pressure to the boys and you’re disrupting what they are used to.# #No dferent than usual for us, everyone is happy to have had a weekend to prepare for the game. We really need to work out a game plan to unlock the Kyleakin code, they are the only team we haven’t managed to beat this year.#########################################-Article by Adam GordonAll images by Willie Urquhart."},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27470  ","story":" Michael McMonagleAs a former prisoner who is now an elected representative it is important that I visit these imprisoned Catalan elected representatives and raise their cases on the international stage. - Martina Anderson MEPAll Catalan political prisoners held by the Spanish authorities in relation to the Catalan independence referendum should be released immediately. That was the call made by Sinn Féin MEPs Martina Anderson and Lynn Boylan who visited Catalan political prisoners in three jails today as part of a delegation of MEPs from across Europe. The delegation visited nine political prisoners, including former ministers and elected representatives and well as independence activists.

He should not tolerate it in Belfast either.The correct decision by British Secretary of State Karen Bradley to reduce MLA wages cannot be allowed to mask the true nature of the undemocratic and politically damaging measures she announced in recent days.By her own staggering admission, Karen Bradley did not understand the voting motivations of the electorate here when she first took up the post.Clearly that is no longer the case. But unfortunately for anyone in this society who is interested in the rights of citizens, equality or the implementation of previous agreements, there is only one set of votes that Karen Bradley is interested in – and that is the DUP’s.Her government is reliant on the DUP for its own survival and is clearly determined not to upset that applecart, no matter how rotten its contents may be.She had an opportunity this week to take tangible measures that would have helped pave the way for a restoration of the power-sharing institutions by confronting the ongoing denial of rights by the DUP.But despite championing rights and equality in her own constituency and country, she failed to do so on behalf of citizens here.Instead what she announced was a suite of measures which subvert the democratic process and previous agreements.Faced with the prospect of a court-ordered Assembly poll, she moved to suspend her powers to call an election as set out in the legislation. That is a hugely retrograde step and a move away from the Good Friday Agreement.It also begs the question, what kind of self-declared democratic government, suspends the right of the people to have their say at the polls And while we all accept that officials require clarity on their roles in the current climate, any move to replace democratic accountability with greater authority for unelected civil servants or Direct Rule Ministers is entirely unacceptable.The aim of Karen Bradley’s intervention this week, setting aside the convenient timing of distracting from explosive evidence at the RHI Inquiry, was to buy time. To announce a flurry of supposed activity but, in reality, doing nothing but continuing to facilitate the denial of rights which is preventing a restoration of the power-sharing institutions.Her government is prepared to allow the political process to continue to drt with no strategy and no plan for a resolution rather than challenge their confidence and supply partners.This reliance on the DUP remains the central problem andany process around restoring the institutions is to be credible, Karen Bradley must begin prioritising the rights of citizens over Tory party self-interest.The Dublin Government must also assert its full role as a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement.The Taoiseach has pledged not to abandon northern citizens in the context of Brexit. He also has responsibilities to them in terms of rights and his government and must now show leader-ship in securing and defending rights which are routinely delivered everywhere  on this is-land.Leo Varadkar would not tolerate discrimination against the LGBT community, women, victims and Irish speakers in Dublin. He should not tolerate it in Belfast either.There can be no ambivalence or equivocation on rights, equality and integrity in government.These are basic building blocks of any democratic society.

Its increasingly obviousthat continued political impasse is a DUP default position in the absence ofgiving political leadership and making political progress.LastMonday in a new destabilising development the Boundary Commission reaffirmedrecommendations which resemble an electoral and political gerrymander of thenorth as a counter to irreversible demographic changes.Thefact is that the Good Friday Agreement and political process are now being heldto ransom by the political self interests and unionist priorities of the DUPand the Tories.TheBritish government and DUP alliance has become a mutually reinforcing wrecker’scharter. Democratic norms are being thrown to the side and violated.In myown speech to the BIA conference I said there is now a real risk that years of progress could be squandered.Irepeated that the absence of ing political institutions is bad forsociety.Thefailure to fully implement and defend the Good Friday Agreement damagesboth the peace and political processes.And thecatastrophe of Brexit has been torpedoed into the midst of these dficulties.Thereis an imperative for us all to look beyond the scale of existing crises and to provide hope and positive vision.Sinn Féin is absolutely dedicated and authenticin our commitment to opening a new phase of the peace process whichsecures a permanent reconciliation and healing process throughout theisland of Ireland.Partitionis the central fault line at the heart of Irish politics and society.It hasbeen an abject failure from its imposition. Thesectarian structure of the northern state post partition ensured thata substantial minority were destined never to be treated asequals.TheCivil Rights Movement  years ago highlighted graphically the inability of theunionist state to treat the minority as equals.This belligerent opposition from powerful sections within politicalunionism against reform of the northern statepersists today in the form of political unionist hostility towards implementation of theGood Friday Agreement since . Therefusal of political unionism to embrace a rights-based society and equalityhas culminated in the collapse of the political institutionsand associated crisis in the north for thelast  months.Thegreater majority of citizens in the north are committed to the Good FridayAgreement.They wantrights to be guaranteed which are already enjoyed by others inDublin, London, Edinburgh and Cardf.The politicalearthquake of Brexit has again exposed the negative rolethat partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentallyanti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.Over  years into the Irish peace process, Irish citizens inthe north now face the very real and frightening potential of partition,as the main source of ision and conflict in Ireland, being reinforced.Verysignicantly, a seismic sht has also occurred in the ambitionand expectation of republicans, nationalists and other citizens inthe north.A newgeneration is questioning partition.Therepublican and nationalist constituency is now looking beyondBrexit and towards the prospect of accelerated Irish reunication.Brexithas become a defining moment for these islands.Ithas introduced a new political discourse about the future ofIreland north and south, and the relationship with Britain and Europe.Thedebate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have now movedcentre stage.Thesenew unprecedented realities in turn present new strategic challenges for all ofus in political leadership.Theydemand that we act as pioneers of the future not prisoners of the past.Thereforeit is time for a paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.Negativemismanagement of the Irish peace process and the Good FridayAgreement by successive British governments, and the particular pro-unionist bias of the Conservative governmentsince , must be replaced with a recognition that the transitiontowards Irish unity should begin.Initially thatshould take the form of preparing for a unity referendumand by engaging in a new political discussion with the Irishgovernment and all political parties on the island of Ireland in relation toreunication.Formany in the British establishment this will be an anathema.Forthose in the Tory party leadership who have tied their electoral survival to analliance with the DUP this prospect will be unthinkable.However, Brexitmeans that change in the political relations between Britain andIreland is now unavoidable, and, while partition never had any democraticlegitimacy, its continued imposition is no longer sustainable.It istime for historic, decisive and brave leadership to be shown by the Britishstate.In parallel, the Irish government needs to begin to prepare for theconstitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish unity. Itshould facilitate an open and inclusive national conversation on Irish unityinvolving all citizens, political parties, social partners and civicsociety.A GreenPaper on Irish unity should be published detailing the constitutional,political, fiscal and economic measures for a successful transition to a unitedIreland.TheIrish government should commence a discussion with the EU commission andinstitutions to explore their practical role and support in facilitating anefficient process of reunication.Politicalunionism must also open itself up to the new reality that Ireland has changeddramatically. Toomany within the leadership of the DUP, and other unionist parties, seek refugein the past, preferring to refight old battles, instead of looking forward tonew opportunities.Societalchange brought about through referenda on marriage equalityand women’s reproductive health rights means that political unionism can nolonger conjure up the spectre of ‘Rome Rule’.Demographicshts in the north are irreversible.It isimportant to note that political unionism and indeed the DUP are notmonolithic.Somevoices within unionism – few in number, but notable – have recognisedthese realities and urge fellow unionists to join the debate and tobecome pioneers of our collective future.However,republicans and nationalists need to recognise the existence of realapprehensions and fears within the unionist constituency.Unionistcitizens need to be convinced that the failures andinjustices of the past will never be repeated and that the newtransformational challenges to be faced will be managed withgenerosity and magnanimity.No onewill have any reason to leave their home in an agreed united Ireland.The %which would make up a new Ireland, who would not identy as Irish, must neverfeel the exclusion from society that was experienced by Irish citizens in thenorth under unionist rule.Aminority should be cherished because it enriches society.Diversityshould be celebrated and respected.Thispresents a strategic challenge for republicans and nationalists.Politicaland civic unionism needs to be persuaded that it can own asignicant stake within a new, pluralist, constitutional, national democracy.Republicanshave a responsibility to develop a sense of belonging for all of thosewho should be welcomed, and cherished equally as childrenof a new Ireland.Thiswill require compromises and accommodation to guarantee religious, politicaland constitutional rights.Theopportunity is emerging to reimagine Ireland to reshaperelationships and create a unity of belonging for those who definethemselves as British as well as Irish and, who share the unionist political identityand orange cultural traditions.Sinn Féin will act as a guarantor for the Britishidentity and the unionist tradition within a new and agreed united Ireland.Butfundamental change can not be left to happenstance.

Published by LilliputPress, Dublin. Price hardback €. Like Fenianism itself, this book hadmodest beginnings but grew to cover all of Ireland, a good part ofthe globe and half a century. Eva Ó Cathaoir began a study ofFenians in Tipperary which has evolved into one of the mostcomprehensive and important scholarly works on the Irish RepublicanBrotherhood yet published. If the film ‘Black ’ is a storyof revenge set during the Great Hunger, the phenomenon of Fenianismarose to a great extent as a political response to that colossalcrime against the Irish people by the landlord system and the Britishregime. But there was far more involved than simple vengeance.Fenianism was a democratic movement, consciously in the tradition ofthe United Irish leaders of the s, and rejecting privilege andclass distinction. In  the IRB staged the funeral of TerenceBellew McManus and brought many thousands of people onto the streets.The working-class character of the movement was clear from thisdemonstration and the author quotes the following from the haughtysnobs of the ‘KilkennyModerator’, lamenting the absence of the‘great and the good’ from the procession:“When we look back to the O’Connellgatherings or even the Young Ireland ‘Confederation’ assemblies,and remember the array of names, of borough magistrates, professionalmen and traders, accustomed to put forward as representing Kilkennyon such occasions, we cannot but view in the most ludicrous light,this miserable farce of an ‘imposing demonstration.’” The recent visit of the Pope reviveddebate among Irish republicans about the role of the Roman CatholicChurch in Irish politics. This book shows again that, with very fewexceptions, the hierarchy abhorred the IRB for its democratic andrepublican principles and the ‘princes of the Church’ fearedFenian inculcation of their ‘flocks’ with a sense ofindependence, no longer reliant on clerical and aristocratic leadersto guide them. Such guidance had led to catastrophe during the GreatHunger as the passivity preached by Daniel O’Connell and thebishops facilitated the peaceful passage of food out of a starvingcountry.Students of Irish history will befamiliar with the story of the Fenian leadership on both sides of theAtlantic, abortive rebellion and invasion, the internecine disputesand personality clashes. This book recounts all that but it goes muchdeeper. For example it tells of the Fenian women, whose storiessurely need to be rediscovered. They were treated as subordinates bymost of their male comrades but many played important roles. It was atime of deep chauvinism with even otherwise progressive Fenians suchas John Boyle O’Reilly opposing votes for women. The book covers all aspects ofFenianism and a great part of its value is in its first Appendix‘Biographies of Munster and Kilkenny Fenians’ which providesbrief profiles of , rank and file Fenians. I have never beforeseen any ‘Roll of Honour’ of the IRB but this is now providedwith a list of ‘Fenian Casualties -’ while the book closes,appropriately, with a list of Fenian monuments in Ireland andManchester. This is a beautully produced book anda credit to the publishers Lilliput Press and of course to theauthor.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27482  ","story":"Pearse Doherty: The Interview  Ruairí Doyle“Society is organised in the wrong way - we should not have a housing crisis - what is happening with our children in emergency accommodation is immoral. It is a scandal that we will look back at in twenty years with shame.” - Pearse Doherty TDSinn Féin TD and Finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty has spoken of his origins, his le and how they influence and inform both his political ideology in an extended online interview. He also outlined his vison for a New Ireland that provides achance for people to live, to work and to raise their families without thechronic levels of deprivation and inequality facing so many today. Speaking ahead of Sinn Féin’s Alternative Budget launch nextweek Deputy Doherty laid out his party’s vision “for a new economy for a NewIreland”.The Donegal TD was born in Glasgow and lived with hisparents and five siblings in a one-bedroom flat in Ibrox before the familyed home to Gweedore in Donegal in the ’s. This informed his belief that no matter when someone leftIreland, evenit were  or  years ago, they still have a great sense ofbelonging, of that tangible bond with home “that’s home - you know - Níl aontinteán mar do thinteán féin - that’s their home”, commented Teachta Doherty.Pearse, who has been a TD since , talked about his drivehome when the Dáil wraps up at the week’s end, crossing the border twice on hisway up the winding road to Donegal to his we and four boys. He also gave aninsight into the dficulty of the balance between work and home le, and theunique challenges of being a public representative. The Gaoth Dobhair resident added that it is not solely challengesthat come with being a Teachta Dala. He said: “It is what shapes you and your values. It’s yourexperience - it’s your past experience - it’s your family experience and it’swhat shapes you in Irish society, the people that are around you. The peoplewho influence you and that help shape you and that’s the values that I bring tomy job today as Finance spokesperson for the lead opposition party. It’s thevalues I will bring to the job as Minister for Finance,I am in thatposition.”Sinn Féin regularly faces accusations of employing “fairy-taleeconomics” or “economic illiteracy”.Pearse dismisses these comments as cheap throw-away remarks,designed to stunt political debate. This is a debate that Pearse opines that the establishmentparties do not want because “any fair minded person would see clearly thatthere is a need to build houses, to bring our children out of emergencyaccommodation instead of cutting taxes for the wealthiest in society.”He continued: “Where despite the fact that the three main banks aremaking €. billion in profits every year, they don’t pay any Corporation Taxand some of them won’t pay for the next twenty years.  That’s the debate they don’t want to have.”As Pearse puts it, the Budget is not just about numbers -it’s about our values and ensuring we create a new economy with strong publicservices and shared prosperity where no one is left behind and no child goeswithout.Deputy Doherty said: “Society is organised in the wrong way. We shouldnot have a housing crisis. What is happening with our children in emergencyaccommodation is immoral and it is a scandal that we will look back at intwenty years with shame.  “What is happening in our hospitals is outrageous, in a country thathas the wealth that it does.  “It is just not shared properly and it is not allocated properly andthat isn’t the fault of citizens. That is fault of politicians that decided onBudget day that the resources created by the Irish people are going to beallocated in this way.”Touching on the spectre of Brexit, as a TD for a borderconstituency, Pearse argues that the North of Ireland remaining in the EU andgiven a Special Designated status is the only way to protect people on bothsides, particularly Donegal which is isolated from the rest of the  Counties.Pearse also remarks that “the debate about Irish Unity needs to go toanother level”. He continued: “We are moving, in my view, to a position where we willhave a border poll. Where a majority of people will vote for Irish unity.  “And that will come about because of demographic changes. It will comeabout because Sinn Féin is agitating for it, and other people are recognisingthat it is in their interests that we have an end to the Irish border.”Sinn Féin is not interested in maintaining the status quoand not content to merely “tinker along the edges - where you might get anincrease in public services, an extra few gardaí, an extra few public sectorworkers, a little tax cut here” Pearse Doherty said. This Budget, and every Sinn Féin Budget, would be about our vision fora new Ireland and that vision of an equal and fair society. We would also focuson the political choices that have always been available to create that society one is prepared to make them. Teachta Doherty states in the conclusion of his interview: “Our job isto provide opportunities so that people can live and work at home. We need togive people the opportunity to raise their families at home, so that they canget through le and reach their opportunities and reach their potential athomethat’s what they wish.” test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27483  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinWe are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.- Mary Lou McDonaldDUP Leader Arlene Foster has called for fundamental changeto the Good Friday Agreement to facilitate Brexit.  by the majority of people north and south must make way for Brexit, a proposition rejected by a majority in the north. The latest position of the DUP leader lays bare the root of thecrisis in the north. Remember, the DUP opposed the Good Friday Agreement, campaigned for a No vote in that historic referendum and they continue to oppose the Agreement. An Agreement that has underpinned peace for over two decades.They oppose the all Ireland nature of the Agreement, they oppose the rights and safeguards of the agreement and they oppose power-sharing.   to be in them.” The institutions in the north could no-longer bear the weight of this contradiction and collapsed. This was brought to ahead by the continual refusal to implement agreements, opposition to marriage equality, rights to an inquest, an Irish language Act and the financial scandal that is the RHI Cash for Ash scheme.Add to the mix a British Government that has no understanding of Ireland, our economy or our agreements. The Tories are at war with themselves over Brexit and seem intent to bring their own country down with them. This same Tory Government entered into a toxic deal with the DUP to stay in power. That is why there are no institutions in the north, and why the DUP leadership walked away from the deal they had made with Sinn Féin in February this year to get the Assembly up and running.These latest comments by Arlene Foster are a desperate throw of the dice by an increasingly marginalised Unionist leadership. The deal with the Tories will end. Its only legacy will be Brexit. Meanwhile Ireland north and south is changing and a New Ireland is emerging. The joyous revolution of Marriage Equality and Repeal of the Eighth has resonated with a new generation in the north. The largest political demonstration in Belfast is Pride. A magnicent event that celebrates the ersity of identities that make up our communities.Similarly there is a growing demand for access to abortion services. As a placard proudly announced in Dublin Castle when the Repeal result came through, “The North is Next”.Brexit has also unied those who voted to remain within the EU. Brexit will be a disaster for the economy in the north, particularly for agriculture. A community that values prosperity and access to the EU is looking beyond Brexit and Westminster and instead towards Irish Unity. We are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.As for Arlene Foster and the DUP - the game is up. If their leadership want the institutions in the north up and working then they must support real power sharing, respect, equality and the rights of others. When this happens Sinn Féin will be a willing partner. Now is the time for political courage, to look forward in the interests of all communities. Meanwhile the debate on Irish unity and a unity referendum grows. I am confident that we can build a New United Ireland, a home for all that share this island. That is the big challenge for our generation. test"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1061936.jpg--.jpg?1538468737000\n","title":"menarys is coming to town","story":"MENARYS is to open a new department store in Ballymena Town Centre.The company recently announced the news via social media stating that it was currently recruiting for ious management and sales positions.Menarys Tempest said on its facebook page: “We are sooo excited to announce that we are opening another new store.... this time its in Ballymena.”Menarys has been trading since  growing from one independent store to a chain of  in .

When flying its important to work with the wind to plot the direction and path of a flight.Richard explained that hot air balloons work because hot air rises.By heating the air inside the balloon with the burner, it becomes lighter than the cooler air on the outside.This causes the balloon to float upwards, asit were in water. Obviously,the air is allowed to cool, the balloon begins to slowly come down.Henry Law, owner of The Little Ollie Balloon Team is a member of the retrieve team. He said he was delighted the balloon was able to make contact with Slemish. HISTORIC MOMENT He said: In order for me to retrieve the balloon when it lands, we use very precise location finders and two way radios, however I was able to see the balloon on the side of Slemish.Richard had radioed through to me to say he thought he would be able to make contact and Im so glad our on board GoPro camera captured the historic moment!Expalining how the balloon comes into land, Henry said: We normally like to land in a green field, and always try to seek the permission of the land owner before doing so.We pick non-crop fields and ones without livestock so as to cause no damage or inconvenience.Quite a large area is needed for landing as sometimes the balloon travels along the ground before coming to a stop, therefore the top of a mountain wouldnt have been safe to try to make a total stop.“However, making contact is a great achievement and we are so proud we were able to achieve it.

Each child is unique and brings a wealth of le experience, within their family and community, to their school setting.

People thought maybe nothing was going up this year, but we didn’t want to put it up and lose it in the storm, so we waited.”The Harvest Thanksgiving services take place on Sunday, October  at .am and pm.Rev Boyd added: “Our church building will also be open from pm to pm for the whole community to look at the displays, listen to live music and enjoy some apple tart.”On Saturday, October , a Harvest Praise Night with the New Irish Youth Choir will take place in the church at .pm.Sad passing of Molly Lutton Shoppers urged to continue to show support for Belfast city centre retailers Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\""},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8650567.1538134353!/image/image.jpg","title":"happiest places in northern ireland revealed and the most miserable","story":"Scores were produced for council area by the Office of National Statisticsbased on four measures of personal well-being - le satisfaction, feeling that the things done in le are worthwhile, happiness and anxiety.Health, employment and relationship status are key determinants of personal well-being according to previous research done by the ONS.

The installation of new seating, lighting and landscaping along the route will help make the trail accessible to all.It has been a goal for many years to connect all council owned open space along the river and this latest set of works is the final piece of the jigsaw which has been made possible thanks to £, funding secured from SOARVillage Renewal Measure.During the course of the works some disruption to the area may be necessary including the temporary closure of the footbridge at Gilford Community Centre and certain access points to the park.

We run a social ‘prescribing programme’ which is a popular concept offered by your GP so that instead of prescribing medication, for say anxiety or in some cases depression, they may refer you to your local healthy living centre and that is where we come in.“Our activities have been proven in many cases to have improved the mental health of a person in that they can talk on how the centre has improved their lives.”Rosie spoke of how community engagement has increased at the Whiterock community gardens and allotment site.“We do hope to see the Men’s Shed model on the gardens, it would be another development that would address a particular need as older men as a group can become socially isolated.“We have weekly walking groups that go up the Black Mountain, Cave Hill, Bog Meadows and our cycling group is also up and running. There is great scope.”Looking ahead to the autumn and winter months, Rosie said that the centre will be encouraging parents and carers to participate in their Health Promoting Homes programme which is “trying to change mindsets in terms of healthy living, which incorporates nutrition.”“The programme is all about promoting the home as a healthier place for the children who are living with parents or grandparents,” she went on.“People are realising the connection between good physical activity, good diet and the impact that it has on their own health.

Dr Julie-Ann Maney, who was recalled to the witness box after giving evidence on Monday, explained that it appeared Caragh had \"respiratory dficulty\" and was \"breathing slowly\".Dr Maney added that respiratory arrest then caused her heart to stop and prevented oxygen from travelling to the brain.Mr ONeill was asked to check for signs of le, confirming each time he heard his daughter take and release a breath.\"I dont know whats wrong,\" he said, before through tears he added, \"I cant look at her.\"I tried to force a bottle in her mouth to seeshe would take it,\" he added, after stating that \"her eyes are closed and shes shaking.\"Shortly after emergency services arrived, the father was heard directing ambulance staff to his home. Seconds later, the call ended.Caragh spent two days in hospital before succumbing to a severe brain injury at half past one in the afternoon of February , .Dr John McCabe was the registrar at the Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children when Caragh was admitted. He told the court that trauma became the \"main dferential\" after speaking to Caraghs father at the hospital.

One user joked it would soon be quicker to drive to Dublin than get through the airports security.Its thought bottlenecks occur because of people arriving at the airport too early for their flight while others show up at the advised time leading to more passengers than expected arriving at one time. The airport took to the social network to remind people to arrive at least two hours before departure.\"Carefully packing your bags at home can help us reduce the time it takes to get you through security,\" it tweeted.A spokeswoman added: \"We apologise to any passengers who suffered delays as a result of queues at security this morning. Customer services staff were on hand to deal with any passenger queries and  indeed any passengers with feedback or complaints we would ask them to contact the airport directly so that we may resolve their issues.\"Dont forget to arrive at least  hours before your flight and that carefully packing your bags at home can help us reduce the time it takes to get you through security.

He said he queued for an hour on Monday and while he made his flight with time to spare he said others turned back in the queue saying they had missed theirs.\"The queue was all the way down the escalator,\" he said.\"I just couldnt understand it as all the lines were open and they were processing everyone at a fair rate. It was not like it was going slow, it was just the sheer volume of people trying to get through.\"And by the time I got through it all the queue was just the same . It was a nightmare.\"He added: \"We went away for our holidays in the summer and had a  minute queue then. But you expect that over the Twelfth fortnight not at the beginning of October when it is mainly just commuters.\"The thing that really got me today was there was no one giving advice or even helping people who were about to miss their flights. There were some asking to get past to catch a flight and people were letting them through, but there needed to be better assistance.\"\"Had I missed my flight I would have missed important meetings today.\"The airport pledged to end long delays after it announced a new company would be taking over the handling of security. Wilson James will take over security operations on November .Belfast International Airport urged passengers to be prepared for security checks before arriving at the airport to speed the process along.\"Adhering to these guidelines and carrying only essential items in hand luggage can help reduce the need for manual checks at security, which can quickly cause queues to build up,\" the spokeswoman added.The airports guidelines include: Ensuring hand luggage is not densely packedAll non-essential liquids are packed in hold baggageAny liquids brought through security must be in a l resealable plastic bag All laptops, tablets etc must be removed from  hand luggage Remove all coats, belts etc"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland traffic latest updates on delays and disruption","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldBrexitPoliticsWest Tyrone By-Election General Election NI Assembly Election HealthSunday LeEducationLittle ReportersGraduationsGood Friday AgreementSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupSchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotorcyclingMotor SportOther SportsBelfast GiantsBoxingTennisCricketCyclingHorse RacingHockeyColumnistsPaul LindsayDeclan BogueBilly on the boxRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyMoneyCyber SecurityUK  WorldBrexitTechnologyJobsFood, Drink and HospitalityAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop  CompaniesBusiness AwardsEntertainmentHoroscopesNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsFood  DrinkRecipesRestaurant ReviewsFood  Drink MagazineFood  Drink Awards GuideFeaturesBooksRunningFamily LeSeptember June February May April February December September  Great Summer WalksCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoArchiveEventsSpirit of N.

There are also proposals to build on Strangford Loughrsquos tourism potential.Newry, Mourne and Down Council chairman Mark Murnin said the local authority was delighted to have reached a key milestone in the development of the Belfast Region City Deal.ldquoWe have in place an investment proposal that focuses on key investment initiatives within our infrastructure, our tourism, our digital connectivity, the skills and education of our people and innovation and digital capability of our businesses, he said.ldquoAs we move through the next stage of negotiations, we will continue to work closely with our partners and stakeholders to ensure that the city deal we secure will deliver on our ambition of a step change in economic performance and more and better jobs for our people.Cllr Murnin said the city deal process had helped to establish what he described as a ldquogenuinely collaborative working relationship across the region and is spearheading a new way of working for councils, the broader public sector, education and business.The local authority and its partners anticipate that an announcement will be made in the forthcoming autumn budget statement, paving the way for them to work up the respective proposals further..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ash shortlisted for music prize  ","story":"THE new album from Ash has been shortlisted for this yearrsquos Northern Ireland Music Prize.Islands was released by Downpatrickrsquos Tim Wheeler, Mark Hamilton and Rick McMurray in May.The event, which will take place on November  at the Ulster Hall, is now in its sixth year and includes theof three categories that formed part of the very first NI Music Awards back in .Over  industry and media cast their vote for the best album of the last  months.

Inconsistency has plagued Liatroim all season and they are precariously perched fourth from bottom with three league games left to play.Darragh beat Liatroim in the league - to - back in August and also accounted for Atticall, Drumgath and Bredagh in the championship, while Liatroim lost to Atticall, but saw off Dundrum and St Johnrsquos in the Championship.Darragh will look to Matty Hardy, Oisin McConvey, Shane Murray, Lee Morrison, Marcus Miskelly and Michael Monan with Liatroim banking on big games from P J Davidson, Conor and Ruairi McCrickard, Gerard McAnulty and Liam Middleton.Darragh seem to have the edge in experience and their exciting attacking formation should be too much for Liatroim to handle.The Burren v Mayobridge SFC clash is expected to be an intriguing affair with no quarter asked or given.Paddy OrsquoRourkersquos side sit proudly at the top of the ACFL Division , but lost both league games this season to Mayobridge, who are six points behind the leaders with a game in hand.Burren have been impressive in beating Loughinisland, Carryduff and Castlewellan to get this far with Mayobridge accounting for An Riocht, Saval and Clonduff.Burren are a solid all-round side and can rely on Donal OrsquoHare, Liam Kerr, Paudie Poland, Ryan Treanor, Cathal Foy and David McEntee to take and make scores.Benny Coulter has Mayobridge purring again and in Ryan Brady, Cathal Magee, Caolan Gallagher, Conleth OrsquoHare and Kevin McClorey he has potential match winners who will all need stoppingBurren are to progress.Bredagh are expected to see off Saul in the IFC on Friday night, given they play in a higher ision.However, Saul are just one more win away from lting the Division  title and a win over Glasdrumman in their last game on October  will see them promoted as champions.On their day, Bredagh are a match for anyone and should have too much power for Saul. However, Donnan Ritchiersquos side showed against a fancied Ballymartin outfit that they fear one one andthey can repeat that sort of display then Bredagh may watch out.Bredagh will look for big efforts from Donal Hughes, Tommy McElroy, Donal McKegney, Michael Robinson, Conor Francis and Owen Costello with Saul relying on Adam King, Cathail Arnold, the Harney brothers, Caolan Magee and Rory Mullen.Unfortunately, star player Pierce Laverty will miss the game as he headed off to Australia on Sunday to take part in a week-long series of Aussie Rules trials.Following this game, Kilcoo will continue in their bid to make it seven-in-a-row when they face Warrenpoint.Kilcoo have again arrived at this stage of the competition with a minimum of fuss and itrsquos going to take an exceptional side to wrestle the Frank OrsquoHare Cup from their grasp.Ryan and Jerome Johnston look to be flying again after an injury-interrupted season and they have the perfect foils in Conor Laverty and Ceilum Doherty with Paul Devlin directing affairs in and around the middle of the park.The Branagan brothers are also expected to have a massive impact on the game as they set about taming Joe Magee, Aaron Magee, Ross McGarry, Ryan Mallon and Ryan and John Boyle.There is also a county final to look forward to on Sunday when Portaferry and Ballycran battle it out for the Senior Hurling Championship title in Ballygalget at pm..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Fantástico%2C Emma  ","story":"LOUGHINISLAND girl Emma Branf has been named as the top Spanish student in the UK and Ireland.The  year-old former Assumption Grammar School student was given the accolade by the Spanish Embassy in the UK and Ireland at a ceremony held at IES Vicente Cantildeada Blanch in London.Itrsquos the first time the award has gone to a student from Northern Ireland.Emma was accompanied to the awards ceremony by her proud mother, Francesca.She and her teachers were also rewarded with a tour of the IES Cantildeada Blanch School, the only bilingual Spanish and English School in the United Kingdom and Ireland, located in London.Emma said: ldquoI am delighted with this achievement but I must also pay tribute to the quality of language teaching in Assumption Grammar.

Really, our committee must seriously question the need to go on. Is it worthwhile staying in existencewe are not backed by the people ldquoThe committeersquos path is at a crossroads and it is us who must decide the future. Which way we go will ultimately depend on the turnout at our next meeting.Mr Gerry Toner, another founder member of the committee, was also shocked at the appalling turnout at last weekrsquos meeting.ldquoI think it is very sad that the business people in the town are not prepared to come forward to do something positive for the area, he said.BALLYNAHINCH mdash A Ballynahinch familyrsquos running protest against Down councillors took another turn this week with a noisy protest outside the councilrsquos headquarters in Downpatricik.Mrs Gemma Rice and her children began chanting and banging tin cans as councillors held their fortnightly meeting.In recent weeks the family has been mounting a silent picked outside the council offices when there are meetings in progress. They claim that councillors have done nothing to help them solve the smoke problem at their Carlisle Park home.The chanting outside the meeting went on for well over an hour. Inside, councillors decided against calling in the police as there were children involved. They closed the windows in the chamber and tried to speak over the noise from outside.DOWNPATRICK mdash Down councillors are staying firmly on course with their plans to open a major dumping site in a picturesque area less than half a mile from the Quoile River, outside Downpatrick.Despite facing a mounting wall of protest from planners and conservationists, councillors decided this week to stick to their guns and push ahead with the scheme.The site eats up almost  acres of land, about half a mile from Quoile Yacht Club, and the council scheme entails a six-feet excavation of the entire area.Pollution controllers at Stormont have already come out against the scheme because they fear it could pollute the nearby Quoile River and local planners have received many complaints from conservationists.Even councillors themselves are split and some launched into fierce opposition of the scheme at this weekrsquos council meeting.Downpatrick councillor George Flinn, whose home is less than a five-minute walk from the river, was the sternest critic and he pulled no punches in an open attack on the plan.ldquoI am appalled that a council which prides itself on being forward-looking should be asked to agree to the vandalising of one of the areas of outstanding natural beauty within its district.KILLYLEAGH mdash Residents of Killyleagh and Shrigley have called for a full debate on the future of the harbour site and possible marina plans.

Of particular interest to local readers will be sections on Saul mdash the place of Patrickrsquos landing.Observing the interest of those outside Ireland on St Patrick, John began thinking seriously about his book project five years ago.He said: ldquoSt Patrick is so obviously supported across the world ndash what is it that causes that support ldquoI was brought up outside Downpatrick in Loughinisland. I assumed I knew everything about St Patrick. I wanted to see ndash what do we know about St Patrick  I wanted to go back. I wanted an anthology of peoplersquos writings throughout the centuries, build up a picture of what he was and what he means throughout our history over , years.John said some of his findings were a ldquototal surprise, such as the article by Maureen Donnelly lsquoThe Altar Stone of Saul Abbeyrsquo. This details how the altar stone on which Patrick is said to have celebrated Holy Communion ended up on a wagon owned by a man who wanted it for the doorstep of his new house at the junction of Saul Street and Scotch Street in . But the wagon overturned, the stone broke and it found its way instead to the Catholic Church in Saul.ldquoI never realised there was an altar stone of St Patrick actually in Saul chapel, John said. ldquoI went three times to try and see it. I could not get in the first time as there was a ceremony on. It took me a bit of time to find it. This is one of the earliest and possibly holiest relics in Ireland open to all to see.John said he was also ldquoblown away by a stained-glass window, lsquoPatrick Arrives in Saulrsquo, in Saul Chapel.ldquoThe three windows are designed so the three windows show one image, he explained. ldquoIt is absolutely beautul.John is the author of many books, including The Irish Christmas Book and The Unkindest Cut: A Cartoon History of Ulster -, as well as books on the Irish famine and the United Irishmen.Surrounded by sites linked to our patron saint in Downpatrick, John believes at times we ldquocanrsquot see the woods from the trees.He points to the massive success of less important sites in the south, or how such a historical location would promoted ldquoto the nth degree in the US.ldquoI think that is the challenge for people here today, he said. ldquoThere is so much scope, there really is. I think we lose the wood from the trees. So many stories, so many things to pursue.Interestingly, his research points to an attitude from some in the south of Patrick being a ldquonorthern saint. There is also, of course, the increased secularisation of Ireland.ldquoBut there are still a massive amount of people who are people of faith, John continued.ldquoWe live in an area of huge historical importance.

A Stefan Mason point put two between the sides, but Longstone were quick to answer when Conor Shields closed the gap to a point at the end of the first quarter.Declan McClements, Rory Mason and Stefan Mason added a further two points apiece with Aaron McClements scoring a superb point to cap a great first half for the visitors and help them to a six-points cushion.A brace of points from Mark Poland and an excellent score from Dean Haughian brought the lsquoStone back into contention, but they still trailed - to - as Ronan Barry blew for half-time.As expected, Longstone came out with a sense of purpose on the restart. A point by Stefan Mason was cancelled out by a similar score from Declan Magee for the home side. Jonny Flynn split the posts for the Blues, but Longstone were quick to reply with a close range free from Ireland.Two goals in two minutes for the home side meant they trailed by a single point and at this stage the game was anyones.However, Loughinislandrsquos recent senior championship campaign saw them battle-hardened and they stood tall to a man across the pitch as the Cloch Fhada men asked some serious questions going into the final quarter when they trailed by three points.Mark Poland and Rory Mason swapped scores and Declan McClements extended his sidersquos lead to four before Longstone hit back once again through former country star Poland.With six minutes to go and the game flowing from end to end, Conor Megoran picked up the ball on the right wing and sent it high into the Longstone square.Stefan Mason reacted quickest and with his back to goal shimmied to make space for a shot which flew past Michael McStay and into the back of the net.Longstone threw everything at the Bluesrsquo defence with Dan Gordon and Sean Cochrane combining to bravely block a certain goal-bound effort with Gordon taking a boot in the face for his troubles.Longstone knew it was not to be their day when Chris Turley denied them with a fantastic save to tip the ball over the bar with two minutes left on the clock.When they needed to dig deep, Loughinisland showed their true mettle. Having been rocked when conceding the two second half goals they steadied the ship with a defence led by Paddy Megoran, Dan Gordon, Jonny Flynn and Dean McLoughlin putting in a rousing last ten minutes when Longstone asked some serious questions.Declan McClements showed a stature beyond his youthful years in midfield, knocking over five points from play. Aaron McClements looked back to his old self with some magnicent high fielding which propelled his team forward throughout the  minutes.In the forward line Stefan Mason top-scored with - and alongside Conor Megoran and Rory Mason gave the Longstone defence plenty to think about with great support from Paddy McKenny, John McCarthy and Paul Digney.Loughinisland: C Turley, S Cochrane, P Megoran, C OrsquoToole, D McLoughlin , D Gordon, J Flynn , D McClements , A McClements , R Mason , P McKenny , P Digney, C Megoran, Stefan Mason , J McCarthy.Longstone -Loughinisland -ACFL DIVISION .prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Pierce heads to Australia  ","story":"A YOUNG Saul Gaelic footballer has just jetted off to Australia to compete for a potential Aussie Rules professional contract.Under the expert guidance of former Down and AFL star Marty Clarke,  year-old Pierce Laverty has successfully secured a ticket to Melbourne for a series of trials.Pierce will get a week to train and acclimatise before testing starts on October  in goal kicking, skills, agility, time-trials and jump tests.All the big AFL clubs will be observing the training and testing week and will select players who they think are good enough to make it.Typically, Pierce is taking this opportunity in his stride, and itrsquos his combination of skill, athleticism and attitude that has set him apart.Unfortunately, Pierce will miss Saulrsquos Parador Lodge IFC semi-final clash with Bredagh in Newry on Saturday night, but hersquos hoping his team-mates can make it through without him and that he will be home in time for the final..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Sam Rutherford Cup belongs to St Patrick’s  ","story":"ST Patrickrsquos Golf Club are the proud holders of the Sam Rutherford Cup.Saturday and Sunday witnessed the clash of the titans as St Patrickrsquos took on neighbours Rockmount in the two-leg final.The first leg was played at St Patrickrsquos in ideal conditions for golf with a light breeze and sunny conditions.Rockmount had chosen to play away from home as they had enjoyed good results from this tactic in previous rounds.

Evenyou didnrsquot know the first thing about the place other than it was old, it was still clearly an important part of the history of Belfast.After the fire, the past of the Bank Buildings became known and many lamented at the thought of losing such a piece of the past: for it to be turned to rubble and replaced with something nondescript. Itrsquos easy to forget that while inanimate, buildings do have character and tell the story of a city in a way that brings it right into the present.But with all that said, it seems now that the fire has been extinguished, some seem more concerned with preserving what is left of the building rather than putting the le back into Belfast. While it has been deemed structurally sound, some debris has still been falling when the wind has swooped through in the wrong direction and with the first storm of the season forecast for this week, the real integrity will only be known now.For more than a fortnight, a firm cordon has been put in place around the burnt-out building and businesses in the immediate area have reported a severe drop in trade, with some stating their footfall has fallen by more than half. With the cordon expected to be in place until after Christmas, there are fourteen businesses within it who cannot open at all.Thatrsquos not to say that nothing is being done to try and help those businesses.Belfast City Council is working with other agencies to try and find alternative premises for these businesses and to ensure that they will not be left out of pocket for something that essentially amounted to sheer bad luck.For businesses still open but noticing a fall in trade, signage has been placed to direct people around the cordon to ensure they can still move around the city centre. Translink too are doing their bit by offering a free shuttle bus that goes from St. Georges Market to the city centre every ten minutes.Events such as fashion shows and promotional meals have been scheduled and there has also been the launch of the ldquoYour Belfast campaign which aims to encourage shoppers back into the city.Irsquod say that you canrsquot fault them for trying, but I do see a few issues with all that is going on.Itrsquos not that I begrudge Belfast having their campaign. I really donrsquot. Their local economy is certainly going to have taken a hit following the fire and hats off to those trying to make the best of the bad situation, but I donrsquot think theyrsquore going about it in the best way.If people want to go to Primark, then put on subsidised shuttle buses for them. The company seem to have been brilliant in looking after their staff and sending them off to other stores despite losing thousands of profit a day with the loss of their flagship store and should be supported for that.If you look at the list of businesses that are completely closed due to the fire, they include the likes of Tesco, a charity shop, McDonalds and of course, Primark. Only three or four of the shops would be generally considered higher end and are places where you plan to go to rather than just meander into as yoursquore passing.If I was in Belfast and need to pick up groceries or want to seethere are any gems in the charity shops, a free bus to Victoria Square isnrsquot going to do me much good.A fashion show showcasing the latest designer trends Belfast has to offer isnrsquot going to be of much interest to those who focus on affordability rather than ensuring that a print or certain cut is in vogue.As the news of the Primark fire broke, many people spoke of how both they and their parents before them had depended on the storersquos low prices when times were tough. To see a campaign promoting higher cost clothing must feel a little insensitive to those who now are worrying about where theyrsquoll be buying their winter jumpers and endless pairs of gloves to replace those that keep getting lost in the schoolyard.We wouldnrsquot have had the ldquoYour Belfast marketing campaign had it not been for the Primark fire so I can understand why it is focused on Belfast, but I feel that therersquos huge scope to promote the whole of Northern Ireland as viable alternatives.We all know that Belfast is still open for business so no amount of cajoling is going to make someone go therethey donrsquot want to but perhaps those in Belfast arenrsquot as aware of what other towns across the province have to offer.The advert lists qualities that Belfast is said to have but itrsquos nothing unique. Here in Enniskillen, wersquore also strong, proud and together. We too have great local music to offer and can offer a great night out. We also love our food, enjoy shopping trips and look out for one another.We may not have had a fire, but our high street needs support too. Traders have been complaining about high rents and rates for years so therersquos quite a high turnover rate of independent shops and small chain branches.People go to where the cheapest prices are but small businesses canrsquot afford to lower their prices to match local competition so they risk losing out on trade. Itrsquos a situation where no-one really wins. If the Belfast campaign is to be a more long-term one, then they should widen it to include everywhere. Promote the highlights of each county and make it accessible to all.If Translink brought back opentickets, Irsquom sure wersquod see a marked increase in people coming here for a weekend break. Some people are understandably cautious of driving in unfamiliar places, especially towns but four hours on a bus in one day doesnrsquot leave much time for relaxing or shopping.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The linen exhibition in Lisburn Cathedral He said: “I trained as a medic and worked for the NHS in Scotland for  years. I supposeyou’re from Lisburn there’s a thread of linen in your DNA in some respects. “The job I do now is as a curator looking at design. I’ve had a passion for design all my le and I see it as a way of generating interest and income for people.“Gathering linen stories as we go has been an amazing privilege. I found it quite similar to when I was a general practitioner, in those situations I was listening to people talk about illness or discomfort. In this situation it’s very joyous, being able to tell someone about their working le in their past.”The ‘Our Linen Stories’ exhibition is touring internationally but is specially adapted for each stop that it makes. In keeping with the setting of Lisburn Cathedral there will be a special focus on the relationship of linen with religious faiths and the traditional ceremonies around birth, death and marriage.The exhibition also looks at ‘millies’ a term often used disrespectfully, but originally referred to skilled, hard-working woman in linen mills. Dr Ennis said: “Lisburn Cathedral is a fabulous venue. The Hugenots – the first weavers who galvanised th century linen trade in Ireland and Scotland – are buried in the church. There’s a church window in memory of the Barbour family , so we have a lot of resonance here.”Of the linen revival he said: “Flax is perhaps the most sustainable of fibre crops as every part of the plant can be used. “Novel material research is producing flax bio composites which have many uses. This potential can contribute to a vibrant, innovative and low waste economy.“For every litre of water used to manufacture linen it takes , litres to produce the same amount of cotton together with a range of polluting pesticides.”The exhibition in Lisburn Cathedral runs from am to pm each day.

Michael Doran came under repeated pressure to explain himself  and accepted a series of major errors Under a forensic examination, Mr Doran admitted myriad serious errors – and changed his story from what he initially told the inquiry and from what he told the Charity Commission last year after a complaint to it that his charity had acted inappropriately.Under deeply sceptical questioning from the inquiry, Mr Doran claimed that he had not been following either judicial reviews taken by boiler owners unhappy at how they are now being treated – despite having been instrumental in the case getting to court – or the inquiry, despite the fact that he describes himself as Northern Ireland’s leading renewables expert and despite the fact that the implosion of RHI has been the most signicant event in the history of the renewables industry in Northern Ireland.That issue is potentially signicant because his evidence to the inquiry was that he was not paying attention to the question of how lucrative RHI rates ofhad been and that issue has been central to both the inquiry and the court action around the time when he submitted misleading evidence to the inquiry.The inquiry’s technical assessor, Keith MacLean, told Mr Doran that he “struggled to understand how you can take so little interest in either the inquiry’s work or the judicial review”, given his unique interest in renewable energy.Evidence which the inquiry has compelled Mr Doran’s organisation to release shows that in September  – two months before RHI even launched – he was aware that it was vastly more generous than Stormont was saying at that time in official documents.A presentation which he gave to businesses included a slide where he had calculated that the payback time on a £, boiler was . years – meaning that for more than  years the claimant was not only getting free heat, but making major profits by running their boiler.That was vastly beyond the % rate ofwhich Stormont said it intended and which the EU agreed would not breach state aid limits.Mr Doran – whose charity has a commercial arm – told the inquiry that it had handled hundreds of applications for the RHI scheme, bringing in almost £, in the process, although he insisted that it had not made very much profit on that service.He was taken to several answers which he gave to the inquiry in writing which were misleading, inaccurate or left out crucial pieces of information.Until Monday he never handed over about , pages of documents relevant to Action Renewables’ involvement with RHI.Mr Doran admitted that his written evidence to the inquiry was “substantially misleading” and apologised for that, but insisted it was not an attempt to mislead the inquiry.Arlene Foster: Sinn Fein ‘trying to distort truth’ in legacy submission Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"When askedhe did not think that he should have warned Stormont that the scheme it was about to launch was “a potential recipe for disaster”, Mr Doran said that “in hindsight, that is now an appropriate way of describing it but at that time we still understood that DETI had the potential to carry out annual reviews and to apply audits”.Mr Doran said he thought the original intended rate ofof % – which would have seen a boiler paid off in about eight years – would have meant that there would never have been any uptake on the scheme.Sir Patrick put it to him that he knew the price of fuel and the proposed tarfs, along with having read the expert reports on which it was based. When asked why he didn’t realise the problem at the time, he said: “I don’t know.”However, he subsequently went on to set out a dferent explanation, suggesting that he did not tell Stormont of the flaws before the scheme was launched “because it would have been a delay of another year or two” in launching RHI.Sir Patrick said: “I’m sure you cannot mean that it was worth wasting public money for a year ”Mr Doran said: “No, it’s not a matter of wasting public money”, adding that he wanted to see a “high uptake” with the potential for it being amended later. He repeated thathe had raised concerns the scheme could have been delayed by a year or two.Sir Patrick said: “What’s wrong with that  What’s wrong with making sure that public money is not wasted ”Mr Doran said: “We weren’t considering specically whether [sic] wasting public money our main concern was to try to get the scheme up and running so it benefited Northern Ireland.”Barrister Donal Lunny asked: “Should you have had more of a regard to the potential waste of public money ”Mr Doran said: “Possibly yes,that’s what the inquiry finds.”Mr Lunny said: “I’m asking you: should you have had more of a regard for the possible waste of public money at the time ”Mr Doran said: “At that time, in my opinion, no” because he wanted to see renewables incentivised.try catch     .               ..

The dig site at bogland in Co Monaghan, where investigators are searching for the remains of teenager Columba McVeigh, who was abducted, shot and secretly buried in November, , by the IRA. \"The searches are all challenging, they are all dficult, but this one is particularly dficult,\" he said.Mr Hills assessment came as new drone footage of the dig site in bogland in Co Monaghan captured the scale of the operation to find Mr McVeigh.The -year-old from Donaghmore, Co Tyrone, was abducted, shot and secretly buried in November .Republicans with knowledge of the crime have told the commission, in confidence, that he was buried across the border in Bragan bog near Emyvale.   The dig site at bogland in Co Monaghan, where investigators are searching for the remains of teenager Columba McVeigh, who was abducted, shot and secretly buried in November, , by the IRA. Four previous searches in the bog have not uncovered his remains.The fth search commenced last month. For the last two weeks excavators have been removing the top level of peat from the section they plan to search.Now an ICLVR team of forensic archaeologists and technicians will comb an area measuring about  metres by  metres - a task that could take months.Mr Hill said peat excavated during previous searches ended up being dumped on the area now being examined.   The dig site at bogland in Co Monaghan, where investigators are searching for the remains of teenager Columba McVeigh, who was abducted, shot and secretly buried in November, , by the IRA. \"The dilemma we faced here is we had up to two metres of peat that had been redeposited on the site from ious searches around ious areas,\" he said.\"Because of the amount of disturbance this ground has undertaken over the years it makes it extremely challenging.\"Mr Hill said techniques used on previous Disappeared searches, including cadaver dogs and geophysical surveys, were not beneficial for the current dig as there was too much previously disturbed earth.Arlene Foster: Sinn Fein ‘trying to distort truth’ in legacy submissionMemorial to murdered soldiers vandalised again Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"The senior investigator said the volume of wet peat also presented a health and safety issue, as the excavators could not track across the land without sinking into it. The team is using special mats to move the machines over the site.Part of the area was examined in the first search for Mr McVeigh in  - an operation undertaken by the Garda.Mr Hill said it was worth re-examining the ground because techniques now used by the commission were not available to gardai  years ago.Mr McVeighs brother Oliver said his overriding emotion as the dig progressed was one of \"frustration\".\"Its really a waiting game,\" he said.\"You have to be learn to be patient. We have to be getting closer, but again we could be left disappointed.\"Im searching for him from when I was , Im now . Thats only the searching - not theof time hes been missing.

extends to platitudes about the need for narratives to be acknowledged and for ‘all relevant material’ to be made available to academics. However, there is no commitment to republicans practising ‘full disclosure’.The cynical refusal to acknowledge its substantial and overwhelming part in the sordid campaign of assassinations and bombings that constituted the ‘Troubles’ is breathtaking.The past is no longer simply being whitewashed, the Sinn Fein approach to legacy proposals means erasing it utterly.

A petition has also been sent in to the National Assembly.Many local residents from Penarth, Barry, Cardf and further afield have shared their frustrations over the sediment being dumped off the coast.Penarth man Anthony Slaughter, who is the Cardf and the Vale Green Partyrsquos campaigns officer and also the chairman of Gwyrddio Penarth Greening, said: ldquoWe understand and share local residentsrsquo concerns over the dumping of this potentially hazardous mud in the Severn estuary.ldquoIn addition to any possible risks associated with this waste we are opposed to any action that enables the development of the Hinkley C nuclear power station.ldquoAs the only political party in Wales that is completely and unambiguously opposed to all nuclear power we do not support the plans for either Hinkley C or Wylfa B power stations.Even rock musician and anti-nuclear campaigner Cian Ciaran, who is the keyboard player for the band Super Furry Animals, has come out against the matter.The musician lodged papers at the High Court seeking an injunction to stop the dumping and said that the ldquonuclear establishment cannot be trusted.ldquoAbsence of evidence is not the evidence of absence, and therefore the precautionary principle should dictate a rethink, said Mr Ciaran. ldquoA rethink by our politicians and policy makers to do the right think by its people.ldquoThe implications and consequences of this dredging could be far reaching.South Wales Central AM Neil McEvoy has set up a CrowdFunder page to raise pound, for the protest as he believes there may be a judicial review.He said: ldquoOur initial target of pound, was so that we could carry out an interim injunction in order to temporarily halt the dumping of the Hinkley nuclear reactor mud.ldquoHowever, in order to stop the mud dump for good we will need toto court, which could lead to a judicial review. Judicial reviews are very costly and so extra funding will be required. This will be used for court fees and to put together a strong legal challenge against the mud being dumped in Wales.ldquoIrsquom concerned because I do not believe enough testing has been done. Wersquore talking about mud being dredged from outside a nuclear reactor.Energy company EDF are dredging the mud ahead of building two new nuclear reactors at Hinkley Point C in Somerset. The company said the dredging is necessary ahead of drilling that needs to be done ahead of works for the new reactors.       ,params: .pushEnvironmental watchdog Natural Resources Walesgranted the licence for the dumping and insist that it is safe.A spokesman for NRW said: ldquoEvery element of the application was considered thoroughly including testing of the sediment from the dredge sites by independent experts in accordance with international standards and guidelines, and advice from health experts. The results showed the material was suitable for disposal at sea.ldquoWersquove tried to reassure people that the proposed activity will not harm people or the environment.EDF says the dredging of mud from the seabed off the Hinkley Point C site is necessary ahead of drilling six vertical shafts for the cooling water system for the new nuclear power station.However, those against the dredging say it could pose health risks.Max Wallis of Friends of the Earth, Penarth and Barry said: ldquoThe NRW up to recently stated the EIA for dumping had been covered in the EIA for the jetty development in Somerset, covered by the Environment Agency but this was contradicted by CEFASrsquos statement of , Nevertheless the NRWissued the  license.

Knowing this, John gave up his teaching course and took a full time job at the boatyardhellipand the rest is history.Mr Freemantle moved from Penarth and started his own boat building workshop in South Clive Street in  with British Road Services ndash now National Freight Consortium.In , the business was expanded and relocated to a greenfield site within Cardf Marina, which is now the exact location of Bayscape.The boat yard at the time stored around - boats. Long before the Cardf Bay Barrage was built, the water was tidal and boats moored in the middle of the river.As there was no road to the marina, Mr Freemantlebuilt a track to enable him to get to and from the boat yard. In  he put pontoons for the boats and laid the first cement for the slipway which was all created by Mr Freemantles own hands.In  the Freemantlesset their sights on retiring and sold the boat yard - which had grown to storing more than  boats - to a family friend of their business partner who used to visit the boat yard as a child. And so Bayscape began.One day the couple were walking along the waterrsquos edge and looked across to see the unique development taking shape in the exact spot of Mr Freemantles beloved boat yard, where  years previously they brought in the original electrics, telephone line and water.

As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community. Itrsquos been le-enhancing for us, and wersquove made all sorts of friends.ldquoPenarth town is a really good place to train a guide dog puppy, with a small arcade and local shops. People are very amenable and love being part of Gemrsquos education. We have the Esplanade, beaches and country parks, and wersquove even taken her to Ikea.\"People are very interested in the puppy and we rarely go on a walk without someone enquiring about what we are doing. Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day. Their yard or garden will also need to be securely fenced so that the puppy remains safely within its confines.Guide Dogs supplies basic equipment, covers all veterinary and feeding expenses, and provides a network of support and advice.To find out more about becoming a puppy raiser for Guide Dogs, ring Steve Kersley on   and leave a message, or email Steve.Kersley@guidedogs.org.uk article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was great to see so many people unite and support the importance of ersity and inclusion, themes that are central to successful recruitment strategies. Perhaps, those of us who are in business can learn a lesson from the organisations, that quite literally, lead the way on the day in the parade. Prominent firms such as Danske Bank, Allen  Overy, EY and FinTrU were out in force at Pride. Leaders within these organisations truly value being seen as ethical, fair and engaged employers. They know that all their staff expect to be able to bring their ‘true’ selves to work. And of course, when people are happy in work they are productive, so it makes total sense. When it comes to the attraction of new talent to an organisation, we should think hard about how we position ourselves as inclusive, especiallythe intention is to appoint millennials. A recent statistic, published by YouGov and referenced by Fergal McFerran of Stonewall, at the Powered By Talent conference stated that “% of  to  year olds now identy as something other than % heterosexual”. Employers should derive two items from this statistic straight away. Firstly, it is highly likely your organisation has LGBT staff employed within. Secondly, employers seeking to recruit, must be seen to welcome potential candidates from all avenues, failure to do so could mean a signicant reduction in applications. Here are some steps to ensure that your organisation, is doing everything it can, to attract recruits from the LGBT community: Dedicate web and social media pages, that hold specic LGBT inclusive content. This simple measure says lots about company culture and openness. LGBT equality, include a statement of commitment when advertising jobs on-line. Ensure confidentiality and fairness. Train recruitment teams, focus on removing any unintentional bias, do your teams know why it is so important to be inclusive  Use proudemployers.org.uk, to advertise your jobs to the UK and Ireland LGBT audience. Join the parade, get involved in LGBT community events, nothing will say you are an inclusive employer more. If your organisation is welcoming of ersity, strives for inclusion and is visible in doing so, congratulations. Unfortunately, here in Northern Ireland many organisations are still not thinking widely enough in definition. Those organisations need to establishtheir agreed policies are indeed active practice. If you feel your organisation would benefit from being more visible and more inclusive, visit www.stonewall.org.uk ersity-champions-programme Justin Rush is director at Belfast-based Abacus Group.

The Ulster Business Top  Northern Ireland Companies dinner, with sponsor AL Goodbody, saw dozens of those making the list attend a grand gala dinner at the Ulster Museum in Belfast. They heard from guest speaker Andrea Leadsom, who restated the Governments commitment to no hardening of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic, and its determination to not have any customs border between NI and the rest of the UK. \"I am fully aware of your concerns as business leaders in relation to Brexit, particularly in relation to the border,\" she told her audience at the Ulster Museum. \"I know the success of many of your businesses, and your day-to-day lives, relies on frictionless trade and travel across the border. Let me assure you that we dont want this arrangement to change when we leave the EU.” The event also heard from Ulster Business editor John Mulgrew, who said companies across Northern Ireland were exhausted due to the deadlock at Stormont, and remain concerned over what damage a ‘no deal’ Brexit scenario could have on their bottom line. “It’s quite clear that anything that leaves us with a ‘no deal’ scenari, in simplistic terms, is not going to work, or be acceptable to you, and thousands of other businesses across Northern Ireland,” he said. And speaking about the lack of an Executive, he said: “Everyone here knows it’s not acceptable. Everyone here is tired talking about it, and wants it sorted now, rather than when it’s convenient for those who are supposed to be here to govern us.” Michael Neill, head of Belfast office at AL Goodbody, said that since the Top  two years ago, little had progressed in how Brexit would be dealt with. “We would all have hoped that by now we would have some sense of what the future business environment might look like. But, sadly, that is not the case. “Every day at AL Goodbody, we’re getting calls from companies of all sizes, right across the Island of Ireland and beyond who are seeking some sense of clarity on Brexit-related legal matters. “That means, every single day, we hear that NI Plc is still grappling with that same ‘great unknown’ Mark spoke of at this event two years ago. \"And when you add to this the political deadlock and over  days without a local government, its no wonder our clients and the wider business community find ourselves in a very challenging situation.” The Ulster Business Top  Northern Ireland Companies magazine is the leading list of the region’s top businesses, ranked by turnover. Overall, pre-tax profits among those making the list grew by %, rising to £.m And turnover among the Top  increased by %, to just shy of £bn. Moy Park kept the top spot, for the seventh year running, with turnover of £.bn. And since publication, that turnover has grown further still.

For reference, this is one of probably more than a dozen trips I’ve paid to the country in the last decade.Antwerp is an accessible port city, known for its diamond quarter. Its main train station is also something to behold. Listed as one of the world’s most beautul stations, it fuses century-old architecture with grand ceilings, along with its multi-storey renovation in .The main town squares in Belgium’s northern cities each have a familiar style, with Antwerp’s Grote Markt akin to the capital’s larger Grand-Place. These spots are worth a dander around on a hot day, but expect to pay tourist prices at the raft of outside eateries which scatter the perimeter.Temperatures in Belgium tend to fall in line with the south of England – a warmer climate than Northern Ireland, with the mercury hitting the late s during the summer.On this latest trip, it was a high of C and a low of a little over -odd at night. Scorching, but with a crisp Belgian strong pale ale in hand, that’s all made right .In Antwerp, and Brussels, you’ll find a raft of beers from the six Belgian Trappist monasteries – highlights include Rochefort , Westmalle Tripel and the highly sought-after Westvleteren  –  and those from the more-modern producers, such as Brussels Beer Project and De Struise, fairly readily across the capital, and the surrounding areas.Frites Atelier is a popular spot for high-end Belgian frites, topped with items such as truffle mayonnaise, Indonesian peanut sauce and a stunning traditional Flemish stew. It’s normally bunged, but the system ensures you aren’t waiting long – and it’s definitely worth the visit.One of Belgium’s beer-known beer spots can also be found a short distance from the city centre. The Kulminator is a somewhat eccentric spot, run by a husband and we team. It has a traditional brown cafe feel, cluttered, but has the most extensive range of aged Belgian beers I’ve come across. To continue the beer theme, we headed to the small town of Lot – before heading on to Brussels for the rest of the stay.It’s home to Drie Fonteinen – one of Belgium’s most-revered sour beer producers and blenders. A couple of hours well spent with one-off brews and vintage offerings, paired with a platter of beer pate, cheese, bread and pottekeis – a fresh cheese spread, somewhere between a smooth cottage cheese and sour cream. Now, in Brussels there are more than a few great spots for both a wide-range of top-end Belgian brews, and a warm atmosphere.The central La Mort Subite is a grand cafe located close to Grand-Place, with a solid range of beer, while Delirium Cafe – known for having the largest selection of beer in the world – is worth a visit. If you’re going as a beer geek, peruse the vast ,+ bottle range and find something you can’t get back home, but be aware than it’s become a tourist mecca – with backpacking students filling it in the busy periods to get a filter-clad snap for their timeline.Moeder Lambic has two spots – one central and one further south. Both are superb, modern Belgian beer bars, with a strong tap selection and the best meat and cheese board in the city.Brussels has a couple of breweries in its city centre, but Cantillon is the place to visit for those who are either fully immersed in beer, or want to expand their palate.You can also eat well in Brussels, with lots of spots serving good meat, cheese and pate, with bistro fare such as Flemish carbonnade and rabbit cooked in gueuze beer. There’s also an undercurrent of ‘all-you-can-eat’ rib appreciation, with Amadeo – and similar spots in other cities such as Ghent. We also opted for the beer-friendly and cosy Nuetnigenough. Starters and mains include black pudding with gueuze beer sauce, veal meatballs and rabbit fricassee with gueuze.For seafood, the bustling outdoor Noordzee is a great place to stop off for very fresh mussels, prawns and crab.It’s dficult to know whether the city’s reasonable hotel prices, and flight costs –booked far enough in advance – are in part due to the terror attacks in . But Brussels is a city moving on from that particularly dark period in its modern history.We stayed at the five-star pole – a grand Art Deco hotel with spacious rooms. On this occasion we paid little over £ a night.Aside from places to eat and drink, the city centre is a very walkable place – it’s the sort of place that merits exploration. The city also boasts a thriving jazz centre, and it’s worth checking online to see what’s happening during your stay.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Pete.jpg","title":"meat merchant to expand into republic","story":"Posted on Monday October  by John Mulgrew Meat mogul Peter Hannan says he will expand the retail arm of his successful Co Down business into the Republic this year, Ulster Business can reveal.The Kildare-born businessman, who runs Hannan Meats in Moira, also believes that, following the negative outlook for the economy in the wake of the vote for Brexit, that the UK’s exit from the EU won’t happen.In an interview with Ulster Business, Mr Hannan said: “Personally, I don’t think we will Brexit.

Ulster Business speaks to Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI and some of those burgeoning firms it has developed strong relationships with over the decades Long-term support is very much at the heart of the decades of partnership between Bank of Ireland and its business customers.And whether it’s offering a wide range of financial assistance, growth support or general advice, the bank has formed le-long partnerships with companies from right across the sectors, and from the large to the very small.It’s been there for three of its longest-running customers – with a combined almost -year history – from the start, and played a key role as a partner in each of their own growth stories.Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI at Bank of Ireland UK, told Ulster Business:“We base our business on a relationship management model – we spend a lot of time with the businesses, we know the owners and their management teams, their growth objectives and ambitions and understand the businesses.“That enables us to provide the right suite of products – challenging business plans, providing funding and help. There’s also the chance to introduce them to potential customers, signpost to expert advice, and become a partner to that customer, rather than just be a funder. It’s very much a partnership approach.“We provide lending facilities to business from the very small micro firm, right through their le-cycle, their growth phase, and scaling up to small and medium-sized businesses.”And for Gavin, it’s all about offering a range of services and assistance “under one roof”.“We have the ability to lend up to £m for business customers. There is the consistency to our approach, and that’s really important in the Northern Ireland market.”Partnership is a phrase that continues to raise its head in Bank of Ireland, regarding both its relationships with business customers, and the longevity and generational nature of the companies it’s developed long-term relationships with.“We would have many instances where a mother and father have built a business, and now the second generation is taking on the management,” Gavin said. “We are involved across both generations, and we are very privileged to be part of that family and business development.”“It’s in our interest that the company continues to grow and thrive and we have been very important in that role.”Nowhere is that more evident than with the hugely successful family-owned McKeever Hotel Group.What started out as a family restaurant business in Randalstown, Co Antrim back in , has blossomed into a burgeoning food and hospitality business boasting five hotels across Northern Ireland and Donegal.And the McKeever Hotel Group is still very much a family affair. In the last  years, the breadth of the business has grown to include Corrs Corner in Newtownabbey, the Dunsilly Hotel in Antrim, Ballymena’s the Adair Arms, Dillons in Letterkenny, and its latest hotel, the Dunadry in Antrim.Today, Eugene McKeever, along with his we Catherine, daughter Bridgene and son Eddie, run the thriving hotel empire which employs around  part-time and full-time staff.“The family business started in  when my parents opened the first restaurant in Randalstown – my dad was a chef and mum was teaching,” Bridgene, who is marketing director, said.“They then bought Corrs Corner. That’s when Bank of Ireland really become involved in the company and helped us out.“We have been supported by Bank of Ireland in a number of ways.”That includes the multi-million pound funding for the refurbishment of the Dunadry Hotel, in addition to funding support provided for the acquisition in .“Bank of Ireland has been with the company during its entire history. In , with the Adair Arms, we were one of the few people back then who were buying, due to the recession,” she said.“There has always been trust and the faith with the bank. My dad has always said – speak to your bank manager, and be honest with them.”The McKeever Hotel Group’s single biggest investment has been with the -bedroom Dunadry.Gavin says that one of Bank of Ireland’s core objectives is to help “customers to thrive”.“In doing that, it covers a lot of dferent things, and it’s not just about being profitable,” he said.“We specically tailor our packages to the customer needs. Their success, is our success and we are very privileged to be part of that growth story.”Eamon McCay started his cooking oil business at a small Strabane premises. He’s now grown Frylite from a small family operation to an Ireland-wide firm with more than  staff, boasting a turnover of £m.And he’s been helped along the way by Bank of Ireland amid ongoing expansion and growth. It’s a relationship which has so far lasted more than  years, and shows no signs of slowing down.“I started Frylite in , delivering fresh oil and collecting used oil. I combined all of the areas in one,” Eamon says.And that initial  sq ft building has grown to five depots across Ireland, with a further site on the cards for yet more expansion. “We supply our vegetable oils to hotels, fast food outlets, commercial businesses, bakeries, industrial food service sector… it’s been gradual growth.”A depot in Galway in  was followed by another two years later in Dublin, with Coleraine and Cork following a short time later. And its Strabane base is now a , sq ft building on a four-acre site.Since , Bank of Ireland has provided facilities to the business including invoice discounting, asset finance and term and cash flow ending, and also previously used stockline facility.Speaking about his strong relationship with Bank of Ireland, Eamon says a commercial finance package ensured the businesses growth.“The bank have gotten to know the business. I felt like I have had a partner, which is invested in the business. Building good relationships is one of the values,” he said.But it’s not just about providing help and finance to customers. Bank of Ireland is sponsor of Catalyst Inc’s Invent competition and is also working with organisations such as the NI Chamber and CBI to showcase and help companies improve skills, digital prowess and scale exports.Another business with a more than two-decade relationship with Bank of Ireland is Pinnacle.And just some of the Sage Platinum Reseller’s top customers include everyone from the Irish Football Associationand Ulster Rugby to Titanic Belfast and Mash Direct.The software partner, which was set up in Belfast in , now boasts a team of more than  experienced providers of Sage business management software solutions, IT services and support.“Going from humble beginnings, the company has grown into a £m business,” Fran McKee, Pinnacle’s marketing director said.The firm, which is headed by founder Ken Montgomery, has been supported by Bank of Ireland through its stages of growth, which has included organic expansion and acquisition. “We have a solid partnership with Bank of Ireland, which has nurtured our business since its inception in .”The firm offers businesses solutions from simple to more complex business needs with Sage. It now has  offices across the UK and Ireland, but according to Fran, there is “massive growth on the agenda”.“We want to be a £m business within the next few years and as well as growing our Sage ision we want to also grow our IT services offering and with the bank’s support we’ll achieve our growth ambitions.  You can come to us as a one-stop-shop for IT and software requirements.“Customers today are very focused on providing a good service as well as achieving their growth ambitions, so they want to have the software in place to help them make decisions and run their businesses effectively.”And Gavin says the key message is that Bank of Ireland is a “proven and consistent funding partner for businesses over a long period of time.”“We work hard to build a great rapport and great trust with our clients and these long term relationships are testament to that. It is exciting to share the journey of young and small businesses to growth and expansion and we’re keen to help the next generation seize new opportunities for their businesses.” ■View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/CK.jpg","title":"cavanaghkelly a partner in business across northern ireland","story":"Posted on Wednesday October  by Ulster Business Des Kelly, Catherine Martin and Michael Drumm Michael Drumm has spent his entire professional career training and progressing up through top accountancy and business advisory practice CavanaghKelly.In the last  years he’s been involved in almost every department within the practice, working across audit and accounts, tax and advisory.Now, one of three partners in the practice – alongside Des Kelly and Catherine Martin – he began his career as a trainee, primarily within audit, and worked there until .“In , I  moved across to our restructuring department. It would have been an extremely busy department at that time following the financial crisis in  but it provided invaluable experience” he said.And while the workload in that area of the business increased in the months and years following the recession, Michael said an overwhelming majority of the CavanaghKelly core client base were able to successfully trade their way through this tough period.Following a busy three year period he then joined the corporate finance team as a manager, then onto a more senior role, before joining as a partner this year – heading up CavanaghKelly’s advisory offering.A Queen’s University graduate, who studied law and accountancy, Michael is also a licensed insolvency practitioner.“I now lead our advisory offering.
