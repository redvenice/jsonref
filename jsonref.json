Durham.The e-liquids are not on the approved list of products held by the Government\u0027s Medical and Healthcare products agency.Only flavours and packaging approved by the MEHA can be sold in the UK.  Mr Walker sold McVape to a MailOnline reporter, who entered a fake date of birth on his website.When asked if the McVapes packaging is targeted at children, the businessman replied: \u0027Yes, that branding is a bit naughty.\u0027He added: \u0027But I have to say that the health benefits in helping people stop smoking outweigh the bad points.\u0027We don\u0027t sell to under 18s. Some of these products might appeal to teenagers but if they are under age they cannot buy it from us.  Meanwhile Juul, one of the world\u0027s biggest vaping companies, has attacked the sale of e-cigarettes with flavours that appeal to children, saying it would never sell flavours such as \u0027gummy bear\u0027 or \u0027cotton candy\u0027 which are \u0027clearly\u0027 targeted at kids.Among Mr Walker\u0027s range are bottles that look like Haribo sweet packets, blueberry jam flavour, cookies and Sours based on Sourz sweet fizzy drinks. Deborah Arnott, chief executive of ASH (Action on Smoking and Health) has called for the products to be banned.She told Mail Online: \u0027I\u0027d warn anyone who sees McVapes for sale not to buy them as they\u0027re not on the list of notified products and that means that there\u0027s no guarantee they meet the necessary standards and they shouldn\u0027t be on sale in the UK.\u0027I\u0027m concerned as well that whoever\u0027s selling them may well not be checking that they\u0027re not selling to under 18s which is also illegal.

In 2012, there were 700,000 vapers in the UK whereas now that figure is closing in on 3m. Market research group Euromonitor estimates that the number of adults who vape will reach almost 55 million by 2021.Teenagers who vape are six times more likely to take up smoking than those who have never tried it, scientists have warned.Those who experiment with e-cigarettes are at higher risk of smoking within two years than those who have never tried the device, a study in the US found.The investigation, which looked at the smoking habits of 18-year-olds, added weight to the argument electronic cigarettes can act as a gateway to tobacco products for teenagers.  The US, Japan and the UK are the world\u0027s biggest markets with vapers in the three countries spending a combined equivalent of £14bn on smokeless tobacco and vaping products in 2016. One British firm - not responsible for specifically targeting children - reported £6.9m pre-tax profit for year to March 2017 up from £6m in the previous 12 months. Its sales rose to £71m from £59m in the previous year.The industry\u0027s claim that vaping brings benefits to health - especially in young people - is hotly disputed.          Those who are attracted to colourful packaging like this and experiment with e-cigarettes are at higher risk of smoking within two years than those who have never tried it, studies found          Mr Walker, who sells thousands of McVapes, added: \u0027We don\u0027t sell to under 18s. Some of these products might appeal to teenagers but if they are under age they cannot buy it from us.\u0027In the US the Food and Drug Administration has announced plans to require strict limits on the sale of most flavored e-cigarettes, including age verification controls for online sales. The move is an attempt to curb what health experts in the US are calling \u0027an epidemic of underage vaping\u0027 with FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb vowing: \u0027What I can\u0027t tolerate is another year of this level of growth.\u0027Last month researchers from Duke University in North Carolina found that flavourings react with vaping liquids to create dangerous compounds that can trigger severe irritation when inhaled.Dr Sven-Eric Jordt, a senior author of the study, said: \u0027These inidual ingredients are combining to form more complex chemicals that are not disclosed to the user. \u0027When inhaled, these compounds will persist in the body for some time, activating irritant pathways. \u0027Over time, this mild irritation could cause an inflammatory response.\u0027A spokesman for McDonalds declined to comment."},{"url":null,"title":"China building worlds longest double deck suspension bridge 5 570ft span","story":"    A 1,000-tonne steel beam is lifted to be installed at the construction site of the Yangsigang Bridge in China last Thursday          The enormous bridge over the Yangtze River will be the world\u0027s longest double-deck suspension bridge when it\u0027s completeDuke and Duchess of Sussex chat with Take That at the Royal VarietyWatts sentenced to life in prison after murdering his familyPolice officers savagely beaten in brutal attack in South LondonSir Graham Brady rubbishes speculation he\u0027s been \u0027sat on 48 letters\u0027Emily Atack braves the viper pit on ITV2\u0027s I\u0027m A CelebrityMelinda Messenger talks about meeting boyfriend ChrisP.

He was last spotted exercising at the Meadows Rehab Centre in Wickenburg, Arizona, last yearBut the real drama lies elsewhere. For despite being one of Hollywood’s most recognisable stars, Spacey has apparently disappeared off-screen as well as on it.Nothing has been seen or heard of the double Oscar-winning actor since the first allegations emerged over a year ago in October 2017.On both sides of the Atlantic, where Spacey owns multi-million-pound homes, the question is being asked with growing urgency: where is Kevin Spacey? ‘He’s become a total recluse,’ one friend told The Mail on Sunday.‘No one has heard from him. He’s vanished. It’s almost unbelievable that someone of his stature can pull it off in a world where everyone has a cell phone.’One producer described Spacey as having ‘one of the most recognisable faces on the planet’ and added: ‘I was with him when he walked into a restaurant in Beverly Hills and the whole place applauded.’It may be a long time before he garners applause again.His downfall began on October 29, 2017, when Star Trek actor Anthony Rapp accused Spacey of sexually assaulting him in the star’s New York apartment in 1986 when Rapp was just 14, triggering a string of similar complaints.          As the new series of the US political drama House Of Cards was screened earlier this month there was a gaping hole. President Frank Underwood, portrayed  by actor Kevin Spacey was killed off by uneasy producers and script writers following sexual assault and harassment allegations made against the actor  last yearTo date, 30 men have made public allegations about the actor. While no formal charges have been filed, police in LA and London are investigating allegations of sexual assault, including rape. In the UK, there are six active investigations. The Old Vic theatre in London, where Spacey was artistic director for 11 years until 2015, said it had received 20 complaints of inappropriate behaviour during his tenure.Spacey issued a swift and contrite apology, ended years of rumours about his sexuality by ‘coming out’ as gay and checked into sex rehab clinic The Meadows in Arizona alongside disgraced Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein.But unlike Weinstein – who has been photographed going about his daily business, visiting his lawyers’ offices and picking his children up from school – there has been no sign of Spacey anywhere.The Mail on Sunday has spoken to – or attempted to speak to – dozens of Spacey’s friends, colleagues and acquaintances in the UK and the US in an attempt to piece together his movements.Final season of House of Cards gets middling reviews as...\u0027It brought the #MeToo movement very close to home\u0027: Tom...Share this articleBut it is clear that Spacey’s vanishing act may be his best coup de théâtre so far.The last known pictures of the actor are fuzzy paparazzi shots taken at the £25,000-a-month rehab facility in November last year.There, Spacey was supposed to undergo a 45-day sex addiction ‘detox’ but, we can reveal, checked out after only 21 days.‘He left early,’ said one friend, on condition of anonymity. ‘He only stuck it out for three weeks.’Where he went after that remains unclear – although there are plenty of associates who claim to know where he is.One well-connected British socialite who knew Spacey during his Old Vic days insists that he is living in seclusion in the Cook Islands, a string of 15 tiny islands in the middle of the South Pacific.‘He’s living as a hermit in the Cook Islands,’ she said authoritatively. ‘He’s keeping his head down until this blows over.     One well-connected British socialite who knew Spacey during his Old Vic days said he is living in seclusion in the Cook IslandsHe still has a lot of rich friends from his Old Vic days. He has enough money to stay hidden.’But a source who worked on House Of Cards insists that the actor, whose real name is Kevin Spacey Fowler, is in hiding in France.‘He’s been in the South of France living on a big estate,’ the man said. ‘He’s been working out like crazy, doing massive oil paintings and keeping a low profile.’It may well be, sources say, that he has put his formidable acting prowess to good use in order to avoid detection.One source said: ‘Kevin is travelling under his real name of Kevin Fowler.’ Intriguingly, the source added: ‘I wouldn’t be surprised if he’s not been seen because he is going out in public wearing a disguise. He’s spent his life transforming himself into other characters – why not now?’Certainly, the star has not been seen at any of the homes in his international property portfolio.Spacey is said to have visited New York since the scandal broke but stayed with a ‘wealthy friend’ connected with the theatre world.A doorman at Spacey’s former Manhattan home – now sold – said: ‘We’ve not seen him here for a long time, well before the scandal.’Another former associate suggested he is ‘hiding in plain sight’ in a rented ranch in Thousand Oaks, a suburb of Los Angeles which recently suffered a double tragedy of a mass shooting and a wildfire.‘Kevin’s been staying at a friend’s place in Thousand Oaks,’ the associate said. ‘He’s become a hermit and never goes out.’The actor has also not been seen at his £2.3 million London flat.With the exception of Spacey’s estranged brother Randy, not one person was prepared to go on the record to discuss the star.One person who worked closely with Spacey claims to have received a call from the actor in which he was ‘genuinely baffled that everyone has turned their backs on him’.‘He doesn’t understand why no one has stuck up for him,’ the colleague said. ‘He sounded quite indignant.’But no one else, it seems, is surprised. ‘It’s typical Hollywood, no one will say a word about him because he’s just too toxic,’ his elder brother Randy, 62, said yesterday. ‘My brother was always an arrogant p**** and now karma has come round to bite him in the butt.‘He was the goose who kept laying the golden eggs, so people protected him. Of course people close to him knew about his extra-curricular activities, but while he was making money they turned a blind eye.’Randy has had no contact with his famous sibling for 15 years after giving an interview about their childhood which he says sent his ‘control freak’ brother ‘ballistic’. But he says he believes that Spacey is ‘lying low’ in the belief the ‘water will cool’.

A still taken from a speeding camera, of Labour MP Fiona Onasanya\u0027s Nissan Micra being caught speeding on July 24 last year\u0027I became interested because I wanted to show them what was wrong in politics,\u0027 she added.\u0027So, I looked into it more thoroughly from there.\u0027Ms Onasanya told jurors how she unsuccessfully ran as a local councillor in 2012 before topping the polls at her second attempt a year later.Adopting the mantra that you \u0027need to live among the people you are representing to adequately represent them\u0027, she quit her job managing a corporate team of lawyers for another in Peterborough.She recounted how she ended up putting herself forward as the Labour Party\u0027s candidate in the general election after hearing that the incumbent would not be standing again.Labour MP is LYING about speeding claim, says her ex-aide:...Labour MP Fiona Onasanya \u0027blamed untraceable man in Russia...Share this articleMs Onasanya later ousted former Conservative MP Stewart Jackson by taking the seat with a majority of 607 votes.Asked by her barrister, Christine Agnew QC, about the \u0027step up\u0027 from her role on the county council, she said: \u0027It was massive.\u0027It was more of a leap than a step.\u0027Ms Agnew continued: \u0027Did it fit in with your expectation of what the leap, or the step, might be?\u0027The MP replied: \u0027I didn\u0027t have any expectations because I didn\u0027t have any idea what it would be like.\u0027          Festus Onasanya (pictured) also used a similar \u0027method\u0027 involving fake driver details, when he was caught speeding on June 17 and August 23 last yearShe added: \u0027It\u0027s a little bit like being asked if you can swim and you say \u0027Yes, I can swim\u0027 but then you get thrown into the ocean.\u0027Ms Onasanya told the court her first visit to Westminster was \u0027a little bit like a fresher\u0027s fair\u0027 at university.She was not given an office until September, two months after the alleged offence, and having to spend her first visit picking up her laptop, security pass and other essentials.Within weeks she was appointed to a select committee and became a parliamentary private secretary to the shadow defence secretary.But those positions were relinquished when Onasanya was promoted to the whip\u0027s office overseeing, amongst other things, party discipline in January this year.Jurors heard last week how one of Onasanya\u0027s staffers recalled seeing 5,000 unanswered emails sitting in her inbox.Describing the deluge of correspondence, she said: \u0027It\u0027s like if you switch your phone off for maybe a month and then turn it on and all the messages come through one after the other.\u0027She agreed that there was \u0027no system\u0027 in place to handle the flood and conceded that some \u0027extremely important\u0027 messages may have gone overlooked as a result.\u0027When I turned on the laptop and went into my inbox it started off with about 50 emails,\u0027 Onasanya continued.\u0027I thought that was not too bad. Then it went from 50 to 70 to 100, 700.\u0027I had over 2,000, and that was me starting.\u0027Onasanya\u0027s musician brother Festus has admitted three similar allegations of perverting the course of justice, the court has heard.Prosecutor David Jeremy QC told jurors Festus was slapped with six penalty points for failing to identify the driver and hit with a further three for speeding all in July 2017.He had earlier been banned for a year after being caught with excess alcohol back in June 2008.Ms Onasanya told jurors she did not know about the convictions at the time she was alleged to have committed an offence last summer.Onasanya later told jurors how she would leave her car in Cambridge and spend four days a week in Westminster.Her brother Festus, mother and others would sometimes drive her Nissan Micra, before it was written off following an accident, she said.Explaining why singer Festus would borrow her car when he had his own, she said: \u0027His car was often off-road having repairs and things done to it so he would use my vehicle.\u0027Onasanya would sometimes let someone else drive her, she said: \u0027Because of the nature of my work, sometimes because of a health condition I would be quite tired so I would be a passenger and also so I could get in with work if someone else was driving.\u0027Prosecutor David Jeremy QC previously accused the MP of \u0027lying persistently and deliberately\u0027 in a co-ordinated scheme with her brother to avoid prosecution.The court also heard that, on February 3 last year, Fiona Onasanya had correctly filled out an NIP for triggering another camera a month earlier.She kept a clean licence and avoided points by going on a speed awareness course.A police investigation allegedly found that her two mobile phones were in the area of the traffic camera around the time it was activated on July 24.Onasnaya recalled receiving a Notice of Intended Prosecution (NIP) letter relating to speeding on July 24.She told jurors she had assumed she was at Parliament that day and left the letter for whoever was driving to complete.\u0027I jumped down to the date which was 24.7.17. I looked at my calendar on my phone and looked at what day the 24th was. I then folded back the letter put it back in the envelope, phoned my mum to say I\u0027ve got a speeding something or other that\u0027s come through.\u0027I then left it at my mum\u0027s house. There\u0027s an area in the living room where we leave post for one another if it needs attention.\u0027I made the assumption at the time that I would have been in Parliament because it was a Monday and then I left it with the relevant person who would have known who the driver was.\u0027She said she intended whoever was driving her car that day to complete the form, unaware it was her responsibility as the registered keeper.But when she later received a letter saying the Russian no longer lived at that address, she spoke to her brother.\u0027When I spoke to him, I can\u0027t remember exactly, but paraphrasing him, he said it was sorted out,\u0027 she told jurors.The MP went on to tell jurors that she suffered a relapse of multiple sclerosis in September last year.She said: \u0027I probably was not in the best head space. I\u0027ve just been told I had got an incurable degenerative disease.\u0027The MP, from Peterborough, denies one count of perverting the course of justice.The trial continues."},{"url":null,"title":"US closes busiest Mexico border crossing hours","story":"The San Ysidro crossing is seen looking north from Tijuana on Friday (left) and Monday (right), when all lanes of northbound traffic were temporarily shut down for several hours for the installation of security barriers    U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Special Response Team officers stand guard at the San Ysidro Port of Entry after the land border crossing was temporarily closed to traffic from Tijuana, Mexico on Monday          Pedestrians stand near barbed wire at a legal Mexico-U.S. border crossing as they prepare to leave Tijuana, Mexico, Monday.

I am a man. The worst? I\u0027m actually proud to be a man and I like being masculineI have a confession to make.This isn’t easy, and I’ve taken a long time to summons up the strength to do it.I’m aware that just by admitting to what I’m about to admit, I will subject myself to all manner of global shame and ridicule.I’ll be taunted, abused, shunned and reviled.But as Sir Winston Churchill once so rightly said: ‘You have enemies? Good. That means you’ve stood up for something, sometime in your life.’OK, here goes…I am a man.Yes, on International Men’s Day 2018, I am hereby identifying as the biological sex that I was born to.This alone is enough to risk making me a social pariah these days, but that’s not even the worst of it.I’m a man who’s actually proud of being a man, and who also likes being MASCULINE.Sorry.I realise this is a horrendous thing to say, and I can only offer my insincere apologies to all the radical feminists now exploding with rage as they read my shocking statement.If there’s one thing they loathe even more than the M-word, it’s the longer M-word.But why?Masculinity simply means ‘having qualities or appearances traditionally associated with men.’That’s it, nothing more sinister.Yet thanks to women of radical feminist persuasion who’ve gleefully hijacked the #MeToo and #TimesUp campaigns to serve their own man-hating purpose, masculinity has become the most controversial, detestable word in the English lexicon.And it’s now impossible to be ‘masculine’ without also being accused of ‘toxic masculinity’.          Radical feminists (here\u0027s Madonna in her shirt touting her \u0027radical\u0027 position) have hijacked the #MeToo and #TimesUp campaigns to serve their own man-hating purpose, masculinity has become the most controversial, detestable word in the English lexiconEven Prince Charming whisking Cinderella off from captive hell to a life of happiness is an evil that must be expunged from society – led by furious Keira Knightley and her ultra feminist knights in PC armour.‘Cinderella waits for a rich guy to rescue her,’ she sneered. ‘Don’t. Rescue yourself! Obviously!’Fine empowering words until you remember that the Prince gallantly saved Cinderella from abuse and slavery and they genuinely loved each other.Then it doesn’t seem quite so ‘obvious’, does it?One of the very worst of the many terrible things about radical feminism is the scourge of pathetic male virtue-signallers that urge them on.As an obvious (or so I thought..) tongue-in-cheek joke this morning, I tweeted: ‘Happy #InternationalMensDay! Stay strong lads, we’re not illegal – yet.’Most people reacted in the way I would react if someone else had tweeted that – by laughing.Others weren’t so amused, bombarding me with hateful abuse about my supposed ‘toxic masculinity’.A man named Box Brown, who has a verified Twitter account and claims to be a New York Times best-selling cartoonist, replied simply: ‘Die.’How laughably hypocritical this angry little clown races to attack what he presumably perceives to be my aggressive maleness, yet does so by saying he wants me dead.Hypocrisy is sadly a prevalent theme with much of modern feminism.The likes of Kim Kardashian and Emily Ratajkowski have both built hugely lucrative careers out of stripping off in the supposed name of ‘feminist empowerment’.          Hypocrisy is sadly a prevalent theme with much of modern feminism. Kim Kardashian and Emily Ratajkowski have built lucrative careers out of stripping off for ‘feminist empowerment’When in fact what they’re really doing is selling nudity and sex.I have no problem with that - just don’t pretend it benefits any other woman or is anything that Emmeline Pankhurst and her Suffragettes would have ever done.They were too busy risking their lives to win women the right to vote, than to have time to writhe naked in spaghetti and ludicrously claim they were doing so to liberate womankind.When I say this kind of thing, women ask me to cite an example of what I consider real feminist empowerment.So let me give you one from yesterday, when a 17-year old German girl driver named Sophia Flörsch was competing in her first Formula 3 World Cup race at the Macau Grand Prix.The race featured male and female drivers, and she qualified purely on merit.On the fourth lap, she struck another driver’s car as she approached a bend at 175mph.The collision caused Sophia’s car to spin out of control and catapult several hundred yards through the air into a wall.It’s the most horrifying car crash I have ever seen, and everyone who watches it would presume she must have died.But Sophia lived, despite fracturing her spine."},{"url":null,"title":"Traveller admits blackmailing brewery boss 20 000","story":"Thomas Ward, 43, of Aspull, near Wigan, admitted blackmail, conspiracy to burgle and conspiracy to commit criminal damage\u0027It could certainly radicalise someone\u0027: Muslim imam...Share this articleJohn Ward 33 (left) admitted the conspiracy offences.

Dr Francesca Carpos-Young arrives at the Central London Employment Tribunal. The tribunal ruled she was wrongfully fired as her remarks were taken out of contextThe professor, who is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts, said the notes were referencing findings she had made interviewing more than 100 musicians for her PhD over discrimination in their industry.In a written ruling employment Judge Goodman and colleagues upheld her claims for wrongful dismissal and victimisation.Prof Carpos-Young could now get her old job back - which she is demanding. This will be discussed at a remedy hearing when compensation will be agreed.Her notes read: \u0027Everyone knows that having a good reputation is important. But how do you get one?\u0027At the very least, you need to consider the following tips: \u0027Be discreet what\u0027s on tour stays on tour. Become familiar with shared understanding of anecdote, caricature, stereotype and jokes.\u0027Google them and look on YouTube, if this is not your culture. For example, you may hear terms like this: Pond life  (string players). Gypos (short for gypsies)  violinists specifically\u0027.\u0027Prof Carpos-Young told the tribunal: \u0027The notes contained some of the discriminatory language my PhD research showed professional musicians had used.\u0027The terms illuminated ways some iniduals in the industry * engage in conduct which would in my view be unlawful because it is discriminatory.\u0027Prof Carpos-Young said she circulated her notes to the student body at the request of deputy principal Tim Jones. Three students complained one of whom, named as Dan Shao, posted them on social media.Soon other students piled in to complain, one writing: \u0027I was extremely shocked. I feel certain areas of this document are completely inappropriate and offensive.\u0027For example terminology of violins as gypos, look young, be clubbable* To highlight but a few!\u0027Another said: \u0027 I do not want to be advised on keeping my head down, be told brass players got drunk and string players are bores who can be found drinking tea\u0027But wait, doesn\u0027t that mean they don\u0027t appear \u0027young, up together and cool\u0027?

I expect Francesca to apologise for sending this out.\u0027The tribunal heard 58 students then signed an open letter saying: \u0027Clearly Fran\u0027s letter is not an exception to an otherwise idyllic and welcoming environment but rather a symptom of a much broader and deeper failure to live up to institutional aims regarding equality and ersity.\u0027Prof Carpos-Young was fired for gross misconduct for \u0027bringing the academy into disrepute.\u0027Professor Jones said he only decided to sack her mid-way through their meeting on November 3 last year after she became \u0027confrontational\u0027.The tribunal said the good feedback from her lecture may have lulled her into thinking her comments would be \u0027read as intended.\u0027Judge Goodman said: \u0027Some (a very small proportion) of the content was provocative, an old pedagogical technique to stimulate interest.\u0027On the other hand, she was a woman of mature judgement, who had been in education in London, at least part-time, for some years, and so familiar with the culture of protest and activism in which isolated terms can be seized on and misrepresented by a minority as condoning or encouraging the behaviour it describes, all magnified in influence by social media.\u0027To that extent only - that she should have considered more carefully how her words might read if taken without introduction to the lecture material and out of context, and should have edited them with that in mind - was she in any way negligent in her duties as a lecturer and so at fault in contributing to what occurred.\u0027The tribunal concluded there should be a reduction in her award - of \u0027not more than ten percent\u0027 - to reflect this lack of judgement in failing to anticipate how her notes might be read by a younger generation.Prof Carpos-Young had only been hired by the academy, whose patron is the Queen, two months earlier. The presidency is held by the Duchess of Gloucester and was formerly held by Princess Diana.She said: \u0027Tim said that I had brought the academy into disrepute.\u0027He said that sending the document without context and bringing the academy into serious disrepute was gross misconduct and that he was terminating my employment with immediate effect. He told me that I wasn\u0027t going to receive any notice pay.\u0027This came like a bolt out of the blue for me. I was extremely shocked and hadn\u0027t expected anything like this.The professor\u0027s claims of whistle-blowing and sexual discrimination were dismissed  - but she won on the grounds of wrongful dismissal, victimisation and failure to be accompanied at a hearing.  "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1d5ce8dfd7f27b2a8731865cdb7fb2195de76ee/38_121_2022_1214/master/2022.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f2ff0a3bec3c9204e4eaa94eba0579fd","title":"edge of visibility exhibition susan tallman kerry james marshall","story":"In a new exhibition in New York, works from artists such as Kerry James Marshall and Samuel Levi Jones take on racial, social and political visibilityIn 2016, curator Susan Tallman was at an art fair in Chicago when one piece of artwork stopped her in her tracks. It was a series of 48 portraits of prominent African Americans, from Nina Simone to Maya Angelou, by Samuel Levi Jones, who had hung them all in a grid.“From a distance, I thought it was an abstract grid, but it’s only when I walked closer, I saw there were faces in it,” said Tallman. “Then, the penny drops when you think about Gerhard Richter’s 48 Portraits.”She’s referring to Richter, the German artist who created 48 portraits of influential white men in literature, science, philosophy and music. From Albert Einstein to Oscar Wilde and Thomas Mann, Richter created portraits of 48 men born between 1824 and 1904, with their faces modeled after encyclopedia portraits, which he found from 1971 and 1998.But the 48 portraits by Jones point to a different history. “It struck me as such a powerful device to get you to pay attention,” said Tallman. “Sam thought about all the people who got left out of history.”This artwork and more are part of the Edge of Visibility, an exhibition on view at the International Print Center of New York. From works by Kerry James Marshall, Chris Ofili and William Kentridge, the artworks touch upon racial, social and political visibility, and what is often overlooked.Tallman, the curator of the exhibit, wanted to shed light on the issue in a time when so many communities are unnoticed. “It has this power to make you think – how do I start looking? How do I become more conscientious about trying to see what isn’t being made obvious to me?” said Tallman. “I think that is the key component, especially in America right now, asking ourselves: ‘How do we start looking at what’s not being fed to us?’”The exhibit features an artwork by former US president Barack Obama’s favorite artist, Glenn Ligon, who quotes the 20th-century African American author, Zora Neale Hurston, for an artwork that reads: “I feel most colored when I am thrown against a white background.” The piece, which quotes Hurston’s 1928 essay How It Feels To Be Colored Me, is written in beige – something that could be compared to Caucasian flesh tone.“It’s his flip on what we expect when we talk about race in America,” said Tallman. “Instead of talking about experiences if you happen to be black, to extend to everyone, through this piece, it’s symbolically ‘white’ on white paper.”A diptych by Kerry James Marshall of black nude figures as Frankenstein and Bride of Frankenstein is also in the exhibit. In reference to his artwork, the artist explained in 2016: “If a part of the goal is to normalize the presence of those figures in museums and artworks you have to have a sustained engagement with those figures under a variety of conditions and circumstances so that now, it becomes ordinary to you.”There is also a screen print of a black flag by artist Megan Foster, captured at half-mast in darkness. “It’s an elegy for democracy itself,” said Tallman. “It was done the day after the 2016 presidential election, literally the morning after.”As for Jones’s 48 portraits of African Americans, they’re shown on black paper, almost hidden. This could partly be why the title of the artwork is meant to look like under-exposed photography, as a metaphor for racist histories.“Race-based visibility and inclusion in recent times has been growing more and more,” said the artist. “With this comes greater resistance and the attempt to dismantle progression. It is important that those who have been forcibly marginalized, realize visibility must continue, and with strong unity. It is up to the oppressed to break free of the antics that keep others in power.”Jones had his own kind of reaction to Richter’s 48 portraits when he first discovered the artwork. “I was confused as to why one would paint portraits of only white men,” said Jones. “I also asked myself why these paintings would be elevated.”But there might be another kind of hidden visibility there, as well. “The representation of white men was predominant over non-white males, but maybe Richter was questioning what I was questioning,” said Jones, “or perhaps, that’s a stretch.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36562b61b4ad55201d781dbb38c508893951b1d7/0_0_6000_8010/master/6000.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=63bad1aa629738e56bf0226b1867b832 2020w","title":"recycling the old masters in pictures suzanne jongmans","story":"Dutch artist Suzanne Jongmans creates photographs that echo the old masters, but with a modern twist: she crafts intricate costumes using recycled plastics, old blankets and used packaging. Jongmans finds inspiration in painters such as Jan van Eyck, Rembrandt and Holbein, whose level of detail she aims to replicate. “When you look at the old masters, you can really see the time that is put into the paintings,” she says. “And that fits with the method I developed.” There is an implicit environmental message in her work but, she says, her primary objective is giving a new life to these old materials. “I’m a collector mostly – I collect all kinds of things, like blankets, wool, things from nature.

But after this year’s finalists, the writers Lula Carballo, Dominique Fortier, Karoline Georges, Kevin Lambert and Jean-Christophe Réhel, discovered that Amazon Canada would be the prize’s new principal sponsor, they wrote to Le Devoir urging organisers to reconsider.“Our great unease comes from the dangerous competition this giant has with Quebec bookstores.

Need we mention the inhumane methods of this online giant, which constitute a danger for small traders and culture at large?” they wrote.The authors said they had not been made aware of the partnership before they were announced as finalists, and the “painful shock” of the discovery made some of them consider withdrawing from the prize. But they decided this would affect both their publishing houses and the students, and so decided instead to air their discomfort in the hope of finding another solution.After the letter was published, organisers announced the prize would be suspended. In a statement, co-founder Claude Bourgie Bovet said the decision was the “direct result of the distressing reaction of many parties in the Quebec book trade following the recent announcement of major support”.According to the Montreal Gazette, organisers of the award have said they will meet with the literary community and relaunch the prize if they can find enough support. Hundreds of Canadian teachers have signed a letter calling for government intervention to save the award.Amazon has been approached for comment.

Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week:First up: ancient history. Thucydides’ History of the Peloponnesian War continues to delight paulburns:First read it at age 17. I’ve lost count of the number of times I’ve reread it after that. Its one of my favourite books. Just to mention a few magnificent highlights of great historical writing - The sea battle between the Corcyreans and Corinthians, 433 the plague in Athens, 430 the fighting at Megara, 424 the character sketch of the Spartan commander, Brasidias the rise and fall of Cleon the destruction of the Athenian Expedition in Sicily, 413 the oligarchic Coup and its overthrow in Athens.I can’t do a post on Thucydides and not mention his use of speeches. He gives recollections of speeches he has heard himself or pieces together a speech from accounts of those who were there at the time. Apart from the Melian dialogue, where he more or less expounds on his philosophy of history, he begins a tradition in classical historiography which is eventually much abused by speeches just being made up by some later writers. If you haven’t yet read Thucydides, put aside some time to do so. Its a reading experience you won’t forget.Another “non-fiction delight”, Babel (Around the World In 20 Languages) by Gaston Dorren, has occupied storm46:What an enjoyable read for a Languages nerd! The story of 20 Lingua Francas, sometimes their particular linguistic quirks (to other language speakers - not to the native speakers concerned of course), their social conventions, their rise to power and the reasons why they may have become a lingua franca, and just oodles of fascinating facts. The chapters, depending on the language under discussion, cover linguistics, history, politics, and the writing style is effortlessly readable and very funny.I particularly appreciated this quote from the sardonic chapter on Français, written in 1671: “Of all languages, French has the most natural and sleekest pronunciation. The Chinese and well-nigh all Asian peoples sing the Germans grumble the Spaniards holler the Italians sigh the English whistle. Only the French can properly be said to speak.”BerlinBirdie wants to “rave” about The Buddha in the Attic by Julie Otsuka:About Japanese brides travelling to the US in the 1920s to marry Japanese emigrants there, who’d mostly lied about their financial and social status, and sent photos of younger, better-looking men to tempt their brides. Rather like a dating app in fact. The book details the women’s experiences in a precise, moving way, not by following inidual stories but by depicting their varied but collective experiences - written in a first-person plural voice (“We were... Some of us found...”) and taking their lives stage by stage - the voyage, the arrival, the first night, babies, children, etc etc. A lot of their experience was hard as you might expect, yet the tone is never accusing or miserable. It’s clear, calm, delicate - almost poetic in fact. Brilliant.Completely brilliant, every last story. Every last word. There were stories from all across the spectrum, pre-war Colorado, antebellum slavery, Mexico in the days of Pancho Villa, hardscrabble Texas... They all seemed to rotate a common center of gravity, the struggle against unrealized potential for pre-Suffragge women. It still seems relevant in an age when women’s health choices are often dictated to them by the ovary-free.Me Talk Pretty One Day by David Sedaris has been the “right book at the right time” for LiteraryWanderings:This was my first foray into the world of David Sedaris and it won’t be my last. I found that the essays became stronger after the first third, but how much this was the writing or me becoming attuned to Sedaris I’m not sure. Laugh out loud funny in parts, this has been a perfect reading companion of late.Finally, EstelleMoon took a “nosee into nostalgia” and read Night Watch by Terry Pratchett:I really liked it! It’s one of the City Watch series within Discworld which focusses on Sam Vimes and the police force of Ankh-Morpork. It made me laugh out loud more than once, and is at the same time a pretty pointed and successful satire on revolutionary idealism.It’s a great book.

When I discussed the topic with Plomin last month, we agreed on the need for urgent discussion of the implications, before genetic selection of embryos for intelligence hits the market. We’re too late. A company called Genomic Prediction, based in New Jersey, has announced that it will offer that service. New Scientist reports that it has already begun talks with American IVF clinics to find customers. They won’t be in short supply.Before we start imagining a Gattaca-style future of genetic elites and underclasses, there’s some context needed. The company says it is only offering such testing to spot embryos with an IQ low enough to be classed as a disability, and won’t conduct analyses for high IQ. But the technology the company is using will permit that in principle, and co-founder Stephen Hsu, who has long advocated for the prediction of traits from genes, is quoted as saying: “If we don’t do it, some other company will.”The development must be set, too, against what is already possible and permitted in IVF embryo screening. The procedure called pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) involves extracting cells from embryos at a very early stage and “reading” their genomes before choosing which to implant. It has been enabled by rapid advances in genome-sequencing technology, making the process fast and relatively cheap. In the UK, PGD is strictly regulated by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA), which permits its use to identify embryos with several hundred rare genetic diseases of which the parents are known to be carriers. PGD for other purposes is illegal.In the US it’s a very different picture. Restrictive laws about what can be done in embryo and stem-cell research using federal funding sit alongside a largely unregulated, laissez-faire private sector, including IVF clinics. PGD to select an embryo’s sex for “family balancing” is permitted, for example. There is nothing in US law to prevent PGD for selecting embryos with “high IQ”.But what exactly does that mean? The work of Plomin and others has shown over the past few years that correlations exist between the code in our genomes and pretty much any trait you can think of, including IQ and academic achievement. Such links to complex traits (as opposed to single-gene diseases) are usually invisible for any inidual gene, but become significant when the influence of hundreds or even thousands of genes are summed in “polygenic scores”.So the service offered by Genomic Prediction, while it might help to spot extreme low-IQ outliers, is of very limited value for predicting which of several “normal” embryos will be smartest. Imagine, though, the misplaced burden of expectation on a child “selected” to be bright who doesn’t live up to it. If embryo selection for high IQ goes ahead, this will happen.What’s more, the many genes involved in a polygenic score for intelligence are in no sense “genes for intelligence” they will have many roles. If you’re “selecting for intelligence” you don’t know what else you might be selecting for, for better or worse.So the science behind embryo IQ testing is still shaky. But before we get too indignant about the horrors of designer babies, bear in mind that already we permit, even in the UK, prenatal screening for Down’s syndrome, a disability that produces low to moderate intellectual disability. It’s not easy to make a moral or philosophical case that the screening offered by Genomic Prediction for low IQ is any different. There may be more uncertainty but, given not all IVF embryos will be implanted anyway, can we object to tipping the scales? And how can we condone efforts to improve your child’s intelligence after birth but not before?The questions are complicated. How to balance inidual rights against what is good for society as a whole? When does avoidance of disease and disability shade into enhancement? Should society be more receptive to disability rather than seeing it as something to be eradicated? When does choice become tyranny?In the UK we are extraordinarily lucky to have the HFEA, which frames binding regulation after careful deliberation and acts as a brake so the technology does not outrun the debate. “Embryo selection needs robust regulation that society can be confident in,” says Ewan Birney, director of the European Bioinformatics Institute in Cambridge. Leaving a matter such as this to unregulated market forces is dangerous."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/441bf9ed7d5a060bbd6f0f185bdc84f3f562fe80/0_538_4827_2898/master/4827.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b966663c7d9043b909c55d856ecf0084","title":"new grandchild love parenting trends","story":"I can hear him shrieking upstairs as I write. It’s his new thing – a sort of shouting. Every day there is a new thing. Every day he changes. Lights and the colour red seem to excite him beyond all else. They make his legs go berserk, like a tiny Irish dancer. It’s such a long time since I lived with a baby, so I am learning all over again. My daughter and her boyfriend didn’t plan on living with me but they have been. No one needs a lecture on the housing situation in London. It’s tough. It’s even tougher with a kid.So here we all are under one roof, but at entirely different stages of our lives. The labour happened here and they didn’t even wake me up. When they went off to the hospital, I texted to see if they had managed to park OK. Parking I hear is an issue. A picture of a tiny creature was texted back he was nearly born in the car park.“You will love it” – so many people told me this beforehand that I felt suspicious. It’s weird being told that you will love someone you have never met. Then I encountered something I never knew existed: elderly broodiness. “I am so jealous,” many friends said when I told them of my impending nandom, whereas all I could say was: “I am not ready.” An ex-colleague emailed recently, speaking of his own “faint wistfulness for a grandchild”.It’s the best relationship, everyone jokes, because you can hand them back. This is true. You get the edited highlights. I am not up all night deranged with tiredness and sore nipples. I don’t change nappies. Mainly in the first weeks, I cooked, as I know how to do that.For there are lots of things I don’t know how to do, even though I have brought up three babies myself. Partly I have forgotten and partly fashions change. I slept with mine or, more accurately, passed out with them in the bed. This is now frowned on a bit in case you squash them in the night. You have to have a cot sort of attached to the bed.My friend, Philippa Perry, said: “For the first six months there is no difference between want and need.” I know a lot of grownups like that, too. Babies want to be held all the time, and indeed why shouldn’t they be?We used to believe in some old hippy thing called the Continuum Concept, where we were to behave as tribeswomen with our babies strapped to us all the time. The backlash then came with the Gina Ford regimes of sleep training, a particularly cruel form of herding cats if you ask me. But for my generation, rushing back to work, expressing milk in office toilets, it was deemed necessary. Blackout blinds. One mate of mine was taping them up and I saw the insanity of behaving like you were in the Blitz in order to get the baby in tune with the work ethic.So I am not entirely to be trusted, and the first time I babysat I was made to watch some YouTube videos so that the anxious parents would know I knew what to do. There are still things I can’t work out, such as the enormous amount of kit. But there is one thing I can: with all the awful things in the world there is little more joyful than a tiny human, and this special time when one enters a universe in which they are the centre. This universe is both smaller than everything else but somehow larger, too.As they prepare to move to their own place, I realise, for I am indeed slow on the uptake, that at my age and in my house I have been living in a love story. It’s happened. I have fallen for someone entirely new."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/594b11827e4f064f604ec3b98f9c74dfbb88e6e9/0_157_4805_2884/master/4805.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fd12b79fb2c9d157ca40b580b5927c58","title":"theresa may eu nationals jumped queue","story":"Britain is now in panic mode, held hostage by a foolish plan gone really really bad.Theresa May has been cornered by her own party, which is plotting to get rid of her. She is mocked by the opposition and laughed at by the EU.The only option left open to her is to try to win the hearts, or perhaps the underbellies, of voters, by finding an uncomplicated and easy-to-repeat narrative to justify her version of Brexit. The problem is that panic and politics aren’t a good mix.Populist promises such as the one she made this morning to stop EU migrants “jumping the queue” spread resentment towards European citizens like me. Not only did we play no part in this mess, but we work here legally and contribute to the country in many different ways. We did not “jump the queue” but exercised the same general right of freedom of movement that allows British people to work in Berlin and Paris, or retire in Spain. Even so, our reward seems to be an increasingly hostile atmosphere, and infinite red tape when we attempt to apply for permanent residency to set our minds at rest.I was born and grew up in Sicily and moved to London in 1996 shortly after I turned 20 years old.I’ve put down roots here, made friends and created a wonderful family. Since I started working as a photographer I’ve paid my taxes and national insurance contributions and jumped no queues whatsoever. No, I’ve earned the benefits I enjoy – a happy and constructive existence in London – through sheer hard work.Since the referendum in 2016 I have noticed an alarming increase in both veiled and more explicit verbal abuse based on my nationality and my Mediterranean appearance. Living life in the face of this stigma is not always easy, but I have enough resources to stand my ground, and thanks to the broad support I receive from friends and colleagues I have the luxury of brushing nasty comments off with irony and a lot of sarcasm. However, this rise in anti-European feeling needs to be addressed and stopped, because it will end in people getting hurt.The dog-whistling May did this morning achieves the exact opposite. It will give permission to any members of the general public who feel that we European citizens are not welcome here to bully, hassle us, or worse.I believe that in the years ahead, as Brexit is exposed as a false solution and times become hard, there will need to be a scapegoat, someone to point at. May is laying the ground for that someone to be an innocent European national living in the UK.I confess that I am shocked by the lack of a strong political counter-narrative to this xenophobia, with the exception of London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, who has been active in stressing the importance of EU nationals living in his city, and explaining how strength and growth is founded on pluralism.Finally I find it strange that we are viewed with condescension even by the most liberal minds in this country. I’m often told: “Ah, you’ll be alright, you’ve been here for many years.” Many British people assume that as an Italian living in the UK I am only concerned about my future here. That is a worry, I suppose. But I have a broader perspective – I am worried for Britain as a whole.What I am witnessing is the country I have chosen to live in taking a wrong turn. I am left with a feeling of deep disappointment in British institutions and British political common sense. I remember how my British friends used to mock Italy for electing Silvio Berlusconi as prime minister, and I loved the fact that I lived in a country that recognised how surreal Italian politics was. Honest, correct sensible Britain on the one hand and crazy, foolish corrupted Italy on the other.Unfortunately the landscape has changed. If the worst comes to the worst, I can still go back to the crazy corrupted Italy we all loved to take the mickey out of. British-born people without another nationality, on the other hand, have no plan B. They are the ones who will be forced to deal with an unrecognisable Britain, bitter and corrupted, the victims of an Etonian gamble gone very wrong."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c3eb416b29b32f046040c824eafcb9f2bf40035/0_216_5500_3301/master/5500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f330199a9f8138433912d19fb0aaecb8","title":"former academy head given 850000 payoff","story":"Sir Greg Martin was paid out of proceeds from private leisure centre on school groundsThe former head of a controversial academy is being paid an £850,000 severance package out of proceeds from a private leisure centre run on the school grounds, MPs have heard.Details of the payment to Sir Greg Martin, the former head of the Durand Academy in Stockwell, south London, emerged on Monday during a hearing of the Commons public accounts committee, which is investigating academy accounts and performance.It is the latest development in a long-running saga involving Martin, who was knighted for services to education and was once a favourite of Tory ministers, before falling out of favour as concerns grew about financial management and governance at the school.Durand Academy has since been transferred to a new sponsor and has been renamed the Van Gogh primary school, but the Durand Education Trust (DET) retained ownership of the private leisure centre developed on the site, as well as two accommodation blocks, which originally generated additional income for the school.John Wentworth, a DET trustee, told MPs the assets – the leisure centre and accommodation – were still generating £400,000 a year but “most” of the money was going towards Martin’s severance pay rather than going towards’ children’s education.“At the moment, we have a considerable liability to the previous executive headteacher of Durand Academy,” Wentworth told MPs, adding that the severance figure had been “considerably higher” but had been reduced after negotiations between Martin and the Charity Commission.Wentworth told MPs there were ongoing discussions between the DET and the Education and Skills Funding Agency about what would happen to the leisure centre and accommodation blocks. He said if the DET retained control they would be used in line with its charitable objectives “to support the wider education objectives of children in Lambeth and to support the children at the Van Gogh primary school”.The hearing offered some fascinating insights into the complexities of transferring schools from one trust to another. The Dunraven Educational Trust, which finally took over Durand, was given just 48 hours to make a decision after the Harris Federation pulled out, though Harris helpfully shared all the information gathered during its investigations. Nevertheless, committee chair Meg Hillier described it as “a 48-hour fire sale”.The hearing was also told about troubles at Bright Tribe, which ran 10 schools in the north and east of England which are now being rebrokered. The academies troubleshooter, Angela Barry, who was brought as interim chief executive, refused to give details about ongoing investigations but apologised for past failings."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/77cccd5ae7dd5d1871a88179dd3e69a33103f599/0_13_7205_4322/master/7205.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f0aa9ce0a5eefd51551432fd7e9bc88e","title":"efl 595m tv deal sky clubs championship","story":"• Some Championship clubs not keen on parts of proposed deal• Aston Villa, Derby and Leeds among clubs who voiced concernsThe English Football League has announced it has formally agreed to a five-year domestic broadcasting deal with Sky Sports worth £595m, starting next season.The deal was unanimously approved by the league’s nine-strong board but is slightly different to the agreement provisionally made with the broadcaster last September.That was for £600m over five seasons and Sky Sports has also obtained eight extra midweek games a season that it can show on its red button service in pubs and clubs.Several Championship clubs, including Aston Villa, Derby and Leeds, strongly criticised the original proposal and they are unlikely to be happy with the final agreement.But the EFL board has decided this is the best option and it will give every club the chance to build their own ‘direct to consumer’ streaming service.In a statement the EFL’s interim chair, Debbie Jevans, said: “Having fully considered the matter, its implications and any associated risks, the EFL board is satisfied that the right deal for the EFL and its clubs has been reached.“Concluding these negotiations has indeed been challenging, as is the case when managing a erse group of stakeholders, and the board took on board the comments and frustrations voiced by a number of clubs and has committed to reviewing the way the league engages with its clubs to ensure that we move forward in a collaborative way in the future.”That is reference to recent suggestions that up to 15 Championship clubs wanted to reject the Sky offer, believing it tied the league in too long and was not worth enough money.Some of those clubs are also understood to have threatened to break away from the EFL if the deal was signed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/84950d3a6241d9ada517828c60a10dd249b5fe96/0_51_1267_760/master/1267.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eca771b9702b55361c22adba733ed90c","title":"harry kane best goalscorer world england gareth southgate","story":"Oh, Gareth. We almost made it. Although, who knows, with a little time those Harry Kane remarks might just start to make their own kind of quietly insistent good sense.The end of November will mark two years since Gareth Southgate’s rather bashful unveiling as England manager, a reign that began with a public apology deep in the grey concrete bowels of Wembley stadium. It has become commonplace to suggest Southgate is yet to put a foot wrong in that time, an impression confirmed by England’s performance against Croatia at Wembley on Sunday.England teams fade out. England teams never learn. England teams just keep battering away at the same pane of glass like a platoon of dying flies. Not here though, as England re-geared their approach and came from behind to win a game in the last 15 minutes which is something of a rare feat for the national team, tournament extra time aside.Best of all Southgate’s late changes and tactical fluidity made good the one slight stain on his time so far, the stasis toward the end of the World Cup semi-final when England seemed to be strapped a little too stubbornly into the system that had got them there.In fact everything was looking fine, great, top hole, prelude to a blemish-free two-year wrap of the dawning of the age of Gareth. Right up to the moment Southgate announced in victory that Kane is “the best goalscorer in the world”.This seems so out of kilter with the smart, measured tone of this England era that regular Gareth watchers have suggested it is more than just an offhand remark. For a start, it’s not true, or not true enough to be worth saying. Cristiano Ronaldo has 48 goals in his past 54 games for Portugal. Neymar has 60 in 95 and is gearing up to haul in a bloke called Pelé in the next two years. Do we really want to play this game?And yet, Southgate is right in other ways. This is a good moment to offer a little unconditional love for a footballer in the middle of his own sweet spot as at this level but who is also in the process of changing his game a little, of becoming Harry 3.0.The most notable part of Kane’s performance was of course that late winner, his 20th goal for England in 35 appearances. Only Gary Lineker (27 games) has got there quicker in modern times. Otherwise Kane is out in front of Wayne Rooney (49), Kevin Keegan (49) Michael Owen (46), Alan Shearer (43) and the oddly overlooked David Platt (42).He scores big goals too, tempo-setters and game-deciders, all but four of them in competitive internationals. Odd isn’t it? The more Kane hones his game – the luckier he seems to get with those tap-ins and deflections.It still seems too much to suggest, as Rooney has, that Kane will go on to break that 53-goal England record. For one thing Rooney enjoyed a 15-year  with England Kane is unlikely to be leading the attack as a 36-year-old at the 2030 World Cup.And more to the point: who cares, really? It is exactly this obsession with personal laurels, of star players who cling on just a little too long, that the current generation should be looking to move beyond. Kane has already helped drive an overachieving team to a surprise semi-final. He has a tournament Golden Boot. Record, schmecord. These are riches of an altogether different kind.Beyond this Kane is changing as a player, and in ways that may or may not affect his longevity. At Wembley he had more shots on target than the entire Croatia team, but he also won more headers than anyone else and held the ball with great craft while England’s inside-forwards ran off him.Kane put Raheem Sterling in on goal with a lovely spin and pass, as he had Marcus Rashford in Spain. He looked like what he is, an all-round footballer who played in midfield coming up the age groups, who can drop deep as a forward playmaker or fight and wrestle with his back to goal.It is a basic footballing intelligence that will serve both England and Kane well from here. The fact is, he does look a slightly different athlete. We have seen this process before. Rooney, Owen and Shearer all tell us that the Premier League takes a bite out of you, that it steals the snap from the legs.For the last four seasons Kane has played with the throttle maxed out. He went almost three years without an injury. Since then his ankle has begun to twang. His returns from injury have been disturbingly swift. For those who point to his lack of flash, the absence of Messi-like dribbling or lightning speed off the mark, this is a player tailoring his game, developing in his mid-20s and whose career has always told us that talent is overrated, that brains, nerve and will are what really make the difference.Hence perhaps the praise now from a manager who has shown himself to be ruthless but who will see this is a good moment to reassure a senior player. Integrating the well-schooled creative talents of the likes of Jadon Sancho and Phil Foden is the next level for this England-Southgate project.Kane offers a bridge for that generation: not just a cutting edge, but a state-of-the-art Premier League athlete who also has some of the old street smarts, with the cunning to mould and change his game to fit. Best in the world will always be a losing game. But you get Southgate’s deeper point. As it stands Kane is perfect for this evolving team, an England player to be enjoyed right now, in the middle of his own golden years."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6fba0ed0fcb44b6680038b58d48b436606a2568/297_0_3201_1920/master/3201.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=67598f1a9075a4dd6b8709a0d8ead471","title":"germany netherlands denmark republic of ireland nations league live","story":"90 min+1: There will be four added minutes. The Dutch fans, decked out in orange, are finally making all the noise.The Netherlands decide it’s time to go long in search of an equaliser. Virgil Van Dijk, up from the back, makes a nuisance of himself and wins the first header. Hummels heads it away, but Vilhena collects on the right. He makes room for a cross and when it’s flicked on at the near post, Van Dijk’s waiting in the middle to cushion a firm volley past Neuer! The Dutch are going to the Nations League finals!87 min: Goretzka combines with Reus, who plays a brilliant pass to Kehrer with the outside of his right foot, only for the wing-back to drag a tame effort wide.Leon Goretzka gets caught trying to play out from the back, allowing the Netherlands to press on the edge of the area. De Roon finds Quincy Promes, who shifts the ball on to his right foot before shaping a fine effort to Neuer’s left from 18 yards. The Dutch have at least five minutes to find a goal that would take them into the Nations League finals!It’s not over yet!81 min: Schulz sees his goalbound volley deflected wide.78 min: Depay surges down the left, skips round Hummels and lets fly with a shot that Neuer saves at his near post. Corner.74 min: “Holland are playing this as if it’s a meaningless friendly,” Kari Tulinius says. “Somehow that this is at least notionally meaningful and they seem to have given up with more than twenty minutes to go makes it worse than watching a meaningless friendly.”72 min: Muller clips a lovely pass over the top to Reus, completely slicing the Dutch defence open. It should lead to a third goal, but Reus’s ball into the six-yard box is behind Sane, who can’t sort out his feet in time.68 min: Kimmich picks up a booking for dragging back Promes.67 min: Serge Gnabry makes way for Thomas Muller, who’s on for his 100th cap.66 min: Diloresen, who replaced the injured Babel, is limping now. On comes Luuk de Jong. 62 min: Germany clear Depay’s free-kick and launch a speedy counterattack, Gnabry releasing Werner. The striker’s through on goal, but he scuffs wide of the left post.59 min: Hummels lose out to Depay, but Sule steps in to stop the striker just inside the Germany area. The Romanian referee sees nothing wrong with the challenge.56 min: Promes cuts inside from the left and shoots straight at Neuer from 20 yards. At least Germany’s goalkeeper has made a save.53 min: Werner tries to run at De Ligt on the left, but the defender stands up and forces the Germany striker to take the ball out of play.51 min: Kroos pulls Depay’s shirt on the halfway line. That’s a yellow card.48 min: It’s all Germany.46 min: The Netherlands get the second half underway. They need two goals to make the finals. But they make a sloppy start, giving the ball away far too easily straight away. They breathe a sigh of relief when Werner shoots straight at Cillessen from the right of the area. That was a good chance.The first half ends with Germany in control thanks to excellent goals from Timo Werner and Leroy Sane. As it stands France will be going to the Nations League finals instead of the Netherlands, who have been a massive disappointment.45 min: Babel limps to the touchline and makes way for Javairo Dilrosun.43 min: Sane somehow wriggles along the right goalline, the ball glued to his twinkling feet, but he can’t quite tee up Gnabry. Up the other end, Babel goes down with a hamstring injury. It looks like his night’s over.40 min: Werner feeds the overlapping Schulz on the left, but Gnabry glances the wing-back’s cross wide at the near post. 39 min: Toni Kroos has been magnificent so far. 37 min: The ball runs to Sane on the edge of the area after a turn from Gnabry. The Netherlands are in trouble again. Or so it seems. Sane’s shot is blocked. Moments later Wijnaldum’s booked for barging into Kimmich.36 min: Ronald Koeman won’t be pleased with how easy it’s been for Kroos and Kimmich to run the show in midfield. His players haven’t been close enough to them. “Not just the pettiness of getting one over on their rivals that’s at stake for Germany tonight, but also seedings for the Euro 2020 qualifiers,” Simon Cook says. “Lose tonight, and as one of the relegated teams with the worst record in the competition, they’d probably miss out on being seeded for the qualifiers, which would make them a dangerous floater in Pot 2.... so to speak.”34 min: Blind curls in a cross from the left and the stretching Sule, trying to stop it from reaching Depay, steers a header against his own bar and over for a corner. An escape for Germany. They have luck on their side tonight.32 min: The Netherlands piece together a neat move down the right, prompting Schulz to pull Tete down. Depay’s free-kick is a waste of time, though.30 min: Gnabry shoots straight at Cillessen from 18 yards.29 min: De Roon wins a corner for the Netherlands on the right. It leads to nothing. Neuer hasn’t made a save yet.28 min: “I always loved that Van Basten goal to beat Germany in Euro 88,” Niall Mullen says. “He always seemed so elegant and totally in control that he made a sliding finish like that into a thing of beauty that has stayed with me for 30 (thirty) years.”25 min: The Netherlands look shocked at the moment. It’s been a disaster for them so far. They could hardly have made a worse start to such an important game.23 min: As it stands, the Dutch are totally effed.Under little pressure, Toni Kroos is allowed to look up on the halfway line and send a lovely pass over the top of the increasingly dismal Dutch defence. Leroy Sane’s peeled behind De Ligt, who doesn’t know whether he’s coming or going, and the Germany winger’s allowed to take the ball down, turn and shoot with his left foot from 18 yards. His effort skids off Tete and that’s enough to take it skidding into the bottom left corner, leaving the Netherlands with a mountain to climb.18 min: The pitch is very bad. The ball is bouncing around all over the place.15 min: The ball’s on the right of the D. It looks like it’s there for the left-footed Daley Blind to hit, only for Depay to whip a disappointing effort straight into the wall.14 min: Kroos concedes possession with a poor pass inside his own half. Hummels panics and scythes Promes down on the edge of the Germany area. He’s booked.13 min: A free kick to the Netherlands on the right, Schulz conceding it. Sule heads De Jong’s dangerous delivery behind for a corner. Nothing comes from it.11 min: As it stands, France are going to next summer’s finals instead of the Netherlands. The Dutch will finish second unless they score.This is outstanding from Timo Werner! Toni Kroos zips a pass to Serge Gnabry, who flicks the ball on to Werner. The striker struggled so much at the World Cup, but this is a demonstration of what he can do. He nods the ball into his stride and then, with the Dutch defence all over the place, slams a low, bouncing drive to Jasper Cillessen’s right from 25 yards! Germany have the lead and the Netherlands are up against it now.8 min: The visitors, remember, don’t need to win. They’re happy enough not to commit too many men forward at the moment.7 min: Germany try to counter, but De Roon cuts out a long ball to Sane, who would have been away.5 min: Kimmich advances down the right and finds Kehrer, who wins Germany’s first corner. Van Dijk heads Kroos’s cross away.4 min: You’ll remember that Germany lost 3-0 in Amsterdam last month. It really hasn’t been their year.2 min: Germany are playing a back three tonight. Don’t they know England have gone back to 4-3-3? Keep up, lads.Peep! Germany, in white shirts and black shorts, get the game underway. They’re kicking from left to right in the first half and they’re quickly on the front foot, Werner turning cleverly and freeing Kehrer on the right. The right wing-back has space in the Netherlands area, but he fires high and wide.We’ve had the anthems. We’ve had the handshakes. We’ll have some football!The teams are out. Time for the anthems!Hello. Some people say that football is all about glory and honour. Those people are wrong. Because the human race is a terrible species, the unspoken truth is that football is really all about making your enemies as miserable as you are. There’s no problem that can’t be solved by ruining someone else’s fun, just for the sheer hell of it, which is why Joachim Low’s ailing side can go a long way towards repairing their standing in the eyes of the German public by stopping the Netherlands from snatching the final qualifying spot for the Nations League finals tonight.It’s not that beating the Dutch would make all of Germany’s problems disappear at once. This has been a year of unprecedented incompetence for Die Mannschaft. As if crashing out of the first round of the World Cup for the first time since 1938 wasn’t bad enough, now they’ve gone and been relegated from Division A of the Nations League with a game to spare! It’s been quite the fall from grace for the 2014 world champions, whose fate was sealed when the Netherlands beat France on Friday night. This evening, however, they can put all the arguments about their worrying slide to one side. Germany are playing for something more important than pride. This isn’t about finishing 2018 on a high: it’s about the pettiness of getting one over on one of their fiercest rivals.For the Netherlands, the thought of partying on German soil is almost too good to be true. They’re on the up again after missing the last two international tournaments and Ronald Koeman’s resurgent side are a victory away from reaching next summer’s festivities in Portugal.

What’s behind the trend, and can exercise really change your shape?The hottest gym in LA right now is Bünda: Portuguese slang for bum, the “home of the better butt” – a gym entirely dedicated to working your posterior. It promises a “total body change”: “Once you Bünda, you will never look back … well, maybe for a selfie.”The trend has hit UK gyms, too, with a number now offering a range of classes focused only on glutes, from “BadAss” to the “Kylie Butt Lift” – named after Minogue, not Jenner. But it is the rise and rise of Jenner and the Kardashian family, whose bottoms have grown with their bank balances, that has led to a seismic shift in workout culture. While many women have, of course, always taken pride in well developed glutes, the emphasis on a firm, or “juicy”, bottom has now overtaken the flat stomach as the fitness holy grail in mainstream women’s health magazines.Instagram is the biggest platform for the trend, with #squats having reached 16.3m mentions and #glutes 4.6m as fitness influencers such as Tammy Hembrow and Katya Elise Henry profit from millions of followers wanting to know how to achieve their own butt transformations. With the Kardashians’ big bums and tiny waists the beauty benchmark for many young women, despite their multiple rumoured surgical enhancements, fitness trainers are finding that their clients increasingly approach them with unrealistic demands.“People bring me a photo of the bum they want, and I have to say: ‘OK, let me talk you through the picture’,” says personal trainer Kelechi Okafor. “They did not do this from training. These people manage to have humungous backsides, but their thighs, hamstrings and calf muscles are non-existent. I’m having to take a step back from taking on so many clients because it is so draining dealing with people’s expectations.”Some fitness experts say the trend is not just about aesthetics, and endorse glute-activation warm-ups as the best way to start a workout and get the body firing on all cylinders. Pilates trainer Hollie Grant says any form of glute activation helps people to bring their pelvis back to a more neutral position. “Most people have lazy glutes because, when they are sitting down, it lengthens and stretches the glute muscle. That has the effect of switching it off.”Grant enthuses about the benefits of strong glutes in preventing knee injuries and back problems, and also for postnatal women whose gluteal muscles have lengthened during pregnancy as a result of the relaxin hormone. “Plus, when your glutes are firing, you’re quicker at running and more powerful at doing squats and deadlifts.”Jim Pate, head physiotherapist at the Centre for Health and Human Performance in London, agrees that getting our glutes active is positive. “Glute exercises such as squats, deadlifts and lunges are good because they are compound – meaning they use many muscle groups, including the core.”But both Grant and Pate warn that the idea of “spot training” to isolate and train just one part of the body is a fallacy. “Over-focusing on one muscle group is going to mean that other areas are neglected and will remain undeveloped or, worse, will deteriorate if neglected over time,” says Pate. “Imbalances in different muscle groups’ strengths that are used together can result in poor functional performance or injury. An all-round programme will result in better, more sustainable results than passing fads.”With all the focus on women’s bottoms, there is a small group of health professionals hoping for a positive impact on the less visible muscles in and around our glutes: the pelvic floor. Amal Hassan, a sports and exercise medicine doctor, is one of the founding members of the Pelvic Floor Patrol, which aims to improve health services for women with pelvic floor dysfunction.“Your glutes support your pelvic floor,” she says. “So if you’re at risk of pelvic floor dysfunction and you’re not firing your glutes in functional movements – so sitting to stand, going upstairs – those deep pelvic muscles can become tight and cause pelvic pain, pain on sex, or propagate symptoms of incontinence or prolapse through weakness.” Even so, glute activation can be difficult to achieve, and Hassan advises using a resistance band to pinpoint the correct muscles.Additionally, she says, postnatal women should first prime the pelvic floor – by exhaling and lifting the muscles – before attempting loaded glute work such as weighted squatting, deadlifting, or even standing in the saddle at a spin class. Untucking the bottom can also help with posture.Okafor is dismissive of the idea this is a “body positive” movement just because it allows for a few curves. “We’re told this trend is progressive and inclusive, but body shaming and fat shaming is still going on. It’s not as if now that bigger bums are in we’re embracing everybody. It’s only a particular aesthetic that’s acceptable. What is progressive about that? We’re just creating real-life Barbie dolls.”Both in the UK and the US, many black fitness professionals are angered by the fitness industry’s new interest in larger bottoms that has led to, for instance, tennis star Serena Williams – her body a product of her sporting talent and discipline – grossly caricatured, while the same attributes in white women are considered desirable. “Remember when Caroline Wozniacki stuck towels down her skirt making fun of Serena?” says Okafor. “When it’s on a black woman it’s something we all laugh at – ‘look at this barbaric woman with her big bum’ – but a non-black woman with the same body is profitable.” Chrissy King, a personal trainer and powerlifter based in Milwaukee, who blogs about intersectional fitness, says “It’s the profitability of this cultural appropriation that is the burn. White women have been able to take something that black women have always had, popularise it and make money from it when black women can’t.”So should we rush out and join an ass class? The fitness professionals agree that strong gluteals are important for a well-functioning body. But as King asks her clients: “Do you want a bigger butt because, societally, you think this will make you feel more accepted? To me, this just feels like another example of fitness capitalising on women’s insecurities about their bodies.”Like Okafor, King is battling the way society pressures women to exercise to look a certain way, rather than focusing on fitness and strength for health and functionality. She despairs of the approach of many personal trainers and fitness influencers on social media. “I see the same things all the time – fitness videos filmed at an angle that shows their butt from behind.” She laughs. “Personally, I film my squatting videos for technique. No one would ever judge a squat technique from behind.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29154973f074960f0af69cc6dd7f29cd56de0967/0_50_2016_1210/master/2016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=09e9e989b476cafc49db8d6d0e45625a","title":"guardian passes 1m mark in reader donations katharine viner","story":"Business model showing way for journalism to ‘regain its relevance’, says editor-in-chiefMore than a million people worldwide have contributed to the  in the last three years, with 500,000 paying to support the publication on an ongoing basis, according to  News and Media’s editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner.She said the business model was showing a new way for journalism to “regain its relevance, meaning and trusted place in society”.Viner told the Society of Editors’ annual conference in Salford that many contributors donated specifically because they wanted the  to stay free and outside a paywall, so “progressive journalism can have the widest possible impact”.“Many readers didn’t understand the challenging commercial reality facing all news organisations, but once we told them more, they expressed real interest in wanting to support the ,” she said. “This was helped by the fact that any money made by the  has to be spent on journalism, because of our ownership structure with no shareholders or owner.“This entirely new revenue stream of monthly and one-off contributions is now a crucial part of our plan to get the  to break even by next April.

Everyone has a story, these walls have seen so many things, and a lot of people have specific memories. Be it the sofa where they got engaged, or something else.”Rock said more than 2,000 people have traipsed down the steps and into Annabel’s basement at 44 Berkeley Square over the past week to inspect the lots in situ. “I feel like I’ve lived in a nightclub for a week,” he said. “Everything is for sale,” he added, from caricatures by HM Bateman to works by painters Glyn Philpot and William Orpen to table lamps, cutlery and even the club’s urinals (£200-£300).Annabel’s was opened in 1963 by Mark Birley, a young entrepreneur who named it after his then-wife Lady Annabel Vane-Tempest-Stewart. Lady Annabel, who went on to marry Sir James Goldsmith, was initially annoyed that Birley had named the club – which was created in a converted coal cellar beneath a casino – after her.However, it was an immediate hit with aristocracy and film stars, leading Lady Annabel to change her mind. “Now I look back on his decision with pride and consider it the most tremendous compliment he could ever have paid me,” she said in her memoirs.The Queen visited Annabel’s in 2003 and ordered a gin martini with no lemon, which then-head barman Abderrazat Mohammed Ghannam said was his “greatest honour” to serve.Lady Gaga was an Annabel’s regular when in London and performed her hit track Poker Face in the club. Tina Turner and Bryan Ferry have also taken to the stage over the years.The Beatles, however, were turned away by the club’s doormen for failing to adhere to the club’s dress code. Rumour had it that George Harrison had refused to wear a tie, but Birley said: “No, absolutely not. That is complete rubbish it’s because they weren’t wearing shoes!”The actror Goldie Hawn, another regular, described Annabel’s as an “extraordinarily designed and conceived place … yet you felt like you could put your feet up”.Birley sold Annabel’s to the multimillionaire restaurateur Richard Caring as part of a £90m deal in 2007. Caring closed Birley’s Annabel’s at 44 Berkeley Square in February and moved the club two doors down to number 46, where Annabel’s now occupies all 26,000 sq ft of the Grade I-listed Georgian mansion. Tuesday’s sale at Christie’s will be live-streamed in the new Annabel’s.Caring will collect the proceeds from all but two lots in the auction. Caring’s charity will benefit from the sale of two photograph lots, which are estimated to sell for a total of £10,000-£16,000.The remaining 263 lots are expected to raise almost £1m, which Caring will use to “purchase further extraordinary works of art for the new Annabel’s and other restaurants for thousands to enjoy”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed8737005d65caa495bc4dd26f239587ec4ce206/89_202_2126_1276/master/2126.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=055132a4cd98d230f8cc7be690eb6d43","title":"taylor swift leaves lifelong label to sign with universal music group","story":"The new deal includes a condition enhancing UMG’s existing commitment to distribute money to artists from the sale of Spotify sharesTaylor Swift has announced that she is leaving her lifelong record label, Big Machine Label Group (BMLG), to sign with Republic Records and Universal Music Group (UMG). The financial terms of the deal have not been made public.Swift highlighted this as “a sign that we are headed towards positive change for creators – a goal I’m never going to stop trying to help achieve, in whatever ways I can”.Swift has not single-handedly brought about this change. In March 2018, UMG were the last of the major labels, following Warner and Sony, to commit to sharing any money generated by the sale of its Spotify equity with its artists. In May, independent label rights body Merlin sold its equity stake in Spotify and passed on the proceeds to its members.Music lawyer Gregor Pryor at Reed Smith said the agreement itself was not radical, but said that “where it does benefit artists undoubtedly is that it’s not recoupable”. This means that any benefits from Spotify sales shares do not count against artists’ existing debts with a label.What made the deal significant, said Pryor, was that Swift used her leverage to benefit other artists. “Jay-Z did it with Tidal: the way that artists are behaving in a way that is more directed towards furthering their returns versus what the traditional machine – of labels and publishers – might have been entitled to.“It used to be the case that if you’re an artist on a label, you took your advance and if you were lucky, you got paid. The world is changing very quickly, and part of that is artists taking control of their own business interests.”In 2014, Swift declined to allow fans to stream her fifth album, 1989, on Spotify or other streaming services. In June 2015, she challenged Apple Music over its decision not to pay musicians and songwriters royalties for music its subscribers listened to during their free three-month trial subscription.Swift was widely credited with prompting Apple to back down however the tech company’s retreat was also due to a collective protest by independent labels who said they would not do deals with Apple until it agreed to pay them during the free trials. In June 2017, Swift uploaded her full catalogue of music to streaming services.Swift’s deal with BMLG expired on 10 November, the first anniversary of her sixth album, Reputation. She signed to the fledgling label age 15 after founder Scott Borchetta saw her perform at a showcase at the Bluebird cafe in Nashville on 4 November 2004.Swift expressed her “heartfelt thanks” to Borchetta for “believing in me as a 14-year-old and guiding me through over a decade of work that I will always be so proud of”. Borchetta has not commented.Under the new multi-year agreement, UMG will serve as the exclusive worldwide recorded music partner for Swift and UMG’s Republic Records will serve as her label partner in the US. UMG’s parent company, the French media conglomerate Vivendi, is planning on selling up to half of UMG. Signing Swift “might serve as the catalyst for a disposal of UMG by Vivendi,” said Pryor.Swift’s Reputation stadium world tour concludes in Tokyo this week. She will play two shows at the Tokyo Dome on 20 and 21 November. Reputation sold 1.9m units in 2017, making it the No 1 album of the year in pure sales terms, and No 3 in album-equivalent streams."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d0174e5043327ffc821f9e7c1ca59225a688c8c/27_31_1134_680/master/1134.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=160ac65ccb39eab1ccbb85ac78234d56","title":"jeremy hunt nazanin zaghari ratcliffe iran","story":"Foreign secretary calls on Tehran to stop using Iranian-British dual nationals for diplomatic leverageJeremy Hunt is visiting Iran on Monday, where he will make a personal appeal for the immediate release of the Iranian-British dual-national Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe on humanitarian grounds.The foreign secretary will also call on Iran to stop using Zaghari-Ratcliffe and other dual nationals as tools of diplomatic leverage.Zaghari-Ratcliffe was arrested in April 2016 as she and her daughter were about to board a flight back to the UK after a visit to her family in Iran. She was found guilty of spying and given a five-year jail sentence. She denies the allegations, and her plight has left a shadow hanging over Iran-UK relations.In August, she was granted a three-day release from Evin prison but her request for an extension was denied and she was forced to say goodbye to her four-year-old daughter, Gabriella, and return to jail, where she had a panic attack. Her family have decided not to apply for further temporary releases because of the tremendous strain she has suffered.“More than anything, we must see those innocent British-Iranian dual-nationals imprisoned in Iran returned to their families in Britain,” Hunt said before a meeting with the Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif. “I arrive in Iran with a clear message for the country’s leaders: putting innocent people in prison cannot and must not be used as a tool of diplomatic leverage.”Hunt has twice met Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s husband, Richard, promising him that he would leave no stone unturned in order to secure her release.There had been hopes that Hunt’s takeover of the Foreign Office from Boris Johnson in August, coupled with the British decision to stick with the Iran nuclear deal in the face of sustained US pressure, might prompt Tehran to release Zaghari-Ratcliffe on compassionate grounds.Although the foreign secretary is due to press the Iranian foreign ministry hard on dual-national cases, there is a good deal of realism about the possibility of an immediate breakthrough. The foreign ministry is not seen as the key decision maker, so Hunt would ideally like to meet members of the judiciary, who hold greater sway. Hunt’s visit is the first by a European foreign minister since the US pulled out of the deal, although Zarif has met EU ministers in Vienna to urge Europe to do more to protect European firms still seeking to trade with Iran from the effect of American sanctions.The US pulled out of the deal signed by Barack Obama in 2015, saying it was full of holes, and announced it would impose sanctions, including fines and asset freezes, on the US arm of any European company seeking to continue to trade with Iran.Brian Hook, the US special representative for Iran, last week expressed confidence that almost no European firms were willing to risk US sanctions. A succession of companies have pulled out of planned investments in Iran, leaving some medium-sized organisations with no US operations to assess the risk of continuing to trade.The British decision to side with France and Germany has caused a rift with Washington. Theresa May was reportedly rebuked by Donald Trump in a bad-tempered phone call, initiated by May to congratulate the US president for the midterm election results. The final tranche of US sanctions on Iran, including sanctions on any country importing Iranian oil, came into force on 5 November.The UK – unlike the US – believes the economic pressure being applied by the US on Iran will not force the country to reopen the deal, and – if anything – will strengthen Iranian hardliners.Some leading Republicans are convinced that the Iranian regime is close to collapse, and Hunt’s visit will be a brief chance to test that assessment.Hunt will stress that the UK remains committed to the nuclear deal as long as Iran sticks to its terms, and will discuss European efforts to maintain nuclear-related sanctions relief. The UK has said that because of Brexit it cannot host the EU’s proposed special purpose vehicle, a device that could enable companies to continue to trade with Iran but avoid US sanctions. It is not clear if any country is willing to risk sanctions by hosting the SPV, a serious blow to Europe’s efforts to show its independence from US foreign policy.Hunt will also discuss Yemen, and underline his concern at reports, documented by the UN panel of experts, that Iran has supplied ballistic missiles and weapons to the Houthis, in violation of security council resolutions. The UK will table a draft resolution at the UN security council on Monday setting out the plans for a ceasefire leading to talks.Speaking during a tour of Tehran’s Grand Bazaar on Monday morning, Hunt said: “This is part of the world that is quite frankly a tinderbox. We want to move to peace in Yemen – that is our number one priority at the moment. We also have the case of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and other dual nationals who are in prison who should not be.

We are not so proud that we don’t think we can learn as we try to adjust universal credit for the benefit of everybody. But that sort of language was wholly inappropriate and discredited a lot of what he was saying.”She added: “But we look forward to working with experts in the area, to make sure we get the right outcome for the people who we want to look after.”Asked about the tone of the UN report, May’s spokesman said: “We strongly disagree with the analysis.”More generally on universal credit, which is designed to replace six separate benefits but which charities and councils have warned is overly complex and often puts new claimants into debt, Rudd struck a more conciliatory note. She promised to try to improve the system but offered no new policy specifics.Asked by the SNP’s Neil Gray to use her influence in cabinet to listen to charities and halt the rollout of the system, Rudd replied: “I wouldn’t want to overstate what the honourable gentleman calls my power, but I am certainly going to listen very carefully.“Part of the benefit of the universal credit rollout is going to be making sure we get the expert guidance from the people who have been working in this field for many years – and we will certainly be doing it.”In response to another question on claimants’ access to emergency payments to tide them over as they move to universal credit, Rudd said: “We have already made some adjustments to that and I will make sure that I do all I can to ensure that we do better.”She promised to deliver “a fair, compassionate and efficient benefits system”, adding: “But I know there are problems with universal credit, despite its good intentions. I’ve seen them for myself. I will be listening and learning from the expert groups in this area who do such good work. I know it can be better. I will make sure it is my role to deliver that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02a57e8b82f879e75c1fb66b2b590493bf552ff0/0_103_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ff55f6904ecebee9a920ae82287d4195","title":"brexit eu ministers prepare to end 45 years of difficult marriage","story":"Madrid throws ner in works by demanding veto on any trade deal covering Rock• Follow the latest Brexit news - live updatesTheresa May is facing a fresh threat to her Brexit deal after Spain warned it would reject it unless Madrid were granted a special veto to prevent any future EU trade agreement with Britain that covers Gibraltar.As the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, sought to sell the withdrawal agreement to both its critics in the UK and member states who have expressed concerns, the Spanish foreign minister, Josep Borrell, threw a ner in the works.Borrell said his government wanted a clear promise that no future trade or security deals would apply to Gibraltar without Spain’s consent.“Negotiations between the UK and the EU do not apply to Gibraltar. Future negotiations on Gibraltar are separate negotiations,” he said.“That is what must be made clear. Until we have the future declaration and we know what it says, whether we agree with it or not, we are not going to approve the withdrawal agreement.”Downing Street and the European commission have a deal in principle on the withdrawal agreement dealing with citizens’ rights, the £39bn orce bill and the Irish border problem.The Spanish government wants the accompanying political declaration on the future relationship, which is still being negotiated, to include the veto on the inclusion of Gibraltar, a disputed territory. The socialist government in Spain is facing criticism at home, ahead of regional elections, for being soft on the Gibraltar issue.Gibraltar’s chief minister, Fabian Picardo, said he had received assurances on Monday from Downing Street that the Rock would not be left out of any agreements struck.He said: “It’s no surprise that we are seeing the Spanish government raise issues at the last minute. The position taken by the Spanish government today does little to build mutual confidence and trust going forward.“The language of vetoes and exclusions should be the language of the past. It has no place in the modern Europe of today at a time when both the United Kingdom and Gibraltar are trying to build a new positive future relationship with the EU.”It is understood that Spain raised its objection after realising last Wednesday that one clause in the 585-page draft treaty specifies that the territorial scope of the negotiations will cover Gibraltar as well as other British overseas territories.Earlier in the day, Barnier had sought to sell the provisional Brexit deal by insisting the UK was now “taking back control” of its laws, in an echo of the Vote Leave campaign slogan, and calling for member states to recognise the progress made amid signs of fracture.“We are in fact at the decisive moment in this process. No one should lose sight of the progress that has been achieved in Brussels and in London,” Barnier said. “Both the EU and the UK will have full control over their own legislation and rule-making.“This is essential on our side for the integrity of the single market. It is essential for the UK in terms of taking back control. Now more than ever we must all remain calm, and I will remain calm, and keep on our focus for the UK to leave the EU in an orderly fashion.”Brussels is preparing for a special Brexit summit next Sunday, where leaders will formally sign off on the withdrawal agreement and the accompanying political declaration on the future relationship, on which negotiations are continuing.Ministers for the 27 EU member states spoke earlier of their concern about the threat in London to the Brexit deal as they made their final preparations to end “45 years of difficult marriage”.But member states are also not happy that the UK has been given a customs union in the withdrawal agreement without strict enough conditions to ensure the European economy cannot be undercut.France is among those that also want a guarantee of a satisfactory agreement for European fishermen who work in British waters possibly in the political declaration, having not achieved that goal in the withdrawal agreement.The EU is looking at publishing a series of side-declarations to the main political declaration in an attempt to set out its stall on the most contentious areas, in a move that could thwart May’s plans to sell her the package to MPs at home.France, Italy, the Netherlands, Denmark and Germany, also want tough “level playing field” commitments from the UK, such as dynamic alignment with the EU’s climate change and environment directives.Alan Duncan, a British foreign minister visiting Brussels, said his colleagues in parliament should be “realistic” when assessing the deal brokered with Brussels, as EU sources warned that reopening agreed texts could lead to a worse deal emerging.Gernot Blümel, the EU affairs minister for Austria, which holds the rolling presidency, said of the coming days: “A painful week in European politics is starting. We have the orce papers on the table. Forty-five years of difficult marriage are coming to an end.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd6fb921d03c2bc26e20b8f058f54ffc7866fbc3/0_0_2565_1539/master/2565.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=859b5e9d2e5bfd33a1bc394263adcb41","title":"cbi gets applause in early for isolated may","story":"A warm welcome, a dash for the exit, then the other half of the lack-of-power coupleSeconds out, round … frankly, who cares? Everyone’s either lost count or, if they’re lucky, lost the will to live. The latest episode in the ongoing Brexit psychodrama, Who’s Afraid of the ERG?, featuring Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn as the self-harming, lack-of-power couple united in their inability to utter a coherent sentence, took place at the Confederation of British Industry’s annual conference in London. No one was holding their breath for a meaningful resolution.The prime minister did go into the day as the home-crowd favourite. Having initially declared that any form of Brexit would be damaging for business, the CBI has recently rather rolled over. Faced with the prospect of a no-deal Brexit, it has come to the conclusion that the prime minister’s bad deal is the only game in town. Rather than campaign for what it really wants, it has taken the easy option of the certainty of everything being worse than it currently is but not as crap as it might be.May was greeted from the stage as some kind of messiah. Or at least a symbol of dogged resilience in the face of almost certain defeat. “Let’s give the prime minister a very warm CBI welcome,” said John Allan, the group’s president, doing his best to whip up enthusiasm. The audience more or less obliged. With May it’s usually best to get the applause in first, as so often there’s little to clap at the end. Today being another case in point.Right from the off, May looked tired. Battered, even. She may be deriving some masochistic pleasure from facing down the rapidly vanishing ERG, but it’s taking its toll. Her delivery was brittle, staccato, with no attempt to connect with the crowd. The conference was just another chore in another unpleasant day and she raced through her speech at breakneck speed. Starting with Brexit.The deal was the deal. Take it or leave it. It was the best she could do under the circumstances, and people shouldn’t get too hung up on how bad the withdrawal agreement was because the real prize was to be found in the seven-page appendix outlining the future trading relationship with the EU. OK, so it was a bit on the thin side at the moment, but she hoped to add a few more pages of legally meaningless waffle in the next week or so. A few who had come to the conference in search of reassurance began to look seriously concerned.Then the prime minister doubled down on immigration. After Brexit we were going to allow wealthy visitors from the US into the country through e-gates, but we’d be making sure that all low-paid workers from the EU would no longer be able to jump the queue. It was far better that patients should die rather than allow scroungers from the EU to come to the UK to fill thousands of NHS vacancies.Understandably, this didn’t go down too well with some delegates, and the owner of the hotel in which the conference was being held stood up to say he was having enough trouble getting staff already. May tilted her head to one side, as she always does when under pressure, and gave him a non-committal answer. Nor was there any relief thereafter, as the next questioner turned out to be a hardline Brexiter intent on rubbishing the withdrawal agreement. Some members of the audience booed, and May barely concealed her anger. Her reply bordered on a straight “piss off”. As soon as was indecently possible, she made a dash for the exit.Late in the afternoon it was Corbyn’s turn. By his standards it was a decent speech. Though he still tends to confuse his listeners by placing the emphasis on the wrong words like a straggler in a remedial reading class, he successfully demolished the government’s Brexit negotiations as pitiful and made Labour’s case for changes in working practices to deal with the causes of Brexit.But the CBI delegates just weren’t that interested. They didn’t want to hear inconvenient truths that might demand something of them. They preferred the strange, isolated woman who had talked to them earlier. The one they could admire for her steadfastness in the face of imminent disaster. That was the British way. Heroic failure in the face of impossible odds. And what was May if not the brightest and second best?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/78a6b91fc7821d76ab432cae63c13dc57b5fb717/853_42_2005_1203/master/2005.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=131e8832eb4b20957a919e68f71e7169","title":"energy minister claire perry accused of swearing and shouting at staff unions civil servants","story":"Unions write to top official at BEIS department saying claims were raised by civil servantsTrade unions have written to the top official in the business department to raise concerns about claims that the energy minister, Claire Perry, has sworn and screamed at civil servants, the  understands.Representatives of three unions representing Whitehall officials wrote a joint letter to Alex Chisholm, permanent secretary at the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS), citing wider concerns about the behaviour of its ministers.The letter, from the PCS, FDA and Prospect unions, said the claims had been raised by BEIS staff, but that the unions could not detail specific instances owing to concerns that iniduals involved could be identified.They singled out the alleged behaviour of Perry, claiming there had been a series of reports about her alleged behaviour towards her civil servants.It is understood that the complaints given to the unions include claims that Perry screamed and shouted, texted one civil servant to say “Fuck off”, and wrote, “What’s this shit?” on a memo produced by staff. The MP for Devizes became energy minister in June last year, a role that involves attending cabinet.The letter, sent earlier this month, has not been made public, and the unions involved have declined to comment.Jon Trickett, the shadow Cabinet Office minister, urged the department to act on the letter. “The unions have raised serious allegations, and we’ve got to look into them carefully,” he said.“All ministers, however important, must pay close attention to relations with their staff, and avoid any conduct that could be seen as unprofessional. Bullying is totally unacceptable in any workplace.”In January, the government updated the official code for ministerial conduct, featuring an expanded section on bullying and harassment.The code says ministers’ working relationships with civil servants and others “should be proper and appropriate”.It continues: “Harassing, bullying or other inappropriate or discriminating behaviour wherever it takes place is not consistent with the ministerial code and will not be tolerated.”A spokesman for BEIS said: “Like all government departments we are committed to ensuring that our staff are treated with respect. We have clear codes of conduct in place, with high standards expected of all.“Any complaints or grievances made by staff are investigated following agreed internal processes.”BEIS had no specific response to the claims raised but noted that the results of staff surveys showed it was among the best-performing Whitehall departments for the fair treatment of staff."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/936d5ae100f6e678b5cd75dec3690e267b6db62f/81_51_4614_2768/master/4614.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=081d782f9bd217834033310785591226","title":"sarah wollaston pushes for mps vote on second brexit referendum doctors amendment corbyn","story":"Tory MP to put down ‘doctors’ amendment’ and hopes to persuade Corbyn to back itSarah Wollaston and three other MPs with medical backgrounds are to put down an amendment to the meaningful final Brexit vote, calling for a second referendum in which remain is an option on the ballot paper.The Conservative MP wants parliament to vote on holding another referendum as soon as possible and hopes to put pressure on the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, and his frontbench to “come off the fence” and support a further public vote.Wollaston said it was only by adding her “doctors’ amendment” to Theresa May’s motion that legal weight would be given to holding a second referendum, and without the amendment, MPs would be unable to force the government into holding one.“People need to give valid informed consent,” Wollaston said, arguing that people did not fully understand the consequences and complexities of Brexit at the time of the 2016 referendum. “You can only give consent if you know what you are consenting to.”But while a small but growing number of Conservatives back a second referendum, the Labour leadership has said it would only consider the idea if it cannot secure a Brexit deal it supports and has been unable to force a general election.“It won’t happen unless Jeremy Corbyn supports it,” Wollaston said. “We need him to come off the fence. If the deal unravels subsequently it’s not clear if we’ll have the possibility to amend it.”May’s meaningful vote is expected in mid-December, assuming the Brexit deal is signed off by the EU at a special summit this weekend. However, the idea of holding a parliamentary vote on a second referendum at the same time is not universally shared by campaigners on the subject.Given Labour’s public position, crafted at the party’s annual conference, many Labour supporters of a second referendum have argued it is better to wait to see whether May’s Brexit deal is voted down, and only if a vote of no confidence fails, push for parliament to vote on going to the public again. Many Labour MPs will be reluctant to defy Corbyn if he does not change his mind on the issue.A Labour source said: “If Sarah Wollaston pushes for a second referendum amendment at that time, she’ll lose. Even if Jeremy came out for it, not all Labour MPs would support it. The whip would not hold.”Wollaston faces other obstacles. Although normal parliamentary procedure is for amendments to be voted on first, before MPs vote on the main motion, the government is expected to seek to introduce its own procedure via a business of the house motion.One expectation is that ministers will seek to prevent amendments having potential legal force by having them debated as separate motions. The former Brexit secretary Dominic Raab had argued that parliament needed to give clear yes or no approval to May’s deal.But it is unclear whether MPs will consent to using a special procedure, in what is likely to become the first test of parliamentary strength over Brexit. Last week, the Commons procedure committee, which advises on how to handle complex parliamentary situations, upheld the traditional amendment-first procedure.If the traditional model of parliamentary procedure is used, it will be up to John Bercow, the Speaker, to decide whether a second referendum amendment can be accepted for debate. He will do so based on the amount of backers the amendment has in the Commons, with some Labour MPs questioning how many people Wollaston can recruit.Wollaston, a former GP, has recruited three other doctors from across the political spectrum as supporters: Paul Williams from Labour , Philippa Whitford from the SNP and fellow Tory Phillip Lee, who resigned from the government over Brexit in June.The doctors’ amendment is likely to have the support of the Liberal Democrats, although the party may put down its own second amendment motion as a backstop in case Wollaston withdraws hers under pressure from Tory party whips."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f4f6972deb6546c282471d29d95ef5a36963f9c/0_0_2895_1738/master/2895.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7cf18c3586224f8aae6eec6786eba070","title":"space how far have we gone and where are we going","story":"Billionaire entrepreneurs are trying to create rockets fit for human travel, while government agencies spend billions furthering their explorations. But we are still a long way off from making our way to the red planetSpace flight is now a venerable industry. Humanity’s first space explorer, Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin, orbited around the globe on 12 April 1961, more than half a century ago, when Britain remained a colonial power and people were still using halfpennies to buy their fish and chips.Since then, more than 550 people have blasted themselves into the deep black abyss, although not all agree on how far up you need to go until you hit space, so there is no internationally accepted figure. Only a 10th of those have been women, in big part due to sexist policies by Nasa and Russia’s Roscosmos space agency.The Soviet Union pulled ahead with the first space walks, but US president John F Kennedy’s announcement that America would put a man on the moon by the end of the 1960s focused the space race squarely on that goal. Apollo 11 touched down on our dusty grey neighbour on 20 July 1969.A total of 12 men walked on the moon over the next few years, all Americans, but no one has been back there since 1972. In fact, no one has left the outskirts of the Earth since then.We imagine astronauts floating in free space or bouncing in moon craters, yet the majority of those lucky enough have instead spun around in low Earth’s orbit – between 99 and a few hundred miles high. That’s where the vast array of communications and navigation satellites live, speeding at thousands of miles an hour to avoid plummeting back to earth.Even though we did not go back to deep space, humans have begun to live and work outside the Earth’s atmosphere, often conducting experiments on themselves to determine the effects of weightlessness, or microgravity, on the human body.By 1986, the Soviet Union had launched the Mir space station. When it eventually fell to Earth (thankfully unoccupied) and burned up, our current space outpost, the International Space Station (ISS), was launched. Since 2000, humans have been living in space constantly. There are three up there at the moment, speeding around the globe once every 90 minutes.A lot, and until we properly understand how weightlessness affects humans, we won’t be able to send this era’s pioneers further afield to places such as Mars or wandering asteroids. Scott Kelly, a US former fighter pilot and long-time Nasa astronaut, spent a year bouncing around the cramped capsules of the ISS in an attempt to understand the long-term impact of space flight. He doesn’t hold the record for the most extended foray into the void – that is claimed by Gennady Padalka, who spent two and half years of his life up there on several missions – but the Kelly experiment had a natural advantage over others: he has a twin.Comparing their bodies throughout, scientists were able to assess how bones, muscles and other parts of the body deteriorate in space. There is even a gym on the ISS where astronauts can keep their muscles – no longer needed to prop them up – from slowly wasting away. But they need to wear a harness to keep them from floating off the treadmill. One big issue is that eye problems develop, but Kelly found his body recovered fast on return. He and his twin seemed in similar shape – good news for future deep space missions.Only three countries, China, Russia and the US, have human space programmes as it remains prohibitively expensive. However, they have provided lifts for space travellers from 40 countries, including a member of the Saudi royal family and even paying customers, such as South African millionaire Mark Shuttleworth, aged just 28.Astronomical. The ISS is the most expensive machine ever constructed with a price tag at around $150bn (£115bn). Nasa’s space shuttle programme, which kicked off in the early 1970s by promising safe and affordable access to space, hoped to cost just a few tens of million dollars per launch. But as the shuttle was thrown in the scrapyard in 2011, the agency estimated the total cost at $209bn — nearly $1.6bn per flight.Following the big fight over the shuttle, which looked fantastic but also restricted space adventuring to Earth’s orbit as well as costing a fortune, the US took a side seat in launches. Most astronauts are now sent by the Russian space agency, which sells round-trip rides on its Soyuz spacecraft for between $21m and $82m.Anyone involved in space travel will scoff at this, but it’s a good question, and space agencies often don’t communicate their achievements enough. Almost every sector of human progress has benefited from sending people into space. Just the act of attempting the feat forced scientists to invent new systems. The Apollo guidance computer was a predecessor to the microcomputer, now found in all smartphones. Clothes are more fire-resistant because of research on space fires. Remotely monitoring the health of astronauts has led to revolutionary systems for helping patients on Earth. Diseases behave and develop differently in microgravity, which assists scientists in finding cures.The first space race was part of the chest-beating of the cold war, but since then human space exploration has been more about countries working together than against each other. The ISS is a massive collaboration between five space agencies (Nasa, Roscosmos, Japan’s Jaxa, the pan-European agency ESA and the Canadian Space Agency) and was assembled over a period of 13 years from 1998, slowly adding capsules like Lego.A big exception to this is China, which has gone it alone with its space ambitions, never sending an astronaut to the ISS. In 2006, Beijing reportedly tested lasers against US imaging satellites in what appeared to be an attempt to blind or damage them, and US lawmakers later banned cooperation between Nasa and China’s state agency.However, the future of any effective human space flight is certainly likely to be cooperative rather than antagonistic. Since 2011, national spaces agencies in 14 countries have attempted to coordinate their dreams into a single vision. The most recent plan, published in January this year, said they had agreed to “expand human presence into the solar system, with the surface of Mars as a common driving goal”.Don’t start the countdown just yet. To get to Mars, most people in the human space flight community feel we need to first go back to the moon. “It’s the only logical step,” says Ian Crawford, professor of planetary science and astrobiology at Birkbeck, University of London. “I’m all in favour of sending people to Mars, but the technology, competence, the experience – I think it’s still out of reach”.The moon has several advantages. It’s only three days away, rather than a several-month round trip to Mars, and has been touted as a location for a research station similar to the one in Antarctica. From their celestial laboratory, scientists could study the impact of radiation exposure and near-weightlessness on the body at a closer distance to Earth, but still within deep space, all while preparing for trips further afield.Well. Not quite either. The Global Exploration Roadmap suggests first building a space station as an orbital base from which to send astronauts back and forth to the moon. This will look similar to the ISS except, instead of rushing around the Earth, it will orbit the moon.It is a mammoth feat and it would be wise to expect serious delays. “Where we go in space is decided by a combination of what people would like to do and the reality of time and budgets,” says Henry Hertzfeld, director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University, Washington DC, and a former policy analyst at Nasa. “The idea of putting people on Mars has been around for a long time. If you read the policies, it is clearly a long-term vision without a date. But we probably are still lacking the technology to keep people for a long time in deep space.”The US and Russia have been giving way to new players. In 2003, China became the third country to put a person into orbit and India plans to follow in 2022. But the sector-changing impact is undoubtedly coming from the private space.In what is being coined the “billionaire’s space race”, Elon Musk, founder of Telsa electric cars, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and Virgin boss Richard Branson all want to send private citizens to space. Their companies, SpaceX, Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic, are set on making human space travel cheaper.They join a handful of commercial space flight companies that already work as contractors for national space agencies. Aerospace industry titans Boeing and Lockheed Martin send heavy launchers into space, but that costs at least $350m per launch – several times more expensive than SpaceX’s new $90m Falcon Heavy system.SpaceX has around $10bn worth of launches already booked and saves costs through reusable spacecraft, where even the rocket boosters land themselves back on the ground and can be dusted off for reuse.And while it is looking increasingly likely that the ISS will be defunded in the next decade, several private ventures are considering either taking over or rebuilding their own space stations.As government agencies prioritise the moon, others are looking straight at Mars. Musk has said his life goal is to create a thriving Mars colony as a fail-safe for humanity in case of a catastrophic event on Earth, such as a nuclear war or Terminator-style artificial intelligence coup. For this, SpaceX is developing the Big Falcon Rocket (BFR), which he claims could send crewed flights to the red planet by mid-2020.Musk says the BFR is partly inspired by Tintin’s rocket and will be the biggest ever made at close to 40 storeys high and capable of ferrying as many as 100 passengers per trip, depending on how much luggage they want to put in the hold.As well as a healthy satellite launch business, SpaceX is raising money by selling tickets on the BFR for a trip, some would say a jolly, around the moon. Yusaku Maezawa, a Japanese fashion billionaire and art collector, is funding such a mission slated for 2023 and says he is going to invite artists with him for the week-long trip to re-engage the public in the wonder of our universe.An astronaut’s guide to life on Earth, Chris HadfieldTo space and back, Sally RideEndurance: A year in space, a lifetime of discovery, Scott Kelly"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/645d9cecf23bc49f7db5501019ba26865db3645c/0_345_6641_3987/master/6641.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fd59d995a11dda3710ebcf797a22862a","title":"are you affected by alopecia areata share your experiences","story":"A new  photography project aims to empower those living with the condition. If you’re affected by Alopecia Areata, we’d like to hear from you Alopecia Areata is understood to be an autoimmune disorder that typically starts as one or more small, smooth bald patches on the scalp. The hair loss can remain as patchy hair loss or can continue until all hair on the scalp is lost (Alopecia Totalis or AT) or complete loss of hair from the body (Alopecia Universalis or AU). The immune system, the body’s natural defence which normally protects from viruses and bacteria, mistakenly attacks the hair follicles, leading to hair loss.To raise awareness about the condition,  photographer Graeme Robertson would like to find people in the UK who are affected by Alopecia Areata to take part in a new  photography project, supported by the leading hair loss charity, Alopecia UK.Graeme himself is affected by this form of alopecia and wants to give a platform to other people who have the condition. He aims to show the impact of alopecia on daily life by photographing people and asking them to share their stories. Graeme has had to come to terms with his own experience, which has resulted in total hair loss, and he wants the project to empower others.He said: “I feel nervous and excited about the project as it means so much to me and I’m totally committed to producing an amazing project with beautiful, powerful photography. If it helps one person then it will all be worth it.”Graeme has been a photographer for more than 20 years, you can see some of his work here.If you have been affected by alopecia areata and would like to take part or find out more about the project, please share your details in the form below.

It is not even that easy to be certain of the result when he starts talking. Like England’s rugby coach, Bayliss is an Australian in his 50s who played most of his sport in Sydney but there the similarities seem to end. Bayliss is the most phlegmatic of men, who seems to foster loyalty naturally and who actively craves anonymity.But even he cannot completely disguise a certain excitement about England’s Test team after a series-winning 2-0 lead was secured over Sri Lanka in Pallekele on Sunday. “Apart from one or two this group are fairly close in age, good mates and all seem to be responding to Joe’s call. Off the field it’s starting to get there. Obviously there’s a few more guys from the one-day side in the Test team with Rashid and Buttler but it’s starting to get a feelgood feel just like that one-day team. Hopefully those results continue.”As captain, Joe Root may not yet have the all-embracing authority of Eoin Morgan in white-ball cricket but here the signs are also encouraging for Bayliss. “I still think he’ll improve even more. Like any young captain he’d probably do a few things differently but the more you have these types of wins in these conditions, that just gives the captain confidence and the players’ confidence in the captain, that he can make the right call. He’ll just get better and better.”The changes of personnel in the team have obviously helped. Finally new players have come in and contributed from the start, spectacularly so in the case of Ben Foakes. There are not so many holes in the team. “There’s no secret we’ve been looking for two or three, maybe even four positions to get nailed down over the last few years,” said Bayliss.“I think on this particular tour we’ve probably seen two or three of those positions getting nailed down. I think of the job that Burns and Foakes have done in their first two Tests – it looks like they’re playing their 30th or 40th Tests. Their calmness has been outstanding.”The Surrey pair have not only played well but they have also been remarkably relaxed in their new environment. Foakes has been constantly held up as an example of the value of Lions’ tours, where he has broadened his experience in foreign conditions over the last three years.Meanwhile Burns, who has played one match for the Lions in his life, provides a welcome reminder that is also possible to reach the team via excellence in County Championship cricket rather than impressing ECB coaches with the Lions. This has been the route of some of our best and grittiest cricketers in recent times, such as Andrew Strauss and Paul Collingwood.Bayliss was also keen to praise those who have not been playing in the Test matches. On his bench he has had three players who share 208 Test caps Stuart Broad has the bulk of them (123), Jonny Bairstow 59 and Chris Woakes 26. Bayliss focused on the first two, who have been ever-present in England Test teams in recent times.“One of the great things that hasn’t been spoken about much over the last two games is Stuart Broad and Jonny Bairstow missing out but the way they’ve taken it has been absolutely fantastic. It makes the feeling around the squad so much better. They are very much part of the squad and they realise that. They know that we are picking what we think is the best team to win each match and they’ve taken that on the chin. It’s been great.” In fact, Bairstow was one of four England players who spent some of Monday visiting and learning about the project of clearing landmines in the north of the country, a sure way to gain a sense of perspective about being omitted from a Test team.So there is much to be cheerful about, so much, in fact, that Bayliss was asked whether he would consider prolonging his stay with England, which is due to end in September next year, given how the red-ball team is advancing. The mere question was a sign of progress since it was not so long ago that many decided that Bayliss was somehow a brilliant white-ball coach and a useless red-ball one.“No,” said Bayliss promptly. “Look, I’ve always been of the opinion, even before I started the England job, that four to five years is a good life for a coach with one team. Hopefully you take it forward and then it’s up to a new voice, maybe someone of a different direction, to take the team forward. That opinion is not going to change.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e40a82dc71ecc6d3e1d8aea1f8edd80997abcd0/151_49_5164_3098/master/5164.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf40555ab6e1fca738c9a75a4a94ccde","title":"south africa faf de klerk sale wales november internationals rugby union","story":"• Siya Kolisi escapes with warning after Murrayfield incident• ‘Wales are almost the silent assassin at this stage,’ says ErasmusFaf de Klerk has played a significant role in South Africa’s revival this year, but the scrum-half will again be playing for Sale this weekend rather than lining up for his country. The Springboks have first call on him under World Rugby regulations, but they have allowed him to remain with the Sharks despite their head coach, Rassie Erasmus, stating that Wales on Saturday will be the toughest game of their four-match tour.De Klerk missed the defeat to England at the start of the month because the match was played outside the official window. He appeared against France the following week, when the Premiership Cup was on, but he played for Sale at Saracens last Saturday, when South Africa were in Scotland, and is training with the club in readiness for Saturday’s game with Northampton.Under World Rugby regulations clubs are not allowed to offer financial inducements to players to put them before a country, but Erasmus said it was his decision not pick De Klerk, adding: “There is no contractual issue. The World Rugby regulation is quite clear, we can draft a player on the Sunday before a Test. We have a very good relationship with most of the clubs.“Faf is a contender for the World Cup but we only have five Test matches before the tournament. We have relied on Faf a lot to get back the winning feeling, but we feel our other two scrum-halves are ready to step up. We are playing in the dry under a closed roof in Cardiff and it makes sense to give them another chance because Faf is more used to northern hemisphere conditions.”South Africa will have their captain, Siya Kolisi, available to face Wales after the flanker was found to have struck the Scotland centre Peter Horne with his head in their 26-20 win but escaped with a citing commissioner’s warning.“I really think it will be an open race next year and it’s impossible to predict the semi-finalists. Northern hemisphere teams have caught up with the running game and while New Zealand are favourites, they have had a bit of a dip. Ireland will gain a lot of confidence by beating them and it is great for the game that there is so little to choose between a number of teams, if not so good for the coaches.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23f55d2b75e953e9d8d28a59bff66566d536e76d/858_433_3919_2351/master/3919.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5a736057b1ca3ce975aef4028eec2ac3","title":"magnus carlsen v fabiano caruana world chess championship game 8 live","story":"Eight straight draws and a 4-all deadlock. Will Wednesday finally be the day for a decisive result? We’ll soon find out. Be sure to join us then for more minute-by-minute coverage.We’re inching closer to a potential tie-breaker, where Carlsen will be a considerable favorite in a series of matches under shorter time controls. After all the Norwegian is the world’s No 1 rapid player and No 1 blitz player (compared to Caruana’s respective ratings of No 8 and No 16). He’s also got experience on the stage having retained the title in the tie-break stage against Sergey Karjakin two years ago in New York. But he believes there’s plenty of road to go when asked about it. “For you Fabiano, does it feel like missing a penalty or was it (not) that bad?” asks a reporter regarding the mental aftereffects of a game like Monday’s. The American responds: “I don’t think the position was ever quite like that. I had some chances, it’s not like it’s always going to work out. Just because you put some pressure on Magnus doesn’t mean that he collapses or anything. I had some chances. I don’t know how serious they were. It definitely wasn’t like missing a penalty.”Says the moderator, English grandmaster Daniel King: “Mind you, you’re in England. We miss penalties very easily.”“Some minor disappointment,” Caruana says when asked to assess his emotions after the match. “I thought at some point I had a very promising position. I didn’t quite see exactly which moment I had something very good.”Says a relieved Carlsen: “This was a tough game. He was the one who had all the chances. So I am happy to have survived it for sure.”Caruana plays 35. Rf6 and he’s down to 15 minutes. Carlsen answers with 35. ... Re2 and he’s under 10 minutes. Another back-and-forth (36. Rg6+ Kf8) and here’s what we’re looking at. The position appears to be a simple draw after 32. ... Kf7 33. Bxh4 Re8. But Caruana grinds on, putting Carlsen in check with 34. Rf1+ followed by 34. ... Kg8. Caruana in right mind to keep pushing even if a draw seems inevitable with only two more games as white. Also, one could cargue consented to a peaceful result perhaps too soon in Game 2 when he could have made Carlsen work for it for at least a few more hours. Black is the one who needs to be more accurate in the current position and Carlsen has about twice as much time as Carlsen, who is down to 11 minutes.Further simplification as the players trade rooks: 31. Rf6 Rxf6 32. Bxf6. The computer is tipping a very slight (+0.34) advantage to Caruana for bringing his bishop into that critical square, but an impending second rook exchange should put this one to bed.Quick back-and-forth with 30. Re1 Bg4. Carlsen has everything under control. The time situation is practically even with both players around 22 minutes for their next nine moves until the time control.Caruana opted for simplification with 27. h4. Carlsen, after a 10-minute think, accepts the pawn with 27. ... gxh4. We appear bound for a draw after Caruana takes a pawn back (28. Qxf4) and the players exchange queens (28. ... Qxf4 29. Rxf4) followed by 29. ... h5. We’re just over three hours in today’s game but getting the sense it might not last much longer. It appears we’re headed for a draw after 25. Nc4 Qg6 26. Nxd6 Qxd6. Caruana comes back with 27. h4, indicating he’s not completely given up hopes for a win. Alas, as grandmaster Susan Polgar assesses, an eighth straight peaceful appears in the offing.And Caruana has played 21. c5 after 34 minutes. It’s a pawn sacrifice though not an immediate one. Carlsen, needing to speed up due to the mounting time crunch, quickly takes white’s bishop on f3 and Caruana takes the bishop with his queen (21. ... Nxf3+ 22. Qxf3). Now Carlsen takes the pawn (22. ... dxc5) and Caruana responds with 23. Rad1. This is the critical moment of the game and match, perhaps as golden an opportunity as Caruana will get to stake a lead. The Norwegian supercomputer Sesse, running Stockfish, now giving the American a big advantage. But can Caruana find all the right moves?Caruana indeed finds 20. Bc3, and Carlsen goes in the tank again before answering with 20 ... Bf5. He spent 20min 53sec on that response and is now almost 50 minutes behind on time. That gives him 34 minutes to makes his next 20 moves. The engines love 21. c5 for Caruana. If he can find it, the advantage will tip even further in the American’s favor. Carlsen responds with 19. ... f4. Caruana faces an important decision. The Norwegian supercomputer Sesse already gives the American an advantage and indicates he can push it with Bc3. Can Fabi find it and turn the screw?Carlsen plays 18. ... g5 and the fight is on! A audacious, aggressive move, especially when he’s so far behind on time. But this is Game 8 and, not unlike the match against Karjakin two years ago in New York, Carlsen is going all in. The engines indicate Caruana needs to find 19. c4 and the American manages to find it in less than four minutes!Another sequence of moves ending with a pawn exchange: 15. Nc4 Ne5 16. Nb6 Rb8 17. f4 exf3 18. Bxf3. Caruana, moving with incredible pace, has more time than he started with thanks to the 30 seconds added to his clock with each move. And now Carlsen is in the tank. Five minutes. Ten minutes. Carlsen weighs his options, at times a bit more fidgety than we’re used to seeing him as Caruana takes a long break from the board. He knows just how crucial this move could prove given Caruana’s razor-sharp preparation. Carlsen already a half hour behind on the clock. And we wait ...Carlsen responds to Caruana’s 14. Na3 with 14. ... e4. The champion is a bit out of his element with this opening: he’s spent about 24 minutes on his last four moves. Says Russian grandmaster Peter Svidler: “This is by far the liveliest opening position we’ve had since Game 1.”Carlsen takes nine minutes before responding with 12. ... f5. Caruana quickly responds with 13. a5 and Carlsen takes another six minutes before coming back with 13. ... a6. Some exciting potential here.We have our first surprise with 12. Bd2. This comes on the heels of 9. a4 (where c4 is far more common), followed by 9. ... Be7 10. Be2 O-O 11. O-O Nd7. They’re making a lot of moves very quickly. We’ll catch up when they pause for their first thing. Here’s what they’re looking at after: 5. Nc3 e5 6. Ndb5 d6 7. Nd5 Nxd5 8. exd5 Nb8 9. a4.And we’re off with 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4. For the fourth time we have the Sicilian and it’s not the Rossolimo. And with 4. ... Nf6 5. Nc3 e5, we’re into the Sveshnikov variation. Hello and welcome to London for today’s eighth game of the world chess championship between Norway’s Magnus Carlsen and Fabiano Caruana of the United States. Play resumes today after with the best-of-12-games match deadlocked at 3½-all following seven consecutive peaceful results.Carlsen, 27, has been ranked No 1 for eight straight years and was considered the world’s best player even before he defeated Viswanathan Anand for the title in 2013. Caruana, 26, is ranked No 2, having earned his place at the table by winning the candidates tournament in March. No American-born player has won or even competed for the world title since Bobby Fischer in 1972.\u0026nbspIt marks the first title match between the world\u0027s top two players since 1990, when Garry Kasparov and Anatoly Karpov faced off for a fifth and final time.\u0026nbspThe match will consist of 12 classical games with each player awarded one point for a win and a half-point for a draw. Whoever reaches six and a half points first will be declared the champion.The time control for each game is 100 minutes for the first 40 moves, 50 minutes for the next 20 moves and then 15 minutes for the rest of the game plus an additional 30 seconds per move starting from move 1. Players cannot agree to a draw before Black\u0027s 30th move.\u0026nbspIf the match is tied after 12 games, tie-breaks will be played on the final day in the following order:\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp• Best of four rapid games with 25 minutes for each player with an increment of 10 seconds after each move.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp• If still tied, they will play up to five mini-matches of two blitz games (five minutes for each player with a three-second increment).\u0026nbsp• If all five mini-matches are drawn, one sudden-death \u0027Armegeddon\u0027 match will be played where White receives five minutes and Black receives four minutes. Both players will receive a three-second increment after the 60th move. In the case of a draw, Black will be declared the winner.Thu 8 Nov – Opening ceremony Fri 9 Nov – Game 1\u0026nbspSat 10 Nov – Game 2 Sun 11 Nov – Rest day Mon 12 Nov – Game 3 Tue 13 Nov – Game 4 Wed 14 Nov – Rest day Thu 15 Nov – Game 5 Fri 16 Nov – Game 6 Sat 17 Nov – Rest day Sun 18 Nov – Game 7 Mon 19 Nov –\u0026nbspGame 8 Tue 20 Nov –\u0026nbspRest day Wed 21 Nov – Game 9 Thu 22 Nov –\u0026nbspGame 10 Fri 23 Nov –\u0026nbspRest day Sat 24 Nov – Game 11 Sun 25 Nov – Rest day Mon 26 Nov – Game 12 Tue 27 Nov – Rest day Wed 28 Nov – Tie-break gamesAwards and closingThe games commence each day at 3pm in London.A brief recap if you’re just parachuting in: Game 1 was a grueling seven-hour, 115-move draw, where Carlsen nearly become the first defending champion to win the opening game of a world title match with the black pieces in 37 years. The next four – last Saturday’s Game 2, Monday’s Game 3 and Tuesday’s Game 4 and Thursday’s Game 5 – were mostly safer, conservative affairs. Then came Friday’s Game 6, where Carlsen was outplayed by Caruana in the middlegame and pushed to the limit before saving a draw with incredibly precise defending under pressure. They played to another draw in yesterday’s Game 7, one that left a somewhat downtrodden Carlsen lamenting his gun-shy play and missed chances to be more aggressive in the aftermath.This is Carlsen’s second consecutive world title defense that’s opened with seven straight draws. The 2016 match with Russia’s Sergey Karjakin unfolded the same way until Carlsen’s gamble for a win with white in the eighth game backfired and he was made to resign under time pressure, only to hit back with a six-and-a-half-hour grind on Thanksgiving Day that forced the tie-breaker where he retained his title for a second time.Will we finally get a decisive result today? We’ll soon find out with Game 8 kicking off at the top of the hour.Bryan will be here shortly. In the meantime here’s his report from Sunday’s seventh game, which left a somewhat downtrodden Carlsen lamenting his missed opportunities to be more aggressive."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a62a15af20e519e701865254a0917afa5596727/0_41_2400_1440/master/2400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f05a68973dff6e3daac9fc3b3170e536","title":"super duper close up review yard theatre","story":"The Yard, LondonThe latest from theatre company Made in China is an arresting monologue about an actor prone to panic attacks and phone addictionA woman in a frilly green dress stands centre stage, flanked by sparkly silver curtains. She looks girly but exhausted, stuck between childhood and maturity. The stage is equally in limbo. A projection screen hangs above a bright picture of a waterfall and odd props – flowers, clothes, make-up – lie strewn about. It looks like a film set a funeral parlour a karaoke bar a luxury holiday. This is a set that doesn’t know itself, designed with an easy sense of chaos by Emma Bailey. It is the ideal backdrop for a show about an anxious actress at a crossroads, unsure of where to go next.Made in China’s shows always feel personal but this one, conceived by the company, feels particularly honest. Jessica Latowicki performs a monologue about an experimental actor recently prone to panic attacks. The narrative focuses on an imminent important meeting with an agent, but it gradually unspools. It is a restless piece, which picks and pecks at themes such as anxiety, self-image, the tension between creativity and stability, and the searing intensity of self-doubt.The company’s previous shows have been a lot more physical, infused with manic dancing, screwball comedy or visual gags. Super Duper Close Up is calmer by comparison and can sometimes feel a little flat. But despite the dips in energy, there is an arresting rhythm to the writing. The script is jittery and not quite in control of itself, and is repeatedly punctuated by Google searches and obsessive references to various friends’ glowing Facebook updates. As Latowicki speaks, she mimes scrolling through her phone. It’s as if the internet has become the chief driving force: the brain that now controls Jessica’s actions, feelings and fate."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3bc85c37d1dc406576e40ea47c06b0d9194e9321/0_342_5125_3075/master/5125.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fffb804b65a6c04caa4cd0588a824b8c","title":"airbnb removes rentals in israeli west bank settlements","story":"Announcement comes before publication of damning Human Rights Watch reportAirbnb has said it will remove from its website all properties in Israeli settlements built on the occupied Palestinian territories in the West Bank, after years of accusations that the company was benefitting from rentals in the illegal outposts.The accommodation bookings website announced on Monday that around 200 listings would be taken down in what will be seen as a victory for the Palestinian-led anti-occupation movement.“Many in the global community have stated that companies should not do business here because they believe companies should not profit on lands where people have been displaced,” it said in a statement posted on its website.“We concluded that we should remove listings in Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank that are at the core of the dispute between Israelis and Palestinians.”The announcement came before the publication on Tuesday of a damning report by the New York-based advocacy group Human Rights Watch on the negative implications of its settlement business.Airbnb, which says it operates in 191 countries, will face a backlash from within Israel and from its international backers, who have fiercely fought attempts to delegitimise Israel’s control of the West Bank.Israel’s tourism minister Yariv Levin called the decision “discriminatory”, according to Israeli media, and instructed his ministry to “limit the company’s activity throughout the country”. It was not clear what this would mean.Israel captured the West Bank from Jordanian forces in 1967 and continues to control and occupy the area, although Palestinians have limited self-rule over small enclaves.Ideologically driven Jewish nationalists who claim all of historic Palestine have since created outposts there, pushing out Palestinian residents. Today, more than half a million settlers live in what have become sprawling towns connected by a network of roads that cut up the West Bank.Settlements have long been seen as a critical barrier to a peace deal, which the international community broadly agrees should be two states side by side, one for Israelis and one for Palestinians.Activists have for years called for Airbnb and other companies to withdraw from the disputed territory, and Airbnb acknowledged it had “struggled to come up with the right approach”.Human Rights Watch welcomed the move. Arvind Ganesan, the business and human rights director at the organisation, said Airbnb’s decision was “an important recognition that such listings can’t square with its human rights responsibilities”.“For two years, Human Rights Watch has spoken with Airbnb about their brokering of rentals in West Bank settlements that are illegal under international humanitarian law and for which Palestinian ID holders are effectively barred from entering,” he said.The settlement movement has sought to encourage tourism in occupied land, with the help of the Israeli government, which established national parks there. A leaked European Union report said some projects were being used “as a political tool to … support, legitimise and expand settlements”.In 2016, Airbnb came under added scrutiny after it was revealed that its website listed settlement properties as being inside the state of Israel, and not the Palestinian territories.Husam Zomlot, a Palestinian diplomat, condemned the firm at the time, saying it was “promoting stolen property and land. There will come a time when companies like this, who profit from the occupation, will be taken to court.”On Monday, a senior Palestinian negotiator, Saeb Erekat, described Airbnb’s decision as an “initial positive step” but complained that it did not include East Jerusalem, which was also captured and occupied in the 1967 war."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28b9ebfb4d5e9587f22efdf1cff08007a45948ba/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=914ac083e47e825ae570b091154954f4","title":"top filmmakers back penguin intervention on attenborough show","story":"Wildlife documentary experts defend crew’s decision to help trapped birdsLeading wildlife camera operators and film-makers have defended the film crew on David Attenborough’s latest BBC series over their decision to break with convention and intervene to save a group of penguins that had become trapped in a ravine.Nature film-makers are discouraged from intervening in the events they are attempting to capture on film. While the general principle is to avoid interfering with the natural course of events, the crew on the Dynasties series stepped in when they saw the birds’ predicament.The penguins at the centre of Sunday’s episode of Dynasties had either blown or tumbled into a gully in a storm and were unable to to get out. In what BBC Earth described as an “unprecedented move”, the crew dug a shallow ramp so some of the penguins would be able to use it to save themselves.But Allan said he saw no problem with the film crew’s intervention. “Interfering or not is a decision based on what you’re seeing at the time. To interfere on a predation event is definitely wrong but, in this situation, they didn’t spook the penguins. All they did was create an escape route for them,” he said. Allan explained it would have been a far more stressful situation for the penguins had the film crew decided to pick them up and move them.He added: “I certainly think, in that case, what they did was entirely justifiable and entirely understandable. I would have done the same thing in their situation.”Philip Hoare, author and film-maker, said the crew were bound to upset someone whichever way they responded. He said he found himself in a similar position when he was in Sri Lanka filming sperm whales. When a group of killer whales appeared to hunt the sperm whales, he realised his boat was in between the predator and prey. “It was a very difficult thing to make a decision on,” he said, “I didn’t want to see any whales die, but there was a possibility that, by being there, we were frustrating one species’ natural instinct and need.” In that instance, his crew moved the boat.He added that it was impossible to document an encounter between a human and another species objectively. “This notion of purity of an encounter between a human and another species is absolutely ridiculous. There’s no possibility of that.”Mike Gunton, the executive producer of the series, also defended the crew’s decision to help the penguins. He told Radio 4’s Today programme: “In the 30 years I’ve been doing this, it’s one of the very few occasions when we’ve ever done anything like this because it’s a very unusual situation. Normally, you don’t interfere, you can’t interfere, or you wouldn’t interfere because of all sorts of consequences.“One, it would be very dangerous to do often for both you and the animal. Also, you’ll probably be changing the dynamics of the natural system or you might be depriving something of its food. But, in this particular situation, none of those things applied.”While it has previously been reported that Attenborough had opposed the move, saying that “tragedy is a part of life”, Gunton said that the presenter had told him he also would have rescued the penguins."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3703449.1542660469!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"north may serve as post brexit bridge to eu claims retail ni","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSince British prime minister Theresa May revealed details of the UK’s orce deal, there has been  growing support from business groups in Northern Ireland.Northern Ireland could be the “bridge to the European Union and have the best of both worlds” after the UK leaves the EU, according to a leading retail organisation which has become the latest business body in the North to back the UK’s draft Brexit agreement.Retail NI, which represents 1,300 independent businesses, confirmed on Monday that while it did not believe the draft deal was “perfect” it had decided to support it because of the potential “economic disaster of no deal”.Glyn Roberts, chief executive of Retail NI, said: “If this deal is not voted through the House of Commons then we face the chaos of the UK crashing out of the EU. We are satisfied that it gives protection to the vital retail supply chain and ensures businesses will have full and tariff-free access to the UK and EU single markets.”Mr Roberts has called for political leaders to put the North’s “economy, future prosperity and people’s jobs” before their own respective political beliefs.Since British prime minister Theresa May revealed details of the UK’s orce deal last week, there has been a growing groundswell of support for it from businesses groups in Northern Ireland.Among the first to back the proposed deal were four of the North’s largest business groups which collectively said the agreement, while “by no means perfect” was a “welcome step forward”.The Confederation of British Industry NI, the Institute of Directors NI, the Federation of Small Businesses and the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce have all agreed that the draft Brexit agreement provides local firms in the North with some clarity and will enable all the parties involved in the negotiations to “move on to the critical next stage”.The North’s Livestock and Meat Commission has also welcomed the withdrawal agreement because it believes “a no-deal scenario would be a devastating blow to the Northern Ireland red meat industry”, while the Northern Ireland Food and Drink Association and the Ulster Farmer’s Union have also both acknowledged that Theresa May’s hard-fought plan could help avoid the one scenario which they both dread – a no-deal Brexit.Leading industry groups including the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, Manufacturing NI, Hospitality Ulster, Freight Transport Association Northern Ireland and the Northern Ireland Meat Exporters’ Association have all described the draft agreement as a “welcome step” towards a deal. While the Anglo-North Irish Fish Producers’ Organisation has said it also views it as an “extremely important first step”.

Photograph:  Colm LenaghanPacemaker PressDUP leader Arlene Foster has accused the British and Irish governments of creating a “a false choice” between accepting the draft withdrawal agreement or having no deal.Ms Foster said on Monday that the Brexit deal would lock the United Kingdom into the European Union “with no way out”.“We have been told that the backstop is only necessary to prevent such a hard border, but these comments make it clear that the EU’s insistence on a backstop was not aimed at this,” she said. “The European Union’s focus on the Border between Northern Ireland and the Republic has only ever been a negotiating tactic to secure its own aims in the negotiations.”The DUP has come under pressure from business groups in the North to support the agreement but Ms Foster said: “I appreciate the concerns people have about a no deal but this should not be a binary choice. It is absolutely clear that it is time to work for a better deal.“The agreement that has been put on the table is clearly not a good deal and no one should be forced into accepting another false choice.”Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said on Monday the DUP was “catastrophically wrong” in rejecting the withdrawal agreement.“It’s now very clear right across Ireland, North and South, that key voices from business, agriculture and other sectors are coming out and facing down the very negative politics advanced by the DUP and the Tory Brexiteers, ” said Ms McDonald.Earlier, northern secretary Karen Bradley urged her fellow MPs to “put the national interest first” and sign up to the draft Brexit deal.She also suggested that failure to accept the deal would result in a hard border between the North and the South. If World Trade Organisation rules applied in the event of no deal then there would have to be border checks, she told a conference of more than 70 leading Northern Ireland business people on Monday.As the DUP continued to warn that the draft deal was a threat to Northern Ireland’s union with Britain, Ms Bradley told business leaders no such threat existed.“The agreement preserves the economic and constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom, upholds the Belfast Agreement, and ensures people and businesses that rely on an open border between Northern Ireland and Ireland can continue living their lives and operating as they do now,” she said in her speech.Ms Bradley, when speaking at the Belfast Met College in the city’s Titanic Quarter, made no direct reference to the DUP – “I am not singling any party out,” she said – but insisted that “compromises have to be made, accommodations have to be made”.Several speakers disputed claims by senior DUP politicians that business leaders did not understand the constitutional threat inherent in the deal.Angela McGowan, director of Confederation of British Industry NI, said: “My members don’t see this as any threat to their Britishness or their nationalities, and don’t see it as a threat to the constitution.”Trevor Lockhart, chairman of CBI NI said: “Nothing in the deal undermines the constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom.” Tina McKenzie, head of the North’s Federation of Small Business said Northern Ireland could not afford the disruption of a no deal: “We are fully aware of what a hard Brexit would do to our economy.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3702271.1542571610!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord varadkar s speech was like a hobbit s front door very low key","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar  addresses the delegates. Photograph: Nick BradshawThrilled delegates knew they were in for a white-knuckle ride when Simon Coveney almost fist-bumped Regina Doherty onstage and then gingerly punched the air before inciting the Fine Gael mob to act like hooligans.The headline act was about to explode upon their ardfheis and the Tearaway Tánaiste wanted the crowd to make some noise.“In six minutes’ time,” he tantalised, “our party leader and our Taoiseach will walk to this stage.”Leo taking himself forward, in tune with the theme of the day.The country would be watching.“I know that this party has a reputation for being polite and mannerly and a little contained sometimes at events like this one,” devil-may-care Coveney told the crowd. “But not today, please! I am asking you to make a statement, to be heard, to let people know how united and strong we are as a political party right now behind Leo Varadkar.”There was a brief, polite pause and then the inflamed foot soldiers burst into a frenzy of genteel clapping. Guests in the diplomatic seating area were worried in case the rabble-rousing Minister for Foreign Affairs might start wrecking the gaff. But Simon settled down and there was no need to call security.Due to upstaging issues, seconds in command don’t often do the wind-up speech for party leaders. They are too far up the pecking order, too close to the crown. Somebody who won’t thieve some shine from the star – usually an up-and-coming candidate or a knockabout crowd favourite – is chosen.On Saturday night, the former rivals for the country’s top job stood together, recast as Ireland’s Brexit warriors.“We work together night and day to protect Ireland,” Coveney declared, just in time for the live TV broadcast and the showcasing of the wonderful Two Ts to a national audience.A wide black curtain was pulled back to allow Leo make his entrance from the back of the hall. They had to do this because after Simon’s podium paean (tough, calm, intelligent, educated, ambitious, compassionate, generous, change maker), Leo couldn’t fit his head though the double doors.He got a tremendous reception as he did some minor flesh pressing on his way to the stage, the Kongos song “Come With Me Now” pulsating from the sound system.“Woah come with me nowI’m gonna take you downWoah come with me nowI’m gonna show you how”As you do.Some bright spark put a joke early on in the script. It involved using one of the props – “ordinary” party members sitting woodenly in long rows behind the Taoiseach who had, apparently, asked him questions earlier which he would address in the speech. This was a way of getting over the makey-up “I met a man out along the road who told me . . .”These people had names, and when Leo mentioned them he swivelled his head towards the props to indicate that Tom or Lynda or Vera or whoever actually existed, and was there among them.Lorraine, it seems, wanted to know about extending the Confidence and Supply deal with Fianna Fáil.“I told her the truth. I said it’s not easy negotiating with the Fianna Fáil front bench,” said Leo, winding up for the big punchline.We feared we might suffocate in tumbleweed but a person began to clap, very loudly, and everyone joined in. Or at least that part of the hall which wasn’t wiped out by the lead balloon which was falling on them.The Taoiseach was clear Fine Gael would not go down the populist road of other parties by buying votes with all sorts of expensive promises like tax cuts and the like. Then he promised he would get middle income earners out of the top tax bracket and make sure more of them qualify for childcare subsidies.“As they should . . . They’re worth it! You’re worth it!”People may scoff and say that money should be used for far more pressing causes, but we noticed one of the private security men in the black bomber jackets standing at his position, hands held low, enthusiastically applauding.It certainly went down well with the crowd.Going forward was thrust forward quite a lot in a speech which was not backward about coming forward. It will come as no surprise that “Taking Ireland Forward Together” is Fine Gael’s new off-the-shelf slogan, from the clunky and unoriginal side of the marketing aisle.Did the Yanks see them coming and sell it to the party? Taking Ireland For . . . a ride? A fool? A small fortune? Hours of happy slogan and poster vandalising in prospect here.There was also a strangely jarring American word in Leo’s speech when he told the nation “Only Fine Gael can be trusted to protect your job, your pocketbook and your pension.”Then again, everyone knows Fine Gael ladies keep their pocketbooks in their fanny packs beside their cellphones.All in all it was a Hobbit’s front door of a speech – very low key.He isn’t a great speaker. If he was, Simon would have said it. But the delegates loved him, and he made up for his flat address by staying behind on stage for the best part of an hour posing for photographs with delegates.But the evening was rescued in style by the big screen in the Ballroom and a memorable rugby match. Leo was among cheering delegates urging on the home team to a memorable win over the All-Blacks. An elated crowd left Citywest in buoyant mood, all keyed up and ready for action.Heading home happy and sweatin’, even if the man who was supposed to do it wasn’t responsible. That doesn’t matter, Leo was exalted by association. A lucky general, along with everything else.Earlier in the day, for the benefit of party members and not for general release, a spoof video of various Ministers trying to be funny was aired.It was an entertainingly awful “spin the wheel” game where Cabinet members answered light-hearted questions. The whole farrago took place with whacky sit-com music running in the background.“Are you ready to play the game?” the Minister for Justice was asked.“I’m ready to roll . . .,” answered Charlie Flanagan, perpetrating a mortifying thumbs up.Then Heather Humphreys spun the wheel unenthusiastically.“What item did Leo Varadkar famously put in the dishwasher in 2017?”What did the Tánaiste have to promise his five-year-old daughter to make sure she would greet Pope Francis?“A kitten. A live one. It’s known as The Holy Spirit in our house,” replied Coveney.One viewer said his toes were curling so much he could scratch his arse with his foot.As soon as Leo left the stage, his team sent an email to all his subscribers.“I’ve just finished. Can you help?”Where to start . . ."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000140439032_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parliament accused conflict interest rejects nda debate","story":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, refused to allow Maria Miller to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerfulHouse of CommonsMaria Miller, the Tory MP, last night accused Parliament of a conflict of interest over Britain\u0027s MeToo scandal after it emerged she had been blocked from questioning the Government over it.The Daily  can reveal John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, yesterday refused to allow Ms Miller, who chairs the women \u0026amp equalities Commons select committee, to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerful, including the Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.Helen Jones, chairman of the petitions select committee, also rejected calls to allow a parliamentary debate on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after two separate petitions demanding a change to the law between them secured 250,000 signatures. It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

The full trial is set to last four days and will commence later this year.There is no claim against Ms Cook, from Newport on the Isle of Wight, who is not a party to the legal action.Law and orderRemainers’ threats of EU non-cooperation if there is no deal are an admission we should leaveTory Brexiteers admit their attempt to unseat Theresa May has stalled amid bitter in-fightingComment: Toppling Theresa May risks a bitter second referendum and a Corbyn governmentBBC Natural History Unit boss: why we stepped in to save the penguinsComment: Never mind Brexit, Theresa May is a terrible Prime Minister - that is why she must go Gibraltar: The tiny British outpost pushed into the spotlight once more by Brexit dispute with SpainRow over dwarf actors as Shrek production hires 6ft man to play \u0026#39vertically challenged\u0026#39 character on his knees Theresa May: \u0026#39Don\u0026#39t just listen to politicians\u0026#39EU agrees plan for joint spy schoolWhy 45 minutes is the ideal commute, according to scientistsDonald Trump mocks former Navy Seal for failing to catch Osama Bin Laden \u0026#39sooner\u0026#39Talking Strictly podcast: Kate Silverton, Ashley Roberts and a Blackpool ten-fest!Brexit rebellion stalls as flow of letters dries up and gang of five\u0026#39s \u0026#39pizza plot\u0026#39 proves too hard to swallowTalkTalk hackers jailed for cyber attack that hit 1.6m customers and cost company £77mRoyal Academy of Music teacher wrongfully sacked for referring to violinists as \u0026#39gypos\u0026#39, tribunal rules\u0026#39Stolen Picasso painting\u0026#39 found in Romania is fake created by theatre groupFrench fuel protests block roads for third day amid injuries and racist attacks\u0026#39Meltdown Monday\u0026#39 leaves hundreds of thousands of rail passengers stranded across the countryAirbnb removes listings in West Bank settlementsComment: The backbench Brexiteers were going to topple Theresa May.

The CBI’s John Allan will use his speech at the group’s annual conference to call on MPs to highlight the importance of compromising in order to “open a route to a long-term trade arrangement and (unlock) transition – the very least that companies need to prepare for Brexit”.Tory MP says \u0027we stand at the bar of history today\u0027- liveMay faces defeat over release of economic impact of her Brexit plansMay says Brexit deal will stop EU citizens \u0027jumping queue\u0027 into UKStop the posturing – MPs like David Davis have no idea about BrexitA compromise would not be perfect, Mr Allan is expected to say, but “most importantly, it avoids the wrecking ball that would be a no-deal departure.”Mr Allan will also highlight a number of examples of businesses losing out on investment due to Brexit uncertainty. ““In the past few days alone, I’ve heard of a life sciences firm in the North West that has cut almost all investment in the UK – putting it instead in Germany and China,” he is expected to say.“I’ve heard a Northern Irish tech firm that has stopped winning contracts because their aerospace customers are worried about Brexit. And a construction firm says it now costs an extra £20,000 to build a house, due to a shortage of materials and labour since Brexit. “These stories are repeated across the country. 80 per cent of firms have already cut or postponed investment because of the risk of a no-deal exit.”The CBI conference begins at 10am on Monday 19th November, with the PM and various business figures scheduled to address attendees.

It is a compromise. But it is hard-won progress,\u0027 said Ms FairbairnThe money that firms are being forced to spend in preparation for a potential no-deal Brexit next March is a waste, the director-general of the CBI has complained.In a speech to the business lobby group’s 2018 conference on Monday Carloyn Fairbairn said “not one penny of it will create new jobs or products”.This is what day one of a no-deal Brexit could look like“Brexit is consuming government – every politician, every civil servant. And it is also consuming British business,” she said.“Our firms are spending hundreds of millions of pounds preparing for the worst case – and not one penny of it will create new jobs or new products.“Investment is flooding out of the right areas like skills and tech, and into areas which do absolutely nothing to help our productivity. Some of it is leaving our country altogether. While other countries are forging a competitive future, Westminster seems to be living in its own narrow world, in which extreme positions are being allowed to dominate.”Despite the almost universally hostile political reception for Theresa May’s draft Withdrawal Agreement with the European Union, unveiled last week, the CBI\u0026nbsphas called on MPs to back it since it avoids the risk of a cliff-edge for firms on 29 March 2019.“The Prime Minister’s agreement is not perfect. It is a compromise. But it is hard-won progress,” said Ms Fairbairn.A no-deal Brexit next March would be expected to ground UK flights and result in severe disruption of haulage deliveries through UK ports.UK-based manufacturers and retailers which have “just-in-time” supply chains have warned of major problems in such circumstances and said that they have limited facilities for stock-piling.Last week, Ms May told the House of Commons: “We can choose to leave with no deal, we can risk no Brexit at all, or we can choose to united and support the best deal that can be negotiated”.In her speech, Ms Fairbairn\u0026nbspagain castigated Labour’s nationalisation plans, saying that when it was last tried in the 1970s “it ushered in one of the darkest periods in our country’s modern economic history”.But she also had a message for those hardline Brexiteers who have presented leaving the EU as an opportunity for wholesale deregulation.“Extreme market ideology does not get us much further. Becoming a hustling cowboy nation with minimal regulation is not what people want. Nor is it what business wants,” she said.On immigration, Ms Fairbairn\u0026nbspalso rejected the recent advice from the independent Migration Advisory Committee that the Government should, post-Brexit, only allow in skilled workers who can command a salary of more than £30,000 and also the Governments pledge to reduce net migration to the tens of thousands.“What has been proposed so far won’t work,” she said.“The idea that anyone earning less than £30,000 can’t contribute to our economy, for instance. Together, we could do so much better – through a jointly developed immigration policy, one that avoids false choices, that does away with arbitrary targets, and focusses instead on the people we need to build our economy.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The dollar’s soaring, the dollar’s plummeting.But why? What moves currency markets? Why do exchange rates fluctuate, often dramatically?The answer is supply and demand. If demand for a currency goes up its price will rise. If demand falls, its price will tend to fall.But what can determine supply and demand?First, expectations of national economic weakness. Think of things like war, or a natural catastrophe, or some other radical change of circumstances with economic implications. A good example is the impact of the Brexit referendum on sterling. So what’s going on? Bad macroeconomic news implies lower economic activity and less inward investment from abroad due to lower returns. That makes investing money in a currency less attractive to external investors, so there’s less demand for a currency from abroad. The result? The exchange rate goes down.Second, expectations of national economic strength. This works the other way. It can be sparked by unexpectedly good GDP figures. Perhaps a new oil or gas discovery. Sometimes it’s driven by political decisions. Think of US dollar currency’s response to Trump’s election victory, with him having promised tax cuts and an infrastructure spending splurge in the campaign. These were all expected to lift the growth rate, at least in the short term. Macroeconomic strength means interest rates likely to rise to head off domestic inflation. Rising domestic interest rates mean better returns which means more demand from abroad. The result? The exchange rate goes up.But it’s important to remember that the value of a currency is a relative measure. A nation’s currency is always valued in a foreign currency. So sterling is measured in dollars or euros or yen or rand or the Mongoloian togrog, you name it. If the value of another country’s currency rises that means yours can fall, even if nothing has really changed about the economic outlook for your country. When the dollar rises against the pound it can be because the US economy is doing well. It doesn’t necessarily mean the outlook for the UK economy has got any worseAnd a final word of caution. Don’t make the mistake of believing that currency moves are always based on rational and careful assessments by currency traders and investors of underlying economic conditions. In the short term – and possibly even the long term – there is a very large dose of knee-jerk sentiment, herding and, sometimes, blind panic involved.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It is clear that Debbie Crosbie may be entering the lion’s den when she joins next year.\u0026nbspTSB appoints Debbie Crosbie as new chief executive TSB owner Sabadell hit by IT failure costs with more expectedTSB sheds 20,000 current accounts in wake of massive IT failure In case you’d forgotten, TSB was spun out of Lloyds, enjoying a brief time as an independent business before Sabadell moved in. Following the deal, it was decided that TSB should move off Lloyds’ IT system, for which it was paying a pretty penny, and onto one provided by its new owner.Trouble is, the transfer went disastrously wrong, resulting in people being locked out of online banking, and creating a political and media furore. TSB’s poor employees, who spent hours on end in its branches dealing with furious customers, went through hell too.\u0026nbspThe bank further compounded the issue by initially trying to downplay it and by failing to keep aggrieved customers properly informed about what was happening.\u0026nbspPester was slow to apologise and then went and told MPs on the Treasury Committee that all was well and they should think about switching to TSB when members of the MPs\u0027 own staff had told them they couldn’t access their accounts that morning.\u0026nbspPutting right what went wrong will be a tough ask for anyone, but on the face of it, Crosbie looks like a smart choice on the part of Sabadell, and the bank’s embattled chairman Richard Meddings, to do that.She’s currently the chief operating officer of CYBG, another ‘challenger’, which hasn’t been free of IT problems. So she knows the territory, and presumably has a good idea of what it takes to succeed with a mid sized bank in the British market.\u0026nbspBefore TSB can do that it needs to convince its customers, regulators and MPs that it can be trusted and is fit for purpose. That will be at the top of Crosbie’s to do list. She may also have to deal with some awkward politics, although that’s not unusual in banking.\u0026nbspTSB’s issues could have made the role tough to fill. But Crosbie was apparently one of 30 names to be given consideration, and topped a shortlist of four.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

The CBI’s John Allan will use his speech at the group’s annual conference to call on MPs to highlight the importance of compromising in order to “open a route to a long-term trade arrangement and (unlock) transition – the very least that companies need to prepare for Brexit”.Tory MP says \u0027we stand at the bar of history today\u0027- liveMay faces defeat over release of economic impact of her Brexit plansMay says Brexit deal will stop EU citizens \u0027jumping queue\u0027 into UKStop the posturing – MPs like David Davis have no idea about BrexitA compromise would not be perfect, Mr Allan is expected to say, but “most importantly, it avoids the wrecking ball that would be a no-deal departure.”Mr Allan will also highlight a number of examples of businesses losing out on investment due to Brexit uncertainty. ““In the past few days alone, I’ve heard of a life sciences firm in the North West that has cut almost all investment in the UK – putting it instead in Germany and China,” he is expected to say.“I’ve heard a Northern Irish tech firm that has stopped winning contracts because their aerospace customers are worried about Brexit. And a construction firm says it now costs an extra £20,000 to build a house, due to a shortage of materials and labour since Brexit. “These stories are repeated across the country. 80 per cent of firms have already cut or postponed investment because of the risk of a no-deal exit.”The CBI conference begins at 10am on Monday 19th November, with the PM and various business figures scheduled to address attendees.

It is a compromise. But it is hard-won progress,\u0027 said Ms FairbairnThe money that firms are being forced to spend in preparation for a potential no-deal Brexit next March is a waste, the director-general of the CBI has complained.In a speech to the business lobby group’s 2018 conference on Monday Carloyn Fairbairn said “not one penny of it will create new jobs or products”.This is what day one of a no-deal Brexit could look like“Brexit is consuming government – every politician, every civil servant. And it is also consuming British business,” she said.“Our firms are spending hundreds of millions of pounds preparing for the worst case – and not one penny of it will create new jobs or new products.“Investment is flooding out of the right areas like skills and tech, and into areas which do absolutely nothing to help our productivity. Some of it is leaving our country altogether. While other countries are forging a competitive future, Westminster seems to be living in its own narrow world, in which extreme positions are being allowed to dominate.”Despite the almost universally hostile political reception for Theresa May’s draft Withdrawal Agreement with the European Union, unveiled last week, the CBI\u0026nbsphas called on MPs to back it since it avoids the risk of a cliff-edge for firms on 29 March 2019.“The Prime Minister’s agreement is not perfect. It is a compromise. But it is hard-won progress,” said Ms Fairbairn.A no-deal Brexit next March would be expected to ground UK flights and result in severe disruption of haulage deliveries through UK ports.UK-based manufacturers and retailers which have “just-in-time” supply chains have warned of major problems in such circumstances and said that they have limited facilities for stock-piling.Last week, Ms May told the House of Commons: “We can choose to leave with no deal, we can risk no Brexit at all, or we can choose to united and support the best deal that can be negotiated”.In her speech, Ms Fairbairn\u0026nbspagain castigated Labour’s nationalisation plans, saying that when it was last tried in the 1970s “it ushered in one of the darkest periods in our country’s modern economic history”.But she also had a message for those hardline Brexiteers who have presented leaving the EU as an opportunity for wholesale deregulation.“Extreme market ideology does not get us much further. Becoming a hustling cowboy nation with minimal regulation is not what people want. Nor is it what business wants,” she said.On immigration, Ms Fairbairn\u0026nbspalso rejected the recent advice from the independent Migration Advisory Committee that the Government should, post-Brexit, only allow in skilled workers who can command a salary of more than £30,000 and also the Governments pledge to reduce net migration to the tens of thousands.“What has been proposed so far won’t work,” she said.“The idea that anyone earning less than £30,000 can’t contribute to our economy, for instance. Together, we could do so much better – through a jointly developed immigration policy, one that avoids false choices, that does away with arbitrary targets, and focusses instead on the people we need to build our economy.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It’s a wartime story in which, for a change, the men are relegated to supporting roles. It follows in a tradition of French rural family sagas like Jean De Florette or Manon Des Sources. The landscapes and the changing seasons play as much of a part in the story as the main characters.Dark River offers little such consolation. It has some lyrical and delicate moments but the mood is generally overwhelmingly bleak and lugubrious. Incest and abuse don’t leave much space for any comic interludes. This is a powerful film with a grinding intensity about it. Light relief it isn’t but Dark River still has quite an impact.Late on in Argentinean director Lucrecia Martel’s startling, highly original new feature, Zama, a character who has just had both his arms cut off, is advised to “shove your stumps in the sand … if you don’t bleed out, you’ll survive.” It’s a grisly, darkly humorous moment in a film that continually surprises us with both its brutality and its lyricism.The most dispiriting aspect of this otherwise enrapturing Oscar-nominated animated feature is that its storyline still seems so current. The film depicts an Afghan society in which women don’t have a face. It is set during the Taliban rule, which lasted from the mid-1990s until late 2001, but this doesn’t feel like a period piece. Seventeen years after the Taliban were ousted from power in Afghanistan following the US invasion, the plight of women in the country appears hardly to have improved. Spike Lee’s work sometimes risks sensory overload. He fires off so many different ideas and storytelling styles that audiences can become bamboozled by his scattergun approach. BlacKkKlansman is one of his very best films because the digressions are as entertaining as ever but don’t get in the way of the main story.Much of the pleasure in Aardman films has always lain in their gently ironic, Alan Bennett-like humour. They take very exotic characters and subject matter but then deal with them in a matter-of-fact fashion. They make a virtue out of their own relative modesty. Early Man isn’t the flashiest animated feature that you’ll see this year but it is certainly the most likeable. 717 Isle of DogsLike all of Wes Anderson’s work, Isle Of Dogs is very stylised, very offbeat and characterised by its extremely dry and often ironic humour. This Japanese-set stop-motion fable is also gorgeous to look at – packed full of intricate visual detail. It deals with some weighty themes (ethnic cleansing, fascism and corruption) but does so in an idiosyncratic fashion.817 Three Billboards Outside of Ebbing, MissouriWriter-director Martin McDonagh has a host of award-winning plays behind him but his movies haven’t always lived up to his stage work. This one certainly does. It shares some of the dark and nihilistic humour found in McDonagh’s previous film, Seven Psychopaths.In an era of wearisome poltergeist movies, haunted house stories and torture porn, A Quiet Place is a refreshingly pared-down and very original affair. Director John Krasinski relies on editing, sound effects and off-screen action to crank up the tension. We do see the creatures from time to time, sometimes even in extreme closeup. They are very grotesque, bigger versions of the polyp-like succubus which exploded out of John Hurt’s stomach in Alien. However, the most terrifying moments here come when the humans are waiting for them to appear, desperately hoping that they won’t. Lady Bird is one of the best American coming-of-age films since Barry Levinson’s Diner. Written and directed by Greta Gerwig, it offers an utterly winning mix of humour, poignancy and sharp-eyed social observation. Gerwig approaches her subject matter with the same tenderness and affectionate irony with which the adolescent Lady Bird regards Sacramento. Gerwig also shows Lady Bird’s heroism as the young heroine strives against the odds to become the very best version of herself she can be.If Phantom Thread is indeed Daniel Day-Lewis’s final film as an actor, he is going out on a wondrously bizarre note. This must be the oddest film in his career, one in which he gives a typically commanding but very idiosyncratic performance. Almost everything here is jarring – but generally in a very positive way. It is not so long ago that Paul Schrader seemed to be giving up on cinema. The American writer-director (whose credits include Taxi Driver, American Gigolo and Affliction) had taken to making movies like the sour Hollywood satire The Canyons with Lindsay Lohan and the cartoonishly violent Dog Eat Dog, shot cheaply, aimed at a VOD audience. The former had a montage of closed-down movie theatres. In interviews, Schrader struck a gloomy note about the future of the industry. This is why First Reformed is so refreshing. This is not just Schrader’s best film in a very long while. It is also a re-affirmation of the director’s belief in the medium.Oscar Wilde goes to ruin in Rupert Everett’s debut feature as director. Everett also wrote and stars in the film, giving a grandstanding performance as the Irish writer at the end of his life, after his release from prison, where he has been doing hard labour for “gross indecency”. This is a moving and surprising biopic that squeezes out every last drop of pathos from its subject matter. Black Panther is not only one of the most entertaining recent superhero films but has an intelligence and a political dimension that such inchoate offerings as Suicide Squad and Justice League completely lacked. It is an action movie which touches on Pan-Africanism and which owes as much to Malcolm X as it does to Batman or Captain America. Sicilian Ghost Story is a genre-bending affair that combines elements of teen romance, gothic psycho-drama and political thriller. It is loosely based on a true story of a boy called Giuseppe Di Matteo whose father, an ex-member of the Sicilian Mafia, turned “grass” against his erstwhile associates. The Mafia responded by kidnapping Giuseppe and keeping him in captivity for nearly 800 days. First Man is all about understated heroism. It’s affecting precisely because Armstrong (played with quiet intensity by Ryan Gosling) doesn’t feel the continual need to boast about his mission. The film is a tearjerker but a very subtle one. Dogman is one of the best Italian films of recent times, a modern day neo realist fable that bears comparison with the great work of Fellini, Rossellini, De Sica et al. Its main character, the dog groomer Marcello (Marcello Fonte), is a wonderful creation: loveable, vulnerable, seedy and comic all at the same time. From its slow-burning beginning, s develops into an epic melodrama. It’s a wartime story in which, for a change, the men are relegated to supporting roles. It follows in a tradition of French rural family sagas like Jean De Florette or Manon Des Sources.

Director John Krasinski relies on editing, sound effects and off-screen action to crank up the tension. We do see the creatures from time to time, sometimes even in extreme closeup. They are very grotesque, bigger versions of the polyp-like succubus which exploded out of John Hurt’s stomach in Alien. However, the most terrifying moments here come when the humans are waiting for them to appear, desperately hoping that they won’t. Lady Bird is one of the best American coming-of-age films since Barry Levinson’s Diner. Written and directed by Greta Gerwig, it offers an utterly winning mix of humour, poignancy and sharp-eyed social observation. Gerwig approaches her subject matter with the same tenderness and affectionate irony with which the adolescent Lady Bird regards Sacramento. Gerwig also shows Lady Bird’s heroism as the young heroine strives against the odds to become the very best version of herself she can be.If Phantom Thread is indeed Daniel Day-Lewis’s final film as an actor, he is going out on a wondrously bizarre note. This must be the oddest film in his career, one in which he gives a typically commanding but very idiosyncratic performance. Almost everything here is jarring – but generally in a very positive way. It is not so long ago that Paul Schrader seemed to be giving up on cinema. The American writer-director (whose credits include Taxi Driver, American Gigolo and Affliction) had taken to making movies like the sour Hollywood satire The Canyons with Lindsay Lohan and the cartoonishly violent Dog Eat Dog, shot cheaply, aimed at a VOD audience. The former had a montage of closed-down movie theatres. In interviews, Schrader struck a gloomy note about the future of the industry. This is why First Reformed is so refreshing. This is not just Schrader’s best film in a very long while. It is also a re-affirmation of the director’s belief in the medium.Oscar Wilde goes to ruin in Rupert Everett’s debut feature as director. Everett also wrote and stars in the film, giving a grandstanding performance as the Irish writer at the end of his life, after his release from prison, where he has been doing hard labour for “gross indecency”. This is a moving and surprising biopic that squeezes out every last drop of pathos from its subject matter. Black Panther is not only one of the most entertaining recent superhero films but has an intelligence and a political dimension that such inchoate offerings as Suicide Squad and Justice League completely lacked. It is an action movie which touches on Pan-Africanism and which owes as much to Malcolm X as it does to Batman or Captain America. Sicilian Ghost Story is a genre-bending affair that combines elements of teen romance, gothic psycho-drama and political thriller. It is loosely based on a true story of a boy called Giuseppe Di Matteo whose father, an ex-member of the Sicilian Mafia, turned “grass” against his erstwhile associates. The Mafia responded by kidnapping Giuseppe and keeping him in captivity for nearly 800 days. First Man is all about understated heroism. It’s affecting precisely because Armstrong (played with quiet intensity by Ryan Gosling) doesn’t feel the continual need to boast about his mission. The film is a tearjerker but a very subtle one. Dogman is one of the best Italian films of recent times, a modern day neo realist fable that bears comparison with the great work of Fellini, Rossellini, De Sica et al. Its main character, the dog groomer Marcello (Marcello Fonte), is a wonderful creation: loveable, vulnerable, seedy and comic all at the same time. There have persistent rumours since that this will be the last Coldplay album ever produced, although the band have yet to confirm their future.Follow\u0026nbspIndependent Culture\u0026nbspon Facebook for all the latest on Film, TV, Music, and moreShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

As well as dealing with the fallout from a major report into Facebook’s communications strategy, the announcement was made amid mounting\u0026nbspconcern that the internet\u0026nbspand social media giants like Facebook are not doing enough to help support local news organisations.Facebook did not say it would make\u0026nbspchanges to its news feed algorithm, which decides what news stories show up on users’ feeds. It also is not making any changes to the way it pays for the kind of journalists the scheme will help train.The new reporters\u0026nbspwill be trained as “community journalists” in the areas they will work, according to the National Council for the Training of Journalists (NCTJ), which will ensure that they gain qualifications through the process. And they will work at local newspapers owned by publishers\u0026nbspNewsquest, JPIMedia, Reach, Archant and the Midland News Association, all of which are taking part in the project.Facebook’s UK head of news partnerships Nick Wrenn said the announcement was in recognition of “the important role\u0026nbspFacebook\u0026nbspplays in how people get their news today, and we want to do more to support local publishers”. It would aim to “encourage more reporting from towns which have lost their local newspaper and beat reporters,”\u0026nbsphe said.The organisations behind the scheme also said they would focus on hiring a erse set of new journalists for the scheme.“The NCTJ cares deeply about the number, quality and ersity of journalists working in our local communities,” said\u0026nbspNCTJ chief executive Joanne Butcher.“We are very proud to support the sustainability of quality local journalism by overseeing the recruitment of additional local news journalists from erse and inclusive backgrounds and by ensuring they are properly trained and qualified.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Sixteen nations were involved in its construction. In addition to the US and Russia, those were: Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK. \u0026nbsp2. No fewer than 136 space flights from seven different types of craft were deployed to deliver parts to the engineers. The large modules were delivered on 42 assembly flights: 37 on US shuttles, five on Russian Proton and Soyuz rockets.3. The result is the largest manned object in space, 357ft long — just a yard short of a full-length American football field.4. The ISS weighs 419,725kg including the weight of spacecrafts, of which it can accommodate as many as six at any one time.5. It is the single most expensive object ever built at £93.4bn.6. It is the third brightest object in the night sky after the moon and Venus.7. The ISS travels at a speed of 4.791 miles per second, fast enough to go to the moon and back in a single day.Nasa space shuttle Endeavour (Getty)8. At that pace it orbits the earth approximately once every 90 minutes or 16 times in a 24-hour period, meaning it passes through 16 sunsets and sunrises per day. It passes over 90 per cent of the earth’s population in the course of its orbital path.9. The space station has more living space than a six-bedroom house, offering six sleeping quarters, a gym and a 360-degree bay window, but only two bathrooms. There are no chairs either —\u0026nbspastronauts taking time out to eat their three square meals a day of canned and dehydrated food have to float\u0026nbspgently in zero gravity.

So far 230 people from 18 nations have visited the ISS\u0026nbspand it has been continuously occupied since November 2000.11. Nasa’s Peggy Whitson set the record for the longest time living and working in space at 665 days on 2 September 2017, before returning to earth the next day.12. Astronauts aboard have completed 205 spacewalks since 1998 to carry out construction jobs, maintenance and repairs.ISS crew members\u0026nbspfrom the Vatican (Reuters)13. The physical toll all this takes on astronauts is considerable: crew members need to work out in the station\u0027s gym for at least two hours a day to mitigate the loss of bone and muscle mass and maintain the normal bodily health they would experience on terra firma.14. Four different delivery craft supply the crew with food\u0026nbspand equipment: Orbital ATK’s Cygnus, SpaceX’s Dragon, JAXA’s HTV and the Russian Progress.15. A Water Recovery System on board reduces the astronauts\u0027 dependence on these cargo craft by 65 per cent through recycling.

Oxygen is generated by a process of electrolysis: current captured from the station’s acre of solar panels is used to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen.17. The ISS\u0027s internal pressurised volume is 32,333 cubic feet, which is roughly equivalent to that of a Boeing 747 passenger jet.18. Software on board the ISS monitors 350,000 sensors checking in on crew health and safety. The station meanwhile carries 50 computers and eight miles of wire, enough to run around the perimeter of Central Park in New York City.19. The ISS provided the set for the first music video ever shot outside of our atmosphere when commander Chris Hadfield\u0026nbspmade a short film set to\u0026nbspDavid Bowie’s “Space Oddity” up there in May 2013.20. To mark its turning 20, the ISS is getting a Refabricator for a birthday present. The device is a hybrid recycler and 3D printer that melts plastics down so that new tools can be created.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Given its brightness, it is surprising it was not discovered a lot sooner.Nasa reveals more about mysterious \u0027alien spacecraft\u0027 asteroidThe swirling cloud of dust is a mere 8,000 light years from Earth is a vast system made up of two shockingly bright stars. The astronomers who found it named it Apep, after the Egyptian god of chaos, reflecting the intensity and vastness of the system but also the curling shape of the snake-god, which matches its whirling appearance.The two bright stars\u0026nbsporbit each other every hundred years or so, according to the researchers. As they do, a fast wind is thrown off, moving as fast as\u0026nbsp12 million kilometres an hour.Eventually the system is going to throw out a\u0026nbsplong-duration gamma-ray burst, according to the astronomers who found it. They can last just a couple of seconds but throw out as much energy as the sun will emit in its whole lifetime.The two stars appear to be rotating so fast that they are close to ripping each other apart. It\u0027s that fast rotation that scientists expect will mean that Apep is likely to throw out one of the GRBs\u0026nbspwhen its core collapses at the end of its life.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

great pyramids of Giza excavated by insectsClick to followThe IndependentThe mounds are waste points for soil and other matter excavated from a vast underground tunnel networkA termite super-colony which s an area the size of Great Britain\u0026nbsphas been under construction since the time of the pyramids in ancient Egypt, scientists have found.Researchers studying the vast landscape of 200 million cone-shaped mounds in northeast Brazil sampled soil from 11 locations and found that some began construction around 3,820 years ago.At around 2.5 metres tall,\u0026nbsp9 metres wide at the base, and spread across 230,000 square kilometres, it\u0026nbsprepresents a vast earth-moving endeavour –\u0026nbspbut the\u0026nbspmounds are not inidual termite nests.Instead, each one is a “waste point”\u0026nbspwhere termite workers dump soil and other matter excavated in the production of a vast subterranean tunnel network which they have used to traverse the landscape in search of food for millennia.“This is apparently the world’s most extensive bioengineering effort by a single insect species,” said Roy Funch of Universidade Estadual de Feira de Santana in Brazil, one of the authors of the report.“Perhaps most exciting of all – the mounds are extremely old – up to 4,000 years, similar to the ages of the pyramids.”Funch)The mounds are largely hidden from view by caatinga,\u0026nbspan assortment of thorny, desert-like vegetation unique to Brazil, and were only revealed to international scientists a few decades ago as the land was cleared for pasture.Now sampling from the oldest mounds has revealed the\u0026nbsparea is of comparable age to some of the oldest termite colony structures known to exist\u0026nbspin Africa, while others began construction around 600 years ago.They have developed in response to the drought-sculpted environment where the annual leaf fall is a boom time for harvesting food, punctuated by long periods where resources are more scarce.“These mounds were formed by a single termite species that excavated a massive network of tunnels to allow them to access dead leaves to eat safely and directly from the forest floor,” said Professor Stephen Martin, a social insect expert from\u0026nbspthe University of Salford and\u0026nbspanother of the authors.“The amount of soil excavated is over 10 cubic kilometres, equivalent to 4,000 great pyramids of Giza, and represents one of the biggest structures built by a single insect species.“It’s incredible that, in this day and age, you can find an ‘unknown’ biological wonder of this sheer size and age still existing, with the occupants still present.”The mounds are not the only entry points to the tunnel network – termites emerging at night to scavenge use dozens of smaller entrances between each waste point.Dying 700-year-old tree put on drip to save it from termitesTermites devour 10m rupees at bankAnts rescue injured workers during wars with termites, study findsBy inspecting mounts cut in half by\u0026nbsproad building projects, Professor Martin and colleagues also showed they lack the complex honeycomb of tunnels\u0026nbspusually associated with a termite nest.Instead each includes a single large central tunnel – measuring 10 cm across – connecting to the underground tunnel network and a series of horizontal “galleries” containing dead leaves or larvae.“The\u0026nbsptunnels\u0026nbspare\u0026nbspnever\u0026nbspleft\u0026nbspopen\u0026nbspto\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspenvironment,\u0026nbspruling\u0026nbspout\u0026nbsptheir\u0026nbspuse\u0026nbspas\u0026nbspa\u0026nbspventilation\u0026nbspsystem,” which left them puzzled as to how and why they had been created at such regular intervals.One theory is that each mound was from a competing colony, but when they transferred termites to a\u0026nbsprival neighbouring mound they were not swarmed and attacked.This\u0026nbspsuggests\u0026nbspthat they intermingle underground rather than competing, and\u0026nbspwhen they did the same test with termites taken from mounds 50km away the attack response was immediate.It suggests there must be shared pheromone scent cues used across\u0026nbsp the tunnel network which identify\u0026nbsplocal neighbours.Professor Martin and his colleagues suggest that these scent markers may exist at each mound point to\u0026nbspensure every termite uses it to remove soil and waste, leading to the equal spacing.Great Pyramid of GizaWonder of the Ancient WorldShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community

I got to dance twice, went up in a hot air balloon twice, and I loved it twice.”Silverton\u0027s dance partner Aljaž Škorjanecand said: “Every week going out there and delivering incredible performances, for someone that has never performed in her life I am so incredibly proud of you.

My mum was over visiting and pointed it out to me and was utterly shocked - so I checked it immediately.I thought she surely must’ve been mistaken but to my horror she was right. I think someone celebrating the life of a man who’s caused such terror is outrageous. And if it’s a joke, it’s not remotely funny.”Fellow resident Victoria Adcock, 42, said: “It’s obviously a prank. People being outraged are just playing into the prankster’s hands. They should just take it off and forget about it.”Claire Newbigging, 37, said: “I’ve not seen it first hand but it’s got to be a joke. I just don’t get it - would anyone really want to commemorate someone like Saddam Hussein?”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The Spanish Government has warned that it would reject May\u0027s Brexit deal unless changes are made with regards to Gibraltar.

We on this side of the House will always engage with professionals, with experts, with NGOs, we are not so proud we don’t think we can learn as we try to adjust universal credit for the benefit of everybody.“But that sort of language was wholly inappropriate and discredited a lot of what he was saying, but we look forward to working with experts in the area to make sure we get the right outcome for the people we want to look after.”Amber Rudd becomes sixth DWP secretary in less than three yearsEarlier in the debate, Justin Tomlinson, minister for family support, housing and child maintenance, said the government “disagreed” with Mr Alston’s findings, and defended universal credit as a “simplified benefit system that helps some of the most vulnerable people in society”.The remarks from the new work and pensions secretary\u0026nbspand Mr Tomlinson will exacerbate concerns raised in the UN report that ministers are “in a state of denial”\u0026nbspover the state of poverty in\u0026nbspBritain.\u0026nbspDelivering his findings on Friday, Mr Alston\u0026nbspsaid: “What I found in my discussions with ministers, is basically a state of denial. The ministers with whom I met have told me that things are going well, that they don’t see any big problems, and they are happy with the way in which their policies are playing out.“But it’s of course not the story that I heard in my travels through Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and in quite a few cities in England.”Theresa May appointed Ms Rudd as the new work and pensions secretary last week after Esther McVey stood down from the role on Thursday in protest at the prime minister’s Brexit deal.The decision prompted immediate criticism from opposition parties, who suggested Ms Rudd’s conduct when the Windrush scandal emerged – a fiasco that forced her to resign – should disqualify her from a top government job.Critics also warned that she\u0026nbspwas taking on a “poisoned chalice” as she becomes the sixth work and pensions secretary in less than three years.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It is the opposite of taking back control.”Caroline Lucas, former Green party co-leader,\u0026nbspadded: “The only solution is to take the final decision out of the hands of deadlocked politicians, away from the backroom deals, and give it back to the public with a People’s Vote.“On Brexit, it’s clear we have a parliament in stalemate that can’t deliver a clear choice for the future.

It would be a huge upset if they did not sign the agreement.The Daily Mail and the  could save us from a hard BrexitThere will not be any negotiation on the withdrawal agreement and its controversial backstop – that, as far as the EU is concerned, is settled. Many countries have said as much publicly, in the face of cabinet Brexiteers demanding a rethink.But the second part of the deal, the future relationship, is far from sealed. If anything, EU states believe their negotiators might have given away too much to Britain: some are unhappy about concessions given with little in return, and want quid pro quos like guaranteed access to British waters for their fishing fleets.If there are changes there, things could get even trickier for the prime minister at home – but these are real countries fighting for their own interests, not fantasy negotiating partners only committed to making things easy for the prime minister.None of the details for the summit are finalised yet, with an agenda set to be released later this week. We’re not sure at this point whether actual negotiation will take place at it, or whether it will just be a glorified rubber stamp. Brussels is known to favour the latter.I was on holiday during the Brexit chaos – what did I miss?Legally, the summit has to take place, because only the European Council – that is the 27 leaders meeting together in Brussels – can sign off the deal and make the political declaration about the future relationship.Those in Brussels and other EU capitals do not like being seen to “meddle” in British politics, precisely because they know how poorly they are perceived.They mostly stayed out of the referendum, they accepted the result, and they have mostly declined to call for a rerun or anything to that effect.But it is possible some may break the habit of a lifetime at the gathering and urge British members of parliament to back the deal. If they do not do it directly, they might apply pressure through other means – perhaps by warning of the prospect of no deal if it is voted down.This will be a difficult sell, however. Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, said as recently as last week that Brexit could be stopped if Britain wanted. If the deal is voted down, staying in is still an option. And there is clearly not a majority for a no-deal departure in the House of Commons.But despite conspiracy theories from both some Brexiteers and the odd\u0026nbspRemainer, everyone around the summit table will want a deal – just not necessarily at any cost.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

A thriving international trophy enterprise exists, with big game hunters paying thousands of pounds through legitimate companies for the privilege of killing iconic creatures. Lion trophy hunts have prices of up to \u0026pound20,000 and it costs up to \u0026pound60,000 to claim an elephant trophy.                Squirrel who thinks he\u0027s Tommy Cooper wins photographer top awardThe hunting lobby maintains that offering big game safaris to shooters helps conserve wildlife, bringing vital funds into Africa and ensuring wild landscapes are preserved. It sees enthusiasts from the UK following in the footsteps of colonial Great White Hunters of the 1930s to claim trophies, according to figures that show the large number of specimens have \u0026nbspbrought legitimately into the country in recent years.The Campaign to Ban Trophy Hunting says that over the last decade 2,500 trophies have been imported into the UK \u0026ndash with almost 400 from species with the highest status under endangered species regulations.\u0026ldquoTrophy hunting involves killing some of the most beautiful wild animal species on Earth simply for fun, says Mr Goldmsmith, Conservative MP for Richmond Park and North Kingston\u0026ldquoIt is not only damaging to the endangered species themselves, the evidence shows that importing the parts also provides cover for a brutal illegal trade. \u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoIn more ways than one, it therefore harms the communities that rely of wildlife for tourism income.

Around 300 rhino horns are known to have been exported by phoney trophy hunters between 2009-2014 alone.Britain\u0026rsquos status as global leader for wildlife and animal welfare is also under threat because of the lack of an import ban.He added: \u0026ldquoThe Government promised to ban lion trophy imports in 2015 in the wake of the Cecil scandal unless it saw significant improvements in the industry.\u0026ldquoThere have been very few if any changes but action has yet to have been taken here. Meanwhile, other countries such as Australia, France and the Netherlands have gone ahead and introduced their own import bans.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs says trophies can only be brought into the country under strict rules.\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoThe UK Government will not issue an import permit for a trophy unless the importer can show there has been no detrimental impact on endangered species and the trophy has been obtained from a sustainable hunting operation, said a Defra spokesman.

I\u0026rsquove been underwater a lot, and I\u0026rsquove seen a lot of animals.Having never seen one in person or even footage or photos of one before, I was quite incredulous and elated that such a creature existed.I know nature waits for nobody, and I couldn\u0026rsquot let this opportunity pass me by.Even the most articulate person in the world couldn\u0026rsquot describe that creature that we filmed.White Island is owned by Mr Buttle\u0027s family, and is famous for its active volcano and erse flora and fauna.Linsey Sala, a scientist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in California, said\u0026nbsppyrosomes\u0026nbspnear New Zealand and Australia reach up 45 to 60 feet long.

His favourite food was biscuits soaked in spirits.On Jumbos journey from London to the US, he needed a daily allotment of whisky to keep him calm.He also used to eat anything thrown at him by visitors, including childrens toys and coins - hundreds of which were found in his stomach after he died.Last year, Sir David Attenborough investigated the le of the elephant claimed to be the largest to have ever lived in a BBC documentary.Sir David said: “I’m going to look beyond Jumbo’s celebrity for the real elephant behind the myths.“How big was he in reality  And what is the truth behind the mysteries that surround his tragic death ”Sir David and his team were given unique access to Jumbo’s remains at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, shedding light on the unforgettable true story behind an amazing elephant.When the team analysed Jumbo’s bones, it discovered evidence of how his le in captivity damaged him physically.After finding an unusual layering of old and new bone in his hip, Dr Richard Thomas, from the University of Leicester, said: “He has many signs of stress and strain-related injuries.“They must have been incredibly painful for him but may have reflected the use to which he was put.”Often pictured giving rides to visitors at the zoo, it seems Jumbo may have been harmed by the ones who loved him most.And Jumbo had more than just a damaged hip.Dr Thomas added: “When we look at the knee we see all sorts of kind of changes in the bone that we wouldn’t really expect to see in an elephant his age. Remember Jumbo’s only  and still growing.”So Jumbo could have suffered from painful joint problems more associated with old age.Sir David concluded: “His bones are more like an elephant in its s or s.”PT Barnum claimed Jumbo was the largest African elephant on the planet, standing at around ft.But by analysing his leg bone, the team discovered he was around ft in at the time of his death.A typical wild African elephant of the same age measures around ft in.However, a crack in Jumbo’s leg bone reveals that he was still growing when he died.Dr Thomas said: “Male African elephants continue to grow until they are  so Jumbo had another  years of getting bigger.”He may not have been as tall as Barnum claimed, but according to Sir David: “He could have matched that claim had he lived.”Jumbo’s calm nature during the day was in contrast to his behaviour at night.Sir David said: “He would become possessed by terryingly violent rages in which he would smash the timbers of his enclosure.”Jumbo was also prone to hurting himself in his confusion, even breaking off both tusks on one occasion. When they grew back, he ground them down against the stonework of his enclosure.His keeper, Matthew Scott, is said to have given him whisky to try to calm him down.The zoo’s superintendent, Abraham Bartlett, was convinced Jumbo was suffering from musth, a natural condition affecting young male elephants when they become sexually mature. It can cause them to become extremely aggressive.But Dr Vicki Fishlock, a researcher in Kenya, disagrees.She argues that musth would have caused Jumbo to be violent towards his keepers, too.And as Sir David pointed out: “There is nothing in the historical records that Jumbo was ever violent towards people.”A new clue emerged when the team found evidence of malformed teeth when studying Jumbo’s skull.Dr Thomas said: “We can think of elephant teeth a bit like conveyor belts. They have six teeth but only one will be in wear on each side at any one time.“Another one will be coming in underneath to replace it at the time which that tooth falls out.”If a tooth does not wear down enough, it will not fall out and will block the new tooth, bending it out of shape. This would lead to terrible toothache.”And Professor John Hutchinson, from the Royal Veterinary College, believes his toothache could have been made worse by the sticky buns pushed through his bars by visitors to the zoo.”Sir David said: “Anyone who’s had toothache knows that it seems worse at night when you have no distractions, so maybe this is one of the explanations for Jumbo’s terrying nocturnal rages.”Dr Holly Miller, from the University of Nottingham, took samples from Jumbo’s femur and rib bones to discover more about the food he was eating.She said: “We’re definitely seeing some suggestion that he’s not getting the iety of diet that other elephants should.”In the wild, African elephants have a ied diet of grass, leaves, twigs and even bark. Dr Miller says the pathologies of Jumbo’s teeth show they were soft and coming through at the wrong angle because they were not being used in the right way.“They’re not being used to grind down the right food.According to a report at the time, his stomach was filled with English pennies, whistles, keys and rivets.It has been reported that Jumbo used to habitually eat coins which had been thrown into his enclosure - and the evidence supports this.Jumbo’s stuffed body was then kept at Tufts University in Massachusetts but was lost in a fire.Jumbo’s tail still remains, from which Dr Miller analysed hair to give a snapshot of his diet almost right before he died.It revealed a high amount of nitrogen, which suggests his body was under stress and was extracting as much nitrogen as possible from his diet to help repair it.In September , Barnum’s circus went to Canada to perform in St Thomas, Ontario. Written records show that Jumbo was suffering from a sort of wasting disease at this time.After the show, Jumbo and a small elephant called Tom Thumb were being loaded on to the circus train when a freight train came hurtling towards them.Accounts of what happened next dfer, with Barnum claiming Jumbo sacriced his own le by running towards the train to save his friend Tom Thumb.But Sir David found more clues on a visit to the Elgin County Museum in the town where Jumbo died.Curator Mike Baker showed him a photo taken shortly after the collision, saying: “You can see abrasions on his hide which match very nicely with the one good graphic from soon after the collision.”It shows the train coming up behind Jumbo, which would have caused the scrapes on his body.Examining the drawing, Sir David said: “That is the circus train with the box car that Jumbo was going to get into, and the locomotive would outrun him and hit him in the rear and that’s the end of poor Jumbo — not what Barnum said.”And with no evidence of fractures on the skeleton, he concludes the most likely cause of death was internal bleeding - leading to a tragic end to a sad and short le.Even after his death, Jumbo was not allowed to rest.He was displayed in a gala in New York and paraded for four years as a roadside attraction.Dumbo will be released in theatres in March .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I sense, like the recently axed Big Brother and The X Factor, it’s been living off its reputation for a couple of years.Enjoyable as it’s been, the basic issue with this run has been the lack of a central figure in the mould of Syed Ahmed, Katie Hopkins or the late, great Stuart Baggs to take the series by the scruff of the neck.Some have shown vague promise but the closest thing it’s had to an alpha bell-end is Captain Pangea himself, Kurran Pooni, who was marked out less by his all-round uselessness than by the wrist he broke arm-wrestling back at the house, and his insistence he was “ per cent stepping up as project manager” just before he  per cent stepped down.There was no dodging the bullet, though, last week, when Lord Sugar demanded he PM a marketing campaign “for a noo airline” with accompanying adverts “and a noo unorm as well”.Kurran wasn’t underselling the sense of destiny he felt at this responsibility. “Everything in my le has led to this moment,” he claimed, presumably ’cos he hadn’t done anything  up until that moment.The great thing about this task, though — like all the best Apprentice episodes — was that the laughs were shared round equally.So while advert director Kurran was recreating the Club Tropicana video on Southend seafront, Camilla and Jackie were designing a stewardess’s unorm for the party-themed Jet Pop that wouldn’t see the light of day eveneasyJet suddenly opened a brothel chain in Amsterdam.A horrible thought occurred, though, as she was market-researching at Heathrow.She’s not going to wear that thing pitching to  industry experts at BA HQ, is she  She bloody is, you know.She gave it the full doors-to-manual flirtation as well. So everyone’s mind was already in the gutter before Jackie finished the audience off with the news: “It’s very easy to wipe down, as well.”In the normal course of events, reducing Claude Littner to a helpless giggling wreck would be enough to lose any task.The other team, though, Typhoon, had contrived to come up with something almost as bad, Manage Air, a business-targeted operation whose corporate logo looked like a satanic pentangle and theme tune was AC DC’s Highway To Hell.There was a genuine sense of tension in the boardroom then, which would’ve been ruinedSugar had played it all for laughs.He didn’t, though. He let the contestants hang themselves with their own words before firing Kurran, who could leave with a sense of “job done”.He’s created a bit of Apprentice folklore, after all, and hopefully reminded everyone this show is far from dead.Naturally, in the final taxi scene, he also remained convinced of his genius, boldly declaring: “My advert was gold.”The first and possibly last time in his le where he’s not just  per cent wrong, he’s  per cent right as well.Glorious television.Dianne: “Stephen Fry.”The Time It Takes, Joe Lycett: “Sesame Street’s Big Bird lives in what street ”Oliver: “I don’t know.”Joe Lycett: “A bird in the hand is worth two in the what ”Jon: “Foot.”And Bradley Walsh: “Which former EastEnders star presents the Sky One series Extreme World ”Zoe: “Barbara Windsor.”CELEBRITY Hunted contestant and former Commando Johnny Mercer MP has faced a stark choice this past month.The eternal humiliation of being beaten by Chris and Kem, off Love Island, on the Channel  hide ’n’ seek game.Or two weeks in a confined space with a clearly smitten Kay Burley.Heroically, he chose the latter, enduring her attention and pet namewith the same sort of grit that probably saw him through three tours of Afghanistan.Then, last week, he sneaked off for an unscheduled visit to his we, Felicity, and Burley completely lost her s***.Lost it so badly, in fact, that she threw herself at the mercy of a passing bread truck driver, which led to the best update of the series: “Kay Burley is currently in a -ton lorry, on the M, between junction  and .”She was quickly grassed up, of course, then apprehended at the Warburton’s depot, without the need for a vet or a tranquilliser dart.But while it’s a poorer show without the old mad-whack, there’s still plenty of mileage left in this gripping series.AJ Pritchard is cornered in Shropshire, Olympic silver medallist Louis Smith has just been found hiding in his mate’s Jacuzzi showroomand Baldrick-brained duo Chris  Kemhave somehow given everyone the slip.But as for Johnny Mercer  He’s probably smuggling himself back to the Mouth of Hell fort, in southern Helmand, just for the relative peace and quiet. Paul Merson: “For me it’s six and a half of one and a dozen of the other.”Graeme Souness: “The only one with potential is Martial and Pogba.”Dion Dublin: “Liverpool are in second and a half gear.”And Charlie Nicholas: “Pogba’s either brilliant or a showpony. He played OK last week.”THIS week’s Doctor Who episode introduced us to the Demons Of The Punjab, who turned out to be nothing of the sort.They were just morbid sods who mope around the universe “honouring those who die alone”, like soldiers, holy men and Brendan O’Carroll on For Facts Sakes.No actual science-fiction storyline to speak of then.But that’s not really the point of this viewer-shedding series, which has already got on its high horse about sexism, Donald Trump, American segregationist racism, men giving birth and gun control.Kind of inevitable, then, that the BBC would eventually pour a bucket of its self-loathing sick all over the British Empire, via the partition of India in , with an episode that was every bit as historically powerful as Carry On Up The Khyber.The key dference, of course, was that Bungdit Din and his Burpers weren’t actually being used as a means of brainwashing children.Because If you were expecting Doctor Who to present the flip side of Britain’s relatively benign rule in India , then you’ll also be waiting for the episode where Jodie Whittaker lands in a Soviet gulag and starts teaching children about the brutal idiocy of Marxism.The BBC just doesn’t do anything other than its own left-of-centre view, these days – or irony by the sounds of things.As it’s just been revealed there’ll be no festive episode of Doctor Whobecause it’s “run out” of storylines.Run out  RUN OUT How the hell can a series run out of ideas when it hasn’t had any yet This Morning, Thursday: “Coming up, at quarter to , the rise of the penis filler, Doctor Ranj is here to answer your questions.”The show’s other penis filler, Martin Lewis, will answer them on Monday.IT seems almost wrong to single out just one programme from Sunday’s beautul Armistice Day coverage, but the year’s most meaningful TV awards should probably all go to BBC’s They Shall Not Grow Old, made by Peter Jackson, whose astonishing film gave a voice, laughter, tears and colour to some of the extraordinary men who survived the - trenches.Those of us who watched it, on Sunday, are unlikely ever to forget the experience. Those of you who didn’t, must catch up with it on the BBC iPlayer.Be sure, though, to watch it right through to the credits’ last chorus of Mademoiselle From Armentières, where it names the veterans who have all long since passed but whose memories and souls have never seemed more alive and unforgettable.“It’s quite hard to put your finger on it.”I’ll bet.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s quite unusual in a politician.But then I suppose Trumpo isn’t your usual politician.The US President was at it again in France.The idiotic French President Macron has dug up that idea about a European army, run by those genius minds at the EU.Those of us not keen on the EU always worried about this ridiculous notion — but we were told by pro-EU politicians that it would never happen. Another lie.Macron said Europe should have its own armed forces to guard against interference from Russia, China and — the USA.What a rude and stupid statement to make in the run up to Armistice Day.When French people would do well to remember that it was us — and the Yanks — that saved their benighted country.Sometimes I wonderit was worth it.Trump was right on the case, with one of his famous tweets.He des­cribed Macron’s comments as insulting.And he added thatit wasn’t for the Americans, the French would be speaking German by now. Quite right.And he’s right, too, that the EU nations do not pull their weight when it comes to funding the real alliance against our real enemies, Nato.They all like to snipe from the sidelines at the USA.And resent the Americans for their power, influence and success.And for bailing them out of the last war.But then they expect the yanks to spend vast amounts of money protecting them all.Germany, one of the richest countries in the world, spends only . per cent of its GDP on forces for Nato. That is as pathetic as it is typical.The French themselves spend only . per cent.We’re second only to the Americans in our spending — but even then I would argue that it’s not enough.Our Armed Forces have been cut to the bone over the past two decades.Would we be able to retake the Falkland Islands now,Argentina invaded  I doubt it.The truth is that Nato is the one alliance of which we should be glad to be a member.It is an alliance of largely civilised, largely democratic countries which has held fast against tyrants, despots and warmongers for  years.Most notably, of course, the Cold War, in which the Soviet Union was defeated without a shot being fired.But now Trump is getting a bit tired of Nato because the US always has to spend, spend, spend.And with the Europeans thinking again of having an EU army there are many who think the days of Nato are numbered.That would be a terrible mistake.An EU army to replace Nato It would be bureau­cratic, incompetent and short-funded.And it would surrender before you could say “Macron”.THE Lord Mayor of Sheffield is a ludicrous dingbat called Magid Magid who has been coughed up from somewhere deep in the bowels of the Green Party.Shortly before Remembrance Day he posted a publicity shot of himself online wearing a white poppy and a T-shirt saying “never again!”A good moment, then, to ask the vital question: Have you ever met someone wearing a white poppy who wasn’t a complete and utter moron We wear red poppies to commemorate the terrible loss of le in battle.People wear white poppies to commemorate themselves and their fatuous sensibilities.It’s called showing off.WAGES have risen at the fastest rate for almost a decade.They went up by nearly three per cent in the three months to September, compared to a year earlier – and about time, too.

And yet, that is where we appear to have ended up.First, under the transition, we shall explicitly be non-voting members for two years.As Brussels has spelt out with brutal clarity, the only change will be that Britain loses its Commissioner, its MEPs and its vote in Council.Then, under the backstop, that status, or something very like it, will be imposed on us in semi-perpetuity.Surely no one — Remain or Leave — can favour such an outcome.I have been arguing since polling day for moderation.I was prepared to accept any compromise, including European Free Trade Association and including Chequers, provided it restored the supremacy of our laws.But the purgatory that now beckons is surely, by any definition, worse than either staying or leaving.From the start, our objective was simply to reach a deal — any deal.Our negotiators, shell-shocked by the referendum result, approached the talks in a spirit of damage limitation.They never seriously contemplated walking away, and the other side smelt their desperation.To be fair, our officials were not helped by the noises coming out of Westminster.How would you expect EU negotiators to react when senior British politicians urge them to hang tough and force a second referendum We might view Tony Blair, John Major and Nick Clegg as has-beens but, believe me, they are seen in Brussels as men of influence.So we fell into a pattern. Britain would make some new concession in the hope of unlocking a deal.Then Brussels would pocket the concession and demand more and — incredibly — British Remainers would cheer.The UK agreed to hand over more money than was due accepted the EU’s absurd and illogical sequencing made an unconditional security guarantee offered to copy EU standards and promised not to be more competitive than its neighbours.Each time, the EU brusquely demanded “more movement”. Each time, Britain rushed to comply.Which brings us to where we are — facing colonial rule from Brussels, of the sort the EU imposed on Bosnia following the Yugoslav war.I am not one of those Brexiteers who half-favoured no deal all along.On the contrary, I was proposing moderation even before the vote, and have repeated that call many times since.But, paradoxically, our reluctance to countenance no deal has made such an outcome likelier.We have reached the point where the terms on offer are less attractive than either a World Trade Organization-based Brexit or a second referendum. This last point is critical.I suspect that two contradictory arguments will now be wheeled out before wavering MPs.Europhiles will be told that the deal, backstop and all, is better than “crashing out” on WTO terms.Conversely, Eurosceptics will be told thatthey don’t approve the deal, Parliament might vote to extend Article , thus imperilling Brexit.These two lines of argument can’t both be true, of course and, in reality, neither of them is.We’re invited to believe thatBoris Johnson and Jo Johnson, from opposite ends of the Brexit spectrum, both oppose the deal, it can’t be too bad. In fact, both Johnsons oppose it because it is a lamentable failure of statecraft.Boris was no Brexit headbanger: He came out for Leave only after the EU refused to give David Cameron any powers back.And Jo is no Remoaner: He has spent two years in Government trying to deliver a reasonable Brexit. If neither of them will back the deal, that tells us something.There is still time — just — to recover our position.As things stand, the backstop has no legal force.The moment it finds its way into a treaty, it will be binding. If any MPs oppose the current approach, now is their chance to act. There won’t be another.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The public was reassured our sovereignty would not be surrendered to any meaningful degree.The Tory and Labour leaders both knew this was a lie. But they kept quiet when signing us up in  and when holding the first referendum in .Voters were betrayed from the start. And the pattern was set.In  John Major signed the Maastricht Treaty, creating the EU, without risking the public vote that saw it initially rejected by the Danes and Irish.In  Tony Blair — who now shamelessly praises fork-tongued civil ­servants for hoodwinking eurosceptic ministers — feared he would lose a referendum on handing new powers to the EU. So he refused to hold it.His successor Gordon Brown, never big on honesty when a lie served him better, pretended this Lisbon Treaty was too insignicant to bother voters with.The EU is founded on deceit. “When it becomes serious, you have to lie,” says President Jean-Claude Juncker. Voters are bullied into reversing inconvenient referendums or denied a say at all.And so to Mrs May, the Brexit deal her Cabinet agreed last night and the revealing EU leak yesterday which makes crystal-clear Brussels’ intentions to keep us in its vice-like grip for ever.That plan being to lock us into its Customs Union for all time, unable to make our own trade deals, powerlessly swallowing its orders and obeying its rules.Our Government knows we cannot legally escape this central pillar of the EU — which we voted to “leave”, remember — without consent from Brussels that it will never give.This is not some minor afterthought, to be bargained away, which is why MPs rejected it in July. It is crucial to the reclaiming of our sovereignty which a .million majority including many Sun readers, voted for in .It is crucial to our post-Brexit prosperity. It looks crucial, too, to whether the deal lives or dies. Yet, knowing exactly what the EU intends for us, the PM still brazenly insisted yesterday that we WILL make our own trade deals.How, Mrs May  We cannot. You surely know it.Do not kid yourself no one is paying attention. The public has been sold a pup again and again. It has had enough.Come clean with Britain. This deal is not wholly without merit.

Men who take care of women, give compliments and know what they want. I will be waiting for you to take my innocence.”It also lists a series of rules for the process, stating that “documents of my virginity will be provided by local health authorities”, the buyer “also has the further possibility to check me up again with a doctor he trusts” and “we will spend  hours together at the hotel where the winner is staying”.Payton said she didn’t want to ask her parents, who are originally from South America, for any financial help and would “probably” never tell them.She said: “I think they would think it’s kind of stupid, I don’t think they would get angry, they would just ask me why I would do something like that.“I guess I’d lie . I would just say I got a job.”Dr Lauren Rosewarne, senior social scientist at the University of Melbourne and author of Intimacy on the Internet, said she didn’t see it as “either positive or negative”.She said: “At the end of the day it’s up to a woman how she uses her body, andshe wants to profit from selling access to her virginity that’s her choice.“I do think it says something about our culture that the quickest way for a woman to earn , upwards is to do this.“Just be careful."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000450356506-e1542576281474.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"prince charles prince louis official royal photos","story":"Doting grandfather Charles has a large smile on his face as he cradles Louis in the gardens of Clarence House.A shot featuring The Prince of Wales with his family also shows cheeky Louis squeezing his grandad’s face as they try to pose.The selection of images includes Charles at Highgrove feeding his prized Burford brown and Marans chickens.He collects their eggs every morning in his wellies and the chickens obediently follow him, ready for their breakfast.The images are part of a set to mark his th birthday, which was last Wednesday.Another shot shows Charles surrounded by his grandchildren Prince George, who sat on his grandfathers knee, Princess Charlotte, cuddled next to Camilla, as Prince Louis smiled in his mothers arms - although the Queen and Prince Philip were absent.The family gathered for the photo, which was taken by photographer Chris Jackson, on a bench in the gardens of Clarence House.One picture shows him sharing a laugh with Harry and William in full RAF regalia.Another picture shows him posing next to his beloved Aston Martin - which he converted to run on WINE instead of petrol.He said last month: They discovered they could run it on surplus English white wine, but also I hadn’t realized that they had mixed whey into it too.The engineers at Aston said, Oh, it’ll ruin the whole thing.I said, Well I won’t drive it then, so they got on with it and now they admit that it runs better and is more powerful on that fuel than it is on petrol.And also, it smells delicious as you’re driving along.The car is powered by a bioethanol fuel called E, which can be derived from a number of sources including surplus white wine, and is mixed with a small amount of petrol.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They want Britain to have a unilateral way out of the Irish backstop plan that could keep the UK in the customs union for many years otherwise.Allies of Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt and Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom say they could both quit by the end of the week unless Mrs May relents. But dfering tactics emerged among the rebel Cabinet group last night.Michael Gove has told friends he won’t now resign eventhe PM refuses ALL the Pizza Club’s demands. The Environment Secretary also thinks they have a greater chance of talking Mrs May out of agreeing a “single customs territory” with the EU as part of a joint vision for a future trade deal.Brexiteers fear the new phrase - in the far shorter Political Declaration that will accompany the orce deal - will spell an end to any hope of controlling our own trade deals where, and could be even worse than her Chequers plan for a soft Brexit.International Trade Secretary Liam Fox and Transport supremo Chris Grayling are also expected to sit tight now. The Pizza Club will try to meet today to draw up a plan of action, but by late last night no time had been set for the get together because of clashing diaries.One former Brexiteer minister, who has already resigned, told The Sun: “The only way to make your case heard by the PM is to put your job on the line. Dominic Raab and Esther McVey did that, but the others haven’t had the balls to yet and probably now won’t, so whatever they ask for is futile.”To the dismay of Brexiteers yesterday, Mrs May argued that the backstop plan to ensure the Irish border stays open wouldn’t workeither side could pull out of it.The PM told Sky News: “Just think aboutyou took out an insurance policy, andyou were coming up to the point where that insurance policy was being used, and suddenly people pull the plug on it for you  What would you think ”She added: “We agreed the withdrawal agreement in principle last week. The focus this week will be on the future relationship”.The PM also revealed she will fly to Brussels mid-week ahead of the summit to press the case personally for her vision of a future trade deal, pledging “an intense week” ahead. The draft Political Declaration that sets a course for the future relationship published last week was just seven pages long, as opposed to the orce deal’s  pages.But Mrs May also revealed she hopes she will be able to persuade round Brexiteer doubters by painting in a more complete vision. The PM argued: “It’s the future relationship that actually delivers on people’s concerns in the withdrawal agreement”.She also warned coup plotters who want to replace her as Tory leader to think again, saying: “It is not going to make the negotiations any easier, and it won’t change the Parliamentary arithmetic”.While admitting it has been “a tough week”, askedshe had considered stepping down, Mrs May said: “No, I haven’t”.The PM will mount a fresh bid today to sell her deal by saying it will halt EU migrants from being able to “jump the queue” to get into Britain. She will tell the CBI’s annual conference this morning: “Getting back full control of our borders is an issue of great importance to the British people”.Writing for The Sun online today, former Cabinet minister Priti Patel says of the current future trade deal blueprint: “The EU is tightening its grip on us and we get nothing – certainly no trade deal - in . This agreement effectively means that the EU has taken back control.”The DUP also called on the PM to renegotiate the backstop last night, arguing it splits Northern Ireland from the EU. Its Westminster leader Nigel Dodds said: “It is clear that it is time to work for a better deal which does not undermine the integrity of the United Kingdom”Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn will again rule out voting for Mrs May’s deal next month unless she deepens customs ties with the EU. In his own speech to the CBI, the Opposition boss say he would negotiate “a new comprehensive and permanent customs union”The Tories’ sticking plaster plan for a temporary customs arrangement, with no clarity on how long it will last and no British say, can only prolong the uncertainty and put jobs and prosperity at risk.Two opinion polls yesterday revealed Labour has opened up a three point lead over the Tories after days of party turmoil over Brexit. As the Conservatives descended again into a full blown civil war, an Opinium poll for the Observer found the Tories have dropped five points to % while Labour has gained three to stand on %.And a ComRes poll for the Sunday Express and Sunday Mirror showed Labour on % versus versus the Conservatives on %.Alongside her woeful and deeply unpopular -page withdrawal agreement was a much sketchier seven-page political declaration that outlined ambitions for our future trading relationship with the EU. It said very little.Before negotiations formally start, it is vital Mrs May gets a lot more from the EU. Without doing so, she almost certainly won’t get the numbers to pass her Commons vote.Despite Mrs May’s stark failings, the Tories must also avoid imploding.A leadership battle will be bloody and even Tory Brexiteers are split. Dominic Raab, who resigned last week as Brexit minister, yesterday admitted he would back Mrs Maythere was a vote of no confidence... What does thatsay about the viability of a coup And voters, already irritated by Tory squabbling, will punish themthey are dragged to the polls yet again.The terrying prospect of Jeremy Corbyn in No, with all the damage Britain’s first Marxist PM could unleash, should be enough to stop the Tories from tearing themselves apart.To unite her party, the PM must start showing some energy, zeal and optimism about Britain.Our future, and hers, depends on it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

just minutes into her public debut in the job. Amber Rudd tore into a devastating UN report that accused ministers of being in denial about their mean-spirited and callous welfare reforms - notably six-in-one benefit Universal Credit. UN special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights Philip Alston called welfare cuts a political choice. And he declared: Government policies have inflicted great misery unnecessarily, especially on the working poor, on single mothers struggling against mighty odds, on people with disabilities who are already marginalised, and on millions of children. But Ms Rudd - who praised Esther McVey after replacing her on Friday - prompted shouts of anger as she branded Mr Alstons comments wholly inappropriate and extraordinarily political. Speaking today just  minutes into her first Commons QA of her job, the Work and Pensions Secretary said: Ive read it over the weekend.  I must say I was disappointed to say the least by the extraordinary political nature of his language. We on this side of the House will always engage with professionals, with experts, with NGOs. We are not so proud we dont think we can learn as we try to adjust Universal Credit for the benefit of everybody. But that sort of language was wholly inappropriate and actually discredited a lot of what he was saying.  Ms Rudd was forced to quit as Home Secretary after inadvertently misleading a Commons committee. But she was brought back into the Cabinet after showing keen loyalty to Theresa May. Her comments today came after Labours Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary attacked Tory ministers for being entirely dismissive of the UN report. Margaret Greenwood warned the government has been determined to press ahead with rolling out Universal Credit despite warnings disabled people could end up in destitution.  She called on Ms Rudd to end the governments state of denial and stop the rollout. The UN rapporteurs report said the roll out of the Universal Credit treated “claimants like guinea pigs” and threatened to “wreak havoc in real peoples’ lives.” The Mirror are demanding a halt to the expansion of Universal Credit and for a review to take place. We say there are three options:Redesign UC to be fit for purpose Axe it in favour of the old systemUC is unfixable Introduce a brand new systemSign our petition to stop the rollout of Universal Credit across Britain and to replace it with a fairer system by signing our petition.

Running hard to avoid falling over is a bad choice for a Prime Minister who’ll know privately her unpopular, chaotic plan is a far worse deal for Britain than remaining in Europe. Surrendering sovereignty to minimise economic damage is May’s cowardly compromise. A braver PM would denounce forcefully the cost-free easy Britannia bonanza fabricated by fibbers Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage, then champion another referendum. The uncomfortable home truths about stockpiling medicines and food as well as troops on the streets put into perspective the Leavers’ mythical poundmillion a week saving promise on the side of a bus. Timid Theresa May doesn’t come clean because she’s afraid of insulting five Cabinet Brextremists organising against her including Michael Gove and a Liam Fox suddenly believing any deal’s better than no deal.  She might survive a no-confidence vote of Conservative MPs in the coming weeks. But May is not strong and stable. She is living to die another day and her botched plan is barely worth the name. So a sovereign Parliament gains a glorious opportunity to take back control next month. Jeremy Corbyn’s immediate task is to convince his Westminster waverers the choice isn’t May’s mess or accidentally crashing out of Europe without a leline. Tory Leaver Zac Goldsmith declaring he’d have voted Remain in place of May’s mayhem. Brexit paymaster Arron Banks said last Sunday he’d do the same. They are rats abandoning the Quitter ship. The , who marched in London for another referendum were mocked as the longest Waitrose queue in history yet Ukip MEP Patrick O’Flynn attracting just four people to his protest outside No  was another sign which camp has the momentum. Time is running out but anything is possible before March  – an extension before departure, a referendum, a general election. The only certainty is the future’s unpredictability.

But Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the Prime Ministers language was offensive and disgraceful. The SNP leader said: That the case for Brexit has been reduced to such a miserable and self defeating bottom line is depressing in the extreme. Lets lt our sights higher than this.Actually, the more I think about it, the more offensive jump the queue  is as a description of a reciprocal right of free movement. Really disgraceful. Businesses in sectors which rely on low-skilled workers, such as hospitality, manufacturing and the care industry, have raised concerns about the impact of restrictions on labour. CBI director-general Carolyn Fairbairn said firms needed time to adapt to the seismic sht in the immigration system. And NHS recruiters fear the new system could cut off the supply of overseas nurses and carers. Federation of Small Businessesnational chairman Mike Cherry said: One in five small employers rely on staff from the EU. More than one in three say finding the right staff is currently holding back growth.If theyre lumbered with complex paperwork and a surcharge to bring in EU staff post- Brexit , that will cause a signicant drag on the billions they contribute to the economy each year.Danny Mortimer, NHS Employers chief executive, warned the planned changes could cut off the supply of nurses.  We know we need to increase the number of UK trained health professionals, especially nurses, he said. The recommendations on salary thresholds and having no need for a so called lower skilled, lower wage, route into the UK would cut off the supply of nurses from overseas and there would be no mechanism for employing people into care worker roles. It would be completely unacceptable to allow vital social care services to close under the strain of not having the people required to provide the necessary care. Downing Street defended the plans. Theresa Mays Cabinet has signed off a -page draft Brexit deal with Brussels - and it has enraged Tories. Here are some of the reasons why:The transition period can be extended - and we dont know how long for Goods face being checked between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK We need the EUs permission to quit the backstop European courts will still have a big hold on the UKFOR THE FULL GUIDE CLICK HEREAsked whether Mrs May regarded EU nationals currently working in the NHS and other public services as having jumped the queue , the PMs official spokesman said: We have always been clear of the important contribution which EU citizens make to our economy and to public services.The point the Prime Minister is making is that we wish to have a global system where peoples skills are the basis on which they are able to work in the UK. At the moment, we have two systems in place - one for people coming to the UK from outside the EU and one for people coming out under the rules of free movement. Its a fact that people coming under the system of free movement dont need a visa and those from outside the EU do.

Staff at the universitys school of journalism have reportedly been warned writing words capped up could frighten the students into failure. Teachers are also reportedly being told to avoid the use of the word dont and negative instructions. A memo reportedly says lack of clarity when explaining tasks can lead to anxiety, adding that staff should also avoid the use of capitals. Lecturers are instead being told they should write in a warm and helpful tone. According to The Express, a memo says: Despite our best attempts to explain assessment tasks, any lack of clarity can generate anxiety and even discourage students from attempting the assessment at all. The memo says to avoid the overuse of do, and, especially, DONT. One staff member reportedly said they used upper case letters for emphasis. But according to reports, the university said its guidance was based on best practice from the latest teaching research. A tweet posted by the university today said it hadnt banned capital letters, but a statement said it is best practice not to write in all capital letters. Professor Margaret A House OBE, Vice-Chancellor at Leeds Trinity University, told .“At Leeds Trinity University we support our students to be the very best they can be. We’re proud to offer a personal and inclusive university experience that gives every student the support to realise their potential.“We follow national best practice teaching guidelines and the memo cited in the press is guidance from a course leader to academic staff, sharing best practice from the latest teaching research to inform their teaching.For every assignment, academic staff have an ‘unpacking’ session with students so the students are clear on what is expected. The majority of universities do this. It is also about good communication and consistent style. For example, it is best practice not to write in all capital letters regardless of the sector. “We are absolutely committed to enhancing and enriching the student learning experience at Leeds Trinity, where staff and students are a name not a number.We support students to achieve their full potential, and we are proud that this is reflected in the University’s employability statistics with % of our graduates in employment or further study within six months of graduation, and also in our very successful alumni community.”  Last month,reported that sign language clapping is being encouraged over regular clapping at The University of Manchesters student union to avoid triggering anxiety. The University of Manchester Students Union passed the resolution to encourage the British Sign Language version at student union events at the first Senate session of the academic year on September , according to student newspaper the Mancunion. It was argued that the loud noise of traditional clapping and whooping pose an issue to students with anxiety or sensory issues.

Edward wanted to ensure his guests were fed well and any visitors to Sandringham were required to sit on the device and be weighed upon arrival and departure to seethey had put on pounds during their stay. If the royals Christmas food is anything like that of the average Brit, everyone will be putting on a few pounds.  Seward also spoke of how unusual it was for the Queen to extend an invitation to a family member of an in-law. “It is unusual for an outsider to be invited, but the royal family does change, she told Grazia. “I’m sure the royals will do everything in their power to make Doria feel at home.’” The royal family usually spends both Christmas and New Year at Sandringham House and have done so since , when Windsor Castle was being rewired causing the royals to relocate.  On Christmas Eve, the family lay out their gts to each other on trestle tables and exchange them at teatime.Presents are usually cheap and fun.

Chloe claims that whenever she posted something on Instagram, Basra would copy them within hours, using the same poses, clothes and wording, reports the Daily Record. In a horrying twist, the mimicry even includes photos Chloe posted when her dad died. When Chloe and her big sister, Linzi, looked further into what was happening, they discovered hundreds of the bizarre photos.  It was claimed that Basra even copied Chloe’s Instagram tag of ChloeCowanxo with her own, HoneyBasraxo. On Monday, Linzi took to Facebook to warn others about the dangers of social media. The -year-old, from Glasgow, who posted more than  pictures to back her claims and said the police have been notied, wrote: “Don’t even know where to start with this but just want to let people know the dangers of social media.  “My sister Chloe is at Dundee university and another girl living in Dundeehas been reenacting her le on Instagram for almost  years. “This girls behaviour is to the extreme of reenacting videos of a photo album that Chloe posted of my dad who past away . “This girl doesn’t follow my sister on social media and had made a fake account.”  And she explained that while “imitation is flattering” Basra’s campaign had gone “too far, adding: “Her behaviour is not ok and I just wanted this out in the open for people to be aware of just how scary social media can be. “Imitation is flattering but this is just too far.” Linzi also claimed to have informed the police about Basra. Friends of the two sisters also reacted to the story which began to emerge on Sunday evening. Linzi’s pal Nathan McNaughton wrote: “I cannot understand the reasoning behind this at all... It’s completely unhealthy! Like most people I’m guilty of copying someone’s style from time to time but this just isn’t the same thing! Hope your sister is okay!

Just hours earlier, dad Sunny had been putting Khadijah in her car seat when the flesh on her hands and legs started blistering.By the time they got to hospital, the blisters had spread all over her body.  She was rushed straight into theatre and doctors started pumping her with fluids and antibiotics, while Sunny and we Nida sat in a room desperately waiting for updates.During the agonising wait, doctors came in and said Khadijahs heart had stopped but they had managed to restart it. However, they warned she did not have long to live. That’s when we started phoning family to come, Sunny said. Tragically Khadijahs condition rapidly deteriorated and despite doctors attempts to resuscitate her, she died with her parents by her side. The day before, they had spent a lovely day out at a park, but Khadijah didnt seem well so they took her to hospital.The staff thought it was a virus and sent her home, Sunny added. However, the next day we Nida was convinced something was seriously wrong with her daughter and they knew they needed to take her back.Sunny and Nida, who have three sons aged eight, five and three, are still coming to terms with the sudden death of Khadijah, who was also born with a complex heart condition. Just last month, Sunny stood for hours next to a billboard in Birmingham showing the final photo of him and Khadijah as a thank you to Birmingham Childrens Hospital and the care they gave her. People reacted by calling Sunny an inspiration and a brave man with a good heart.  Paying tribute to Khadijah, Sunny said: The boys know their sister is in heaven. Even our youngest points to the sky and says up when we talk about her. Khadijah was a little busy body, very talkative and lively. She loved babies, always wanted to be mum when she was playing. And she was very strong and resilient because she went through so much. She had a fighting spirit few adults have. Now, the Erdington dad has gone a step further - by taking aid out to Syrian refugees in Lebanon.  Its been six months since we lost our daughter Khadijah and, although the pain will never go away, its moments like this that are part of the healing process, he told Birmingham Live. When she passed away, we had lots planned like charity dinners, appeals and aid trips and I said to my we shall we cancel everything  And she said no you have to carry on, these people need your help. So thats what weve done. Sunny runs ISA Foundation, a charity that delivers aid where its most needed. He and his team helped , people in Lebanon earlier this month, mostly thanks to donations that have come in via Green Lane Mosque in Birmingham.  This is the seventh time weve been out there to support the Syrian refugees displaced from their country, said Sunny, a former policeman who runs a security and logistics firm. Theyre still staying in makesht shelters no-one expected them to be there for three to four years. Now that winter is coming, we went to support them with donations of food, winter clothing and fuel for their heaters to help them survive the harsh winter. He added: The temperatures get very low, our winter is nothing compared to there. And the children are just in slippers and flipflops. They dont even have shoes and socks and theyre living in mud.  Our dogs live in better conditions in their kennels here than those refugees do. The area where they visited is hard to reach so the last time these refugees received aid was when the ISA Foundation visited them last year. Its heartbreaking, really emotional, said Sunny. I have to wear sunglasses otherwise theyll see me crying all the time.  Theres a little girl who was born in the camp and has Downs syndrome. Shes walking now and she came running over to me. She looks a bit like Khadijah. Her parents dont know about her condition and what lies ahead for them. I spoke to a widow with four kids whose father was shot by a sniper in the war. She says she hasnt the courage to tell them their father has died so she just tells them hes making a long journey. Its so emotional.

The woman, who did not wish to be named, told the Daily Mirror: “I’ve never been so low in my whole le. “A few months ago I was going to kill myself and my son because I couldn’t deal with it. “But when I go and pick my boy up from school and he smiles at me, it builds me and I think, I can’t do that to him - I’m not a killer.  “I’ve been to the doctor and I’m on antidepressants and they’re helping but I feel like I’m just in a nightmare. “Every month my money comes in and within the week its gone. And I dont have anything for the next three weeks, Ive got nothing to feed my son.” When she phoned the DWP to tell them about her situation, they told her to contact Citizens Advice who would tell her where to get food. She continued: “I’ve not paid electricity for a while. I go to a food bank down the road, and going in there makes me feel like I’m the worst person, the worst mum. I live day by day. I don’t eat breakfast, I just try and get enough food for an evening meal. “I’ve even thought about selling my body. I haven’t done it up to now but I don’t see any change, I don’t know what  to do.”  The heartbroken mum is currently looking for work but struggles to find a position that works around school hours. I’m hoping I can get something, in the meantime I’m always just so angry and sad.” After fleeing a violent and emotionally abusive relationship, she is now stuck in a new nightmare thanks to Universal Credit which leaves her “unable to provide for my son”. The mum-of-one was initially told she could access an advance payment of around pound when she needed it and then pay back in her monthly payments. However, after taking some money from it while waiting for her first payment, her access was revoked, leaving her without any financial security. “When they told me I couldn’t access it, I had nothing. I went to bed hungry that night. You just feel like nobody cares,” she said.  “The old system was perfect, I had enough money to pay my bills and buy food. I had no issues - I’d say I’m down at least pound per month on the new system. “Now I’m always thinking,I had pound, I could get so much food with that money and people just throw that around on coffee or whatever like it’s nothing.” A DWP spokesperson said: “The reasons why people use food banks are complex, so it’s wrong to link a rise to any one cause. Mental health is a key priority and we’re committed to ensuring people get the support they need, which is why we’re spending a record poundbillion this year in England. The Mirror are demanding a halt to the expansion of Universal Credit and for a review to take place. We say there are three options:Redesign UC to be fit for purpose Axe it in favour of the old systemUC is unfixable Introduce a brand new systemSign our petition to stop the rollout of Universal Credit across Britain and to replace it with a fairer system by signing our petition. “Once a budgeting advance has been awarded, a further advance cannot be awarded whilst the repayments are being made. This is to protect the claimant building up arrears. Budgeting advances are available to help cover essential needs and ensure that claimants have support straight away.” The Mirror has launched a campaign to halt a major rollout of Universal Credit before it hits million families from July . Our Stop the Universal Credit Cruelty campaign sets out three options: redesign UC to be fit for purpose axe it in favour of the old systemUC is unfixable or introduce a brand new system.

The -year-old killer was handed five le sentences without the possibility of parole for murdering we Shanann, , along with their daughters Bella, four, and Celeste, three. Watts cried and shook in court as he listened to Shananns father, Frank Rzucek, speak about how his pregnant daughter and granddaughters lives were taken by an evil, heartless monster who took their bodies out like the trash. Frank said: God only knows what happened that night but le will never be the same. They had all their lives to live. They were taken by a heartless one, taken by an evil monster the heartless monster. You took them out like trash - you disgust me.  They were loving and caring people. You may have taken their bodies from them, but you have never taken the love they had for me you monster. You heartless monster you have to live with this vision every day of your le. You have no heart or feelings - prison is too good for you. Shananns mother also spoke to the court and addressed Watts, in part saying: Your faithful we trusted you, your daughters trusted you. I have no idea who gave you the right to take their lives, but I know God and his mighty angels were there at that moment to bring them home to paradise. Not only did you take your family of four, you took your own le. I want the world to know our daughter and her children were so loved by us. Watts parents Ronnie and Cindy also made a statament. It read: We are not here to ask for leniency we are not condoning or tolerating the crime that occurred and the pain caused we join in our daughter in law and grandchildrens family in saying this should never have happened. Theyaccept their son has done this they accept their son chose to plead guilty. They appreciate he is given the opportunity to serve this sentence.  It is not enough to make up for what he has done. Cindy Watts continued: This is something we will never get over, we will always mourn the loss of our family. I am still struggling to understand why and how this tragedy occurred. To my son Chris I have known you since the day you were born. You were a good friend, brother, father and son. I have loved you from the beginning and we still love you now. This might be hard for some to understand how I can sit here and tell you we are heartbroken. We cant imagine what could have led us to this day but we love you. As your mother Chris, I have always loved you and still do. I hate what has happened, we are struggling to understand but we will remain faithful as your family. We love you and we forgive you son. The court heard how Shanann was strangled to death, while his young girls were smothered. The court heard how Bella had fought for her le and bit her tongue during the struggle against her father.Imagine the horror in Bellas mind as her father took her last breaths away, a prosecutor said at Mondays sentencing, adding that Bella fought back for her le. Judge Marcelo Kopcow: This is perhaps the most inhumane and vicious crime that I have handled out of the thousands of cases that I have seen. Watts pleaded guilty to nine counts in total - including three counts of first degree murder after deliberation, two counts of first degree murder - a victim under  in a position of trust, one count of first-degree unlawful termination of a pregnancy and three counts of tampering with a deceased human body.  Speaking at a plea hearing where Watts pleaded guilty in exchange to avoid the death penalty, Judicial District Attorney Michael Rourke said: He deserves a le sentence for each and every act on top of each other. It was important that each of those beautul human beings was respected in that sentence. Watts buried his we in a shallow grave and stuffed his dead daughters in oil tanks where he worked, officials previously said. Their bodies were discovered days after the trio were reported missing from their home in Frederick, Colorado. After the trio vanished, Watts made a tearful TV plea to find them. Days later, on August , he was arrested but denied he had killed them.  But things then took a sinister turn and he repeatedly changed his story to police. He claimed that his we had strangled their daughters in revenge after he revealed he was having an affair and wanted to split. He allegedly told detectives that he flew into a rage and strangled Shanann after catching her in the act on a baby monitor screen. But police rejected his story and charged him with three counts of first-degree murder.

Local reports say that despite an exhaustive search operation in Barron County, as well as more than , leads being investigated by local and federal law enforcement, there are still few real clues as to what happened to Jayme after her parents deaths.  Sherf Chris Fitzgerald said: While  days has past, there is still hope in this department on this case and the community support and prayers that we have been given continues to fuel our drive and determination to bring Jayme home. Thank you all for your support and prayers and again there is a tip out there that will solve this case and bring Jayme home. Investigators believe Jayme was inside the home when her parents were killed.  In a  call a disturbance can be heard in the background, according to US news reports. A police dispatcher told investigators that while no one spoke on the  call, voices could be heard yelling in the background. The dispatcher called the number back and got Denise Closs voicemail. The girl, who was immediately ruled out as a suspect and runaway, was missing by the time officers arrived just four minutes after the call was made.

The -year-old agricultural vehicle shop owner wanted to make sure his penis was normal, he claimed. He filmed male customers on four occasions between May last year and June this year, saying his insecurity stemmed from the fact that he was not having sex with his partner. But he was told in court that he should have just gone on the internetthat was his concern. It happened in French supermarket chain E. Leclercs shop in Vire, a town in the Calvados department in the region of Normandy, northern France.  The man, who cannot be named for legal reasons, told authorities: I wanted to compare myself to other men. The hidden camera was discovered by the supermarkets security officer three months ago and he then reported the incident to the shops management and local police. It was not dficult for authorities to identy and locate the suspect as he had reportedly filmed himself by accident as well as the interior of his car. According to police, the -year-old had been questioned for a similar incident one year ago. The search carried out at his home led to investigators finding more videos of men in the toilet. The man explained that he was going through a rough patch as, according to his testimony, he was no longer having sexual relations with his partner. He claimed that this made him feel uncertain about his manhood and that he was suffering from feelings of helplessness.

It was the worst injury situation since I have been at Aberdeen.“With Mark, he had done all the pre-season work so to then get injured in a pre-season game sticks in the throat a wee bit.“But that is

What’s more, eventhey don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in , a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now,  years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 37","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Sir,It is always a delight when a letter awakens a landowner.James F Lithgow#s insult about ‘blow-ins’ is a typical trait. I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception. May I please ask your readers to seek out their pipers and encourage them to represent their school as a piping quartet,not as a full band, at the next Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships The championships are organised annually by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute. It is our country’s most pressing public health issue – one we must address now, collectively.Scotland has made a lot of progress over the past  years, including a guarantee of a year’s post-diagnostic support, better education and training for staff in health and social care and better standards of care for people with dementia in hospitals.There is still, however, an unacceptable gap between national policy and dementia care and support in our communities.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

Star lost possession in midfield and Connor Crawford’s clearance was closed down by the Kings Park forward whose shot beat Kalache from the edge of the box and the hosts took a - lead on the hour mark.This visibly knocked the confidence of the Star team and Kings added a second goal when poor play again from Star trying to break gted possession to the hosts and once again their striker was on hand to make it - and give Star a mountain to climb in the last twenty minutes.Star didn’t give up however and could have been back in the game when the ball fell to Gregor Peacock in the box, the ing striker hit the shot and the ball was saved by the Kings Park goalkeeper.Kyle Selfridge went close to claiming a late leline but his free kick from twenty yards cannoned off the bar and the game finished - to the home side.The Star management team were disappointed as that’s the first time the Lochgilphead side have failed to score in the league in more than two years.On Saturday November  Red Star play host to Campbeltown pupils in what looks like another tough league match.

Fiona Coughtrie, , and Stephen Thomson, , were caught metres away from targeted store Aldi in Prestwick after pinching the generator on June . The blundering thieves made attempts at a getaway but were snared a short distance away at the traffic lights on Ayr Road. Ayr Sherf Court heard the stolen electrical device was worth pound.. Defending Coughtrie, of Galloway Avenue, solicitor Tony Currie said: “Slightly unusual as I don’t think either of them have a caravan. “It requested both of them to carry the item out of the shop. “This is an offence that was against a background of a chaotic lestyle and drug issues.” Mr Currie explained the pair were then caught “literally straight at the traffic lights”. Sherf John Montgomery commented the theft attempt was “rather pathetic”. Defending Thomson, of Elba Gardens in Ayr, solicitor Ian Gillies said: “Mr Thomson and Miss Coughtrie were living together but they’ve decided to part – and I don’t think that’s a bad thing. They’ve been getting themselves involved in drug-taking. “Mr Thomson could do with some support.” Sherf John Montgomery told the pair: “You both tell me that you want to change – well I can provide you with an opportunity to do that with a community payback order. “If you don’t comply with the terms of the order you’ll be brought back before me and we know what will happen.” Coughtrie and Thomson were ordered to be under supervision for  months.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnCourtsPrestwickAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13471434.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_emp_ayp_080918AyrCurrie_09JPG.jpg","title":"ayr rugby club near move","story":"NewsAyr Rugby Club near move to new town centre base at Dam Park as they prepare to sell Millbrae homeThe Millbrae men, who top the Tennents Premiership, are in advanced talks to sell their Millbrae home and move to Dam Park in Ayr town centre.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  OCT NewsDam Park could play host to Ayr Rugby Club as soon as  \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBooming Ayr Rugby Club are nearing a deal to sell their Millbrae home and move to the town centre. Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as .

Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13594714.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_ayr-u.jpg","title":"ayr united appear itv show","story":"NewsAyr United appear on ITV show The Chase as Bradley Walsh asks questionsThe Honest Men appeared as an answer on hit ITV show The Chase yesterday .Share.\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"facebook|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"messenger|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"twitter|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"whatsapp|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"linkedin|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"flipboard|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"email|share|\"ByLochlin Highet:,  NOV NewsThe Chasers \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAyr United have been flying high at the top of the Championship - and now theyve made prime time national TV.

general inspection since .MP John Lamont believes the figures show the Scottish Government is failing Borders pupils.He said: ldquoParents in the Borders will find it shocking that one in five schools have been waiting more than a decade for an assessment by Education Scotland.\"While I understand that inspections can be stressful for teachers, they need to be taking place more regularly than they are.\"Inspections are vital for parents to make an informed choice about their childrsquos education.\"Many young families look at these reports before a potential move and with so many out of date in the Borders, it can only be putting people off.\"But our hard-working teachers are also being let down because inspections provide important feedback and advice.\"Among the  local schools which havent been fully inspected in the past decade are Hawick High School , Priorsford Primary , Stow Primary , Walkerburn Primary , Broomlands Primary , Fountainhall Primary , Jedburgh Grammar Schooland Eyemouth High .Its also been nine years since Berwickshire High was inspected, eight years since Earlston High, seven years since either Peebles High or Kelso High were visited and five years since

regularly after the agency was criticised last year.Mr Lamont MP added: \"Education is meant to be the Scottish Governmentrsquos number one priority, so you would think there would be enough resources

more than , bin collections each year.Figures released through a freedom of information request show that over the last five years, council bin crews have failed to empty more than , bins from around , households.Furthermore, the number of bins missed each year has been rising since , when , bins collections were missed.Three years later, in , that number had risen to ,, and already this year , bins have been missed.Opposition councillors have lined up to criticise the figures, particularly in the wake of allegations that Scottish Borders Council is considering moving to three-weekly bin collections when the budget is proposed in February of next year.Hawick and Denholm councillor Clair Ramage said: ldquoBin collection is a very emotive subject and as councillors we receive many complaints over this very issue.ldquoTo see that there has been a rise in the number of missed bin collections is extremely alarming and has to be investigated as a matter of urgency but this is only the tip of the iceberg.ldquoIn the last month we have been informed that Scottish Borders Council is considering tri-weekly uplts, a change that I am completely opposed to.ldquoAt the moment Scottish Borders Council is struggling as we have seen householders use their recycling bins for general waste when their general waste bins are full.ldquoThis creates other problems, the recycling vehicles are then contaminated with general waste and have to pay penalties to the processing company.ldquoIf bi-weekly lts are not working then tri weekly lts will create even more problems, for example fly tipping.ldquoI realise that budgets are tight but the combination of missed bin collections resulting in rubbish spilling over encouraging vermin is not something that as a community we should accept.Hawick and Hermitage councillor Watson McAteer also commented: \"I do not recall missed bin collections being a statistic that is regularly shared with councillors. Perhaps the fact that for whatever reason , bins have failed to be collected explains why this is not on public record.ldquoI am regularly receiving complaints from constituents who find their bins still full on the pavement after the collection date.ldquoWhile of course there will always be occasions when the council have no control of the situation the figures being produced certainly challenge the current collection policy.ldquoCan you imagine the problems this would causethree-weekly collection was to be introduced  I for one will not support such a move and would ask the council to explain to council tax payers why this problem exists and what they are doing to resolve it.According to data collected by the Local Government Benchmarking Framework, which is a comparison network for Scottish councils, . per cent of Scottish Borders are satisfied with their local refuse collection.However, this is below the Scottish average of . per cent and is the second lowest of the rural and island councils that Scottish Borders Council is grouped with.The council also spends pound. per premises on waste disposal, which is below the Scottish average of pound..Leader of the opposition and Tweeddale East councillor Stuart Bell said that Scottish Borders Council officers work hard to recty issues, but residents need to be aware of how to report missed bin collections.He said: ldquoI will be interested in the councilrsquos conclusions on the long term trend. As I recall there has been a gradual introduction of food waste collections into the larger communities in the last few years, so the number of total collections may have increased at the same time as the number of missed collections has increased.ldquoBut I am concerned to see the detail of missed bin collections. I had expected, and can see, that the number of missed collections is higher in the winter months when the teams can have dficulty getting round in the snow, but it is worrying that the level of missed collections never drops below  in any one month. ldquoThe public needs to know that there is a very easy mechanism of reporting missed collections on the councilrsquos website and, in my experience, refuse and recycling staff at Scottish Borders Council do follow-up on issuesthere is a systematic cause.A spokesperson for Scottish Borders Council said that the number of bins left unemptied each year is actually very small compared to the number the council collection.The authorityrsquos waste management service says it collects around .m bins each year, meaning the number of missed bins equates to less than half a per cent.The spokesperson said: ldquoThe number of missed bin collections over the last five years will be dependent on a number of factors including: the provision of a new weekly food waste service to around , households in  access issues due to obstruction and road closures vehicle breakdowns adverse weather service error an increase in the number of new homes which bins are collected from each year and bins not being presented by householders by am on scheduled collection days and incorrectly reported as missed.ldquoIt is not possible to determine the exact cause of any increase in missed collections but the increasingly challenging winters experienced across the Borders will be having an impact.ldquoThat was the case this year, when the extreme winter conditions experienced in January, February and March caused signicant disruption, with three full days where collections were unable to be carried out across the Borders.ldquoHouseholders reporting a missed collection over this period will have contributed signicantly to the increase this year."},{"url":null,"title":"a72-to-close-at-clovenfords-while-manhole-cover-is-repaired","story":"DRIVERS in the Tweed Valley are being warned the A will be closed at Clovenfords this Sunday.Scottish

four-fold in the space of a year.According to figures just released by the Trussell Trust, foodbank use in the Borders has risen by  percent in  months - the highest percentage rise of any local authority area in Scotland.The Trussell Trust, which support a network of  foodbanks operating out of more than  centres across the UK, have reported that between April and September , a total of  emergency food parcels were issued in the Scottish Borders  to adults and  to children.And many other locally-organised foodbank services arent even included in the figures.In comparison, the same period in  saw just  being issued.Despite the percentage increase, the number of parcels issued this year in the Borders remain the lowest in Scotland over the same period.The figures also report a UK-wide increase of  percent in providing emergency supplies to people in crisis.The charity claims the rise in reliance on foodbanks coincides with the UK Governmentrsquos Universal Credit rollout, which was introduced in the Borders during the summer.The charity says the inability of benefit levels to cover essential living costs and issues with payments remains the most common reasons for referral to a foodbank.They said: ldquoUniversal Credit is not the only benefit people at foodbanks are experiencing problems with, but the new system is increasingly driving referrals due to benefit delays, which include waiting for a first payment or having problems with a new claim.The charity is calling for the five week minimum wait for a first Universal Credit payment to be reduced.Emma Revie, Chief Executive of The Trussell Trust explained: ldquoWersquore seeing soaring levels of need at foodbanks. The time to act is now. If the five week wait isnrsquot reduced, the only way to stop even more people being forced to foodbanks this winter will be to pause all new claims to Universal Credit, until funding is in place to reduce the five week wait. Foodbanks cannot continue to pick up the pieces ndash we have to make sure our benefits system can protect people from hunger.Commenting on the figures, Tweeddale MSP Christine Grahame said: ldquoThese are truly heart-breaking figures for the Borders, which bring into sharp focus the devastating impact the Tory government is having on our local community.ldquoThe fact that people cannot afford to eat is a disgrace in any circumstances, but we can see from the statistics that in the previous year there have been  incidences where emergency food has been given to children specically ndash this is an abomination in a developed country such as ours.ldquoWhile sustained Tory cuts have created this problem, we can see that where Universal Credit has rolled out, which is the case in the Borders, it has made things worse.ldquoMichelle Ballantyne MSP who is the Toryrsquos Social Security spokesperson, represents the South of Scotland which covers the Borders ndash despite her ardent defence of Universal Credit in parliament recently, she must see now how devastating this roll out has been.\"I call on her to review her position and urgently press her colleagues at Westminster to halt the roll out of UC, so the fundamental flaws can be addressed.In response Michelle Ballantyne MSP said: ldquoWhile Ms Grahame might be correct that foodbank usage has risen across the UK, she might want to look closer before placing all the blame with the UK Government.\"We should also remember that, despite this increase, foodbank usage in the Borders is still at the lowest number in Scotland.ldquoI would consider it narrow-minded to attribute the entire increase with Universal Credit there are many other factors contributing to foodbank usage across the country.\"Aberdeen City Council and Perth and Kinross have also implemented Universal Credit around the same time as the Borders and the same report notes that foodbank usage has actually decreased in these areas.ldquoHer assertion that Universal Credit is the sole reason that foodbank usage is rising in the Borders just doesnrsquot add up.ldquoI appreciate there are issues with Universal Credit and the UK Government has said they will address them. An example of this is the announcement that there will be increased work allowances which will give a boost to hundreds of thousands of people including a pound boost for couples with children.ldquoI suggest that Ms. Grahame spend less time scaremongering and instead focus on how we can address the drivers of poverty instead."},{"url":null,"title":"pet-of-the-week","story":"This weeks Pet Of The Week, from Borders Pet Rescue, features Willow and Mittens.The charity told us: \"This lovely pair of nine-year-old sisters came into the centre as they couldnt live with the dogs in their previous home.

Perhaps a little too early for the jumpers, I attended the Memorial Hall eager to feast upon the much-anticipated performance of these young thespians.Could they really deliver this magical Christmas story and live up to the incredible reputation set by their mentors, Innerleithen  District Amateur Operatic Society  You bet your bottom dollar they did!From the moment the music started and the curtain opened on this stunning production, I along with the audiences were captivated.Playing the hopeful orphan was Freya Wilson. She already looked the part with red hair and freckles, and with stunning vocals she belted out classics lsquoTomorrowrsquo and lsquoMaybersquo, which I have no doubt produced a few tears from the audience. She embraced the character with her cheeky charm and wit, and carried out the role of the ever-optimistic character beautully.Hatching a plan to escape the orphanage and find her parents, Annie is helped by her urchin friends, who had the crowdrsquos toes-tapping and knees bouncing to a fantastically choreographed lsquoHard Knock Lersquo.

What was in the champagne bottle, I do not know, but the teenager stumbled about the stage, and conveyed the child-hating orphanage boss to comic perfection. Hanniganrsquos flirtatious manner with Officer Ward , who brings Annie back after running away, had the audience chuckling, and truly convinced us of her distaste for the girls in her care with a jaw-dropping performance of lsquoLittle Girlsrsquo.Anniersquos capture isnrsquot the end of her adventure, itrsquos only just begun, as she s in perfect time to meet Grace Farrell.Miss Farrell is gracefully played by the suave and sophisticated Ava Church, dressed impeccably as the rsquos private secretary to Oliver Warbucks. Annie cheekily seizes a golden opportunity to spend Christmas with Mr Warbucks, and is swept off to live the le of royalty at his mansion.Annie soon melts the heart of wealthy businessman Oliver Warbuckswho gave an endearing performance as the billionaire.

It is very dficult for one to critic her own child. However, I am very proud to call her a vain, blonde bimbo, red-lipstick wearing, smoking, winey voiced, floozy!The three baddies gave a show-stopping performance of lsquoEasy Streetrsquo which had the audiences in stitches.True to the classic, their evil plotting is foiled and Annie has her happy ending after being adopted by Mr Warbucks.

She is originally from another European country but has made Haddington her home, with her husband and two wonderful children.Her explorations of nearby woods led her to discover an unusual grave amongst the trees. It is a grave of a horse, buried in the th century. It was this grave she had offered to show me. To get there we had a beautul walk along a secluded section of the banks of the Tyne. It was the trees I noticed first, of course, which were dotted along the banks of the river.Autumn was just then beginning to brush the trees with its colour, and it was one of those evenings when the setting sun seemed to take its time, bathing the land in bright streaks of orange light. Along the way, Marije paused and said: ldquoThis is my tree.It was a beech tree of signicant age, its branches arching over the Tyne, asfishing. She showed me her sitting place, underneath its embracing canopy. Here the roots curved to make a natural seat. Her older son spoke of seeing kingfishers, and sure enough, this was a perfect place to absorb the majesty of the Tyne as it flowed towards Haddington. Another beech of similar age grew close by. Their branches entwined, making it look like they were sisters holding hands.But I sensed then there was more to Marijersquos connection to this place, although I then had no idea just how powerful her story was.When we finally got to our destination in the woods further upriver, the light was too weak to penetrate the trees. The old grave of the horse was shrouded in darkness.Yet with the help of mobile torches we could view it, and for sure the grave was interesting and worth a story in its own right. I vowed to find out more about its background as we headed back to Marijersquos house in the dying embers of a sunset.When we reached her house we were treated to wonderful hospitality. It was then that Marije told her story of the beech tree.Not long ago she had been diagnosed with cancer. She faced the possibility of being taken by this cruel disease. Numbness and disbelief at first overcame her, then there was the realisation that le might be very short and she would have to leave her two young children.She walked to the beech tree soon after her diagnosis and sat cradled by its roots. Despite having family and friends whose love and support was invaluable, Marije explained it can also be a desperately lonely feeling. ldquoWe all know we canrsquot live forever, she told me, ldquobut to face the reality of my end at such a young age and with children was unbearable.ldquoI went on that walk to the tree in the most dire situation, she told me. ldquoI felt a connection as I sat under the tree, I really felt her old wisdom and energy.Her love for her young children is what gave her strength in the worst of times. The tree seemed to symbolise this powerful bond, its roots deeply holding it safe.ldquoPeople talk about mother nature, Marije said, ldquoand I understand why. When my hair fell out, I lsquogave it backrsquo to nature, underneath the beech. I know it makes me sound weird, but it really helped me.It is not weird, of course. Trees are full of wisdom, not in the sense of actual words but in the spiritual sense. Beech is said to be the matriarch of the wood, sometimes called the mother of the forest. It is a good listener. Our best ideas and inner reflections can come when we sit under the embrace of an old tree even science tells us this now.Sadly not everyone wins the fight against cancer, but thankfully Marije recovered after treatment. The experience has left her treasuring every single day and taking no sunrise for granted. And she is thankful to her beech tree, which was her companion and confidant in those times of emotional agony. It remains for her a place of contemplation and peace, where she can give thanks and absorb the joy of being alive.ldquoI cherish every day now in ways I didnrsquot before, she told me. ldquoI think it is important to allow our kids to feel the connection with nature. That means being in nature, and respecting it. After all, we are all part of it.This was the real story of that walk on that day a story of incredible bravery, pain, love and determination by a young mum I now have the privilege to call a

This is a direct result of the Scottish Government slashing council funding over this period, with East Lothian Council having suffered cuts of around pound million in the last five years.ldquoEast Lothian Council has done its utmost to protect the budget.ldquoThe Scottish Government needs to recognise the impact its cuts are having and give local authorities the funding they need to protect services, including road maintenance.The county is currently covered by km of roads, ranging from class A routes to unclassied lanes.And an Annual Status and Options Report, produced on behalf of East Lothian Council, has revealed that  per cent are currently in need of repair.The report, which looks at the impact of future funding on network maintenance in the long term, warns that the current level of investment of pound.million a year will mean that more than  per cent of the roads will be in a state of disrepair in  yearsrsquo time.And it reveals that, as an asset, East Lothian Councilrsquos carriageways depreciate in value by poundmillion every year.It also found that nearly km of rural public roads in the county were in poor condition and needed immediate investigation and possible treatment.The report said: ldquoThe level of investment on public roads in East Lothian has not been sufficient to limit the decline in the overall condition of the network.It revealed that additional investment of pound.million over the next  years could signicantlyimprove the state of the roads, with fewer than  per cent likely to need repairs by the end of the decade.Peter Forsyth, asset manager for East Lothian Council, said that the recommendation for operating the carriageways following the report was to continue with the current level of investment.In a report to the councilrsquos policy and performance review committee, he said the costs of corrective treatments, in particular carriageway reconstruction, were ldquoprohibitive and a preventative treatment approach should ldquomitigate the need to invest signicantly.But he warned: ldquoShort-term under-investment could result in major long-term expenditure necessary to recty major defects which could have been addressed earlier.Councillor Jane Henderson , leader of the opposition, said: ldquoOur road infrastructure assets are vital and dficult decisions will need to be made.ldquoWithout investment now the amount of money needed in the future will be a greater problem the old expression of lsquoa stitch in time saves ninersquo was never so apt.ldquoThe decision on how much to spend on roads now will inevitably mean choices.

With  holiday lodges crammed on to the former fairways, the beautul landscape and its wildle will be lost forever. There is another way! A country park, managed by a charitable trust, could deliver fantastic community benefits, education and natural play spaces, as well as jobs and spend in the local community, enhancing rather than damaging the environment.The spokesman said it was ldquohugely questionable that  new self-catered lodges were needed, adding: ldquoAny search on [property rental website] Airbnb will show an average of  self-catering options available in North Berwick pretty much every week between September and May, so an additional  could actually overload and damage the existing tourism market.

Visitors will be able to access it via a walkway.The plans were originally turned down after an objection from Transport Scotland, which felt it would ldquoresult in inappropriate parking which would interfere with the safety and free flow of traffic on the A.However, at the local review body meeting, three councillors disagreed and gave it the go-ahead.Among those approving the plans was ward councillor Norman Hampshire.

It is a collection of stories and anecdotes mainly relating to sporting le and animals.The following tale is inspired from one of the anecdotal stories in Eganrsquos book:ONE autumn evening in the early th century, a storm descended on the county. Dark clouds opened their dreich souls and drenched the land with a torrent of rain. The wind and downpour kept people awake for the whole night, and but by sunrise the tempest was over.Yet all the sudden rain had caused the River Tyne to flood. The folk of Haddington gathered by its banks to witness a strange sight. For the surface of the water was laid with huge masses of hay. The storm had obviously caused the hay recently cut and stacked in the fields upriver to be blown into the flood water, or swept away by it.They watched as small mountains of hay floated by. It was an intriguing sight but of course for farmers it was their winter feed for their animals going waste to the sea.Then someone spotted a swan. It seemed to be attempting to find a place to land. The river was in a torrent and at times the majestic creature seemed to give in to the current and glide on its course until once again it found the strength and motivation to make for the river bank. It was in no imminent danger, but clearly desired to get out of the fast-moving water.As people watched the swan it was noticed that a strange black spot could be seen amidst its white feathers. As the swan drted closer to the bank, people realised what the black spot was: a rat!The rat was clearly alive, at times peeping over the plumage asto see where they were. The swan seemed unperturbed by the ratrsquos presence on its back. In fact, as people watched more closely there seemed to be a connection between the swan and the rat which was most unusual.The royal bird was clearly giving the rat a collie-buckie, or piggy back. How the rat came to be on the swanrsquos back in the first place nobody could tell. The wee creature was very likely at home in one of the bales of hay when it was swept away by the river. In the swirling water it must have struggled to survive.Then rescue came with the swan. Could the creature have scrambled onto the swan without its permission  Surely not! Did the swan actively help the rat  If so, the moment of rescue had been a compassionate act unseen by human eyes. As people followed the drama they realised that the swan was looking for a place to land, not for itself but for its passenger.A crowd had soon gathered to witness the swanrsquos progress. The power of the flood water meant it had real dficulty in finding a place to get close to the river bank. But finally the swan found the strength and opportunity to swim close to the riverrsquos edge.The rat, recognising the opportunity, leaped from the swanrsquos plumage and landed safely on dry land. For an instant the rat turned and looked at the swan, then scampered away. The swan, its mission accomplished, majestically glided back into the main flow of the river.If the rat had thought itself safe then it soon realised this not to be the case. The people watching the spectacle had motivations very dferent to the swan. As soon as the rat landed, dozens of young men, urged on by their elders, chased it with sticks and set their dogs upon it.The animal, having survived naturersquos tempest, now faced an even greater danger his le was sport for humans. The creature zigzagged as people, yelling and howling with delight, chased it this way, then that. The rat, being cornered by a group of about  lads armed with stones and sticks, turned and headed back towards the water.But it didnrsquot make it. The creature was given a deadly blow by a lsquomerciless fellowrsquo. A cheer rang out and people came to view the dead rat. Then a strange silence descended as people reflected, now too late, on what had happened. In the frenzy of the chase it had been so easy to see the rat as merely vermin, rather than a living creature who had struggled to survive and so earned the right to le.People dispersed, no longer cheering.The whole scene had been witnessed by the swan from its vantage point on the river. What its thoughts were on the human behaviour it saw we can only guess.Humans can be made to do this to each other as well, of course. In the frenzy of war, people are encouraged to see others as no more worthy of le than that rat. And the insidious power of this is that both sides are encouraged to think the same way.But deep down, when we touch our humanity, we know how wrong this is. Old soldiers themselves are the first to understand the tragedy of it and see the humanity in those who had been on the lsquoother sidersquo. While there are undoubtedly people who commit evil and need to be stopped, it is the conditions which allow hate to flourish which give rise to their power and influence in the first place.In our remembrance of those who have fallen, let us do so with the reflection and not the frenzy. Let us not forget that the real enemy of us all is hate."},{"url":null,"title":"inspectors-impressed-on-visit-to-elphinstone-primary-school","story":"Parents of youngsters at Elphinstone Primary School and Nursery Class received a letter this week from Education Scotland and the Care Inspectorate following an inspection visit in September.The letter outlined a number of strengths at the school, as well as areas to improve.Fiona Robertson, head of education at East Lothian Council, told the Courier: ldquoWe are pleased that inspectors from both agencies recognise the positive dference that nursery and primary school staff are making for the children and their families in Elphinstone.ldquoThey considered leadership, learning, attainment and wellbeing amongst other areas and concluded that the school was good across these quality indicators.ldquoIrsquom especially pleased to see Alison Cameron receive recognition for her leadership and direction so early in her time as headteacher of the school.ldquoI know that she and the staff team will continue to put pupilsrsquo learning at the heart of all they do.ldquoIrsquod also like to recognise Heather Williamsrsquo work in laying the foundations for this positive outcome during her time at Elphinstone.The letter noted strengths in the schoolrsquos work, including kind and articulate children who make the most of their learning, and the warm, inclusive ethos that creates a family feel.No further inspections are planned, with the school urged to ldquodevelop a strategic, joined-up approach to self-evaluation to ensure that all children can achieve the best possible outcomes and to continue to develop the curriculum.Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet spokeswoman for education, echoed the comments of Mrs Robertson regarding the schoolrsquos former and current headteacher.She said: ldquoThe inspection recognised a number of areas such as the positive relationships across the nursery and school which are making a dference for children and families.ldquoThey also commented that children were making the most of their learning and were provided with real leadership opportunities at the school."},{"url":null,"title":"austerity-over-in-the-county-definitely-not","story":"Jim Lamond, head of East Lothian Council resources, dismissed claims austerity was coming to an end as a report warned of uncertainty about the future of farming, food and drink, and tourism after the UK left the European Union .Audit Scotland identied the potential problems facing East Lothian as the key sectors of its economy came under risk.

We had just popped in to get a few simple items, but I ended up with a very upset wee boy. The supermarket had already begun to display toys. My son had noticed them immediately because they had been deliberately placed at his level.I eventually managed to distract him and we made it out without a major meltdown, but it just highlighted to me the pressures we are all put under.I kept on saying to my son: ldquoNo, but maybe for Christmas.It was a tactic to get some immediate peace, but I realised I was building up expectations that Christmas is the time when all the accumulated desires for stuff are met.We are made to feel that the value of Christmas is measured in the amount of stuff we acquire or give. I hate this and reject it but I am by no means immune from its pressure. I am made to feel guilty and every year I give in some way or another.The psychological warfare in our minds has already begun. The new toys laid out in that supermarket was but the opening shot. Soon a lsquoChristmassyrsquo atmosphere will engulf us as we do our shopping, designed to press our internal panic button that we need get on with buying lots of stuff, like a stressed squirrel collecting nuts for the winter.I know Irsquove ranted about this before but in February I spoke to a group of vulnerable parents in a course I was delivering. Many had huge debts yet had spent literally hundreds of pounds on Christmas presents, most of which were by this time broken, forgotten about or discarded.One of the parents encapsulated it perfectly: ldquoThe trouble is itrsquos easy to realise after itrsquos all over that yoursquove gone overboard, but the pressure is so hard to resist before Christmas. Yoursquore made to feel that you are a bad parent or a failureyou donrsquot get all that stuff. Itrsquos everywhere you go and on the screens. Itrsquos impossible to escape from it.In the discussion the parents said they wished there was a course or some guidance on how to resist the pressure while still making Christmas special for their kids.In a sense, this issue is not just a Christmas one, although the consumerist pressure is at its most intense in the run-up to Christmas, and even immediately afterwards with the sales. We have literally been sold the idea that buying stuff is what defines us.It has been a conscious, deliberate and sustained ideological assault on us and our children.In her brilliant film The Story of Stuff, Annie Leonard gives a quote from a retail analyst Victor Lebow: ldquoOur enormously productive economy. . . demands that we make consumption our way of le, that we convert the buying and use of goods into rituals, that we seek spiritual satisfaction, our ego satisfaction, in consumption. We need things, consumed, burned up, worn out, replaced and discarded at an ever-increasing rate.While this was in reference to the USA a number of years ago, it holds true for us here and now.Christmas, as well as other seasonal festivals, have been made a festival of buying stuff.Itrsquos destroying the very planet we live on, it piles our homes with unneeded and soon-to-be discarded consumerist items .Meanwhile, more and more of us are time poor and running about to pay for things we soon forget we even bought and are likely already in the dump or charity shop.I was once told I was being a Scrooge when I spoke of this issue. But the message in Scrooge, when he realises whatrsquos important, is that he gives his employee time off to be with his family, and a pay rise so they can eat he shows kindness and shares a meal and social time with his family. Itrsquos not about tons of stuff.Our time together is the most valuable and valued thing we will ever have. Irsquod never say donrsquot buy presents, as I know a thoughtful present is a wonderful thing. Butitrsquos lost in a sea of other stuff then its signicance is lost too.What I think is important is doing things together and measuring the value of gts by the thought put into them, rather than the price or quantity of them. And there are a host of local Christmas fairs taking place in schools and community halls all over East Lothian where many local craftspeople, artists and others will be selling locally produced and environmentally friendly gts which have real value and are designed to last. It seems to me this is the best place to take our custom.I know this has not been a proper story but, then again, in a sense it is. Itrsquos the story of how our rituals and the meanings of our lives have been turned into market value, and we now often feel powerless or unable to step out of it without feeling guilty, inadequate or ldquoa Scrooge.Thatrsquos how I feel every Christmas but Irsquom going to make a Herculean effort this year to practice what I preach. Irsquom not rejecting that lsquoChristmassyrsquo feeling or refusing to buy presents. But Irsquom defining it on my own terms, or at least Irsquoll try. Itrsquos about my time with people I value. Itrsquos about putting in thought rather than looking at the price tag.Itrsquos also about understanding how terribly dficult Christmas is for so many people and finding ways to connect with them and show them some kindness and inclusion.Maybe itrsquos just me, but I think that is one of the best gts you can give your children and others you love."},{"url":null,"title":"great-grandmother-84-enjoys-microlight-flight","story":"Jenny Lyall, , was the passenger in a microlight, taking off from East Fortune Airfield, earlier this month.The small aircraft, piloted by Kim Ritchie, gave Jenny the chance to look over her home in Haddington.Clients at the townrsquos day centre, managed by Caroline Scott, have been outlining things they would like to do, from having a holiday in the spring to going on the London Eye.For Jenny, though, it was a chance to take to the skies.She said: ldquoIrsquove always watched the microlights going over and would be sitting in the garden saying: lsquoI quite fancy doing that.rsquoldquoWhen Caroline askedthere was anything anybody would like to do I said I would like to go up in a microlight.A few days later Jenny received a phone call telling her there was a surprise for her at the day centre and she said she was thrilled when she found out that was a microlight flight, adding: ldquoI thoroughly enjoyed it ndash I would do it again tomorrow.ldquoNot bad for an -year-old!Caroline was delighted to be able to help.

Itrsquos a love letter to the British Isles, a spectacular place which has looked after me, and now itrsquos my turn to look after him ndash or her.He offers a thought: ldquoThe motto of the Isle of Man, lsquoWhichever way you throw me I will standrsquo, the three legged symbol, I think thatrsquos a great motto for people to live by.Thatrsquos easy to say, but wersquore facing confusion, polarisation of politics, right-wing extremism. You must be afraid of the isions politics has produced and the invective that comes with it  It seems everyone wants to be angry.ldquoIrsquom sick of politics, he admits. ldquoIrsquom completely disenchanted with all of it. Politicians lack so much knowledge. If Irsquom honest, I donrsquot think therersquos a politician out there worth listening to, of any creed or colour. I donrsquot have any truck with any of them. Irsquom just looking away at the moment while they do what they do, which is self-aggrandizing and performing their Punch and Judy nonsense. I cannot be bothered with it.He adds: ldquoI was in that arena vaguely for a while on account of a few opinions I was invited to give.He certainly was. Oliver incurred the wrath of the Nationalists back in  when he declared independence for Scotland a \"dead dog.\"But does he now regret becoming involved in the independence debate He pauses for thought. ldquoNo, I think itrsquos important to say what you think is true. But I donrsquot like the atmosphere at the moment whereby you canrsquot say what you think. If you are not pleasing the social media mob you are silenced or destroyed. I was asked some questions and I gave an honest answer.Oliver rejects the offer of half a sconeand instead sips at his coffee cup. ldquoHow it really started for me was when I was being interviewed for Bannockburn  [his TV show] and a journalist asked me about the referendum. ldquoI remember saying, lsquoA referendum is like going shopping for food when yoursquore hungry.rsquo You donrsquot want to be making snap decisions.Because you come away with a packet of Hobnobs and a jar of Nutella  ldquoExactly. I donrsquot think we should have referendums to decide which side of the road we should drive on, never mind kicking the ball back to the general population to determine a nationrsquos destiny. Thatrsquos why we have political democracy, whereby we employ hundreds of people to read tedious paperwork, shout and bawl at each other in a room for as long as it takes. Thatrsquos why these -odd people have a job.He becomes more animated. ldquoReferendums are a bad idea. After the Scottish referendum there were immediate cries for another one. lsquoThat disnae countrsquo. Now therersquos been Europe. And that was seen to be wrong. And so you claim for another one. What do you do  Go for best of three  Or best of five Oliver smiles. ldquoIrsquove never been a card-carrying member of a political party. I used to scoff at university friends who were. In the same way I couldnrsquot understand why anyone would get excited about football. Irsquom not minded that way.Yet, but he is minded to recognise how politics overlaps into culture and issues of identity, which he loves to wax lyrical about on his TV shows. But there are those who donrsquot countenance his passion for explaining the likes of Iona and the coming of Christianity. Some, such as Professor Tom Devine, see Oliver as an irritant.The historian once attacked the fact Oliver had been asked to front a History of Scotland ndash given he didnrsquot have a degree in history.Oliver didnrsquot take Devinersquos comment laying down however, describing the historian as being like of the old grumps from The Muppets.More recently, Oliver got it in the neck when appointed president of the National Trust for Scotland, and many Nationalists demanded his removal, which seemed odd given the TV presenterrsquos passion for this space we live in.But the writer presenter took it on broad shoulders. Did his personal history prepare him for the future stre  Seems so. Hersquos used to adjustment. ldquoI was born in a council flat in Renfrew, my dad moved to Ayr to work [he was a commission salesman] and then to Dumfries. The family was ldquocomfortable, he says. It certainly wasnrsquot an Angelarsquos Ashes set in Scotland storyline. They even managed a holiday to Spain once.Yet, the man who would go on to explain the Picts and Vikings and anacyclosis to uswasnrsquot top of the class at school. ldquoI was in the upper half but I wasnrsquot so great at maths and science so I focused on English and history, which I was quite good at.Oliver was blessed with encouraging parents who most likely were baffled why their son wanted to study archaeology, University I fell in love with the prospectus given it rarely leads to a career. ldquoI did work as an excavator for a few years going on digs, he recalls. ldquoIt was fun, but there was no money in it. And during the winters it became a bit grim.One Friday afternoon he was excavating the Roman Road in Greenock, and on the Monday he was covering a peace protest in Lockerbie for the local newspaper. Why the switch to journalism ldquoI liked the idea of journalism because it was essentially noseyness about people, he explains, grinning. ldquoItrsquos a bit like archaeology in that itrsquos the chance to poke through the rubbish, to find out what people were doing and why. Instinctively, I want to know who, what, where, why and when.Journalism has been as important to his current career, he says, as his time spent scraping dirt with a big spoon. ldquoWhen Irsquove been cast in the likes of Coast as a presenter it helped me get something out of people. And this Magpie-like work taught me how to become engrossed in a subject for a day then drop it, and move onto something .The curious mind continued to search for the next adventure and in  he joined a BT internet company. ldquoI thought that may be my future. I was also fascinated to learn how it had evolved, largely financed by the US military, who wanted to knowcomputers could survive after a nuclear attack. And so they hired these hippies to find out. And then I wondered what do we do with it  What are the consequences of it He answers his own question: ldquoItrsquos created titans such as Mark Zuckerberg, and Amazon, Google and Pay Pal. He adds in soft, serious voice, ldquoNow, Zuckerberg is almost at the point he has more power than Putin, without the missiles.While working for the internet company, Oliver decided to set off for Zululand.ldquoI had met up with my close pal from university Tony Pollard one day in the Granary Bar in Glasgowrsquos Shawlands and we came up with the idea of going to Zululand to make a film [which became the BBCrsquos  documentary, Two Men In A Trench].Boldness has to be part of the reason for Oliverrsquos success. He had a good job, with a good salary, a car and an Amex account. ldquoBut I didnrsquot have a mortgage. I wasnrsquot married. I could take a chance. And I knew I had had experience. When the TV job ran out Irsquod do something .Does the job flipping suggest a malcontent  ldquoNo, when I was at BT I figured Irsquod give it a couple of years, he says with a wee hint of umbrage in his voice for me having suggested such a thing. ldquoAnd we made the film really because we wanted to go to South Africa. The voice warms again: ldquoArchaeology was my first love and we met again. It was like Friends Reunited. And wersquove been together ever since.Hersquos a television natural. But did he always feel confident speaking to the camera  ldquoYes. Irsquove always had a good memory and Irsquom lucky in that I can remember  words in the right order, he says, grinning. ldquoTalking to the camera is not a natural thing to do. Itrsquos like a golf swing. But some people can do it. And I enjoyed being with these like-minded people. It was quite collegiate. I loved it from the get-go.Oliver landed on the box at the right time. ldquoI was   when television began to happen for me. I had few delusions about my own reality. Irsquod been in a few dferent jobs, had the rougher edges knocked off by le experience. Irsquod filled shelves at Presto supermarket while eating the Mars Bars. Irsquod worked on an MS till. He adds, with a wry smile, ldquoIrsquod been dumped often enough by women.Women. Yes, now hersquos married to one. And history taught him he should incorporate this woman into his future. Oliver met his future we Trudi when he was at university. ldquoI was in third year at the time, the president of the archaeology society and she was in first year, and she came in to join. I made a bee-line for her when she walked in the door.He grins. ldquoI donrsquot think she was as impressed by me as I was by her.She must have liked him a little because the pair were together for seven years. ldquoAnd it just sort of fizzled out. Then, years later, I met her wee brother Johnny and we swapped numbers and a few months after that I was back in touch with Trudi. It was asIrsquod seen her the day before.He reflects: ldquoThatrsquos another great thing about my le. Whatever happens, I know Irsquom with someone who remembers me when I was  and a silly arse. She remembers me when I had all sorts of archaeology student affectations, all patchouli oil and cheese cloth shirts. We can remember the teenagers we were.Oliver reveals he had the long hair back in the day. He didnrsquot create the soft Tarzan look for telly. He has just never bothered to have it cut. And it works for him, gives him a USP, although watching him on TV with the wind blasting into his face as he stands on a clf edge he does have to brush it away from his mouth a little too often but, I suppose, a kirby grip or a hair scrunchy would wreck the image.He laughs. ldquoIrsquove been holding out for the Head and Shoulders contract for  years but itrsquos never happened.Therersquos a calm about Oliver, even though he does become animated when he talks about the politics he says he wants nothing to do with. And he clearly loves his le, beaming at the delights of a career which allows him to take his family adventuring in the likes of Australia and New Zealand while filming Coast. Yet with three children hersquos not immune to worry, about the impact of social media, for example. ldquoPeople can have , friends, but ironically they have never been more isolated and lonelier. People go to Facebook ndash I donrsquot ndash hoping to see other people in this clearing in the forest who are equally lonely.Hersquos happy however, very happy. ldquoThe thing I most love these days is writing. I wrote as a student, as a journalist and then in TV with scripts. Irsquove written ten books or so and itrsquos something Irsquoll be able to do.And now hersquos making live appearances. ldquoIrsquove sort of blundered into them. Irsquom out there talking about our world, like Simon Reeve and Dan Snow. Maybe I can do this every year. Why not So the world will be all right, Neil  We need you to tell us it will be. ldquoWe tend to think this is a modern concern, but perhaps Stonehenge and Avebury are partly expressions of feeling the same concerns, people feeling they are little specks in the great scheme of things and wanting to be heard, to make a mark.He grins, reassuringly. ldquoWersquoll be fine, but I wonrsquot beI donrsquot do this school pick-up in time.Neil Oliver ndash The Story of the British Isles in  Places, the Theatre Royal, Glasgow, November ."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-insider-guide-stornoway","story":"But therersquos so much more to the Hebridean capital than just great views.

Irsquom going to look at the detail closely before coming to a final decision about how I will vote in the deal when it comes to the House of Commons.Mr Masterton, elected as the MP for East Renfrewshire last year, wrote on a blog:ldquoDeciding whether or not to support this deal will, short of a decision on whether to go to war, be the biggest decision MPs will make. I will not be rushed, bounced, or forced into reaching a position. To do so would be irresponsible and do you a disservice. You deserve a decision of this magnitude to be properly thought through.ldquoI have read the documents carefully and have a number of concerns. These relate primarily to the Northern Ireland backstop , and aspects of the future relationship framework where there is a real lack of detail.He continued: ldquoI now need to work through those concerns and understand the practical reality and real-world implications in a number of areas. So as of today, I am not in a position to state that I will be supporting the deal.However, he also wrote that leaving the EU without a deal would be a ldquoterrible outcome and voting against the May plan poses an ldquoinherent risk.Mr Duguid wrote yesterday that he is continuing to ldquoseek and receive assurances that the UK will leave the CFP and become an ldquoindependent coastal state.He added: ldquoEU demands for continued, guaranteed access is UNACCEPTABLE.While Mr Lamont and Mr Masterton voted Remain in the  referendum, Aberdeen South MP Ross Thomson voted for Brexit.The MP stepped up his criticism of Mayrsquos plan yesterday: \"The PMrsquos plan would create serious new trade barriers between GB and NI. As a Unionist first and foremost I can never accept that.With May struggling to cobble together a parliamentary majority for the draft deal, she desperately needs her Scottish MPs onside.SNP MP Stephen Gethins said: \"With all wings of her party against her, it is abundantly clear that Theresa May has no chance of getting her deal through parliament - leaving us all in political purgatory.ldquoRather than trying to please the Prime Minister, the Scottish Tories should be listening to their constituents who voted overwhelmingly to remain in the EU.\"The best deal short of EU membership is to remain in the single market and customs union.\"It is essential that we avoid both Theresa Mays hard Brexit and a No Deal scenario - and all options must be on the table to achieve that.\"A Scottish Tory spokesman said: \"Scottish Conservative MPs know that their constituents will expect them to scrutinise this draft agreement in detail before they vote, and that is exactly what they are doing.\"Meanwhile, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon will tell a forum in Dundee on Monday that Brexit in any form is likely to reduce economic growth.She will use her address at the National Economic Forum on Monday to reiterate her call for the UK to remain part of the single market and customs union.She is expected to tell delegates that leaving the single market will do \"immense damage\" to jobs and living standards in Scotland.Sturgeon will say: \"The UK Governments refusal to even consider the Scottish Governments detailed plan to keep Scotland in the single market, while accepting a dferentiated solution for Northern Ireland, which we support, potentially puts Scotland at a competitive disadvantage.\"But, perhaps worst of all, it leaves everybody completely uncertain about the shape of our long-term relationship with the EU.\"The seven-page political declaration on the future contains little more than vague aspirations and platitudes.\"But while we can expect more pages forthcoming on some aspects of the future relationship, there will be no concrete reassurances.\"The governments National Economic Forum is a regular event attended by ministers and senior figures from business, the public sector and trade unions to discuss how best to grow Scotlands economy.Sturgeon will address delegates at the Apex City Quay Hotel on the theme of innovation and inclusion.She will say: \"Put bluntly, long-term economic uncertainty is hard-wired into the Prime Ministers withdrawal deal.\"If the UK Government insists on leaving the EU, then it should remain in the single market and customs union. That is the solution which respects the outcome of the referendum, mitigates the worst economic consequences of Brexit and largely resolves the Irish border issue.\"If Brexit goes ahead - in any form - it is likely to reduce economic growth.\"But that doesnt devalue our wider efforts to support business - in fact it makes those efforts all the more important.\""},{"url":null,"title":"theresa-may-faces-crunch-week-as-tory-critics-plot-her-exit-from-downing-street","story":"The Prime Minister appeared to have gathered momentum on Friday after surviving a spate of resignations from her Government, but she is expected to face a series of challenges to her authority over the next few days.Conservative MPs who have angrily denounced her draft agreement with European negotiators are expected to get close to the  signatures required to force a no- confidence vote in her.A core of influential Cabinet Ministers who voted Leave in the  referendum, led by Environment Secretary Michael Gove, will also meet within days in a bid to persuade May to change course.The Tory civil war comes as senior figures in all the main parties at Westminster insist she will be unable to command a majority for her exit plan.May last week unveiled the  page draft Brexit withdrawal agreement, which was put together following fractious discussions with the EU.The UK is scheduled to leave the EU next year, but Mayrsquos problems arise from what happens after the completion of the transition period in December .Under the draft,a long-term trade deal has been not agreed by the end of , one option is for the transition period to be extended for a limited period.An alternative, in order to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, is a ldquobackstop consisting of a single customs territory between the EU and the UK.However, the backstop plan infuriated some of Mayrsquos backbenchers as they believe would prevent the UK from entering into new trade deals with other countries, which they argue is one of the main benefits of Brexit.The UK would also be unable to cancel the backstop independently and would need the agreement of the EU, an outcome MPs fear would trap the UK.Publication of the draft agreement led to the resignation of members of Mayrsquos Cabinet, including Brexit secretary Dominic Raab.It also triggered a campaign on the backbenches to secure the  signatures required to force a no confidence vote in the leader.However, the move to force a vote appeared to stall after MP Steve Baker, vice-chair of the pro-Brexit European Research Group, over-estimated the number of signatures.Mr Baker had stated on a WhatsApp group that the number was ldquoover , which would have led to a contest, but he later backtracked and said his count had been ldquoinaccurate.One senior Tory told the Herald on Sunday that the figure could reach  by Tuesday, which would lead to a vote soon after.Another Conservative insider said a vote could be an ldquoopportunity for Mayshe won it convincingly.ldquoShe would be able to say she has a mandate for the deal on the table, he said.Another threat for the Prime Minister will come when Gove, whose decision to stay in the Cabinet last week gave May a boost, meets other Cabinet Brexiteers to discuss strategy.It was reported that Gove, Andrea Leadsom, Chris Grayling, Penny Mordaunt and Liam Fox will meet and try to force May into renegotiating elements of the draft.Meanwhile, May has warned her Tory opponents that rival Brexit withdrawal plans, including the so-called Norway and Canada models favoured by her hardline critics, would not solve the backstop issue.In an interview yesterday, the Prime Minister said: \"People say If you could only just do something slightly dferent, have a Norway model or a Canada model, this backstop issue would go away. It would not. That issue is still going to be there.May appointed Stephen Barclay as her new Brexit Secretary, the third this year, but the role has been further downgraded as the Prime Minister will in future take sole control of negotiations on EU withdrawal.The job of Barclay, a Leave supporter, will be limited to the domestic delivery of EU withdrawal, preparations for Brexit either with or without a deal and shepherding legislation through Parliament.He said: \"We now need to keep up the momentum to finalise the withdrawal agreement and outline political declaration and deliver a Brexit that works for the whole UK.\"Party chairman Brandon Lewis said the Prime Minister is \"prepared for anything\", when asked on BBC Radio s Today programmeshe was prepared for a leadership challenge.He added: \"I think that whatever deal, when we see ious dferent organisations and groups talk about dferent ways of leaving the EU - Norway, Canada, all of these things - what we have to be clear about ... is all of those require a backstop.\"In another development, Irelands deputy premier has warned MPs to sign up to the Brexit agreement or risk crashing out of the EU without a deal.Simon Coveney said people were \"too quick\" to write off May, saying she has shown \"resilience, courage\" and a \"reality check\" to Brexiteers in Westminster.He warned it \"will be dficult\" to find an alternative deal that will prevent a hard border. \"If we are forced into that situation we will have to look at ways in which that can be avoided but that will not be easy,\" he added.\"It is a far more sensible approach to support what is being negotiated over the last two years as a way that we know provides the guarantees that we have looked for and insisted on that there will be no physical border or infrastructure or checks or controls and that is an issue that goes beyond commerce and trade.\""},{"url":null,"title":"is-there-a-better-way-to-teach-our-teachers","story":"After the opening pleasantries, MSPs from the education committee began to question the group on the quality of teacher training in Scotland ndash or teacher education as the universities who deliver it prefer it to be known.Following a number of national and international surveys which indicated a fall in standards of literacy and numeracy in the classroom, the conversation quickly turned to the matter of basic skills.Halla Price, a primary teaching student from Edinburgh University, told the committee: ldquoThere was not enough focus on the teachers having the skills to teach numeracy. I do not believe that everyone who graduated this year has sufficient skills in numeracy to be able to teach it to -year-olds at a reasonable standard.Cue bedlam. Here for the first time was a suggestion the slide in standards could be laid at the door of poorly prepared trainee teachers unable to pass on the essential skills required to make pupils literate and numerate.Even tabloid newspapers became interested in teacher training with the front page of next days Daily Record berating the Scottish Government under the headline \"You Do The Maths\".Scottish Conservative Party leader Ruth Davidson seized the moment demanding new literacy and numeracy tests for primary teachers at the beginning and end of their course.There was even graver concern when the education committee received a follow-up report from universities which said student teachers on some four-year degree courses could spend as little as  hours on numeracy and  hours on literacy.John Swinney, the Education Secretary, said he was ldquovery concerned by the findings and raised the issue with both universities and the General Teaching Council for Scotland.More than a year on and there is still resentment from some involved in teacher education over the way the issue played out.\"The students were not a representative sample,\" one member of university staff said. \"They were a very specic group who had already written to complain to the committee and they were the only ones selected to speak. It was unfortunate and we are still dealing with the consequences.\"Professor Ian Rivers, chairman of the Scottish Council of Deans of Education, is also concerned about the weight given to some of the statements made to the committee.\"There was no actual evidence that teachers who leave university are unable to teach -year-olds to the appropriate standard,\" he said. \"Every university does its absolute best, working in partnership with experienced teachers, to make sure our students leave able to meet the requirements and professional standards expected of them.\"The committee wanted the literacy and numeracy work we do neatly calculated in terms of the number of hours we deliver, but that is a very narrow view of what we do. All of the work on literacy, numeracy is integrated into the course as a whole so it is very dficult to provide what they wanted. That does not mean that literacy and numeracy is being ignored.\"Mr Rivers also questions the current narrative from headteachers and council officials that the quality of new teachers is not what it was.Local authorities have recorded an increase in the number of probationers having to repeat a year because they were not seen as being of an appropriate standard and school leaders have also raised concerns over quality.ldquoWe do not allow anyone to graduatetheir practice is not up to scratch and that is done with assessments by a member of academic staff from the university in partnership with the classroom teacher they have been working with,\" said Mr Rivers.\"It is very important to understand that teacher education is the starting point of a journey and not the end point. When students are on probation councils are also heavily involved in the development of skills and knowledge as the teacher moves towards becoming a fully registered member of the profession.\"The other concern that has unsettled public confidence in teacher education is drop-out rates. Figures published earlier this year showed the number of new teachers leaving after less than a year had doubled in just four years. In total, almost  probationers have left the profession since the   school year.While the reasons for leaving are not given a wider survey of probationers conducted last year highlighted a number of worrying concerns about the quality of courses and the experience of probationers in schools.Some trainees told how their ldquoappalling experiences at the hands of disinterested lecturers and on placement in classrooms had made them re-think their career path. One said veteran teachers had told them to ldquoleave whilst you still can while another suggested bullying was re within the profession and staff rooms a \"poisonous environment\".The Scottish Council of Deans of Education argues that the drop out rates are not particularly high and are generally stable. However, they acknowledge a growing concern over the ever-increasing demands placed on trainee teachers and the requirement that universities provide the Scottish Government with evidence of how they are addressing a iety of additional areas including looked after children, children with autism, LBGTI pupils, black and ethnic minority pupils and pupils with mental health issues.Moyra Boland, a senior lecturer from Glasgow Universityrsquos School of Education, said all of these areas were crucial, but questioned whether it was wise to try and cram them all into a one-year postgraduate course.She said: \"You can never get everything into the curriculum. That will never happen because there is so much to know in schools and it is such a complicated job. You never stop learning as a teacher because every class provides new challenges with new combinations of children.\"Rather than thinking about covering absolutely everything in initial teacher education in Glasgow we are much more focused on how we give our students the skills and dispositions to find the knowledge that they need to support their changing classrooms from year to year.\"Ken Muir, chief executive of the General Teaching Council for Scotland , also has concerns over what is expected of trainee teachers and believes the time is ripe for a wider review.He said: \"It would be a good time to look at whether the current system of a one year postgraduate followed by a one year probationary year adequately prepares teachers for the range of youngsters and experiences they will face.\"There are huge added responsibilities on teachers, and therefore on teacher education programmes, and an expectation that everything has to be covered which creates pressures and dficulties.ldquoWe need to stand back and ask,we want teachers to be skilled in covering a wide range of areas from sex education to additional support needs, can we cram all that into an  week university postgraduate programme \"Mr Muir said one solution was to look at a longer period of induction that allowed teachers to undertake the additional studies they require once they were in school so they could focus on the areas most pertinent to the context of their schools.There is also more radical thinking on the current structure of initial teacher education.Professor Chris Chapman, chair of Educational Policy and Practice at Glasgow Universitys Robert Owen Centre, wants to see barriers broken down between universities and schools.\"If we are building new schools we should look at teacher preparation in the design of those buildings. You could have studio classrooms or experimental classrooms where trainee teachers are working with university staff and teachers in a more regular and dynamic way.\"I would like to see university staff co-located in schools and working much more closely on a day-to-day basis with teachers and student teachers and engaging with research. That would create a much more dynamic and reflective set of teachers.\"Raymond Soltysek, a former teaching lecturer at Strathclyde University and now an independent educational consultant, argues Scotland could go much further.He believes the inconsistencies highlighted in the way universities deliver basic skills is an indicator of a system where students at dferent institutions study dferent subjects for dferent s of time and are assessed in dferent ways.\"Perhaps more radical initiatives should be explored,\" he said. \"Many have suggested ious structural changes, including taking professional teacher training back into the public sector.\"However, a model of public ownership might take the form of a National College of Teacher Education ndash a central body run by the GTCS, councils, Education Scotland, teachersrsquo bodies and associations ndash which would centralise matters such as recruitment, course design, student placement coordination and assessment. That would provide much greater consistency in what is delivered across Scotland.\""},{"url":null,"title":"Iain Macwhirter  May   s done the impossible - brought Leave and Remainers together  but only against her","story":"The Prime Minister made a dignied, resilient stand last week, before a House of Commons that loathes this proposal. But theres a time when resilience turns into defiance, and then defiance turns into delusion. Theresa Mayrsquos staying power is the nations curse, as she perseveres with a orce deal which has no hope. She has finally united Leavers and Remainers, but only to the extent that theyrsquore against her. Shes lost both her Brexit Secretaries, a host of ministers and both houses of parliament. But, like Monty Pythonrsquos limbless Black Knight, she battles on regardless.MPs on all sides say the European Court of Justice will continue to have effective jurisdiction over UK laws on things like state aid, labour conditions, environmental standards and tax. Theresa May insists it wonrsquot, and that by , a deep and meaningful future trading relationship will have been negotiated, which will make the backstop unnecessary. But that is a triumph of hope over experience. No one has yet come up with a way of ensuring frictionless trade that doesnt involve either membership of the Customs Union, or accepting many of the rules of the European Single Market. If you keep all or part of the single market you keep the ECJ.This doesnt mean that the ECJ is involved in every negotiation. There is to be an arbitration  to sort out everyday problems between the EU and UK. But when it comes to a dispute on EU law, the ECJ rulings are final. That is crystal clear in Article  of the Withdrawal Agreement which says that the ECJ ldquoshall have jurisdiction to make such a ruling, which will be binding on the arbitration .Theres nothing sinister in this ndash except in the eyes of paranoid europhobes. When you join a tennis club, no one complains that your rights and liberties are being removed just because you accept the rules. The real issue is whether you have any say in the making of them. Democracy demands that members of an international trading organisation should have have a share in the decision-making process. This is where the Withdrawal Agreement, indeed the whole Brexit project falls down, because as things stand, we dont. We will be rule takers.Theresa May realised very early on that the economic cost of leaving the EU completely was just too high. She gave assurances to all those big international companies like Nissan, Siemens and Rolls Royce, who have complex, just-in-time supply chains, that she would negotiate a deal that was at least as good as the single market. She effectively promised no tarfs, border checks or regulatory issues ndash ie no ldquofriction - between Britain and the EU. She had to, or theyd have upped and left . Components for Vauxhall cars are said to cross and recross EU borders at least  times before theyre finally assembled in Ellesmere Port.But removing tarf and non-tarf barriers is precisely what the Customs Union and the European Single Market were originally created to do. The EU is first of all a free trade area, the most comprehensive in the world. When Britain decided to leave, it meant that frictions would inevitably . Theresa May has been trying to square the circle ever since: getting the benefits of a single market without being in it.Shes achieved quite a lot, to give her credit. Under her orce deal, Britain gets broad access in to the single market in goods without having to accept free movement. But the cost was always going to be some continued observance of the EUrsquos regulations, plus ECJ oversight. Weve had to agree to ldquodynamic alignment with EU regulations, meaning that when they change in future Britain will have to go along with the new rules.The obvious solution might be to just join the single market, as Norway did after . It is not in the EU, the Common Fisheries Policy or the Common Agricultural Policy. This is Nicola Sturgeons preferred option, and she said last week thatScotland even got the same deal as Northern Ireland, which is to remain largely in the ESM, she would vote for the Withdrawal Agreement. But while this Norway option has worked after a fashion, it has powerful critics. It costs quite a lot, and there have long been complaints in Oslo about ldquofax democracy - that new laws are simply faxedfrom Brussels. But hey ndash thats just how these things work. You are either in the EU or you arent.So what happens now  Mays deal wont fly, yet she stands her ground. The deal will almost certainly be rejected in parliament, even though Labour dont really have a coherent alternative. Jeremy Corbyn was scathing about Mayrsquos ldquobotched deal, but he too wants to leave the EU. Nor do Labour wish Britain to be a formal member of the Customs Union or the European Single Market. John McDonnell, the Shadow Chancellor, says he would renegotiate the deal to achieve a ldquoclose and collaborative relationship with the single market. In other words, a better deal than Mayrsquos. But the German Chancellor, Angela Merkell, has made clear that negotiations are over. End of story.Faced with a disastrous no deal, and no prospect of renegotiating the Withdrawal Agreement, the opposition parties face a very hard parliamentary choice next month. Do they join with Jacob Rees Mogg and the DUP, and vote for an economic disaster which would damage the livelihoods of countless Labour voters  Or do they suck it up, back Theresa May and then blame the Tories in future for landing Britain with such a bad settlement  If they vote down Mayrsquos orce deal, they must know that renegotiation is not now an option. Nor is a general election, because the Tories wonrsquot vote, like turkeys, for an early Christmas. The only alternative is for the opposition parties to do what they should have done months ago: unite the Remain majority in the House of Commons to demand a delay on Article , and then force May to hold a repeat referendum.If parliament cant decide what to do, the only option is to hand it back to the people who got us into this mess in the first place: the voters."},{"url":null,"title":"tumultuous-brexit-events-could-have-implications-for-scotlands-economy","story":"Arguably, the publication of the Draft Withdrawal agreement was an attempt to reconcile the un-reconcilable.

After two-and-a-half years of debate, this basic economic reality has not been reconciled with the political reality of the Irish border question.But it is vital that a comprehensive deal is reached on the UKrsquos economic future with the EU.Most economists share the view that integration with your nearest trading partners helps support faster economic growth. It opens up opportunities for exports, deepens supply chains and incentivises international investment.Being a member of the European Union has also helped to support migration into Scotland, something that will be of increasing importance in the years ahead as our population ages.

A Brexit deal that is already dead in the water with the Prime Ministerrsquos own authority at risk as the Tory Party implodes with resignation after resignation from the Government. It is increasingly clear, the Prime Minister is, or now, still in office ndash but she is not in power.The Brexit deal satisfies no one, not least the people of Scotland. Instead of coming back with a deal that protects the economy across the UK, the Prime Minister has shown utter contempt once again to the Scottish people. Despite the fact that Scotland voted to remain in the European Union, the Prime Minister has decided to ignore our interests. Yet, the UK Government has agreed a dferentiated deal for Northern Ireland ndash but sold Scotland out. Quite rightly, Northern Ireland is to receive access to the European market, but that dferentiation puts Scotland at a real competitive disadvantage. We are being left high and dry by this deal. England and Wales will get what they voted for, remain voting Northern Ireland is guaranteed a special deal to stay close to the EU, yet Scotland, with the highest vote to remain of any UK nation, has our democratic wishes ignored. Instead, Theresa May wants Scotland to pay the price of a Brexit we didnrsquot support - with lost jobs, household incomes slashed and our NHS under threat.Now I wonrsquot pretend that I expect any Tory Party leader to put the interests of Scotland before their narrow party political interests ndash the broken promises of consecutive conservative leaders have taught us not to expect anything less from them. However, the context in which this conservative leader finds herself should at least cause the Prime Minister to pause for serious consideration. Consideration of the offering we in the Scottish National Party have put to her time and time again. We will vote for a deal that delivers membership of the Single Market and the Customs Union. Such a deal would protect our economy, safeguard jobs and maintain living standards. Anything less is economic catastrophe. With  strong MPs, the SNP has  votes ndash and with the parliamentary arithmetic as it is, stacked against the Prime Minister and her insufficient deal, Theresa May should start listening. She should change course.It is time for the Prime Minister toto Brussels and extend Article  to secure continued membership of the single market and the customs union. It is time for the Prime Minister to take her head out of the sand and be realistic. Thousands of jobs will be lost unless a deal is secured that will protect the future of economy. It is completely reckless to risk. Playing a game of wait and see isnrsquot good enough. There is little time left, the Prime Minister cannot sit and wait to seethe Brexiteers to come with their pitchforks. She needs to show some leadership and recognise her deal cannot get through the commons, therefore she must deliver a new deal. Only one deal will carry a majority and secure our economic future ndash and that is a deal that secures continued membership of the single market and the customs union.It has been an excruciating week for the Prime Minister, her party is ided and now she is desperate. There is only one way to see off defeat, and that is to finally put the interests of citizens across the UK first not the interests of the Tory Party. I urge the Prime Minister to take the compromise and keep us in the single market and the customs union. Should she fail, she will not be forgiven and I do not mean just by those with the pitchforks in her own party. The SNP will not allow Scotlandrsquos future to be put at risk or our economy to be ripped apart.

It was a stlingly humid, rainy day in the midst of civil war in the West African nation of Liberia when I met him back in .Along with a few other boy soldiers, J-Boy was guarding a makesht checkpoint on the Po River bridge some  miles or so from the Liberian capital Monrovia.High on cocaine and alcohol and heavily armed, the boys were in an unpredictable, volatile mood and hell-bent on extorting whatever they could from terried civilians fleeing along the road from nearby fighting.Clearly wary of our presence as journalists, my driver offered the boys cigarettes to try and relax the situation before myself and a colleague began chatting with them.Like most boy soldiers J-Boy had a swaggering, boastful air and carried his assault rle like some totemic macho badge of honour. Had he himself ever killed anyone  I eventually asked tentatively.ldquoOh sure man, plenty, plenty, he replied, grinning widely, his eyes scarily unblinking. ldquoWith this good AK, itrsquos way easy, killing, he assured me, slapping the assault rle in his lap while speaking Kreyol, the English-based pidgin spoken by many people in Liberia.It was a disquieting confession, one I had little doubt was true. The AK he was referring to of course was the AK-automatic rle, or lsquoKalashnikovrsquo as itrsquos more commonly known throughout the world.Itrsquos been said that the Russian name most often uttered across the globe is not Lenin, Stalin or Putin, but Kalashnikov. The reason is depressingly simple, for there is estimated to be as many as  million Kalashnikov rles in circulation worldwide, thatrsquos almost one for every  people.The Kalashnikov is not just any gun, but a brand name that straddles continents and is as familiar as Coca Cola. With its distinctive banana curved magazine clip, the rles familiar silhouette is part of modern iconography.Mexican drug cartel gunmen boast about their cuernos de chivo, or ldquogoat horns, because of its curved magazine. In Lebanon that same silhouette has made its way onto the flag of the Islamist Hezbollah movement while in Mozambique it features on the countryrsquos coat of arms.In other African countries, the shortened form lsquoKalash, has even become a boysrsquo name. In Britain meanwhile there is a well known racehorse named Kalashnikov, while its cultural symbolism has found its way into movies like Jackie Brown by Quentin Tarantino where black market arms dealer Ordell Robbie played by Samuel L. Jackson, praises its effectiveness for ldquowhen yoursquove absolutely, positively, got to kill every mother****** in the room.The reality of the Kalashnikov of course is anything but glamorous. It is, in effect, the modern worldrsquos most plentul and efficient killing machine, an infamous utensil of death.Had he been alive today the weaponrsquos designer, former Second World War Russian tank sergeant, Mikhail Kalashnikov, would have been  years old last week. How ironic it is that Kalashnikov himself was born almost a year to the day,  November , after the signing of the armistice on November  , that ended the First World War.No firearm of any kind has killed more people than the Kalashnikov. In the  years since its first prototype was made, the AK- has dealt death to millions. Every year, small arms kill between , and , people in the worldrsquos conflicts with the Kalashnikov accounting for a high proportion and quite possible the majority of this human toll. Kalashnikovs make up more than one in ten of all firearms globally.Despite having been around weapons for most of my working le, Irsquove always felt acutely uncomfortable by their presence. On a point of professional and ethical principle countless times Irsquove declined the chance to hold or be photographed let alone fire a weapon. It only makes an already dficult job more complex when reporters, non-combatants, are seen to be shouldering any kind of arms.Only once have I broken this cardinal rule back in the s in the remote mountains of Afghanistan.ldquoShoot, shoot, mister Daoud! insisted the Afghan commander of my guerrilla hosts for the umpteenth time, as we sat one day watching his men train at a remote camp in a craggy valley in the Hindu Kush mountains.With his holy warriors looking on, the commander slotted a full clip of the boat-tailed bullets designed to give more accuracy into a Soviet-made Kalashnikov and thrust the weapon towards me.There was an uneasy pause, but judging by the looks of the fighters around me, this had simply boiled down to an issue of initiation and acceptance, a very Afghan thing about loyalty and brotherhood. To refuse my hosts now would have made my presence at best uncomfortable, and at worst, untenable.I explained that I would do this one time only, that no photographs should be taken and that he must never ask me to do it again. The commander gave me his assurance and after only minutes of instruction, a battered plastic bottle was set up some distance away as a target.As I squeezed the trigger and the first rounds cracked against some rocks reasonably close to the bottle, the gawping bearded guerrillas who had clustered around began to grin. It wasnt a question of them ever expecting me to fire in earnest, just about passing some strange communal ritual.In the event the experience was to prove instructive, for the ease with which I was able to handle the rle made me realise why the AK- had gained its reputation as a so-called ldquouser-friendly weapon.I realised too why it had become the firearm of choice among mercenary suppliers and illegal arms dealers, who know that those who end up shouldering this oddly toy-like weapon - which fires  rounds a minute, each powerful enough to punch a hole through a personrsquos chest from  yards - will have had little or no proper military training. Or, put another way, it is ideal for everyone from Afghan peasant farmers to school-kids-turned-killers like J-Boy in Liberia or some marauding civilian gunman in an incomprehensible blood lust in a shopping mall.So robust and simple is the Kalashnikov that quite literally itrsquos a gun that child soldiers can take apart and put back together in  seconds.While not especially accurate the gunrsquos controls are unsophisticated with plenty of clearance between it moving parts meaning no matter how clogged it gets with Syrian dust or Congolese mud its mechanism is unlikely to jam and those who use these weapons like such reliability.The Kalashnikovis a weapon for ldquothe small-statured, the mechanically disinclined, the dim witted, and the untrained, observed former US marine turned war correspondent CJ Chivers in his remarkable book The Gun: The Story of the AK-.It is a weapon, he notes chillingly, that allows ldquoordinary men to kill other men without extensive training or complications. So durable is the gun that as a reporter in Afghanistan in , Chivers saw an AK- stamped with the manufacturing date of , something I too have similarly witnessed.Currently some  dferent types of Kalashnikovs are now produced in at least  countries and vast quantities of the weapons have turned up in trouble spots all over the world for decades, especially in Africa.Hundreds of thousands of them disappeared after the breakup of Yugoslavia frequently ending up in the hands of terrorists and criminals. Most of the Kalashnikovs used in the Paris attacks at Charlie Hebdo and the Bataclan theatre were purchased in Belgium and traced back to the Balkans.Recently too the war in eastern Ukraine against Russia-backed separatists has led to the uncontrolled spread of Kalashnikovs throughout the country.ldquoUkraine has turned into a supermarket for illegal weapons, says Heorhiy Uchaikin, who heads the Ukrainian association of gun owners, and estimates that Ukrainians now illegally possess as many as  million firearms the majority Kalashnikovs.ldquoIn Ukraine, a gun is like shoe polish in a shoe polish factory, Uchaikin recently observed.If ready availability makes the Kalashnikov ubiquitous, so to does its cost. According to a report by Global Financial Integrity, which monitors illicit financial flows, procuring an AK- on the black market depends on a number of factors, notably the further it travels.In Afghanistan, the gun could cost as little as  while on Mexicorsquos northern border with the US, the price would increase to ,. In Belgium where the Paris Charlie Hebdo perpetrators obtained their Balkan Kalashnikovs, it has a price tag of about ,. An authentic model would cost , in Pakistan but a locally produced model can be obtained in the countryrsquos frontier bazaars for as little as . It is also possible to obtain an AK- through the darknet where costs typically range from , to ,.The independent research group Small Arms Survey based in Geneva points also to the fact that cheaper weapons prices lead to an increased risk of civil war, independently of other conflict risk factors.Countries with more porous borders tend also to have lower weapons prices. This is especially the case in Africa, where such borders allow the supply of weapons to meet demand more readily.The Survey says that in Africa, Kalashnikov prices are the lowest in the world and falling. Income, regulatory effectiveness, war legacy, and supply cost iables all lower the price of weapons, but even controlling for these factors, being located in an African country makes purchasing an assault rle around US  cheaper than the world average.During years of working across the African continent, I have stood on many dirt airstrips watching Soviet-era cargo planes being loaded up with crates of grenade launchers, ammunition and Kalashnikovs much of which often appeared to have been beneath the radar deliveries with little in the way of accompanying ldquopaperwork.ldquoAfrican conflicts are wasteful of weapons ammunition and are always in need of more. The guys who carry this stuff in are just flying truck drivers, Alex Vine who has intensively researched the arms trade and today heads the Africa Programme at Chatham House once told me.He has a point. Back in  just before I encountered J-Boy in Liberia I flew into the capital, Monrovia, on the second humanitarian aid flight ever to have reached the country since the upsurge of the civil war a few weeks before. The aircraft was flown by a group of volunteer pilots who told me that days earlier, coming in to land on the first aid flight, they had almost collided with an unscheduled incoming cargo plane.ldquoLater we found out it was flying in ammunition and guns for President Charles Taylor, which some people said was coming from Libya, the Swedish pilot told me.ldquoIts always the same across Africa, you never know who is flying what.One member of the same pilots own crew even admitted to having ldquoferried a few Kalashnikovs and bullets in his time.Illegal trafficking in small arms and light weapons is estimated to be worth . billion to . billion every year, equivalent to about  to  per cent of the legal arms trade. With over a million Kalashnikovs still produced annually, one of the worldrsquos foremost killing machines is set to remain at the centre of the global arms trade for decades to come. Today the Kalashnikov continues to kills more people each day than all the worldrsquos tanks, warplanes and ships combined.As a servant of communism, Mikhail Kalashnikov, who died in , made no money from his invention. Had he been a capitalist as well as a master gunmaker, he would have been a billionaire.Russian President Vladimir Putin has called the Kalashnikov ldquoa symbol of the creative genius of our people.The weapon that made Kalashnikov a Hero of the Soviet Union has also appeared on t-shirts and vodka bottles, featured in videos and song lyrics and been re-fashioned in crystal - a gt from Putin to George W. Bush.Before his death in  however, the designer of the worldrsquos most famous rle expressed more than a few regrets about what he had given the world.ldquoI am proud of my weaponhellip but I wish I had invented a machine which people could use, which could do good, for example, a sowing machine, said the peasants son from Siberia. Unfortunately that will never be and sadly as child soldier J-Boy told me that day on the bridge in Liberia, ldquoWith this good AK, itrsquos way easy, killing."},{"url":null,"title":"the-cool-list-hotels","story":"Built in  by Lord MacDonald of Sleat and once surrounded by orange trees ndash hence the hotelrsquos name ndash Marmalade is a -minute walk from Portree harbour and offers fine views over Portree Bay and to the Cuillins beyond.

We are now all reaping the bitter harvest. The country has been landed with a bad deal and the unedying spectacle of a roguesrsquo gallery of hardline Brexiteers denouncing the product of their own actions.Parliamentary arithmetic means there is little hope of this deal surviving a vote in the Commons.With Jacob Rees-Mogg and the rest of the European Research Group in open rebellion, Dominic Raab joining an ever-growing list of former Brexit Ministers, and other Ministers going and gone, the Toriesrsquo time in Downing Street should surely be up. This is beyond a party political argument.So, of course, while there is an element of drama in watching the Tory party turning on itself, the problems of Theresa Mayrsquos deal are far more serious than that.One of Labourrsquos six tests for the Toriesrsquo Brexit is whether it delivers for all regions and nations of the UK. Theresa Mayrsquos negotiations have patently not produced a deal that delivers for the people of Scotland.Scottish Labour has been clear from the beginning that we need a deal that best supports jobs and our economy. Which is why a few weeks after my election as Scottish Labour leader, I said that we needed a new comprehensive and permanent customs union ndash because you need that to protect our manufacturing industry and its supply chains. This would also be the cleanest and best way to protect the Good Friday Agreement.We also need a strong and stable single market relationship, one that is good for jobs in our service industries. And we need a deal that guarantees no erosion of workersrsquo and consumersrsquo rights and environmental standards.The Tories Brexit proposal delivers none of those things. For these reasons it has to be rejected by the House of Commons ndash and its why every one of Scotlandrsquos Members of Parliament, regardless of party, must vote down Theresa Mayrsquos deal.But the position of the Scottish Conservative Party is now totally untenable. Their leader, Ruth Davidson, and the Scottish Secretary David Mundell, threatened to resignthe deal did not protect the integrity of the UK. Theresa May ignored them ndash but so far they have clung on to their positions. It is remarkable that Dominic Raab has shown more backbone and integrity than either of Scotlandrsquos leading Tories.The SNPrsquos argument that there must be a separate deal for Scotland is not a matter of political principle. It is an exercise in cynical political posturing.For Scotland to be in a customs union, the logical position is for whole of the UK to be in customs union. A hard border between Scotland and the rest of UK would make even worse the economic damage of Brexit. And remember the UK single market is four times more important for Scotlandrsquos economy than the EU single market.But providing the SNP with the excuse to play fast and loose on this issue is yet another way in which Mayrsquos Brexit threatens the integrity of the UK.Should MPs vote the deal down then this would constitute a total loss of confidence in the Government. From there, the right outcome is a General Election so that the people can finish the job they started in  and sweep the Tories from power.A General Election and a change of government is necessary to break this Brexit deadlock and avoid the no deal outcome. A General Election and change of government would create the conditions for the European Union to stop the clock on Article  and to begin meaningful negotiations with a new government that can deliver a deal to parliament and the country.We need a deal that works for the whole of the UK and it is becoming increasingly clear that is something only an incoming Labour government can deliver."},{"url":null,"title":"future-shock-the-question-is-not-whether-ufos-are-real-its-why-the-us-military-have-only-now-admitted-their-existence","story":"If Trevor ever approached you in the city centre, all urine-stained jogging bottoms and uncomfortable familiarity, asking for change towards his train fare home, you wouldnrsquot hesitate to dig deep ndash perhaps handing over your pound smart phone too so he could check the Central Station timetable.Thatrsquos why I believed this establishment-approved Knight of the Realm when he said UFOs were real. The year was  ndash the fag end of true reality, a few years before the mass fractionalisation, isolationism and grotesque self-glorication bequeathed to us by the digital dawn. No phones, no internet, your gran could whistle the Top Ten and  million folk watched Coronation Street. Before Xhamster, Ken Barlowrsquos rampant bed-hopping was all teenagers had to learn about sex.This vacuum of yawning nothingness allowed for mass pop culture crazes that infected entire continents with short-lived delirium ndash and in , the brow of the globersquos collective consciousness was hot and sweaty with X-Files fever.In fact, so seismic was the showrsquos influence that ITV saw fit to dedicate an entire eveningrsquos scheduling to UFOs ndash showcased somewhat predictably in the familiar format of a  debate. Nothing that would scare the horses, then ndash or elderly folk too jiggered to get up and change the channel after Corrie.Saucers full of secretsIT was as a prelude to this peculiar pow-wow that host Sir Trevor greeted viewers with an unforgettable soliloquy. ldquoWersquore here tonight not to decideUFOs are real ndash unidentied flying objects clearly are real, he announced, steely-jawed, unblinking. ldquoSomething is in our skies. Wersquore here to discuss what they could be and from where they might originate.It didnrsquot matter that Trevor was likely reading some faceless producerrsquos hyperbolic spiel from an autocue. The signicance lay in the fact someone who didnrsquot cut his own hair or eat roadkill just told the nation UFOs were real.Even unbound by its ubiquitous acronym, unidentied flying objects being legitimised on ITV should have been a cultural watershed ndash a moment where even the most earthbound of cynics recalibrated their stance.Yet, nearly a quarter of a century later, the credibility of UFOs has lost much of its worth in terms of cultural currency. Even reputable sightings like the darting lights witnessed by several commercial airline pilots over Ireland last week barely registered a raised eyebrow.Perhaps, then, UFOs really are just a fading hangover from less informed times, when our species was far more susceptible to vague notions of the supernatural ndash before smartphone addiction stopped our minds from wandering, killing imagination, wonder and creativity stone dead.Perhaps Sir Trevorrsquos new gig chatting to folk with morals lower than snake testicles ndash not celebs, the monsters he salaciously affords the oxygen of publicity on his abhorrent Inside Death Row show ndash is also indicative of todayrsquos anaesthetised indference to anything thatrsquos not taking place within our own silos.The dying scream of a world quickly spiralling into an uninhabitable, fascist dystopia is being deafened by the static of digital isolation. In such a dystopian, self-obsessed reality, it might actually take something as seismic as the sight of a UFO hovering over a major city to dig us out our deep burrows and unite us again as a species.Escape the netTHE smoking gun often held up by cynics dismissing the UFO phenomenon is the distinct lack of any clear photos in this smartphone-dominated era.Certainly, two major online sites for reporting sightings ndash the National UFO Reporting Center and the Mutual UFO Network ndash have both experienced numerical declines parallel to Gary Glitterrsquos royalty cheques.The internet itself can certainly shoulder some of the blame for UFOs fading fame too. Despite the initial promise that free access to information and instant communication could birth a more enlightened, empowered and equal world, a grotesque funfair mirror reflection of reality has instead haemorrhaged.Without gatekeepers, lies are now afforded an equal  to truth, and the ensuing static serves only to discombobulate focus and perception. In the era of spin, reality distortion, Photoshop and Deepfakes, good luck finding credible evidence of your own existence never mind UFOs. The internet is rather like communism ndash wonderful in theory, but the cradle of true horror when human nature is added to the formulae.At times, however, some notable events do cut through the noise. Commercial pilots are certainly credible witnesses and last weekrsquos incident over the Irish sea proved that very strange things continue to happen in our skies ndash even odder than folk willingly paying pound for a coffee and biscuit.Some of the iniduals now coming forward to tell their stories are actually more plausible witnesses than those we trust to steer us through the clouds in a sky-dart ndash high ranking government employees and military personnel with nothing to gain and everything to lose. Yet, despite waving all manner of prestigious credentials, itrsquos likely they will be taken as seriously as folk who claim to have skinny-dipped with Nessie.Full DisclosureOVER the past few decades, there have been several ldquoofficial movements attempting to find some sort of objective truth on UFOs.The most high profile is lsquoDisclosurersquo, where ufologist Steven Greer herded  whistle-blowers ndashincluding astronaut Gordon Cooper and a brigadier general ndash for a fascinating press conference held in Washington DC in . The aim  To ldquoestablish the reality of extraterrestrial vehicles, le forms and advanced propulsion technologies. The bantz at that Christmas party must be awesome.Yet, groups like Disclosure are finding it tough to gain publicity in the mainstream media, where editors have licked a finger and held it to the wind, deeming the public has lost its appetite for such frivolity in an age filled with real clear and present otherworldly dangers.But who needs the media as a conduit when the lying, conspiring governments themselves are now releasing the most intriguing and credible UFO evidence for public consumption Perhaps most jaw-dropping of all the recently declassied military footage released by the US Defence Department is an encounter between Navy F- fighters and several unidentied aircraft. The recording captures several pilots discussing a hovering egg-shaped craft, apparently one of a ldquofleet. Another film trumps that however ndash showing an F-rsquos close encounter with what is clearly, well, an unidentied flying object.More sober mindsets will speculatethis was simply space junk catching the sunrsquos light or even an advanced craft piloted by tiny Russians. Yet, such speculation itself suggests something even more terrying than the existence of UFOs ndash that we might actually be completely alone in the universe. Or perhaps were simply in too early a stage of evolution to be interesting.The Pentagon comes cleanIF itrsquos a credible UFO whistleblower yoursquore after, perhaps someone with a lot to lose from being subject to ridicule from his peers, then Christopher Mellon is your man ndash a former deputy assistant Secretary of Defence for Intelligence for the Clinton and George W Bush administrations.Bemoaning the lack of transparent government investigations into valid sightings, Mellon recently told the Washington Post: ldquoI know from numerous discussions with Pentagon officials over the past two years that military departments and agencies treat such incidents as isolated events rather than as part of a pattern requiring serious attention and investigation.He also makes reference to his colleague Luis Elizondo - who used to run a Pentagon intelligence program examining evidence of ldquoanomalous aircraft - resigning in protest at the US governmentrsquos seeming indference to a ldquogrowing body of empirical data.ldquoNobody wants to be lsquothe alien guyrsquo in the national security bureaucracy, Mellon soberly concluded. ldquoNobody wants to be ridiculed or sidelined for drawing attention to the issue. Yet, the current attitude is a serious and recurring impediment to progress.Other declassied documents reveal that the US Air Force recently launched several F- fighters in a failed attempt to intercept an unidentied high-speed aircraft darting over the Pacic. Defence Department officials also confirmed more than a dozen similar incidents taking place off the US East Coast since .Itrsquos perhaps no coincidence that these stories emerged not long after the Pentagon itself publicly acknowledged the existence of a program dedicated to studying unidentied flying objects. The soberly-monikered Advanced Aviation Threat Identication Program ran from  to , but many officials claim its efforts have simply resumed under another name. Either way, admission of its existence has marked one of the most signicant disclosures about UFO government research since the infamous Project Blue Book, a y US Air Force study into thousands of sightings that was shut down in .Officially, Project Blue Book failed to find ldquoany technological developments or principles beyond the range of present-day scientic knowledge, yet a small number of its investigations remain unexplained. And thatrsquos the thing ndasheven one of the millions of UFO sightings is true, then the phenomenon is conclusively proven. Just one.Wharsquos like US FAR from being a spectacle confined to the toothless whispers of mulleted banjo prodigies, Scotland is no stranger to wee visits from aliens, interdimentional structures, highly evolved sky dragons and time travellers from the future. Perhaps all fouryoure in Port Glasgow.Just last year, an Airbus A with  people on board which was making its final approach into Glasgow airport, came within  feet of colliding with a ldquoblue, yellow and silver object, which pilots witnessed flying underneath it. The disturbed crew immediately contacted air traffic control, stating: ldquoNot quite sure what it was but itrsquos definitely quite large and itrsquos blue and yellow. Prestwick airport backed up the sighting, with radar detecting an ldquounidentied track history . miles east of the planes position  seconds earlier.However Scotlandrsquos most infamous UFO tale, unique in British history as the only example of a close encounter becoming the subject of a criminal investigation, is known as The Livingston Incident. Forestry worker Robert Taylor claims he saw \"a huge flying dome\" in woodland near Dechmont Law on November , , describing it as seven metres in diameter, and made of a dark metallic material with a rough texture like sandpaper.Taylor claimed to have experienced an acrid smell \"like burning brakes\" and the sensation of being dragged. When police visited the site, they found marks in the soil where the craft was said to have hovered, and further tracks following the path of two ldquomine-like objects. Taylor, who died in , never sought publicity or financial gain ndash and always stood by his account.Perhaps he would have found a more sympathetic audience in Bonnybridge, home of the infamous Falkirk Trianglersquo. This well-kent ndash and henceforth thoroughly monetised ndash phenomenon was first reported in  and the area still continues to register around  sightings a year, more than any other place on Earth ndash even more than the notorious Area  in Nevada. The fact it attracts a lot of UFO tourists who are perhaps inclined to believe in the phenomenon ndash and also want their moneys worth ndash is neither here nor there, of course.Scots UFO expert Ron Halliday says: \"One theory is that there could be a window into another dimension, other worlds, the past or the future. Even Nessie probably thinks thats a bit outlandish. Although where  would you visit but Scotlandthis planet is simply some sort of space zoo for holidaying Zeta Reticulians And finally hellipTemporal lobe epilepsy is an unenviable yet fascinating condition that many doctors deem entirely responsible for all occurances of inexplicable supernatural phenomena, from UFOs to religious communion to the indeterminate forces holding Donald Trumprsquos barnet together.Those afflicted may not be aware of their condition, unwittingly suffering brief seizures, paralysis, vivid hallucinations and ndash notably ndash an overwhelming feeling of something other in their vicinity.If UFOs are indeed a purely internally projected phenomenon, we can then safely assume such stories would likely reflect current sociological, technological and cultural fears and aspirations.Certainly during the Cold War, the beings described in these close encounters were often characterised as benign saviours who wanted to help humans overcome the prospect of nuclear annihilation.And after events such as Watergate and the Vietnam war fuelled mass distrust in government, witnesses came to describe UFOs as a threat to humanity ndash their sinister occupants often rendering abductees powerless and repeatedly probing them intimately against their will.Looks like this might just be another column about Brexit after all."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa-may-takes-swipe-at-tory-critics-ahead-of-critical-week-for-brexit","story":"The Prime Minister warned that a change of leadership would not make it easier to get a deal past parliament or the EU, after furious Brexiteer backbenchers started moves to remove her.She told Skyrsquos Ridge On Sunday that as far as she knew the -letter threshold for letters of no confidence needed to start a leadership battle had yet to be reached.In a message to those plotting her downfall, including members of the European Research Group of Eurosceptic MPs, she said she had not considered quitting.She added: ldquoA change of leadership at this point isnrsquot going to make the negotiations any easier and it isnrsquot going to change the parliamentary arithmetic.ldquoWhat it will do is bring in a degree of uncertainty.

Well you canrsquot dredge a rocky bottom, so wersquore not doing that.As MBL developed its processes to remove alginate from the seaweed, it found marine cellulose was also produced.Dr Mark Dorris, a senior research fellow and lecturer in material science at Edinburghrsquos Napier University, has been working with that to create new bioplastic materials, the starting point of which are fibres that are ,th of the width of a human hair.Wood pulp is already used to produce nanocellulose, but Dr Dorris said when kelp is used the end result is ldquobetter than any nanocellulose in the world.This raw product can be turned into bioplastics to be used in food packagingfor products such as sandwiches andready meals, but work has also beentaking place with the Ministry of Defence to develop a ldquotransparent armourthat could be used for helmet visors and body shields by police and the armed services.The nanocellulose could also be usedto develop slow release drugs for treating colon cancer, as well as to helpconserve fragile, historic documentsand artefacts.Dr Dorris said: ldquoTherersquos loads of applications for this, medical implants, meshes. This stuff, because it is made from seaweed, is biocompatible, the wood cellulose isnrsquot.But Mr Mackie said he fears plans to develop such products could be haltedMSPs vote through the legislation as it currently stands on Wednesday.He said: ldquoWe worked long and hard to develop our process, basically we have turned the whole alginate processing upside down, to get to what is unique, nobody  does it.ldquoWersquove got this brilliant raw material, we do a wee bit of magic with it.ldquoThis is the thing I am most proud of that we have done, and when I see what these guys can do it is just incredible.For Sir David, though, his concerns for kelp remain.He said: ldquoIt is perfectly possible to harvest them sustainably by removing their fronds while leaving the rest of the plant intact.ldquoBut dredging ndash or indeed any kind of harvesting that removes the whole plant ndash is a wholly short-sighted measure that risks the wholesale devastation of our kelp beds.ldquoI urge decision makers to take the necessary action to protect these vital,and globally important, habitats."},{"url":null,"title":"mark-smith-why-this-brexit-fiasco-could-eventually-give-us-all-peace-of-mind","story":"Forty-seven years on from that revealing little moment in political history, Theresa May now faces a vote of her own in the Commons to pretty much undo all of Ted Heathrsquos work and it makes you wonder what music might be appropriate this time round. Messiaenrsquos Quartet for the End of Time perhaps. Or John Cagersquos piece for organ, As Slow as Possible, which takes  years to perform. Or maybe even Eh-Oh by the Teletubbies. Any of them might symbolise the mess wersquore in now: the disorder, the ision, the dragged-out damage.To make some sense of it all, it might be useful to remember what Edward Heath thought he had achieved in  as well as the approach he took to some of the controversies that are still with us, such as referendums. Mr Heath said in lsquo that he believed the British people would eventually see the wider benefits of the European Community, particularly peace and prosperity. ldquoI believe they will become convinced that this is where the future of modern Britain lies, he said.For a while, they did, although Ted Heath did have to fight hard to win a majority in the Commons. He also resisted the pressure to hold a referendum, which some said was the only way to avoid the claim that the Government was dragging the country into the Common Market against its will. Mr Heath took a view that now looks impossibly elitist or hugely realistic: in a parliamentary democracy, he said, it would be irresponsible to leave a decision on so critical and complex an issue to the electorate.It obviously wouldnrsquot be easy for a politician to express that kind of view now, but there are lessons for Theresa May to learn from Ted Heathrsquos experiences ndash not easy ones though. Specically, in one respect Mrs Mayneeds to do exactly the same as Ted Heath did, which is to aim for the reasonable centre of the electorate, which still exists and which supports remaining in the EU, a soft Brexit, or some pragmatic compromise.However, it now looks like she can only achieve that result , in another respect, she does exactly the opposite to Ted Heath. Heath thought referendums contradicted the principles of parliamentary democracy ndash and they do ndash but in the circumstances wersquore in, another public vote is the only way to get us away from the extremes of Brexit. In fact, a second vote may end up being one of the few redeeming features of this process by recalibrating us back to where all the good and sensible stuff happens in politics: the centre ground.It is likely to happen because of the logistics of where we are. Theresa May did not ndash and realistically could not ndash stick to her Remain principles when she took over as leader of the Conservative party, but she has achieved the best deal in the circumstances ndash some of which were unavoidable, some of which were self-inflicted.The unavoidable bit was the UKrsquos border with Ireland ndash a hard border is impossible without being a member of the customs union ndash whereas the self-inflicted bit was Mrs Mayrsquos insistence on ending the free movement of people, which ruled out membership of the single market. In this version of our world ndash part reality, part unreality created by Mrs May ndash the deal we have is the only practical option.All of that means that the next few stages in the process are pretty much inevitable. Mrs May is still trying to appease Brexiters by promising that a wonderful free trade deal is still on the horizon but unless we can reach a deal that avoids a hard border in Ireland ndash and no one has come up with one ndash then, under Mrs Mayrsquos plan, Britain will eventually enter the backstop outlined in the withdrawal agreement. Realistically, the backstop is also likely to form the basis of the long-term relationship between the UK and the EU: in other words, a UK-wide customs union with Northern Ireland retaining some elements of the single market.However, we know, and Mrs May knows, that there is no majority in the Commons for that, which leaves only four options: three unlikely and one almost inevitable. The unlikely options are, first, a no-deal Brexitsecond, a re-negotiation of the deal, which the EU has already ruled out whatever Andrea Leadsom says and third, a general election, which neither Theresa May nor any other Tory PM would go for.Which leaves us with the fourth option: another referendum. Ted Heath was right to resist one when he was PM, but  years on, another public vote will soon be Mrs Mayrsquos only choice. She cannot appeal to the right-wing extremists who think the same way about Brexit as some Christian evangelists think about gay-cure therapy ndash that the facts of le can be changed by faith. In insisting on her version of Brexit, she has also ruled out support from the hardcore Remainers and the SNP.However, increating a situation where a second vote on Brexit is now the only option, Mrs May could be doing us all a favour. There is always a chance the result will be another vote for Leave, but the polls show a vote for Remain is increasingly likely. If so, that could help quieten the extremists of all kinds ndash Brexiter, Socialist, Northern Irish Unionist and Scottish Nationalist ndash and take us back to the centre of politics. A good result in a second referendum on Brexit might also achieve a little of what Edward Heath felt in Number  on the evening of th October : a sense that the world is in the right order, a feeling that we are doing whatrsquos best for Britain, and maybe even some longed-for peace of mind."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa-may-says-her-brexit-plan-is-best-for-britains-jobs-as-she-faces-critical-week","story":"In a message to her political rivals, the Prime Minister stressed that Brexit was not an exercise in \"political theory\" but something that affected peoples lives and livelihoods.In Brussels, Michel Barnier, the European Unions chief negotiator, said the Brexit process was at a \"key moment\" and urged all sides to remain \"calm\".One of the remaining details to be resolved is how long a possible extension to the transition period - effectively keeping the UK aligned with the EU after Brexit - could last for. This is an option because, in theory, it would help avoid having to have a backstop period.Intriguingly, Greg Clark, the Business Secretary, talked up the prospect, saying it had ldquooption value.There has been speculation that a one-off extension,sought when the agreed transition period expired at the end of , could last until the end of .Mrs May conspicuously did not knock the idea down but stressed she would want it to be over by the time of the next scheduled general election in June , while Mr Barnier said an extension could not be \"indefinite\" and a deadline would be decided in talks this week.However, a question hangs over whether or not extending the transition would mean putting off the day the UK took back full control of its fishing waters.At present, Britain will become an independent coastal state on Brexit Day. However, the UK Government has agreed that for the transition period the countryrsquos fishing industry will comply with the regime of the hated Common Fisheries Policy until December .Given that quotas are set in December for the following  months, any extension to the transition could mean that UK fishermen would be bound by the CFP for another year. If, as Mr Barnier has suggested, the transition might extend to December , this could mean the UK adhering to CFP rules until December  more than seven years after the  vote to leave the EU.Any extension to the transition that meant UK fishermen continuing to abide by CFP rules would be anathema to Scottish Conservatives, who have threatened to vote against Mrs Mayrsquos proposed deal,this were the case.But it has been suggested the draft withdrawal agreement ldquokicks the can down the road as it simply says on the future of fisheries that both sides would use their ldquobest endeavours to come up with what happens beyond December  with an agreed plan by July .Mr Barnier and others have flagged up the possibility of slapping tarfs on UK fishing productsthere is no guarantee of continued access for EU boats to UK waters.This morning, the PM took her Brexit message to the CBI conference as she sought to win business backing for her plans.CBI director-general Carolyn Fairbairn told the event in east London: \"It is a compromise. But it is hard-won progress.\"She said firms were already spending hundreds of millions on preparations for a no-deal Brexit.In her keynote speech, Mrs May said: \"We are not talking about political theory but the reality of peoples lives and livelihoods. Jobs depend on us getting this right.\"And what we have agreed unashamedly puts our future economic success, and the livelihoods of working families up and down this country, first.\"But Brexit-supporting businessman Roger Kendrick challenged her over her plans, which he said would restrict the ability to strike trade deals with countries outside the EU, telling Mrs May: \"Think again about the economics of the whole thing.\"The PM told him: \"The portrayal that you have given of what has been agreed is a little inaccurate,\" adding: \"It makes sense for us to continue having a good trading relationship with the European Union...but also have the freedom, which we will have, to sign those trade deals around the rest of the world.\"In Brussels, Mr Barnier updated ministers from the  remaining EU nations on the state of the Brexit process.Austrian EU minister Gernot Blumel said it was \"a painful week in European politics\" and \"we have the orce papers on the table,  years of dficult marriage are coming to an end\".Luxembourgs foreign minister, Jean Asselborn, said: \"This deal that is now on the table is the best there is. There is no better deal for this crazy Brexit.\"Askedhe thought Mrs May could survive, Mr Asselborn said: \"I believe she can convince her party and perhaps a part of parliament which is not on her side, so that this deal can become reality.\"The question of Mrs Mays survival is one that the EU are watching closely as Tory rebels continued to attack her plan although there still remained doubt as to whether or not they had the  signatories needed to spark a no-confidence vote. A total of  have gone public. Some MPs who were said to have put in letters to Sir Graham Brady, who chairs the  backbench committee, refused to confirm publicly they had done so.The message from both the PM and the EU representatives in Brussels was that there could be no unpicking of the orce deal, although work on the blueprint for the future relationship continues.Mrs May made clear the proposed withdrawal plan had been \"agreed in full\" by both sides.However, David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary, said: \"This deal is not what the people voted for. It will tie us to the customs union for years to come with no way out.\"But there is still time to negotiate a Canada+++ deal that delivers on the referendum. So lets get on with it.\"And Boris Johnson, the former Foreign Secretary, made yet another colourful attack on her plan.He used a column in Mondaysto describe the agreement as a \"-page fig leaf [that] does nothing to cover the embarrassment of our total defeat\".Calling for the scrapping of the Northern Ireland backstop, he added: \"We should massively accelerate our preparations to exit on World Trade Organisation terms, with a new Secretary of State responsible for all the cross-government work.\"There would, of course, be some disruption in that outcome, but by no means as much as sometimes predicted.\"And it is our failure to make proper preparations that has so gravely weakened our negotiations.\""},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9061484.jpg?type=article-full","title":"facebooks-45m-fund-for-80-local-newspaper-jobs","story":"Newspaper companies and the National Council for the Training of Journalists will run the pilot scheme designed to bring more local reporters to communities.Recruits will have ied levels of education and experience and the NCTJ will steer and assess training.Called the Community News Project, it could be extendedsuccessful.Read more:Reporters to be hired as part of the BBCs local democracy talent poolNewsquest, JPIMedia, Reach, Archant and the Midland News Association have joined the scheme.The goal is to boost newsgathering from towns and villages \"which have lost their local newspaper or beat reporters\".Nick Wrenn, head of news partnerships at Facebook, above, said: \"Local newspapers keep people up to date on everything thats going on in a community, but also play a vital role in holding local councils and institutions to account.\"We recognise the important role Facebook plays in how people get their news today, and we want to do more to support local publishers.\"Sian Cox-Brooker, strategic partner manager at Facebook, said that local news \"is also the best way of finding out what is going on in your community\".She said: \"At Facebook we know that it is what people want to read.\"The news comes as the Cairncross Review, under the chairmanship of Dame Frances Cairncross, is looking at how to sustain high-quality journalism in a changing market.Read more:Facebook linking to more local news sitesToby Granville, editorial director at Newsquest, parent company of Herald and Times, said: \"This initiative will mean that we can e deeper into our communities to engage with them about what matters most at a more granular level.\"These new journalists will be able to help fill a void of rich content while establishing new audiences in otherwise untapped areas and help build a sustainable future for community news.\"The NCTJ and publishers will focus on recruiting trainees from a range of backgrounds, designed to reflect the ersity of local communities.Joanne Butcher, chief executive of the NCTJ said that community journalists will have access to a full training programme from the NCTJ while working.She said: \"Trainees without the NCTJ Diploma in Journalism will receive training to achieve the qualication, while those who have passed the diploma will work towards a new National Qualication in Journalism for community journalists.\"They will also have access to a range of training from Facebook focused on digital newsgathering skills.\"Read more: Two new national newspapers launched in ScotlandShe added: \"We are very proud to support the sustainability of quality local journalism by overseeing the recruitment of additional local news journalists from erse and inclusive backgrounds and by ensuring they are properly trained and qualied.\"Karyn Fleeting, head of audience at Reach PLC, said: \"Community news is shared widely on Facebook, on pages and in community groups, and this collaboration will help us reach communities which dont currently benefit from in-depth community news.\"We think it will be good for journalism, good for our newsrooms and good for the local communities we serve.\"Laura Adams, content director at Archant, added: \"We hope it can play a small part in boosting community engagement in towns, cities and counties across the UK, and open up new opportunities for the next generation of journalistic talent.\"The application process begins next year but the NCTJ and publishers will visit to schools, universities and industry events across the country to talk about the project, and encourage more young people to think about a career in journalism."},{"url":null,"title":"sturgeon-mps-could-potentially-back-my-brexit-plan","story":"The First Minister said she believed the Commons could yet back remaining in the single market and customs union, despite many MPs regarding it as ldquoBrexit in name only.Ms Sturgeon also told the National Economic Forum in Dundee she feared Theresa Mayrsquos Brexit plan would leave Scotland at a ldquoreal competitive disadvantage to Northern Ireland.She said Ulsterrsquos tighter regulatory alignment with the EU -

At the time the Prime Minister made clear this was not something she wanted to happen but,it did, it would only last a few months beyond December .Yet, because fishing quotas are set in December for the following  months, any transition extension that included fishing, would mean the UK not taking back full control of its fishing waters until December  at the earliest.However on Monday, Mrs May and Greg Clark, the Business Secretary, appeared more amenable to the option after Michel Barnier, the EUrsquos chief negotiator, spoke about a possible extension to December .Mrs May told the CBIrsquos annual conference that any transition extension would have to end well before the next General Election due in June .

Jim therefore tried to find historical accuracy as far as possible by researching contemporary documents and manuscripts that held vital evidence.\"There are certain liberties you can take, like for example the drumming used by the armies preparing for battle and that is often for dramatic effect.\"The film is billed as a \"true David versus Goliath story\" of how the great th-century \"outlaw king\" Robert the Bruce used cunning and bravery to defeat the larger and better-equipped occupying English army.At the films debut during the Toronto Film Festival last year there were a few raised eyebrows when American actor Chris Pine, who plays Bruce, appeared full-frontal naked in one scene.Directed by Oscar-nominated film-maker David Mackenzie the epic was shot in ious Scottish locations throughout  and Jim spent six months working on the diegetic soundtrack.Jim said: \"I had a meeting with David Mackenzie just a few weeks before the shoot and none of this particular aspect was planned.

We all love it.\"Gill Arrowsmith and Shirley Sinclair both thought the painting was \"fantastic\" while Annemarie Simpson thought that a similar venture in Wick would help tackle the \"towns eyesore\" buildings.While on that subject, one dissenting voice condemned the piece and said there was a \"masterpiece eyesore now in Wilson Street thanks to Caithness Horizons\".Beauty is, of course, in the eye of the beholder.The mural depicts a portrait of Thursos renowned botanist and geologist Robert Dick surrounded by a kaleidoscopic representation of the CHMAG facade and the scientists specimen collection.The bold use of line and colour based on modern urban graffiti cannot fail to be noticed just like the mural on nearby Tollemache House but is sited in a much less conspicuous space ndash the gallerys car park.CHMAGs curator Merran Gunn, who was instrumental in commissioning Delaye to create the work, said the artist had also spray painted a wall within the building as part of a show running called Graffito.His earlier piece has an explosive anime style figure punching out of the wall toward the viewer.\"Marcs work is bold and vibrant, electric colours jostle for dominance, and the new outside mural is no exception with tangerine skies set behind the historic Thurso of Robert Dick,\" said Gunn.Thursos illustrious scientist had his herbarium collection feature in an earlier work by the artist Joanne Carr which in turn is featured within Delayes mural ndash a clear case of one artist paying homage to another.\"Graffiti and street art is more relevant than ever whether it be in the art world ndash with the recent record sale of Banksys girl with a balloon ndash or here in the Highlands where graffiti has made its way onto the syllabus at Farr High School through art teacher Tracy Wilkinson,\" she said.After garnering great positive feedback from the current show Merran decided to \"have a moment of spontaneity\" and raised funds through a crowdfunding website and the Dounreay Communities Fund to commission Marc Delaye to breath some le into a fairly drab corner of the town.Tracy Dodson, commercial manager of CHMAG, said that the gallery was \"breaking boundaries\" with Graffito.\"It questions what actually constitutes art and what gets shown in a gallery. Graffito is an exhibition that celebrates artwork that is available to everyone.\"Traditionally graffiti has been seen as anti-social, fringe or even as criminal vandalism, but with an emphasis on social inclusion, we are celebrating street, pop, comic and zine work as mainstream art for hanging in our gallery.\"Tracy unabashedly declares that Graffito is \"aimed at young people and the young at heart, as a way of inviting new and future audiences to a museum and gallery experience\".\"This is a multicoloured on-the-wall exhibition devoted to all manner of graphic mark-making and breaking the boundaries of what art is all about,\" she said. \"We have also hosted street painting and comic workshops, guided gallery tours, and collaborating with our local schools and council.\"Marc Delaye is an established community projects artist with Freshpaint.org which is based on the Black Isle.\"Murals are as alive now as ever before and an excellent way to introduce art to internal and external spaces, giving iniduals and communities something that they can be proud of and enjoy each and every day,\" said Marc.The murals can be privately commissioned and can be an \"ideal means of advertising products, services, messages and campaigns\".Other exhibitors at Graffito include Andy Strachan, of Comic Creations Studios Dundee, David Robertson of Fred Egg Comics and Zu Dominak, all of whom work at the University of Dundee within the Masters degrees in Comics and Graphic Novels ndash the only course of its kind in the UK.Other exhibitors include Victor Nobis and his series Fallen Giants ndash a fantasy dream space where cities like Edinburgh rise and twist through the torso of neon lit giant figures.Graffito finishes on Saturday with a day of childrens workshops, guided tours and a colouring competition.Monday  Nov  : PM"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"November ,  at : amPolice in Kirkwall are appealing for witnesses to an assault, which took place in the early hours of Sunday, to come forward.

We are pleased to confirm we have made some changes to the substation design at Finstown, which we hope will go some way to address concerns raised. We are also pleased to confirm that we will underground the proposed infrastructure at Hoxa Head.#In the coming weeks, SSEN’s project team will continue to assess the responses received as it further refines the project design.SSEN plans to submit its planning applications for the proposed substation at Finstown, the subsea cable and the underground land cable that will connect Finstown to the subsea cable later this year, while a final round of public consultation will be held in Spring  on the onshore infrastructure required to connect the ious renewable projects looking to connect on Orkney to Finstown substation.For more information on the project, including the latest visualisations of the proposed substation at Finstown, please visit: https:www.ssen-transmission projects orkney copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Albyn Housing is asking them to pay a lot more each month in some cases.The concerns were echoed by the MP Mr Blackford who said ldquofor quite a while now, he has been working with the CAB to get to bottom of ldquowhat I would generously describe as curious practices from Albyn Housing.He added: ldquoIn one case an Albyn Housing client who had just undertaken a tenancy was immediately sent a letter informing her rent was already in arrears.ldquoIn effect, they are asking for a payment arrangement in view that it is a debt, and extra payment is, therefore, being requested each month.ldquoI am sure as a charitable organisation Albyn Housing has their tenantsrsquo best wishes at heart, however, their recent practices raise many questions.ldquoThese must be reviewed to ensure that no additional hardship is being brought upon the people who take up a tenancy with them.In response, Calum Macaulay, chief executive at Albyn Housing Society, insisted his rent due date had not changed and said his organisation followed the statutory form of tenancy laid out by the Scottish Government in the HousingAct  ldquowhich states that rent is due on, or before, the first day of the month, paid in arrears.He went on: ldquoTenants claiming housing benefit previously had their rent paid directly to Albyn Housing.ldquoWe were always made aware that the payment was due, and as such, any arrears would be treated as technical.ldquoNow, with universal credit, the tenant is responsible for paying their rent direct. The society has no dealings with the DWP and we are not made aware of incoming housing payments. This means that all tenants, regardless of whether they are claiming universal credit or not, are required to pay their rent in accordance with their tenancy agreement.He said housing officers would be ldquomore than willing to help tenants make arrangements that work for them.It comes weeks after Albyn Housing had to apologise to a vulnerable tenant in Inverness after a boiler check bungle ended up leaving the single mum locked out of her flat for the night with her toddler daughter and having to rely on social workers to pay for emergency accommodation.Monday  Nov  : PMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Throughout the coming winter we will monitor the agreed plan to make sure we cover any changes in weather using our existing resources to best effect.ldquoHowever, we all have a duty to take responsibility for our own personal safety which is why I encourage drivers to be aware of our gritting policy as it is simply not possible to treat every road at the same time.She added: ldquoPeople also need to be aware this year to the changes to Saturday and Sunday services.

It’s not as bad a deal as characterised. It contains many positive elements in relation to the rights of EU citizens.“Going forward, it contains this hugely important prospect for Scottish businesses for being able to trade in the EU without tarfs, without quotas - that’s the number one thing that businesses have said that they want.”Read more: Jeremy Corbyn urged to meet Nicola Sturgeon and form united front for new Brexit voteFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said SNP MPs in Westminster will vote against the deal when it is put forward in the House of Commons.Mr Mundell suggested the reasons for doing so are linked to campaigning for a second Scottish independence referendum.He said: “That’s why Nicola Sturgeon is so keen on it, that’s why she’s mandating her MPs to vote for a no-deal Brexit, because she understands that the chaos and disruption that a no-deal Brexit would bring would be the best recruiting base for her independence referendum.”SNP MSP Tom Arthur suggested Mr Mundell was refusing to put Scotland’s interests ahead of the interests of his party.He said: “David Mundell makes himself look and sound more ridiculous with every day that passes.“First he indicated he would resignNorthern Ireland was given special treatment, then he reportedly voiced concerns about the proposed deal while in Cabinet and now he has admitted Theresa May’s plan will leave Scotland worse off.“But still he clings to office, without a shred of principle or credibility.“It seems there is literally nothing that can happen that would lead David Mundell to put Scotland’s interests before the Tory party’s interests.“He is quite clearly the Cabinet’s man in Scotland rather than Scotland’s man in the Cabinet - and his position is now utterly untenable.”Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie called Mr Mundell’s comments “unconvincing” and insisted there must be another vote on Brexit.He said: “The Scottish Secretary can’t bring himself to say the Prime Minister’s deal will make le better for people in Scotland and that’s because it won’t.“Tearing ourselves out of Europe will hit every single Scottish household.“People across the country watched the chaos of last week unfold and Conservative isions deepen.“Nobody is fooled by David Mundell’s unconvincing claim that this is the only way forward.“Those who favour a people’s vote now make up the biggest cohesive bloc in British politics.“Hundreds of thousands of people have taken to the streets demanding the chance to avoid a big Brexit blackhole.“Tory arrogance has taken us this far. People deserve better than to be marched into a terrible deal that will hurt their finances.“The Brexit decision needs to go back to the people.”Scottish Labour MP Lesley Laird said: “Theresa May once believed that no deal was better than a bad deal.“Now David Mundell is saying the exact opposite yet sees no conflict with his position in Cabinet.“To back this bad deal as the only alternative to a no-deal Brexit is to accept a  choice.“Instead of leadership from Theresa May’s government we are getting brinkmanship.“Parliament must be given a meaningful vote on the half-baked mess that Theresa May has brought back from Brussels and when, as appears likely, it is voted down, it is Parliament that must set out the next steps towards delivering a deal which delivers on the promises made to voters at the outset.”She added: “It was embarrassing to hear Mr Mundell unable to make any positive case for supporting Theresa May’s deal this morning.“It is clear the majority of his Scottish Tory colleagues are also unconvinced.“They should all now finally stand up for Scotland and reject this broken deal.“Scotland deserves better than Tory ministers and MPs who slavishly put party first and the people second.“Mr Mundell must resignhe is to retain even a scrap of credibility on this.”Read more: Lesley Riddoch: Now is the time for Nicola Sturgeon to reignite Scottish independence debate©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4831447.1542480311!/image/image.jpg","title":"dani garavelli what s it like to be the best of the tories dirty laundry","story":"It was a cricketing analogy Theresa May chose, in the end, to explain her decision to cling on to a role she never mastered: that of a Prime Minister tasked with negotiating the kind of deal which only ever existed in the fantasies of a few deranged Brexiteers. #One of my heroes was always Geoffrey Boycott,# she said. #And what do you know about Geoffrey Boycott  He stuck with it and got the runs in the end.#Setting aside the fact that what most non-cricketing folk know about Geoffrey Boycott is that he once supported Ukip and was convicted of assaulting a former partner, it was still an odd comparison to make. May has proved she has the cricketer’s staying power, for sure, but not his passion. Her reluctance to leave the stage smacks more of inertia than of any belief in her power to deliver. Watching her make her statement in the House of Commons, as cabinet members and MPs prepared to desert her and opposition MPs hurled abuse, it was that old football chant that came to my mind: “No-one likes us we don’t care.” Except, of course, that when Millwall supporters sang the line it was an expression of defiant solidarity an “us against the world” kind of thing. For May, there is no “us” unless you count her husband Philip, who poured her a whisky after her marathon cabinet meeting. There is only her, ploughing on, never veering from her set course. Like a missile launched into outer space, she seems propelled less by hope or conviction, than by an inability to stop and the lack – so far – of sufficient resistance. Even being compared to appeaser Neville Chamberlain appears to have done little to dint her determination.Has there ever been a lonelier figure in history than May  Macbeth watching the approach of Birnam Wood, perhaps  Or Julius Caesar lured to the Theatre of Pompey by his erstwhile allies  Et tu, Dominic  Et tu, Esther  Et vos, several junior ministers most of us had never heard of  May exudes loneliness the way some people exude vitality. Long before no confidence letters started stacking up, she appeared ill at ease in the company of others, be they members of the public or world leaders. Remember that footage of her at the EU summit in   The one where she fiddled anxiously with her cuffs and searched for someone to talk to, as all around her other attendees greeted each other with hugs and air kisses  I have neither met nor read of anyone who has found in May either a force to be reckoned with or a kindred spirit. Most report her as lacking in presence and conversational gambits. In a rare personal jibe aimed at another woman, Nicola Sturgeon said she found it impossible to get any human connection. As for when May takes on Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs: Denis Healey’s famous jibe about being “savaged by a dead sheep” comes to mind.Bingeing on the latest season of the Brexit box-set is emotionally confusing. What are we supposed to feel for this robotic character who refuses to be beaten, even when she so obviously is  Not admiration. There can be no admiration for a leader whose management of everything from Grenfell to the snap general election has been so spectacularly inept. And certainly not for a leader who, while home secretary, introduced the hostile environment policy that led to the Windrush and other deportations. Respect is wrong too. How can we respect someone so out of touch with the impact of Tory policies that – even as her party is preparing to tip the country off a clf – she thinks it’s amusing to jig her way out to the conference podium  Despite myself, what I did feel for May, last week, was a sort of muted regard for her obstinacy. May is a Remainer who took on the challenge of achieving the unachieveable – a compromise that would suit everyone – presumably because she felt it was a better option than having negotiations conducted by a sovereignty-obsessed Brexiteer. It was an impossible, thankless task and she was undermined at every turn. Nevertheless, she and her civil servants put together a deal. Perhaps it’s a dog’s dinner of a deal perhaps – as Jo Johnson suggested – it will leave us a “vassal state”, but it’s more than any of her blowhard critics have done. And at least she had the guts to face down the DUP on the Irish Border backstop. May’s deal is unlikely to be passed by the House of Commons, but as any deal capable of passing through the House of Commons is unlikely to be agreed by Brussels, she was always on to a loser.Yet, while she is taking all the flak, where is the man who kicked this off this fiasco in a misguided attempt to buy off his party’s right-wingers  At a financial conference in Florida, of course. David Cameron is a shameless dilettante who takes responsibility for nothing. His catastrophic miscalculation has never stopped him sleeping at night. He left No  with nary a backward glance. The same is true of Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage, who were last week spotted enjoying a cosy drink at an upmarket restaurant, and former Brexit Secretary David Davis, who is currently in Washington.Whatever  May lacks – grace, empathy – she does not lack a sense of civic duty. Why  would she plough on, pushing a deal in which she cannot believe to a party that only tolerates her because it doesn’t know what  to do  Anyone  would have packed up long ago and headed for the nearest wheatfield.This is not an endorsement of May’s premiership, which has been characterised by a series of humiliations and mistakes, and an inability to answer questions with anything other than her sound-bite du jour. Her craven cosying up to Trump still makes me queasy.But imagine the resolve it takes to get up every day and face the public when you are assailed from all sides when you know that some of those, like Michael Gove, who have agreed to join your cabinet, have only done so in the hopes of bringing you down from within when you know no gain is ever going to come from all the pain.Imagine putting yourself through all that when you are aware your legacy will be naught. No matter how this turns out, May is going to go down in history as one of our worst-ever prime ministers.When she first became leader, the columnist Marina Hyde rfed on a Katharine Whitehorn quote which asked: “Have you ever taken anything out of the dirty clothes-basket because it had become, relatively, the cleaner thing ” May, Hyde said, was “the cleaner thing.”It was true then and it’s true now. It is a testament to the amorality of almost everyone  involved that the prime minister comes across as a person with a degree of integrity . She is the best of a very bad bunch.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4831670.1542617327!/image/image.jpg","title":"lesley riddoch now is the time for nicola sturgeon to reignite scottish independence debate","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...The First Minister must move on a second Scottish referendum or the moment will have passed, argues Lesley Riddoch.An interesting exch­ange occurred on yesterday’s Andrew Marr show between the BBC presenter and guest Nicola Sturgeon.The First Minister said: “One thing is beyond any doubt, the implications of Scotland not being independent are stark. Scotland has been sidelined.”Andrew Marr replied: “So why don’t you have a second referendum ” Nicola Sturgeon responded: “You will have to wait for that statement – that will not be in the too distant future.”: Nicola Sturgeon: decision on Scottish independence vote in ‘not-too-distant future’So far, so unremarkable. The SNP leader’s been producing that “wait and see” line since last year’s snap general election. Even though it failed to convince when trotted out in response to Patrick Harvie of the Scottish Greens during First Ministers Questions last week when he pointed out that waiting for clarity over Brexit might mean waiting forever. Now maybe it’s no bad thing to have folk urging you to move a bit faster towards your constitutional destination of choice. But maybe it’s also a little weird.: Richard Leonard: Scottish independence vote would be worse than BrexitCommentators north and south of the Border assume the Scottish Government must be close to some kind of announcement on a second indyref, given the degree to which Scotland has been visibly carved out of the Brexit process, denied any whf of the dferential deals that proved possible for Northern Ireland, Gibraltar and Cyprus despite Scots voting more overwhelmingly to stay in the EU. But Nicola Sturgeon and Mike Russell spent the weekend promoting another cause – urging the UK to remain in the Customs Union and stay in the Single Market like Norway and Iceland. Now of course it’s a reasonable enough suggestion. Norway joined the halfway house after two referenda rejected EU membership so they could keep their recently-won political independence but win single market access for their outward facing economy. Access to the single market is not a great solution but it’s a heck of a lot more popular in Norway than full EU membershipor leaving the single market to plough the lonely free trade furrow advocated by Britain’s hard Brexiteers. But there are cultural reasons why single market access can work for Norway but not for Britain. Firstly, the arrangement means being a “rule-taker.” That may be easier for a small country that was never a full EU member in the first place than once “mighty” Britain where the very idea of “rule-taking” prompts overwrought talk about “vassal states”. Secondly, the acceptance of less-than-perfect deals is an everyday occurrence in Norway because it’s had proportional representation since  and thus daily experience of negotiation and compromise. Westminster’s first-past-the-post system, by contrast, breeds a confrontational “no surrender” approach to international relations which would make Britain a very bad fit with the small, consensual EEA nations. Thirdly, membership of the single market means accepting freedom of movement. This doesn’t particularly bother the Norwegians, who were part of a Nordic Travel Area  years before Schengen and joined that club despite remaining outside the EU to make le and travel easier for citizens and neighbours. Sadly though, freedom of movement is a massively big deal for the millions of Britons who voted to leave the EU. So while single market membership may make sense on paper, there’s absolutely no way the closet Brexiteer Jeremy Corbyn or the Ukip-fearing Theresa Maywill ever consider single market membership because it ends the illusion that control over British borders can ever be “taken back”. So, since neither the Tories nor Labour will ever accept this halfway house, why are the SNP still pushing it  Are they virtue signalling – demonstrating that the Scottish Government can embrace a rational solution to Britain’s Brexit problems evenit cannot be stomached by No   If so, why bother It’s hard to see how much more virtue the Scottish Government can possibly accumulate over Brexit. Scottish voters not living on another planet since  are fully aware that we voted to remain, the Scottish Government published an options document a full year before Westminster, political parties here are fairly relaxed about freedom of movement and even Ruth Davidson could support single market access as long as no one from London was watching. Butthis virtuous solution has no hope of being implemented, why does the SNP spend its only moment of UK-wide media continuing to advocate solutions for the whole of the UK when that makes it almost impossible to start making the case for independence As Britain’s constitutional crisis likely deepens this week, every other party will be laying out its stall – whether that is A Peoples’ Vote, A No Deal Brexit, Theresa May’s deal, a Tory leadership challenge or a general election. But Scottish independence is nowhere to be seen. Of course, everyone accepts that naming the date for another referendum is indeed impossible with uncertainty all around. But it seems that worry about naming a date is also stopping Nicola Sturgeon from making a case – and that’s becoming problematic. Scottish voters are being plunged into a Black Friday-style sale of constitutional options and voters are thinking deeply about the future . Does the SNP believe swithering Scots will hold onto their democratic currency, ignore all the whizzy offers being laid before them and keep their powder dry till the Indy Express finally rolls into town  If it takes too long, swithering voters may have ed to the Union fold.So it’s just as well the Greens have decided to move into the unoccupied political space of the Independence movement. Yesterday, Scottish Greens co-convener Maggie Chapman wrote about the need to get updated, Brexit-framed, modern arguments for independence into the public domain as a matter of urgency. SNP MP Mhairi Black made similar points.Many Yes activists are praying the SNP leadership has got over the snap election and will start talking in detail about the independence scenario it exists to promote. If Oscar Wilde is right and the only thing worse than being talked about is indeed not being talked about, then Westminster is actually winning as an institution by being the sole focus of attention right now. Playing it safe can be laudable – but not being a player at a time like this is not an option.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4831674.1542578384!/image/image.jpg","title":"jeremy corbyn urged to meet nicola sturgeon and form united front for new brexit vote","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Scottish Labour figures have called on Jeremy Corbyn to meet Nicola Sturgeon this week and present a united front to overhaul Theresa May#s deal with Brussels or give the people a chance to reverse Brexit.The First Minister will go to London for talks with politicians working to thwart the Prime Minister’s Brexit plan, and said she hopes to sit down with Labour and others to formulate an alternative. The call for unity came as Mr Corbyn faced criticism for again appearing to play down the prospects of a referendum on the terms of Brexit, claiming it was “not an option for today” and refusing to say how he would cast his ballot in a so-called “people’s vote”. Ms Sturgeon described Mrs May’s draft agreement as a “blindfold Brexit” that lacked clarity on the UK’s future relationship with the EU and confirmed SNP MPs would vote against it in the Commons.“If the House of Commons says we want to go down the road of single market and customs union membership, we want more time to take this back to the people of the UK in another vote, we need an extension of Article  –there is a clear change of direction – then I believe the EU  would be prepared to look at that,” the First Minister said on the BBC’s Andrew Marr show.“But that means those who don’t want this deal coming together.“Those who don’t think the Prime Minister’s deal is the right way to go have now a responsibility to come together and coalesce around an alternative.“I will seek to have discussions this week with other parties to get us into that position.”The First Minister said she was keen to talk to Mr Corbyn “and whoever ” in the Commons when she visits London.Labour peer Lord Foulkes said the SNP and Labour leaders should meet. “We need to build a broad front on the way forward, which I hope would be a people’s vote,” he said. Scottish Labour MEP Catherine Stihler said: “Support is growing for a people’s vote, and there is an opportunity for Labour to get fully behind this and campaign to stop a reckless and damaging Brexit.“This is a time for strong leadership in the interests of the workers who our party represents.“I encourage Jeremy to engage with other party leaders, including Nicola Sturgeon, to address the Brexit crisis.”East Lothian MP Martin Whitfield said: “For Theresa May to understand that all of the parties that are in opposition are as one on this is useful for her to know.“There is an opportunity there for people to talk… that’s what needs to happen. The time has come to say that [a people’s vote] is what the majority of the country want.”He added: “If ever there was a time for people to start talking, now is it.”Last week Mr Corbyn raised hopes that opposition parties would present a united front when he joined Ms Sturgeon in signing a letter demanding MPs be able to amend the motion that puts the Brexit deal to a Commons vote.However, despite party policy stating that Labour will pursue a second EU referendumattempts to change the deal or force a general election fail, Mr Corbyn poured cold water on calls for Labour to support a people’s vote, saying it was “an option for the future” but “not an option for today”.In an interview with Sky’s Ridge On Sunday, he also told how his party couldn’t stop Brexit “because we don’t have the votes in Parliament to do so.“There was a referendum in , a majority voted to leave the EU, there are many reasons why people voted. “I don’t think you call a referendum and then say you don’t like the result and go away from it. You’ve got to understand why people voted and negotiate the best deal you can.” Asked about calls for a second referendum, Mr Corbyn said: “It’s an option for the future but it’s not an option for today,there was a referendum tomorrow what’s it going to be on, what’s the question going to be ”Asked which way he would vote in such a referendum, he said: “I don’t know how I am going to vote, what the options would be at that time.”The Labour leader will appeal to business to back his plan for a Brexit deal in a speech to the CBI conference in London today.Arguing that Labour can secure a deal with closer ties to the EU market and better protections for workers’ rights, Mr Corbyn will say: “The government is trying to force a bad deal that doesn’t meet our country’s needs by threatening us all with the chaos and serious damage to our economy of a no-deal outcome.“The Prime Minister knows that no-deal isn’t a real option. Neither the Cabinet nor Parliament would endorse such an extreme and dangerous course.”©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4831836.1542629600!/image/image.jpg","title":"israel ban social media after ex celtic star s pro arab post","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Israel have launched a self-imposed ban on posting social media posts after ex-Celtic star Beram Kayal caused an internal storm in their camp. - The  best Scottish Premiership signings of the season so farThe Israelis warmed up for their showdown in Scotland with a - romp against Guatemala at home last week.After the game, Brighton midfielder Kayal posted a picture on Instagram, later deleted, of the seven Arab players in the Israel squad with the caption ‘The Bosses.’But that sparked a major row in the Israeli squad, who have suffered from serious political and religious isions before between their Arab players and the rest of the group.Kayal’s post prompted a hastily-arranged team meeting before the squad flew to Glasgow and Guangzhou midfielder Eran Zahavi revealed they have now agreed to have a social media black-out until after the game.He said: “Beram Kayal and the rest of the Arab players in the squad made it very clear to us there was no bad intentions meant when he posted that.“We had a conversation and we all agreed the most important thing is the team’s success.“We don’t want to create a media circus about this and have agreed to not post anything until after the game in Scotland.”©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.The project, costing around £ million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in .

Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.HGIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the # shock value # when it comes to expressing what art is or should be Personally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it # And the winner of the Turner Prize is#. #. lol“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is###. ”.Go on David,since you are consumed with what is appropriate why not have a go yourself  You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is##.David Spence.

LoLThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.Based on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"whalsays new research arrives in lerwick for first time ","story":"The Research leaves Symbister with bunting flying as she heads for Lerwick on Saturday.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested. In the absence of Hogg and Barclay, English-based Sean Maitland and David Denton, and half-backs Finn Russell and Greg Laidlaw who now ply their trade in France, it gives an opportunity for some youngsters to make their mark.Those include Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings who have been named in the starting line-up, while Darcy Graham, George Horne and Matt Fagerson may get their chance later in the game.He won’t be making an appearance on this occasion as he plays for Welsh side Scarlets, but I am particularly interested in seeing Kiwi import Blade Thomson in the next three tests. Hopefully he can make an eye-catching debut to match his name.: : : : : : : :Family, friends, work colleagues and a good number of former footballers gathered on Friday to say farewell to Alastair Johnston from Cunningsburgh.When I first met him in the early s he was still an excellent player. He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

SIC has a poor record of flag flying in my opinion from the senior flagstaff. It#s the UK government#sand Scottish Parliaments policy to encourage councils to fly the Union Flagon a regular daily basis. It#s very rare to see a flag flying any time except on the Lord Lieutenants flag flying days list ofwhich is out of date.It is troubling to hear where the British media still blame German militarism and nationalism for WW, asnationalism and militarism were ever missing from the British national outlook. All major European powers fought to gain advantage over neighbours.It is refreshing though to hear the French President tell world leaders, including Putin and Trump, that nationalism is a #betrayal of patriotism#.#By saying #our interests first and never mind the others#, you stamp out the most precious thing a nation has # its moral values,# he said, thereby insisting these sometimes exist.The European Union used to be widely regarded as a moral endeavour. It seems most of our neighbours still see it that way, as something worthwhile which tempers selfish instincts and secures peace.If Brexit goes ahead the prospect of Britain forgetting its responsibilities as a victor, as Churchill put it in, #for the immediate future of the world# looms large. Let us hope some lessons can be recalled.#Patriotism is when the love of your own people comes first nationalism, when hate for people other than your own comes first.# # Charles de GaulleSadly we see Donald Trump, #America First!, Let#s make America great again#. A nationalist doctrine of utter selfishness!We seem the same doctrine of the Alt-right gaining a foothold in the UK and Europe. Remember #The Only Thing Necessary for the Triumph of Evil is that Good Men Do Nothing#,It is a sad reflection of the many, many people which has died due to war and conflict.There is one institute which promotes, encourages and sanctions war and conflict more so than any other establishment within a modern society.We have probably killed and maimed more people in the last  years than at any other time in  years. What has brought this to the fore is technology but also the institutes which have remained silent on such atrocities, this being the backbone of modern societies driven by economics, our banking systems.Never has there been so much money spent on war and conflict, never have so many countries been destroyed by war and conflict, and who stands by the sideline reaping in massive profits as a result, our banks.The Bible says # For the Love of Money is the Root to All Evils # never a truer word said with our modern banking systems.Rather sad that at a time when we remember those that saw the horror of so many European conflicts, we also saw the French and German leaders announce they want to create a #real# EU Army. I presume by #real# they mean, #the ability to kill people#. Not only was it tactless of Merkel and Macron, we surely have enough standing armed forces already in the world. Do we really need another Jane , I feel sure that Merkel and Macron were not thinking along the same lines as yourself .They stated the need for a ‘ real army’without any references to the huge revenues that could be gained from the manufacture of arms.It’s all very well trying to pass their claim off as being for the strength and safety of Europe but with no reference whatsoever to the economic   financial benefits which would bolster the banking strengths of Germany and France. What an oversight !!Too much sauerkraut and champagne probablyto blame.I wondertheir suggestion is in any way due to their much reduced popularity in their respective countries.I would have thought the present EU decision-making structure e.g. nations’ vetoes, is hopelessly incompatible with having its own military, capable of defending Europe against Russia, China and laughably, the US. How much will that cost  It will need massive further integration, possibly, to United States of Europe level , a ghastly spectre that motivated many Brexiteers to vote ‘Leave’. year more than the next seven countries put together at  billion dollars.To say that the E.U. should not work militarily together is preposterous.Europe has been ided by maniacs with delusions of grandeur,their own ego#s and agendas on too many occasions # the last fty years has brought us peace,economic stability and a continent able to feed itself.I am sure WinstonChurchillwould be very proud of that after the hell of World ,he fought like so many others for it and would be appalled at the prospect of Little Englanderism and the new Westminster faith with its no deal brexit nonsense! Hungarian Revolution of , Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia, the Turkish invasion of Cyprus, The Bosnian War, The Kosovo War, Annexation of Crimea, The Ukraine crisis, The Russo-Georgian War and that is ignoring The Troubles in Ireland and countless terrorist attacks. We have a death toll here of tens of thousand and rising! Graham Fleming at least make a stab at historical fact occasionally.John, look at the EU command structure! The most expensive army on Earth would require a  Sate agreement before it could deploy. Then it could not fire a shot. If it hit an killed an enemy how about that enemy#s human rights  Iy takes # The Europen Court # about four years to reach a design!Thank God we are not talking about a European Navy, climate change and all that, sailing ships only.All of these good things I mentioned happened within our European Union,the bad bit you mentioned truthfully# was Northern Ireland, mainly the domain and remit of the British state doesn#t bode well for the future at all,at all.Interesting that the Great War commemoration coincides with Theresa May#s abject surrender to the EU.One big threat from May#s deal is to the UK union itself with the proposal that Northern Ireland be separated from the rest of the UK and be under Brussels laws and regulations.As predicted, the SNP now want the same treatment and will use that as a #grievance# to win support for a second Scottish independence referendum.The current mess will also play straight into their hands by confirming their allegations of #Westminster incompetence#.Many events over the past four years that have commemorated the sacrice of so many people have been profoundly moving .However I have been a bit upset this year.I have noticedthat local communities were trying to #outdo# each other with their poppydisplays.Well-meant I am sure, but remembrance is not about community #one-up-man-ship#, it is very personal and I am sad that in some places it has been turned into a #best display# competition # a Halloween of who can remember best.

A lot of visitor experiences are going to be marred.\"Adam Gough, CairnGorm Mountain representative, who had told of the need for the slopes aimed at beginners and intermediates, was clearly stunned by the rejection.Asked immediately after the decisionan appeal was likely, he said that a statement would be issued later.CNPA head planner Gavin Miles had stressed from the outset the application had to be determined on planning issues ndash landscaping impacts in particular ndash and not on its commercial merits, which had generated much argument.He said the business case was a matter for Natural Retreats.Mr Miles told the committee the articial slope would not extend the ski area in any signicant way but the footprint of obvious development would increase.He commented: \"Initially the team were very concerned about the landscaping but as more information was given to us by the applicants it was considered that in the long term planting would mitigate against that. There would be an impact in the short term of the dry ski slope.\"Whether it will ever be an attraction in its own right and generate signicant income, who knows, but that is not a consideration of the planning process.\"In effect it is a ersication of business in this area and therefore acceptable andit was to strengthen the stability of CairnGorm Mountain then thats a good thing.\"He said there were some hefty planning conditions attached to control the development.CairnGorm Mountains representative said some  per cent of total visits to the resort were in just three winter months of the year.Mr Gough had told the committee Natural Retreats had explored several options in depth to remove the reliance on winter income including mountain biking and zip-wiring but this plan was the most viable at this time.He said it was imperative the attraction can provide year-round employment in order to retain its best staff.

Highlands and Islands Enterprise who commissioned the report have described the findings as a starting point.But it appears that there would have to be very persuasive arguments to now veer from this set course.HIEs head of business development Susan Smith told the Strathy: \"This is the start of a long journey but at the centre of this needs to be the buy-in from stakeholders and the local community.\"Naturally an element of funding has to come from the public purse.\"There are large infrastructure funds for which this project may be eligible.\"Intriguingly she continued: \"Without setting hares racing it is prudent that we look at what alternative funding mechanisms might be available.\"I would put the option forward there may be a number of philanthropic investors out there who are passionate about Cairngorm who may with a sensible model and plan consider some form of philanthropic investment.\"Ms Smith would only add when pressed: \"We have a very loose expression of interest which suggest to us there may be the opportunity to do a bit more work to tease out whether this is an alternative strategy but there is absolutely no guarantee.\"On Coire na Ciste, she said the consultants found there was no business case to develop the area as campaigners and many ski visitors would like to see.The HIE boss said: \"They have come back quite unequivocally saying that it would not stack.\"They have looked at the two sites and said it is unsustainable as a second site until there is a capacity of  peopleor more using CairnGorm Mountain because facilities would have to be doubled up.\"This is the view of the experts and they have consulted widely and I have to take confidence in that... to deviate from these findings there would have to be a signicant rationale to do so.\"Ms Smith said the two new chairlts would replace some of the surface lts but was unable to say which ones.She said that their partners Highland Council, Cairngorms National Park Authority, Scottish Natural Heritage and Forestry Enterprise Scotland were enthused and excited by the vision.She said: \"They believe that for the first time in many years this is a sensible approach for the way forward.\"She also said HIE wants to be much more inclusive working with the right community representatives.Ms Smith explained: \"It can not be a free for all.

Importantly that means that visitors will be travelling through the Sleat peninsula, where communities have worked long and hard to build up a viable industry.“In the midst of the important debates about ferries and not least the importance of the MV Coruisk to the Armadale-Mallaig crossing, it’s important to celebrate the huge contribution that RET has made to the island economies.”If CalMac#s league tables of ferry route usage tell us anything, it is that moving the MV #Coruisk# from its purpose-built harbours on the busiest crossing in the north-west remains inexplicable.If the two tables of passengers and coaches highlight anything , it is that CalMac badly needs its two new ferries from the Clyde to be delivered according to their revised schedule and not experience a third delay.It is a mild surprise, as Kate Forbes MSP says, to discover that more people sail between Mallaig and Armadale in Skye than between Stornoway and Ullapool and that more coaches cross the Sound of Sleat than make any other journey on CalMac#s itinerary.It is good news not only for Sleat but for the whole of the island. It is good news which is tempered by the fact that this busy, bustling route is now served only by whatever ships CalMac can spare, when the tide permits them, while its purpose-built vessel, the MV #Coruisk#, which can dock at Armadale in all tidal conditions, is ploughing between Mull and Oban  nautical miles away.If CalMac had the ships, Mallaig Armadale would be dependable and therefore even busier, Mull would have a vessel of its own and almost everybody would be happy.CalMac do not have the ships in large part because two new deep-sea vessels which were commissioned in  from Ferguson Marine Engineering at Port Glasgow show no sign of turning up for duty.One of them is due to operate on CalMac#s busiest passenger route between Ardrossan and Arran. The other is to work between Uig, Tarbert and Lochmaddy, which last year carried almost , people.The delivery date for those two ships has been put back twice. On each occasion, the £ million contract to Ferguson Marine — which is the property of one of the Scottish Government#s friends, advisors and allies, the billionaire tax exile Jim McColl — was topped up by a multi-million-pound handout from the public purse.If all was on schedule at least one of those ships would now be in service, and CalMac would have substantially more leeway in manoeuvring its fleet from one part of the west coast to another. They might even be able to keep the #Coruisk# on the Sound of Sleat.They are very far from on schedule. The new Ardrossan Arran ferry is now supposed to be delivered next summer, and the new Uig Tarbert Lochmaddy ship in spring .Will they be delivered  Or will we experience a third delay, which would certainly plunge CalMac into even greater chaos as its ageing fleet breaks down or requires routine maintenance somewhere in the Baltic Those are important questions. As we reported last week, the chief executive of Outer Hebrides Tourism, Rob MacKinnon, has criticised the Scottish Government for a lack of any #tangible action# to address the islands# ferry problems.The Scottish transport ministry, said Mr MacKinnon, must #pursue all feasible options to increase ferry capacity in both the long and the short term for the benefit of both visitors and islanders#.As we report this week, Labour#s Western Isles# candidate Alison MacCorquodale has added her voice to the many demanding to know the precise terms of the private finance initiative deal which has bound the Scottish Government into using just one ferry for all passengers and freight between Ullapool and Stornoway, with unacceptable consequences.Ullapool Stornoway may not yet carry as many tourists as Mallaig Armadale. But it is the definition of a leline service, with , passengers last year, many of whom found themselves unable to squeeze onto an overbooked #Loch Seaforth#.We should be told how and why one of our biggest and most important ferries came to be owned by Lloyds Bank.We should be toldJim McColl is going to deliver two badly-needed ships at the third time of asking.It is not enough to say, as does transport minister Michael Matheson, that building CalMac#s ferries is #providing vital support to our shipbuilding industry#The way things are going, building and rebuilding CalMac#s ferries will keep Scottish shipbuilding alive well into the next decade. Their higher purpose, and Mr Matheson#s job is to provide vital support to the Hebridean ferry service. That support is urgently required."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/2018-mod-gold-medals-e1539885405814.jpg","title":"thursday at the mod skye and lochalsh gold medal","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThere was a Skye and Lochalsh double in the premier singing competition at this year’s National Mòd in Dunoon.In Wednesday night’s final Ceitidh Campbell from Kyle of Lochalsh won the women’s Gold Medal, while the men’s medal went to Ruairidh Cormack from Portree.Both singers are following in family footsteps in landing the prestigious honour, which is presented by Mòd organisers An Comunn Gàidhealach.Ceitidh’s mother, Barbara Smith, won the Gold Medal when the Mòd was held in Skye in .

November, in which Councillor Ian Cockburn put forward a motion whereby the local authority would determinefunds were available for design work to begin on replacement options to the bypass. This motion was agreed. earlier this week, the chair of the EDI committee, Councillor Allan Henderson said that the council was putting pressure on the Scottish Government to have the route classed as a trunk road. However, during Thursday’s meeting Councillor Cockburn was quick to dismiss the likelihood of this happening: “Who in their right mind would take  miles of the worst road in the Highlands” He said. “After six and a half years we still only have two options… and the delays and the consequences for the wider community have been absolutely shocking.”The SNP member for Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh also went on to question the tendering process behind the work at the bypass, saying: “Was it necessary to shut the road during the day  I believe there was a tender on the table that would have allowed the road to open during the day.”He went on to argue that the council needed to release money straight away to enable design work on the replacement options for the current bypass to begin, adding that it was a matter of urgency due to the risks identied in the  annual sloping report which detailed four very high-risk rock slopes at the Stromeferry bypass.In response to Councillor Cockburn, the council’s head of infrastructure Colin Howell said that the council did receive an alternative tender from a contractor who said they could carry out the required works at night, however, Mr Howell said the cost was signicant and due to concerns about these plans it was decided it would be wise for some of the work to be undertaken during the day.Mr Howell said that while there were ongoing issues with rockfalls and managing slopes, he believed that the council had done a good job. He went on to add that the council were prioritising the high-risk slopes and currently working on the cost and details in relation to stabilising those areas which would be delivered at the next EDI committee meeting. He added that there were “three optimum solutions” in respect to replacement options and said that the committee had “decided to leave those three on the table# and seek dialogue with Scottish Government for funding. He said: “The administration is looking for feedback, we are working on slopes with high risks and will come back to the next EDI with the costing.”Councillor Derek MacLeod described the current situation as “one episode in a long, long history of problems with the route#, and in contrast to his fellow ward member, Councillor Cockburn, he argued that the route should be “trunked between Auchtertyre and Garve” as he believed it to be strategic in linking the ferry points of Uig and UllapoolCouncil Leader Margaret Davidson told the committee that she would be meeting with the Transport Secretary Michael Matheson and would report back “what options have been put on the table.” Councillor Davidson said that the council were “acutely aware of what’s needed” and were working towards a long-term sustainable option for Stromeferry.

For anartist of his stature this was courageous, dependent as he was, tosome extent, on commissions from people who, to say the least, wouldnot be subscribers to our paper. But this was an artist who went hisown way in art and who acted as a citizen with a conscience in anIreland where State-imposed censorship distorted not only politicaldebate but also national self-image. For Robert Ballaghcreative work and active citizenship have gone hand in hand all hisle. This is depicted in his double self-portrait ‘Upstairs No.’,one of the many illustrations of his work in this superbly writtenand beautully presented book. It is not a standard autobiographywith chapters set out in chronological order beginning with genealogyand ending with this week’s news. As you would expect from Ballagh,he takes a dferent approach, starting towards the later years andcircling through his days in no particular order before coming backto the present. More than that, he weaves narrative, anecdote andreflection together seamlessly and conversationally showing a skillwith words akin to his skill with brushes. He has a story to tell ofa very ied le, from his unusual family background to his time asa showband guitar player, through his unorthodox beginning as apainter and his development as an artist and an activist. Withfrankness and clarity he tells us how he learned and matured as anartist and his brief commentaries on many of his works areilluminating both of how they were made and the concepts behind them.It makes the reader want to look again and more intensely at thepictures. The Prologue isessentially a dedication to Robert’s late we Betty, his lelonginspiration, mentor and most important critic. The first chaptertells the harrowing story of how Betty, in her serious illness, wasdisgracefully let down by a healthcare system which basically allowedher to die through neglect, as was admitted in legal proceedings. Butthis does not cast a shadow over the book, as her positive presenceis felt throughout, and is celebrated by the author. These days I rarely getthat urge immediately to re-read a book when I reach the end, but Idid with this one. Thankfully the chapters are so well defined thatthey can be read as stand-alone essays or stories. Take just twoexamples: ‘Who Fears to Speak ofEaster Week’ recounts the tremendous people’s commemoration ofthe  Centenary in which Robert played a central part, aculmination of his activism which has included campaigning againstapartheid, for the Birmingham Six, for artists’ rights, with theIrish National Congress opening border roads, in solidarity withPalestine and as an enthusiastic participant in Féile an Pobail inWest Belfast from its commencement.‘Dining at McDonald’s’is a brilliant critique of the dominant and stultying modernistideology and practise in art and an appeal for an opening up. Ballaghattacks “the notion that the artists’ choice imbues a givenobject with special properties which are tantamount to a metaphysicaltransformation of the object that it ceases to be a pedestrianartefactand becomes,by virtue of the artist’s choice, art”. This ideology leads tothe absurdity of much of the ‘installation’ stuff in galleriesthat baffles all but elitist insiders and, as Ballagh recounts, theclaim by loyalist killer Michael Stone that his attack on Stormontwas a piece of performance art. He argues that the bureaucracies mustset aside this ideology and make galleries more open and democratic .For these views and forhis artistic method and, among some I suspect, for his politics,Ballagh has been frowned upon by certain elites. One prominent figurein the Irish art world said of him with dripping condescension thathe is “not a real artist, he is a mere illustrator”. Typically,Ballagh responded with humour and defiance in a self-portrait wearinga t-shirt saying ‘Fuck the Begrudgers’. I cannot recommend thisbook highly enough. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27486  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National Chairperson“The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office”Ive been wondering lately whether anyone in Democratic Unionist Partyleadership circles actually try to reflect upon what republicans, nationalists, and other progressive minded citizens think about the current political situation.Do they even care what others think The evidence suggests not.Several days ago the DUP leader pronounced that her party could and would change the Good Friday Agreementat a whim. There was no hint of irony in her claim – the DUP has spent the last  years opposing the GFA, ever since it was signed.In another extraordinary, but not untypical, outburst she declared her blood red line position on Brexit and, that in the same week as the consultation on dealing with the past was concluding!Of course the DUP leader, and other key figures have form in making offensive and provocative political interventions.Her dehumanising description of republicans as \"crocodiles\" in  comes to mind.Notably, she previously called republican and nationalist Ministers in a ing Executive ‘rogues and renegades.Only the DUP knows whether this leader is naturally predisposed to being rhetorically gaffe prone, or is being deliberately offensive.Perhaps some figures in the DUP do think about wider opinion: the DUP is not a monolith after all.But, those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power sharing.  They oppose equality and rights, and reject reconciliation.Instead they have chosen to join forces with the extremists in the British Tory party to help steer the Brexit train wreck.The DUP leadership is living in a delusional bubble.Meanwhile, the party brand has become indistinguishable from the financial scandals of recent years such as Red Sky, NAMA, Brexit dark money, and financial relationships with Sri Lanka.The ongoing RHI inquiry exposé of how the DUP behaved in government makes a complete mockery of its purported adherence to good governance’.The party MPs have become power drunk through their pact with the Tories, and a serious misconception that they are king makers in Westminster.  Edward Carsons cautionary words have clearly been forgotten or disregarded.  He warnedWhat a fool I was.  I was only a puppet, and so was Ulster… in the political game that was to get the Conservative party into power.’ The DUP has a tactical approach towards everything including maintaining the status quo on its own terms, slowing down and frustrating progressive societal change, and maintaining sectarian dominance within the unionist constituency.The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office.  Its inability and refusal to embrace dference or celebrate ersity is reflected in an institutionalised bigotry against, and intolerance towards the Irish national identity and cultural traditions, and LGBT rights.The partys contempt and sharp practice in government has destroyed wider public confidence in the political institutions, and led to the decisive tipping point of RHI and withdrawal of the Líofa grant scheme in the winter of .As a result of its ingrained arrogance and lack of political humility the DUP leadership is constantly in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarianism, homophobia, and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists, and many others, including sections of civic unionism, do not believe the DUP is serious about restoring genuine power sharing. These citizens want the institutions to be restored, but not at the risk of allowing the DUP to continue practicing discrimination, disrespect, intimidation, bigotry, and sharp practice. They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power on that basis.  And, neither will Sinn Féin.The DUPs behaviour, and the onslaught of Brexit have together brought back graphically into focus the denial of rights which resulted in the Civil Rights Movement fty years ago.A generational realignment has occurred within northern nationalism.Acht Gaeilge, marriage equality, womens reproductive health rights, legacy justice rights, and the demand for a Bill of Rights are the modern day acid test equivalents of one person, one vote.  The current crisis in the north of Ireland is the visceral culmination of  years of DUP push back against the GFA.Intoxicated with its imaginary power at Westminster, the DUP leadership has finally over played its hand. The political institutions could have been re-established by the th February last, but the DUP leaders walked out of negotiations.Instead of selling the deal which they negotiated in February with Sinn Féin, the DUP leader, deputy leader, party chief executive, and its senior talks team bottled out.Since then the party has been convulsed with the resultant internal fall out.  There has been no meaningful contact with Sinn Féin, and absolutely no willingness demonstrated to resume negotiations.Any advocacy of blood red lines is a total anathema to democracy.The wider nationalist constituency is fed up to the back teeth with the subversion of the political process by the DUP, the British Tory government and others in political unionism.It is more impatient than ever for equality, rights and parity of esteem.  The history of  is being replayed. Thousands marching from Duke Street in Derry city on Saturday th October to mark the iconic civil rights march  years before is the latest example of that.  An exciting momentum for change is taking place across Ireland, north and south.  Old orthodoxies are being eclipsed by discussions about new, modern, all-Ireland constitutional and political arrangements. The permanent unionist electoral majority is gone and demographic changes are irreversible.All of this puts the onus back upon both governments to act decisively to address the denial of rights.The Irish government needs to take the lead because for now the DUP has this British government over a barrel.  But thats a short-term situation.  A British general election in the immediate to mid term cannot be ruled out.A new political discourse has begun about the future. All sections of society need to be involved in this and the unionist is critical in all of this.Brexit, the GFA, citizens rights, and an Irish unity referendum are central to that. Progressives should explore common ground and alliances for change.Republicans and unionists need to start to face the same way.  We have to begin looking at each other through eyes of the future.The benchmarks of a rights-based society guaranteeing civil and religious liberties and equality for all, are set.  These are not negotiable.So, whoever is actually in charge of the DUP for the time being has a lot of serious thinking to do...Who now leads the DUP  Do they have the authority to negotiate and stick to an agreement Are they committed to a shared future with republicans, nationalists, and others in the north Unless, and until the DUP can clearly answer these questions for the rest of society, it will remain exactly where it is now – out of power, and facing the inevitable fate about which Carson warned: getting dumped by the British Tories.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27487  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe Liberal Party was in government in Britain and had introduced the Home Rule Bill with the support of the Irish nationalist MPs in Westminster. They had abolished the veto of the House of Lords and Home Rule was due to be implemented in . The Tories seized on the issue of Home Rule as the most effective weapon to bring down the Liberals. Leading members of the British landed aristocracy, capitalists and senior military figures jumped on the bandwagon and backed up Unionist leader Edward Carson with threats of civil warHome Rule was brought in.Amidst the political frenzy there were very few Protestants in Ulster who were prepared to oppose Carsonism. But there were some and among them was the Reverend J.B. Armour of Ballymoney, County Antrim. A minister of the Presbyterian Church, Armour stood out from most of his co-religionists in advocating self-government for Ireland. In , he opposed a resolution at the Presbyterian General Assembly condemning Gladstone’s second Home Rule Bill. He was also a strong critic of landlordism.In , he again opposed a resolution against Home Rule at the Presbyterian General Assembly.Calling for freedom of conscience for Protestants to support or oppose Home Rule, Armour slammed the intolerance of Carsonism when he told the assembly:“If you deny the right of private judgment and of free speech, how much do you have of Protestantism worth keeping  Nothing at all.”Armour organised a public meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney to support Home Rule and oppose Carsonism. Banners in the hall proclaimed “No provisional or provincial government for us” and “Ulster for Ireland and Ireland for us”.The resolution stated that the meeting of Protestants of Ballymoney and the protests in The Route“against the claim of Sir Edward Carson and the self-constituted Provisional Government of Ulster to represent the Protestant community of north-east Ulster” and “disputes the narrow claim that dferences of creed necessarily separate Irishmen and women into hostile camps”. Among the speakers at the Ballymoney meeting were JB Armour himself, historian Alice Stopford Green, Jack White, son of a British Army general and later a leading figure in the Irish Citizen Army, and Roger Casement, who was executed in . This was Casement’s first appearance on a political . With his Antrim family background, Casement regarded the occasion as hugely signicant and in his speech he denounced any notion of partitioning Ireland. The meeting was a once-off and failed to turn the tide of Carsonism but it did show that a signicant minority of Protestants in the North-East were still prepared to stand up for Irish unity and self-government. The meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney in support of Irish self-government was held on  October ,  years ago this week. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27490  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.- Declan KearneyLast weekend the Irish Congress of Trades Unionsand Irish Labour History Society organised a conference to commemorate William Walker in Belfast.Walker was an anti-Home Rule unionist who was a leader in the Belfast Independent Labour Partyin the early twentieth century.When James Connolly, Irelands most signicant historical, socialist republican leader called on the ILPs membership to support socialist unity in Ireland, his appeal provoked a rebuke from Walker.This led to a robust debate between both figures in the pages of Forward between May and July .Their debate came to be known as the Connolly Walker controversy and later became an historical reference point for the anti-imperialist struggle in Ireland.I participated in a  alongside veteran trade unionist Joe Bowers, Ulster Unionist councillor Chris Mc Gimpsey, and ICTU Assistant General Secretary, Owen Reidy, to discuss the post Walker years and the current situation in the north.Not surprisingly we delivered four very dferent perspectives on Walker and his legacy as well as, Brexit the north strategy and politics on the Left and, future prospects.A very challenging but fraternal debate ensued between the lists and the audience.I opened my comments by saying that any consideration today of William Walker’s legacy needs to be within the historic and contemporary reality that the advancement of socialist and Labour politics has been held back due to the effects of British colonial policy in Ireland.He was a product of his native Belfast and directly influenced by the communal environment within which he grew up.He was a protestant in a largely protestant workforce. Sectarianism in the late s and early s stalked Belfast.While Walker was severely limited in his political analysis he was committed to improving the conditions of his fellow workers.He is an integral part of Belfast’s industrial history and his contribution to the city’s labour heritage deserves recognition.British policy in Ireland and its consequences for Irish society has ided Irish workers along communal lines. It has paralysed the labour movement from effectively challenging partition and championing the strategic aim of Irish unity.Partition is the central fault line at the heart of Irish society and politics.Sectarianism remains a visceral blight in this state.Following partition, it was used by the ruling unionist elite to cement the foundation of the state and prevent unity among citizens on issues of common concern.The fact is Labour was indeed told to wait as the resurgent struggle for national independence grew in momentum just over  years ago.The counter revolution which took place post partition represented a strategic setback for labour and working-class interests in the new free state.It eclipsed the seminal influence which socialist republicanism had on the  Proclamation and the Democratic Programme of the First Dáil.The rights of workers became subservient to the conservative elites, north and south.However, sections of the labour movement were compliant with British policy in Ireland and the imposition of partition.That was personied in the political thinking of Walker and others pre partition.This tendency opposed Connollys core position that \"the two currents of revolutionary thought in Ireland, the socialist and the national, were not antagonistic but complementary\".Walkers debate with Connolly reflected a key contradiction inherent in the Irish labour movement and its relationship with the Irish national liberation struggle, and anti-imperialism generally.That contradiction has existed ever since.Walkers brand of ‘Municipal Socialism’ was in reality a euphemism for self-imposed strategic and political limitations which went on to define the Trade Union movement in the north.As a result, the Irish labour movement, particularly in the north has failed to challenge partition and modern British political policy towards Ireland.Partition has been an abject failure. It was never designed to make the northern state a political or economic success.From the beginning this state has carried within it the conditions of inherent instability.It was built upon institutionalised and structural sectarianism which ensured that a substantial minority was destined never to be treated as equals.The Civil Rights Movement fty years ago exposed the inability of the unionist state to treat the minority as equals.That belligerent opposition from powerful sections within political unionism against reform of the northern state persists today in the form of political unionism, and specically DUP hostility towards implementation of the Good Friday Agreementsince .Refusal by the DUP to embrace a rights-based society and equality, culminated in the collapse of the GFA political institutions in January , and our associated political crisis which has continued since then. Those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power-sharing.The party brand is now indistinguishable from financial scandal and sharp practice in government.As a party, the DUP is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic reforms, social modernity, and standards in public office.Its project is negative and tactical, and entirely focused upon slowing down and blocking progressive change, while maintaining a sectarian hegemony within the unionist constituency.The DUP is in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarian, homophobic and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists and many others, including sections of civic unionism, have concluded that the DUP has had its chance and cannot now be trusted in government.They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power at the risk of allowing it to continue practicing discrimination, intimidation, bigotry, or sharp practice.The enduring political crisis is accentuated by systemic structural weaknesses in the regional economy.The required investment in local public services and protection of workers’ rights are confronted with a combination of Tory austerity and Brexit.Pressures on public services are intensying.The regional block grant, or public expenditure settlement, has been reduced by .%.Real term cuts to public funding are now factored into future budget profiles alongside ·         Actual net cuts in take home pay for public and private sector workers·         Welfare cuts and the universal social charge·         Higher inflation and living costs, adults in working families live in relative povertyAverage wages in the north remain lower than ten years ago.Precarious working conditions, zero hours’ contracts, and the scam of bogus self-employment used by some employers are in common practice.Workers’ rights and protections are being systematically reversed.The onset of Brexit will be a catastrophe for the regional and island economiesIt will deepen an existing race to the bottom by further undermining the potential for economic growth, and new investment.The Brexit agenda, twinned with Tory austerity threaten jobs across all economic sectors, workers’ terms and conditions, and, any potential for sustainable public services in the north.The dawning political and economic reality is that Brexit has changed everything.It has exposed the negative role that partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentally anti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.  The British state has been pushed into an unprecedented, existential political crisis.Brexit is a train wreck being jointly steered by the DUP and extremists in the British Tory party.But it also has become a defining moment for these islands.A new generation is questioning partition.There has been a seismic sht in the ambitions and expectations of citizens in the north.A new political discourse has begun about the future of Ireland north and south, and our relationships with Britain and EuropeThe debate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have moved centre stage.The time has come for a fundamental paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.The Irish government needs to begin preparing constitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish Unity.It should facilitate an open, inclusive national conversation involving all citizens, political parties, social partners, and civic society.That is a dialogue about our collective future on this island which addresses all the concerns, accommodations and compromises relevant to negotiating a new, all Ireland, constitutional, pluralist democracy.Today this new focus upon Irish unity provides Irish trade unionists and workers with an opportunity to influence the debate about future constitutional and political change.Previous moments of political change have required that labour should wait.The emerging challenge for the Irish labour movement north and south is to engage with this emerging discussion.To paraphrase Connolly in his opening contributions to the Connolly Walker debate\"Constitutional change then is almost a certainty of the future.”The labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.I said to the Belfast conference this reality will require Irish trade unionists to take strategic positions on supporting an Irish unity referendum and then to campaign positively for constitutional change.On Monday of this week I reiterated that opinion when I met Patricia King, General Secretary of ICTU in Dublin.Of course, this will be a challenging discussion for the Irish labour movement, as comrades noted both during and after the plenary discussion. But it should not be feared or avoided.Today in modern Ireland there is a battle for hearts and minds about how society is organisedThe status quo has failed us all.Connolly’s vision of a united Ireland which serves the interests of the many instead of the few will not be wished into existence.Labour should not wait again.The Irish labour movement needs to assert itself on the Irish unity debate by introducing a progressive labour agenda to the unfolding discourse on future constitutional and political change.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27491  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe writer, newspaper editor and Irish republican Seumas O’Kelly was a native of Loughrea, County Galway. Author of short stories, plays, poems and a novel, The Weaver’s Grave which was his masterpiece, O’Kelly’s le was cut short because of his commitment to Irish freedom. The O’Kelly family of Loughrea were flour millers and merchants and Seumas received a good education. He was a fellow student of James Joyce in University College Dublin. There is a remarkable photograph of the BA degree class of  including Joyce, O’Kelly and George Clancy. Like O’Kelly, George Clancy, a close friend of Joyce, was to die a tragic death. He was Sinn Féin Mayor of Limerick when on  March  he was murdered in his home by the Black and Tans, on the same night as former Mayor Michael O’Callaghan. Seumas O’Kelly was a committed republican from an early age. He is recorded as one of those to the fore in the centenary commemorations of the  Rising in . He was writing for Arthur Grfith’s Irish Republican Brotherhood-funded newspaper The United Irishman from  and for its successor Sinn Féin from . While a full list of attendees is not available it is probable that he was at the founding meeting of Sinn Féin in November . In  O’Kelly was appointed editor of the Leinster Leader in Naas, County Kildare. He founded a branch of Conradh na Gaeilge in the town and was active in Sinn Féin locally. He welcomed republicans to his home during the annual Wolfe Tone commemorations in nearby Bodenstown. O’Kelly’s first book of stories was published in  and his first play was produced the following year. Several of his plays were produced at the Abbey Theatre. Constantly busy with literary and journalistic work, O’Kelly was subject to poor health. He joined Óglaigh na hÉireann when they were founded in  but was unable to play an active military role. His brother was a Volunteer and was jailed in England after the  Rising. The paper Nationality, edited by Grfith, was established in  and O’Kelly was one of its writers. It was the main organ of Sinn Féin during the  and  by-elections. In May  Grfith was arrested and jailed in England and O’Kelly took over as editor of Nationality. Following the  November  Armistice which ended the First World War, British soldiers and loyalists ran riot through the streets of Dublin, attacking suspected Sinn Féin supporters. On the night of  November a crowd of drunken soldiers invaded the Sinn Féin Ard Oig at  Harcourt Street . Seumas O’Kelly was at his desk in the Nationality office and tried to defend himself with his walking stick. The office was wrecked and O’Kelly collapsed. He was brought to Jervis Street Hospital where he died of a brain haemorrhage. Seumas O’Kelly was honoured with a republican funeral to Glasnevin Cemetery, attended by huge crowds. He died on  November ,  years ago this week.  test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27492  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaAt the start of the th century women began to campaign actively against the denial of their right to vote. In  the Women’s Social and Political Union was founded in England and the militant feminists commenced the battle for the vote. In Ireland there had been groups working for women’s suffrage but the campaign really began here on the instigation of Hanna Sheehy Skeffington and Margaret Cousins. Margaret Cousins came from a unionist family in Dublin but she later wrote: “I belonged in my heart from the beginning to the fighters for freedom.” Her husband James Cousins also rejected the unionism of his background and became involved in the Gaelic revival. Margaret came into contact with the women’s movement in England in . On herto Ireland she co-operated with a remarkable young woman who was to make her mark on Irish history. Hanna Sheehy was the daughter of a Fenian, David Sheehy, who took part in the  Rising and was elected as a Parnellite MP in . Hanna was an exceptional student and excelled academically despite the restrictions on women’s access to education she achieved a first class honours MA in . She became a teacher and married Francis Skeffington. In line with their shared feminist principles they adopted each other’s surnames. Francis resigned his post as registrar of University College because the authorities refused to register women on the same basis as men. In  Hanna and Margaret founded the Irish Women’s Franchise League , with the active support of both Francis Sheehy Skeffington and James Cousins. From the beginning they stressed that the IWFL would address the specic needs of Irish women in “a subject country seeking freedom from England” and would “work on independent Irish lines”. Margaret Cousins described the IWFL’s position: “Its policy was to educate by all forms of propaganda the men, women and children of Ireland to understand and support the members of the League in their demand for votes for women, and to obtain pledges from every Irish Member of Parliament to vote for Women’s Suffrage Bills introduced in the British Houses of Parliament, and to include Women’s Suffrage in any Irish Home Rule Bill.” The IWFL campaigned throughout the country and made an impact beyond their numbers of about  activists. Not all militant women agreed with the IWFL’s tactics the republican group Inghinidhe na hÉireann refused to join in lobbying the British parliament, preferring to “organise a women’s movement on Sinn Féin lines, or on lines even broader still”. Despite this dference, republican women such as Constance Markievicz played an active role in the IWFL’s work and Hanna Sheehy Skeffington herself was strongly republican. Markievicz urged young Irishwomen to prepare to fight: “Arm yourselves with weapons to fight your nation’s cause. Arm your souls with noble and free ideas. Arm your minds with the histories and memories of your country and her martyrs, her language, and a knowledge of her arts and industries. Andin your day the call should come for your body to arm, do not shirk from that either.” Markievicz said Irishwomen were “doubly enslaved with a double battle to fight”. Following the  general election the Irish Party at Westminster was in a position to press the Liberal government to publish a Home Rule Bill. But Redmond and his party still refused to support women’s right to vote. The IWFL became more militant and Hanna and Francis founded the Irish Citizen newspaper to further the cause of women’s rights as well as Irish independence, social justice and pacism. When British politicians visited Ireland they were challenged by the IWFL. Margaret ‘Meg’ Connery confronted British Tory leader Andrew Bonar Law and Unionist leader Edward Carson when they came to Dublin. In Belfast Hanna Sheehy Skeffington challenged Winston Churchill. Margaret Cousins joined protests in England in  and was jailed for a month. In June  eight women from the IWFL smashed windows in Dublin Castle and other prominent buildings. Hanna was arrested at the Castle and she and the seven others were imprisoned in Mountjoy. The following month British Prime Minister Asquith visited Dublin and there were more protests. Three English feminists had followed Asquith to Ireland and they were also jailed for their protests. After a hunger strike in Mountjoy by the English suffragists and the IWFL women, all were released except two of the Englishwomen who were subjected to forced feeding. Many meetings of the IWFL were physically attacked at this time by Redmondites who saw the campaign for women’s suffrage as a threat to their political dominance and their relationship with the British Liberal government. In contrast, republicans such as Pádraig Mac Piarais and Thomas MacDonagh were supporters of the IWFL. The IWFL also won the support of prominent trade unionists James Larkin and James Connolly. They were closely allied with the Irish Women Workers Union in Liberty Hall and in  Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed after a confrontation with the Dublin politan Police during the Great Lockout. She was released after a six-day hunger strike. That year also saw the death in England of feminist Emily Davison who ran on to the course at the Epsom Derby and was trampled by a race horse. Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed again in  for campaigning against recruitment to the British Army. Her influence and that of the IWFL was seen in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic of  which enshrined women’s right to vote. Her friend James Connolly told her: “You will be glad to know that in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic we are including equal citizenship for women.” Hanna replied that she knew who was responsible, meaning Connolly himself. “We were practically unanimous, Only one questioned it,” replied Connolly. Francis Sheehy Skeffington was murdered in Portobello Barracks by a British Army officer during the Easter Rising. Hanna embarked on a tour of the United States to expose the truth about the murder and other British atrocities. She continued to play a leading role in the struggle for Irish freedom, as did many of the pioneering feminists of the IWFL. In  the IWFL saw its central aim achieved when women voted for the first time in the general election which resulted in a massive Sinn Féin victory, although women under  were still excluded. The IWFL actively opposed British rule and supported Dáil Éireann. For example in August  Hanna was badly beaten by the RIC who attacked a Sinn Féin meeting at which she spoke in Kilbeggan, Co. Westmeath. IWFL women went on to champion women’s rights in the decades following the Treaty when they faced the very dferent challenges of a partitioned Ireland with conservative anti-women governments North and South. The Irish Women’s Franchise League was founded  years ago on  November .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27493  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonA wreckers’ agenda is being driven by the DUP and Tory government.

They must not be allowed to destroy the democratic option formaking change in the north.It is these circumstances which bring sharply into focus theIrish governments responsibilities.Those who courageously signed this letter to the Irish government are saying the negative position of the DUP and British governmentmust not be tolerated.These are citizens who want the political institutionsre-established but only on the basis of democracy and equality.They are assertive in their resolve to see a rights basedsociety created, which guarantees rights, respect, and parity of esteem, in ashared, inclusive future.But they are not prepared to be treated as second-classcitizens in this part of Ireland.Those days are over.It is time for the Irish Government to indeed redouble itsefforts to step up to the mark by absolutely opposing the imposition ofBrexit, and guaranteeing equality and rights for all citizens in the north.An Taoiseach and the Irish Government needs to reflect verycarefully about the signicance and timing of this intervention, respondpositively and act decisively, in cooperation with the politicalrepresentatives of Irish citizens, and others in the north, to ensure thattheir democratic rights are delivered upon.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27494  ","story":"• th NOVEMBER  - Newly elected Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams Mícheál Mac DonnchaTHE Ard Fheis of  marked a signicant stage in the political development of Sinn Féin. The historic gathering came in the wake of the campaign in support of the H-Block and Armagh prisoners, the epic Hunger Strikes, the intervention of prisoner candidates, North and South, in  and Sinn Féin’s electoral rise in the Six Counties in  and .The party’s performance in the October  Assembly elections – when five republicans were elected to the body set up by British direct ruler Jim Prior – caused alarm to the SDLP and their supporters in the Establishment parties in the  Counties. Sinn Féin’s lead in boycotting the Assembly was followed by the SDLP for fear of losing further support to republicans. The Fine Gael Labour Government, led by Garret FitzGerald, set up the New Ireland Forum in Dublin mainly as a  for the SDLP. In June , the political establishment in Ireland and Britain was rocked by the election of Sinn Féin Vice-President Gerry Adams as MP for his native west Belfast. For long a leading republican activist, Adams advocated the deeper politicisation and popularisation of the republican struggle and the building of Sinn Féin across the  Counties.The British Tory government of Margaret Thatcher was also concerned at the rise of Sinn Féin. In the week before the Ard Fheis in November , Prior told Tory MPs that Ireland could become a “Cuba off Britain’s west coast”. He said he feared Sinn Féin could overtake the SDLP electorally and “we must do all we can to strengthen constitutional nationalism”. When the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis gathered in the Mansion House in Dublin on  and  November, it was set to elect a new leadership. Ruairí Ó Brádaigh had been president since  and he announced that he would not be seeking re-election. He said the four-province federal Ireland plan, of which he had been a strong advocate, had been rejected at the  Ard Fheis and his approach on other issues, including electoral strategy, had been rejected by the Ard Chomhairle.In his address, the new party president, Gerry Adams, dismissed media claims of a ‘Northern takeover’ and said:“We are not a Northern, nor a Southern party – we are an Irish republican party organised throughout Ireland.”The main theme of his speech was the need for republicans to break out of political isolation and “get among the people in the basic ways which the people accept”. In line with this approach, the Ard Fheis voted to contest European Parliament elections with the intention of taking seatsthey were won. This followed the expansion of party electoral strategy the previous year. The Ard Fheis coincided with a by-election campaign for the Dáil seat of Dublin Central, which was contested by Sinn Féin candidate Christy Burke, turning in a creditable performance. There was further controversy after the Ard Fheis, and discomfort for Fianna Fáil leaders in particular, when Gerry Adams was confirmed as the main speaker at the annual Kilmichael commemoration in west Cork. Gerry Adams was elected president of Sinn Féin at the Ard Fheis of November ,  years ago.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27495  ","story":" Robbie SmythOver the last  years Irishsociety has evolved and transformed in many ways.

Ireland north or south was never a concern yet we will all pay the cost for generations to come.Brexit represents a huge threat to the social, economic and political le of this island. The outworking of Brexit could be the imposition of hard border.That is why the people of the north - from all communities and backgrounds - voted to reject it.They knew it would devastate the economy, strip away rights and undermine our political agreements.And that is why, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result, Sinn Féin embarked on a diplomatic offensive across Europe warning of the dangers of Brexit and putting forward our demand for a unique solution for the north which would respect the majority remain vote.Through intense lobbying in Brussels, Strasbourg, Dublin and London, Sinn Féin led and built support for the idea that our unique position and peace agreements required a unique Brexit solution.Our case for special status for the north within the EU sought to ensure there would be no hard border, that citizens rights would be upheld and the Good Friday Agreement protected in all its parts.As the prospect of a no deal Brexit became more likely, we made it clear the north needed to remain in the customs union and single market in order to prevent our economy being driven off a clf by the Tories and their DUP allies.That was reflected in the backstop which was agreed by the EU and the British government. But as soon as it was agreed the British government, as they always do, began trying to renege on its commitments.Our position remains now as it was then. That backstop must be maintained and protected. It provides the bottom line and is our insurance policy against the worst excesses of Brexit, which we know will be a disaster for this country.The backstop is not perfect and neither is the withdrawal agreement. There is no such thing as a good Brexit after all.There are still issues of concern and clarication required, particularly relating to the issues of rights and representation.Over the course of the last number of days Sinn Féin has met with An Taoiseach and An Tanáiste and have been in contact with Theresa May about all of these concerns.The pro-remain parties represent the majority of people in the north and are fighting on their behalf.By contrast, the DUP are actively trampling the best interests of people and business in the north in their reckless cheerleading for an as yet  Tory Brexit.Sinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit.  We will continue to put pressure on the Irish government to act in the interests of citizens, north and south and hold the Taoiseach to his pledge that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.Whatever twists and turns the Brexit debacle takes next, the backstop as agreed must be maintained. It cannot be sacriced in an attempt to save the ailing career of Theresa May or to serve the hard-line agendas of the Brexiteers in the Tory party or the DUP. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27499  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonGUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers# rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.- Declan Kearney MLADimitrios Papadimoulis is a Greek MEP who represents the Syriza party in the European Parliament.He has spent a le time involved in left wing political activism in his native Greece and has been a member of the Syriza central leadership which brought the party from opposition into government in , while the country was still in the midst of its financial and economic crisis and subjected to extreme political and economic pressure by the European Unionestablishment.Dimitrios is ‘laconic and philosophical in the way of Sparta’ – to borrow a phrase he used during a contribution at a recent conference which we attended together in Brussels, organised by GUE-NGL the European Parliamentary group to which both Sinn Féin and Syriza are affiliated.This meeting brought together leadership representatives and MEPs from twenty of the most signicant political parties on the progressive Left in the EU to discuss the future direction of GUE-NGL and future political strategy and co-operation among left wing and progressive parties including the  European elections, and the next term of the EU parliament.During one of our conversations at the conference Dimitrios recalled a story from - years previously, when he was travelling to deliver a speech.Dimitrios told his taxi driver what he was planning to say at the meeting.The taxi man replied:“Remember, you are a politician, not a prophet. Do not promise me things it will take  years to achieve. Make change for me tomorrow.”Dimitrios immediately decided to change his speech. He learned a lesson that day from the taxi driver which has stayed with him ever since.Theories or notions, and even visions for changeremain just that unless they can translate into concrete change in society.People want change which makes a material dference in their lives for them and their families.And thats how it should be.Fair wages high quality education and health free at the point of delivery and a clean sustainable environment should not be dreams. They need to become realities.So political activists who are committed to transformational change need to be grounded in the real world.They have to understand what they can deliver in the here and now, and then to have a plan to achieve even more.But the progressive Left can only make change when it has the strength to do so.That means setting realistic objectives and priorities, and then devising strategies which work.I said in my opening comments to the conference that Europe is at a crossroads.The political direction, policy orientation, and increasing need for reform of the EU coupled with, and often fuelling the rise of the extreme right wing, now presents an existential threat to the principles of the progressive Left.Social democracy has effectively collapsed both politically and electorally across Europe.There is a need to build a progressive Left alternative, and to popularise a new political narrative or common sense based upon core ideas: To include:·         That economies serve the many and not the few:·         That human and democratic rights are inalienable:·         That the global environment is protected:·         That Europe should act as a force for international peace and solidarity: and·         That racism, sectarianism, misogyny, homophobia and xenophobia are opposed.These ideas should be a common  for expanding the political strength of the progressive Left.However, that potential faces many challenges.Some of these are beyond the control of the progressive Left, but others are not.All of this was under discussion at the GUE-NGL conference.There were many notable contributions.Arnaldo Otegi, the General Secretary of the EH Bildu was in attendance.He had just received the ground breaking judgement from the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled his prosecution was wrong.During Arnaldos presentation he provided a powerful critique of global capitalism and the importance of defending community and social values.Panos Skourletis has been a senior minister of the Syriza government.In a highly signicant move several months ago, he moved from that role to take up the position of Secretary of Syrizas Central Committee.Panos set out an analysis of the situation in Greece and wider Europe and argued that it is time for a common front of left parties and other progressives and democratic forces in Europe.Earlier I argued that unity and cohesion are essential between parties and democratic forces on the left in Europe: and that we must focus on what expands unity, whilst respecting our dferences and uniqueness as parties and national movements.Sinn Féin believes that GUE-NGL has successfully enabled progressive parties from the left to co-operate within the European Parliament, whilst recognising the autonomy of political delegations.This is one of GUE-NGL’s strengths as a parliamentary group and deserves to be consolidated.Unanimity is not required on all issues, all of the time but progressives cannot afford to be disunited.Political sectarianism undermines political strength, solidarity and fraternity on the progressive Left.The collective strength of the progressive Left in Europe stems from the domestic relevance and political strength of its constituent parts.The left will only be as strong in the European Parliament as progressive Left and republican parties are relevant and strong in their national contexts.The success of a real progressive Left alternative,  depends upon securing strategic beach heads of political strength and influence.This is why support for the only left wing government in Greece is so politically important.Whilst progressives need to be in a hurry to make change and in pursuit of a social and more democratic Europe, we also need to be realistic and pragmatic.The distinction between strategy and tactical positions need to be understood.Alliances with others are indispensable to the process of changing the overall balance of forces.Rigid or dogmatic ideological positions can prevent agreement upon shared objectives and securing unity among the widest cross section of progressive and democratic opinion.The political discussion and focus upon an emergent European Progressive Caucus embracing the Left, social democrats, and environmentalists is such an innovative and welcome initiative.I proposed to the Brussels conference that a strategic consensus among the progressive Left and others should be based upon support for national independence, social emancipation, citizens rights, and democratic control over the economy.For our part Sinn Féin will contest the European election in  on an agenda which advocates for the creation of a Social Europe.We will be emphasising the need to protect rural and fishing communities the promotion of economic democracy enhanced environmental policy, human rights and social justice as well as defence of the Irish peace process and support for a united Ireland.The onset of Brexit has changed the political and social landscape in Ireland, and also signicantly influenced political discourse within the EU itself.It has swept away all of the established constitutional, political and economic assumptions about the status quo in Ireland and refocused international attention upon the democratic case for Irish unity.During the conference I highlighted the denial of citizens rights and blocking of political democracy in the north of Ireland by the DUP and British Tory government. The point was made that this existential rights crisis, combined with the imposition of Brexit represented the most serious threat to the Good Friday Agreement, and the democratic option for managing change in the north of Ireland.The European Parliament  EU institutions have become strategically important forums within which to promote the democratic aim of a united Ireland and to encourage support for an Irish unity referendum. The level of interest in, and support for constitutional change in Ireland is now at an unprecedented high level across the EU.Sinn Féin will continue lobbying to make the case for a united Ireland a priority for the progressive Left and within other sections of democratic opinion represented in the European Parliament. Irish unity is integral to the vision of a new Europe.Going forward, the progressive Left in Europe needs to focus its collective efforts upon maximising representation and influence in the next parliament.GUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.That is what the shared ambition of a New Europe should mean. Sinn Féin has a central role in promoting that vision.The progressive Left across Europe has much to do.We need to be people in a hurry.The future cannot wait.We need to plan, organise and attract the popular support to make change for all tomorrow: To build a New Europe - a Europe of Equals. test"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1106582.jpg--.jpg?1540373104000\n","title":"allen s meats moves to larger premises in cullybackey","story":"AFTER  years serving the people of Ahoghill Allens Meats has moved to larger premises to meet the demands of the growing business.The butchers shop has relocated to Cullybackey to take over the former Lamont Butchers at  Main Street in the village.Allens Meats needed to acquire larger premises and decided to make the move to Cullybackey after David Lamont retired.Lamont Butchers has been based in Cullybackey since  and Derek Allen and his team will continue to provide the same excellent customer service and top quality produce.Derek said: “The business is growing and we needed more space to enable us to offer a wider range of products.“We would like to thank all our customers in Ahoghill for their support over the last  years.

It is not a reflection of politics or religion and it is not red to reflect the colour of blood.The full motion read: That this Council was disappointed to learn of the decision by Cambridge Universitys Student Union to vote down a motion to promote Remembrance Sunday and therefore records its objection to this decision to ignore such a signicant event in our history.Cllr Henry continued, saying: If this is the way our young people have been taught, what hope do we have We as a nation look to our students in the hope that one day they will be our leaders in many walks of le.He also said: When the young people of Cambridge University voted overwhelmingly to de-emphasise the sacrice of the armed forces, thereby striking out any reference to the British war veterans, remembrance day and the poppy they brought untold hurt and suffering to many families who lost loved ones during the wars.What a despicable way to show gratitude to many hundreds of thousands who gave their all so as those students and indeed everyone of us can enjoy the freedom of democracy that we have today.Our freedoms cost many everything they had.It is easy to judge from a distance when you have the luxury of a safe and comfortable democracy.Cllr Henry requested that the council write to Cambridge University to: express their disgust and revulsion at the decision made by the Students Union. Speaking to second the motion, DUP Councillor Paul Reid said: The poppy is an emblem of remembrance used since .The poppy is not a political symbol, it is not a religions symbol but a reminder of those who fought for freedom.TUV Councillor Brian Collins thanked Cllrs Henry and Reid for bringing this matter to the attention of Mid and East Antrim Council.He said: This is a very emotive subject.To Cambridge Universitys Student Union, shame on you. Many a young man and women left the university and interrupted their studies to go a serve their nation, and many of them never ed to their studies.We have to remember the families. This is just disgraceful.The TUV fully support this important motion.UUP Councillor AP Wilson also supported the motion.He said: We share the disappointment with Cambridge Universitys student union.Cllr Wilson, however said he didnt think Council should get involved in: undergraduate student union politics, saying that: Sometimes there are lots of brains and not necessarily much common sense.He said that Council should do all they can to make sure remembrance was respectful and not party political.Alliance Councillor Paul Sinclair was also concerned about getting involved in student politics.He said: We should reaffirm our support for Remembrance Sunday.After a recorded vote, Sinn Fein Councillors Hardy and McKeown voted against the motion while Councillor Paul Maguire, Alliance Councillor Paul Sinclair and SDLP Councillor Declan OLoan abstained from voting.

Sinn Fein Councillor Patrice Hardy brought forward a motion as last weeks full council meeting, which stated: This Council supports the Right to Work: Right to Welfare groups Peoples Proposal aimed at introducing a simple but vital checklist for social security decision makers.‘This Council supports the aim and will write to the Permanent Secretary of the Department of Communities for the issuance of guidance to all Decision Makers, requiring them to ensure that both due process and impact assessments are undertaken and fully compiled with in the decision making process.Speaking in support of the motion, Councillor Hardy said: For me this is about protecting the most vulnerable in our society.“It is about building protections for the many citizens in the Mid and East Antrim Council district who are in the receipt of benefits. The Right to Welfare Group are calling for a risk assessment to be carried out by social security decision makers and have developed the Peoples Proposal which is a human rights checklist. “The checklist includes the right to due process, including the right to information and representation, presumption of innocence and transparent decision making prior to the appeal stage.”Councillor Hardy spoke passionate about the Peoples Proposal and about the recent benefit changes.She said it is needed because: On average over  financial sanction are issued against unemployed people every month, while  decisions are made on a monthly basis to stop sickness benefits.People are being financially sanctioned first and then appealed afterwards while suffering forced poverty.She gave figures, saying that: , people were forced to use food banks last year, including , children. This isnt good enough.Speaking about children, she said levels of child poverty have continued to increase here.Over a quarter of all children are living in poverty. This is not just a statistic, this is a sad reality. Many children are arriving to school hungry. Every child should have the right to food and every child should be free from poverty. Seconding the motion, fellow Sinn Fein Councillor James McKeown, said: This highlights the disaster that is austerity and changes in the welfare system have brought upon people in our society. He also added: We need a fairer and more professional approach to benefits.UUP Councillor Stephen Nicholl, said: The substance of the motion is absolutely correct. The impact of the changes in welfare delivery are causing a signicant impact in society, especially on those who are the poorest in society.He added: The increasing use of food banks in areas where universal credit has been ruled out, the use of food banks have increased by %.I have seen some horrendous decisions going through. So I think anything that introduces greater clarity and greater consideration of the actualconditions is to be welcomed to try and make this a fairer system.DUP Councillor Billy Ashe said this affected everyone. He commented: We would support this motion. The benefit system is not working for the most vulnerable.He added that the community planning directorate compile a report on this subject that Council can use to influence decision making at a higher level in the future.Council unanimously voted in support of the motion.

Boyle, Chief Executive of Ballymena Business Centre. The project is part funded by Invest Northern Ireland and the European Regional Development Fund under the Investment for Growth  Jobs Northern IrelandProgramme.I used to be a childminder and had two young children and didnrsquot think it was possible for me to get into the beauty business - but then I went back to college and studied beauty at the Roberta Mechan College, she said.I have a real interest in health and well-being and wanted to offer these services to others. I opened in April this year and I currently offer specialist skincare, nails, massage and waxing.Helen turned her dream into a reality after taking part in the Go For It Programme which is delivered free of charge by a team of experienced business mentors through Northern Irelandrsquos wide network of enterprise agencies.It provides expert advice and help with developing a robust business plan to help turn ideas into a commercial enterprise.Commenting on the success of the programme, Helen said: Often it is hard to know where to start that was my experience before starting the Go For It Programme. The support and guidance offered through it helped me fine tune my business idea from concept to working reality.They helped me with practical things in the early stages like setting out a business plan and doing a detailed analysis. It was great for helping me to budget and forward plan.ldquoI would urge anyone who has ever had the idea of starting up their own business, or evenyou have just started operating your own business to apply for a place on the Go For It Programme. The skills and knowledge imparted is beyond the realms of what you could achieve on your own.Melanie Christie Boyle, Chief Executive of Ballymena Business Centre, on behalf of Mid and East Antrim and Borough Council, added: ldquoHelen joined the Go For It Programme driven by a desire to launch her very own beauty business, driven by a passion to help women improve their skin and help them feel good about themselves.Helen undertook an intensive beauty course under tutelage of an industry expert with a clear vision and motivation to open her own salon as soon as she completed her examinations.We worked with Helen to develop a business plan, focusing on key areas such as defining her service provision, marketing and financial forecasting, as well as helping her secure commercial premises at Ballee and Harryville Community Enterprise Centre.It is great to see how Helen has progressed her business in such as short space of time, building a loyal customer base and a excellent reputation for her quality customer service and using only the very best range of products.If you have a business idea yoursquod like to develop oryou are thinking about starting a business call    or visit: visit www.goforitni.

Looking after the maintenance of it, the operations of it, all the visitors’ services, and the staff and all that side of things.“Anything that happens on the bridge is my responsibility and it’s my job to make sure it gets sorted out.”Trish Johnson making safety checks on the bridge.Born in Belfast, Trish grew up in Banbridge, attended St Mary’s Primary School and then Banbridge Academy where she completed her A Levels before going on to study engineering at the University of Salford, Manchester.After graduating, she says she “sort of fell into” bridge engineering and maintenance – an industry she has remained in for more than  years.Trish, who is better known to family and friends in Northern Ireland as Patricia, has been bridgemaster at Clton for the past two years. But previously she was in charge of maintenance at the Severn Bridge and the Second Severn Crossingand before that looked after bridges and highways across Wiltshire and Avon.She is the first woman to take on the role of bridgemaster at Clton, but says she isn’t tempted to change her title to bridgemistress.An aerial view of the Clton Suspension Bridge, which spans the Avon Gorge and the River Avon.“It is a historic title so it would be unfair to try to change it. I’m happy with bridgemaster, so I wouldn’t want to try to change the course of history!”Trish manages a team of  people including bridge attendants, visitor centre staff, maintenance workers and administration staff, as well as dozens of volunteers who help out with ious projects.“I really enjoy it. It’s fantastic,” she said. “It is a real honour to be looking after such a historic asset. I’ve been in Bristol  or  years now – a long time since I left Northern Ireland – and the bridge has always been a part of my tours when family have been over, so it’s amazing that I’m actually looking after it now. and Santa getting ready for the Twilight Market in Portadown.\"   and Santa getting ready for the Twilight Market in Portadown.\"  Christmas switch-on and twilight market tonight Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"“It is a big responsibility. The bridge itself is over  years old. It is one of the icons of Bristol. We get half a million visitors here every year, so it is my responsibility to make sure the bridge is well maintained, safe to use and that it is there for a long time to come.“It is a historic Grade  listed structure and there are not many historic Grade  listed structures that are still used as a transport asset. We still have four million vehicles cross the bridge every year, so it is a working asset as well as a historical and visitor attraction, so there is a lot to the job and it definitely keeps me busy.”The married mum-of-two admits to being slightly obsessed with bridges, and once even booked a weekend trip to Copenhagen just so she could visit the Öresund Bridge which runs between Denmark and Sweden.Her husband Rob, who works in finance, may not share her passion for bridges, but it seems he’s seen more than his fair share over the years.“When we go on holidays he ends up getting trailed round every bridge,” Trish smiled. “He’s getting used to the bridges by now!”Neither of Trish’s children share her love of engineering either. Her daughter Fiona, , works in marketing, while son Thomas, , is studying economics at university.She says she tried to get them into engineering, without success. But she’s adamant that more needs to be done in the UK in general to encourage young people, particularly girls, to get into science, technology, engineering and mathssubjects.“I think the UK has got the lowest percentage of female engineers in Europe and that’s a sad situation. We’ve probably got about % or less female engineers across the UK, so it is really important that we increase the number of women in engineering. “We need to increase the number of people with engineering skills full stop, but we need to tap in to that whole area of getting girls engaged and interested in engineering,” she continued.“Maths was my big thing. I am one of these geeks really. The problem solving side of things is what I really liked, and still do really, and engineering is perfect for that. There is always a problem you’ve got to sort out, and that’s what gets me out of bed in the morning.“I have done it for  years and I have had a whale of a time and really enjoyed it. It’s not just about getting your hands dirty and the mud and concrete and that side of things, there is so much more to it than that and that’s what we have to try to get across to the youngsters of today.”Trish, whose father Tommy Fee is well known in the Banbridge area for having run\u2028 fitness classes at the local college for more than four decades, has made her le in Bristol and says she has no plans at present tohome to Northern Ireland.“I get drawn back every now and then. I go back to see family and friends. But my husband and kids are here so I don’t think I’ll be moving home just yet, but who knows what we’ll do when we retire.”THE FACTS• The Clton Suspension Bridge opened in . It is a private bridge run by a trust.• The  feet long, ,-tonne structure spans the Avon Gorge and River Avon between Clton in Bristol and Leigh Woods in North Somerset.• The deck of the Grade  listed structure sits  feet above the river.• Its designer, Isambard Kingdom Brunel, was just  when he was appointed project engineer. • Brunel died in  – five years before the bridge he described as “my first love” officially opened.• Today the bridge serves as a crossing for more than four million vehicles every year.• Vehicle drivers have to pay a £ toll to cross the bridge, and the money goes towards the upkeep of the historic structure.• Trish Johnson, the first female bridgemaster, took over the role in October ."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8537099.1529312918!/image/image.jpg","title":"new park ride facility at fane valley welcomed","story":"Local Alderman Junior McCrum has welcomed the new park and ride facility being built adjacent to Fane Valley in Banbridge.

With a limited number of tickets still available, ‘Em Two Balloons duo Gerard Jordan and Ciarán Nolan told Daily Belfast how audiences can expect all their favourite characters from previous stage outings with a wedding bringing together the West and North of the city for its fairytale finale.“This is the fourth year we have brought ‘Em Two Balloons and their Christmas show to the Roddy’s,” explained Ciarán, “we had great success last year with the Terrible Tragedy of the Twinbrook Turkey and we are back again to tell all about the Fairytale of New Lodge. We had Deck the Falls back in , Turkey last year and now this feels like the completion of part of a trilogy.”“The demand for the shows is growing each year,” said Gerard, “audiences have really taken the characters Ciarán and I play and given us such great support. At the start of November we learned that there are only  per cent of the tickets left at the Mac and people are coming in every day to get their tickets early for the Roddy’s. If there were more days in December we would put on more shows as the demand is there.”“Audiences can expect pretty much what they have experienced before, especially in terms of laughter,” said Ciarán. “There are wedding bells in the air in the production, North Belfast is meeting West Belfast and the introduction of the Glider is bringing our characters East. I mean, what’s the most exotic thing for a Westie  It’s’ getting on the Glider and heading East, seeing Stormont in real le,” he laughed. “The characters Gerard and I have created Jean and Joan, Tablets and Muttley and our two doormen Feargal and Maxi are all there as well. Countess and Winalot, the two dogs, are woofing all the way towards Christmas too. Our bride is played by me and called Mini Driver who is from the Oldpark, Feargal is our groom and the all important wedding prep forms part of the story too.”Gerard spoke of how the hard work has been going on behind the scenes since .“It’s been great how much the audiences have backed us. The real compliment is that the audiences keep growing and this year we’ve added matinees into the Mac, we want to branch out to new audiences each year and will be taking the show to Naomh Éanna on December  as well.”Ciarán said that due to overwhelming demand a handful of dates will be performed after Christmas at Fruithill Bowling Club, Gort Na Mona and St Paul’s GAC on the ,  and  of December. “We will be working on new material for  and ‘Em Two Balloons will be bringing out a new production.

Speaking in Dublin Mr Varadkar said: “The intention would be extending the transition period, and activating the backstop would never be necessary and won’t be necessarywe can successfully negotiate a future relationship, so the sooner we can have this deal sealed, and the sooner we can get on to talking about that future relationship the better I think.” While in Brussels, Mr Coveney attended a meeting of EU Foreign Affairs Ministers to discuss Iran, Yemen, Central Asia and Ukraine, as well as security and defence. He said ministers had an exchange of views on Iran and had reaffirmed support for the Iran nuclear deal. The EU’s relations with Central Asia were discussed ahead of an EU-Central Asia ministerial meeting which is scheduled to take place on November . Mr Coveney said: “This is a region of growing importance and we discussed how the EU can take forward our partnership with Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.” The ministers also had an exchange on Bosnia and Herzegovina following recent elections there. Mr Coveney said Ireland was “strongly supportive” of the perspective of EU membership being an agent for the promotion of reform and stability in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the wider Balkan region.

Their joint interpretation captured the essence of yet another Mozart masterpiece, with the soloist giving a most sensitive performance of the blissful Adagio, which is one of those classical pieces most people recognize, but are sometimes not sure where it comes from.The second half was taken up by Schuberts Ninth Symphony, known as \"The Great\", which the Ulster Orchestra already performed this year at the end of its lunchtime series in early summer.Under the direction of Rustioni, this was a stately and measured performance of this truly \"great\" symphony, which finally burst into le in the finale.Schubert was never a composer to waste a good tune and he repeated the main theme all the way to its triumphant climax, to sustained and deserved applause.The Ulster Orchestra is looking for a new principal conductor, and Maestro Rustioni, on his third visit to Belfast, has certainly made his mark."},{"url":null,"title":"we would be trapped taoiseach comments show hard border never possible says arlene foster","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Mrs Fosters comments come amid growing pressure on the party from Northern Irelands business community to rethink its position on the proposed deal. On Friday influential farming and business organisations voiced their support for it. Appearing on RTEs The Week in Politics programme on Sunday, Mr Varadkar said his government was not contemplating a hard border on the island of Ireland in the event of a rejection of the draft Brexit withdrawal deal. \"We have been told that the backstop is only necessary to prevent such a hard border, but these comments make it clear that the EU’s insistence on a backstop was not aimed at this,\" said Mrs Foster.

We would be trapped,\" she added. \"Those attempting to sell the current deal are using the threat of no deal as the only other option. I appreciate the concerns people have about a no deal but this should not be a binary choice. It is absolutely clear that it is time to work for a better deal.”On Friday, Mr Varadkar warned against unpicking the current withdrawal deal and said signing up to the agreement was the only way of avoiding a hard border. In Belfast on Monday, Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley was speaking to business leaders in the province about the benefits of the proposed deal. Mrs Bradley said a no-deal Brexit would mean theof customs and regulatory checks on the island of Ireland with World Trade Organisation rules meaning it was \"very clear\" checks would be required. She also suggested the future of the Common Travel Area would become uncertain in the event of a no-deal Brexit. On Monday Sinn Fein leader Mary Lou McDonald hit out at Arlene Foster over her partys position on the current Brexit deal. Mary Lou McDonald insisted it was time for “grown-up politics” and to act to protect the island of Ireland’s economy from a no-deal Brexit.In a scathing assessment of the DUP position, Ms McDonald said “internal wrangles” within the party should not be allowed to drive Ireland “over the clf”."},{"url":null,"title":"commons finance","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I’m asking ministers about her freedom of conscience again today in #JCNSS https:t.co mwBShUFsDp— Tom TugendhatNovember , Grilling Mr Lidington at a session of the parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Security Strategy, Mr Tugendhat warned that by continuing to fund the programme, the UK was allowing its policy on human rights to be “held hostage”.“What we are dealing with here is a situation in which the policy of the UK Government is being decided by a Pakistani mob,” said the Tonbridge  Malling MP, who also chairs the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee.Mr Tugendhat said there could be few more deserving beneficiaries of the right to asylum than Ms Bibi and her family, who have so far been unable to leave Pakistan.But he told the committee the Foreign Office’s senior civil servant had suggested that she may not be offered sanctuary by Britain because of the “security implications for Pakistan and the UK”.“That does raise some serious questions about our policy as a country and what we are willing to stand up for,” said Mr Tugendhat.Releasing evaluations of the value for money of the Rule of Law in Pakistan Programme would allow MPs to scrutinise whether UK Government personnel and resources were being used “as a means of holding our own policy hostage or indeed as leverage for a Pakistani mob”, he said.The programme is funded in   by £. million of overseas aid and an undisclosed amount of other UK money, said Mr Tugendhat.While he supported the goal of building the capability of the Pakistani judicial institutions, he said: “It is the results I am seeing which leave me deeply concerned.“There comes a point where we must ask ourselves is the money we are putting in good money after bad, or is it making a dference “When you look at the way we have handled other abuses of minorities by other countries, where we have withheld funding or closed programmes, this does raise some serious questions about our very signicant assistance to the Government of Pakistan and the current government’s seeming tolerance of extremist violence and propaganda against human rights.”Mr Lidington said he shared the MP’s “horror and outrage” at the treatment of Ms Bibi.But he said: “I would deny the proposition that the UK policy is being determined by a mob in Pakistan.“We do have a law which requires each asylum case to be assessed on its merits. I know the Home Secretary is determined that, should this case come before him, he would have that dealt with in the same way on its merits.”Mr Lidington said that there were “international conversations going on” about how to help Ms Bibi and her family live in safety, but declined to give further details.He said he would seek advice on whether to release the evaluation report.Mr Lidington said that “all relevant information” would be taken into account when deciding on future aid funding to Pakistan.The  Bibi case highlighted the dficulty Pakistan faces with the tolerance for extremist views among parts of its officialdom as well as the general population, he told the committee."},{"url":null,"title":"7 ways you can celebrate international mens day according to","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The main route is as follows:.Quay Trail from existing greenway behind Sainsbury’s supermarket, Derry to the entrance of Foyle Hospice on the A .Entrance of Foyle Hospice along A on left-hand side towards Thornhill College .Thornhill College to Culmore village, turning right on to Culmore Point Road continuing adjacent to the River Foyle.Coney Roadpast Culmore Country Park, turning right on to Canning’s Lane in Muff .Turning right on to Kilderry Lane and continuing to the R.Connection on R back towards the Community Hall and also in the direction of the Muff Community Parkgoogletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshIn Muff, the route will also include an additional link to the village centre from further up Canning’s Lane on to Kilderry Lane, coming out at Main Street opposite Borderland.The North West Greenway Network programme manager, Jonathan Henderson said: “Almost  people attended the consultation events which were held in May and we received over  written submissions. A key outcome from the consultation process is that people are on the whole supportive of the project concept and are keen to see both local authorities construct infrastructure which encourages cycling and walking between the two locations. The rationale for the chosen route has been explained in the Stage  Preferred Route Corridor Selection Report which will be available at both events as well as online from  November.”Ronan Gallagher, Communications Manager for the project, added: “One of our key objectives is to build infrastructure that will encourage people to cycle and walk to and from their destination in Derry or Muff, but particularly between the two locations. Once completed, not only will we link Muff to Derry, but students at Thornhill College and several primary schools will be able to cycle and walk to school in a safe, segregated environment.”At both events the general public will have an opportunity to leave comments on the proposals. For those who are unable to attend, plans and a comments card will be available at www.nwgreenway. After these events, both local authorities will proceed to lodge formal planning permissions in both jurisdictions and will engage with landowners along the route to agree accommodation works. The councils are keen to liaise with residents while minimising disruption during construction. Subject to the approval of planning consent in both jurisdictions, it is hoped that construction work can commence in early .Public information events:Wednesday  November  – Hollybush Primary School,

power restored","story":"Concerns have been raised after residents of a street in Derry waited nine hours to have power restored to their homes after an underground cable was damaged.The incident happened at the Paddock Lane area in Ballyarnett at pm on Friday, which resulted in a number of homes experiencing a power loss.However, concerns have now been raised that it took NIE nine hours to restore power, given that many of those who live in the area are elderly.Commenting, the independent councillor for the area, Warren Robinson, said that while he understands that certain circumstances could delay power being restored, he was nonetheless concerned at how the issue was handled by NIE.“I was made aware of the problem after being contacted by some residents who were affected. “Concerns were raised in particular because this area houses a large proportion of elderly residents. “I immediately contacted NIE and was informed that a third party contractor had damaged a cable in the area and was told that a repair team were on site but NIE could not give me an estimate for when the fault would be repaired.”Cllr Robinson added: “I understand that sometimes circumstances may mean there is a delay in having repairs carried out but electricity was off in this area for ten hours and my concern would be that elderly residents were left with no information and no offers of help from NIE.”“NIE do have a duty of care to these customers, I believe they have a particular duty of care to our elderly neighbours. googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“NIE need to tell us why it took ten hours for the repair to be carried out. They also need to put measures in place wherebythere is a delay that this is immediately communicated to the affected residents.”Safety Responding, a spokesperson for NIE said that the efforts of engineers had been hampered by ‘adverse weather conditions’, adding that it had been dficult to provide customers with an exact time for when the issue would be resolved due to ‘complexity’ of the problem.“NIE Networks received reports of a fault at Paddock Lane at approximately pm on Friday, November ,” a spokesperson said. “An underground electricity cable had been accidentally damaged by a third-party contractor resulting in a small number of customers experiencing loss of electricity supply. “The damaged cable required isolation for safety reasons before engineers could begin to carry out repairs. The spokesperson continued: “We do endeavour to provide our customers with information where possible, however, it was dficult to provide an exact time for restoration on this occasion due to the unforeseen nature and complexity of the fault, as well as the safety required to undertake the repairs. “This was further compounded by our engineers operating in adverse weather conditions. Following excavation work, repairs were carried out to the damaged cable with supply to all affected customers restored by .pm on Friday.”"},{"url":null,"title":"us investors told north west ireland gateway uk eu markets","story":"Potential American investors were told last week that the North West is perfectly placed for an investment hub for business and global companies seeking to establish a gateway to both the UK and EU markets. A number of focused engagements with industry specialists, FDI executives and venture capitalists took place throughout the week in both Philadelphia and Boston as part of the Trade and Investment mission led jointly by Donegal County Council and Derry City and Strabane District Council, presenting the compelling investment proposition that the Northwest City Region has to offer.Potential investors heard from leading global company DuPont, which has a longstanding commitment to the region, taking advantage of the unique combination of benefits that the Northwest region has to offer including an accessible, connected and business friendly gateway region with a compelling vision for greater international impact.Investors learned that companies and businesses are attracted by a talented and educated workforce, the value balance, the superb quality of le and the supportive business environment. Cathaoirleach of Donegal County Council, Cllr Seamus ODomhnaill, who led the delegation along with Cllr John Boyle Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, believes that these types of engagements are essentialwe are to raise the profile of the region as an investment location. “Having these key influencers and potential investors in a room focusing on the northwest region and sharing with them our vision and ambition as well as the practical supports and assistance available to businesses in the region is vital,” he stressed. “There is no better way to build meaningful connections and relationships than face to face engagements.”Mayor John Boyle believes that: “The strength of the region is underpinned by the strong collaborative approach which sees industry, government at both central and local level, and further and higher education institutions from both sides of the border working together to fuel further economic growth and prosperity. This is something that investors value greatly in terms of facilitating ease of access to supports in the region.” Local businesses from a range of sectors across both Council areas also participated in the mission meeting with potential clients and business partners with a view to increasing sales and expanding their businesses. Derry based Bridie Mullin Irish Linen Ltd. participated in the mission and brought her eponymous label of handcrafted quality Irish line to Boston in an effort to tap into the US market.Bridie explains that the trade visit was an opportunity to build on her own research, and to visit stores and meet with potential clients gaining a deeper understanding of what exactly the customer is looking for. It also allowed her to get an insight into the potential costs associated with exporting and logistics assisting in finalising price points for trading.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshThe trade and investment mission also involved engagement with educational institutions with a memorandum of understanding being signed by the North West Regional College and Philadelphia Community College and the State of Pennsylvania during the mission that sees the consolidation of relationships developed over the last two years.Samantha Traynor, Vice Principal of the North West Regional College, who also participated in the Trade and Investment Mission, explained: “The MoU represents the first step in building and consolidating a partnership through education and training with a specic focus on sharing best practice in Work Based Learning to include Traineeships, Apprenticeships including Higher Level Apprenticeships and also the continued professional development of our respective professionals in our workforce.”The week also saw the announcement by both Councils of an exciting research project with Hard Graduate School of Design, exploring how the cross-border northwest city region can be shaped in light of the economic, political and social realities of Brexit. This project is being led by Assistant Professor Gareth Doherty in Hard GSD, who is originally from Donegal. Reaching out to the diaspora was also a key objective of the mission and this manested in events in both Philadelphia and Boston, where members of the diaspora from across the region attended and shared with the delegation the opportunities and challenges faced by the diaspora and their commitment to continue to engage in a way that is meaningful and mutually beneficial. The Cathaoirleach of Donegal County Council also had the honour of accepting on behalf of Donegal Hospice a cheque of , raised by the Donegal community in Philadelphia.Speaking after the trip, Chief Executive of Donegal County Council, Seamus Neely, said: “This Trade and Investment Mission is part of the ongoing positive work being done by both Councils. We are committed to continuing with the positive work we are doing to drive forward our economy and to maximise the opportunities we have as a cross border gateway to both the UK and EU markets. “We have longstanding connections with Philadelphia and Massachusetts and these connections transcend economic, cultural and political linkages. The Golden Bridges conference has provided the Northwest region with an important  in the Massachusetts region allowing us to reach out, connect with and form meaningful relationships and collaborations with stakeholders in ious sectors that have been instrumental in progressing growth and prosperity in the region.”Reflecting on the visit, Chief Executive of Derry City and Strabane District Council, John Kelpie, said: “It takes time to make connections, develop relationships and build trust. Our ongoing positive engagement with Massachusetts has to date resulted in a number of exciting developments including the investment and success stories around One Source Virtual and Metaverse. “Results such as these are part of our key objectives in terms of strengthening the profile of the City Region as outlined in our Strategic Growth Plan and are evidence that our direct approach of travelling to the US, making those connections and building rapport, really works.”Pictured at the launch of the new research project led by Hard GSD exploring how the northwest region can be shaped post brexit are Cathaoirleach of Donegal County Council Cllr.

been given to Carryduff girl Cara Mailey.The nine-year-old has a form of dwarfism which means that living in a standard-sized world can present challenges for her.Born with achonlasia, Cara dared to dream big and applied last year to have a special den created for her by the team from the popular CBBC programme The Dengineers.The plucky and determined child is now the proud owner of a colourful sweet-themed garden den that is ideally sized to suit her height mdash and her sweet tooth.Despite the production team swamping the Mailey family home in June to carry out the work, the show was only broadcast on Sunday morning.Cara found herself a star attraction at St Josephrsquos Primary School, in Carryduff on Monday.ldquoA lot of people have been telling me I saw you in the newspaper, I saw you on TV, giggled Cara.She has made great use of her den since then.ldquoI play in it most of the time, I sometimes do my homework there and bring in my friends to play or go in just get some sweets and bring them into the house, she told the Recorder.ldquoHaving the den makes me feel a lot happier and safer as usually I would be climbing up stuff to reach things but now I can pick them up and

never had anything like it when I was younger, she said. For Cara all of the toys or bikes for her age group are all too big or tall for her, so this is brilliant.Mrs Mailey said Cara came up with the idea of having a sweet-themed den after attending a birthday party at Aunt Sandrarsquos Candy Factory in Belfast last year.ldquoCara decided herself that she wanted to apply for the Dengineers and I honestly didnrsquot think she had any chance of getting it as there were over , applications from throughout the UK, said Trish.ldquoCara did a phone interview with the producers, then a Skype interview, then they came over to spend a day with her and it was all hush hush until we got the call to say she had got it.Her parents had to keep the news a secret until presenters Lauren Layfield and Joe Traconi surprised her with the news in May after she won bronze in the m sprint at the National Dwarf Games in Birmingham.Trish added: ldquoA team of four came over in June on a Monday as the den was created by designer Mara Tulip and the big reveal day on the Friday.

It is also impacting on residents being able to park outside their homes, particularly in the Irish Street, Fountain Street and Saul Street areas.Cllr Sharvin believes the combined voices of the business community and residents can see the charges reduced to their previous level to ldquosupport the economical sustainability of Downpatrick town centre.He is also encouraging people to complete the online survey or pick up a paper copy from the council offices at the Downshire Civic Centre.Cllr Sharvin confirmed he has also asked council officials to survey the condition of its three car parks in Downpatrick, suggesting the surface in Irish Street is ldquoparticularly poor.Downpatrick councillor, Dermot Curran, has also expressed concern about the impact of the increased charges and believes the increasing concern is exactly the kind of issue a tradersrsquo group in the town should be addressing.He added: ldquoThe town needs a thriving business organisation to help with its continued economic regeneration and to discuss issues like increased parking charges. Such a body would provide the business community with a much-needed voice on a range of important issues.The series of roadshows to discuss parking charges moved to The Lodge in Castlewellan and the Newcastle Centre last night and takes place next Tuesday, November , at Ballynahinchrsquos Market House between .pm and .pm, before later moving to The Hub in Saintfield between pm and pm..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Symbolic lantern walk rekindles time WWI ended  ","story":"A SPECIALLY designed beacon was lit in Killyleagh on Sunday night to mark the th anniversary of the end of the First World War.Local man Martin lsquoTinarsquo Charters, , one of Northern Irelandrsquos last survivors from the Second World War, lit the gas beacon of light at the front of Killyleagh Castle to mark the moment the guns finally fell silent.Mr Charters was accompanied by two local schoolchildren, Zac Gordon, from St Maryrsquos Primary School, Killyleagh, and Louise Craig, of Killyleagh Integrated Primary School.The cross-community event was attended by more than  people at the end of Remembrance Sunday.The eveningrsquos events began with a lantern walk from Shrigley to Killyleagh.

worlds brexit","story":"The author of a report, \"Brexit at the Border\", has said that the ldquopressure is on our political parties especially those with the influence of the DUPa \"best of both worlds\" brexit is to become a reality.Dr Katy Hayward, who is a Reader of Sociology at Queens and who has  years research experience on the impact of the EU on the Irish border and peace process, was responding to an article penned by DUP leader Arlene Foster in last weekrsquos Impartial Reporter.In that article Mrs Foster laid out what the ldquobest of both worlds would be for Northern Ireland, which included full access to UK single market, full access to the EU single market, and full access to future UK and EU trade deals.Mrs Foster said that no-one has offered this ldquobest of both worlds to Northern Ireland but Dr Hayward claims that it is possible but onlythe ldquoUK remains closely aligned to the EUrsquos single market andit stays in a customs union with the EU.Dr Hayward does not see a smooth path to any such scenario however.ldquoBut, as Mrs Foster is well aware, the most vocalMPs in the Tory party want the UK to have a far more remote relationship with the EU after Brexit. If they succeed, this would automatically mean more barriers to trade with the EU, including across the Irish border, she stated.Dr Hayward agreed that the Mrs Fosterrsquos argument against any sort of backstop was ldquoperfectly reasonable as it is not ldquothe intended destination. But she still argues that it is of ldquocritical importance.. It is the issue over which the whole Withdrawal Agreement could collapse, leaving all of us in the mire of a lsquoNo Dealrsquo outcome.ldquoIt is therefore very important that all judgements of the backstop are based on a clear and accurate understanding of what it actually means, unclouded by hyperbole.And it is in relation to the backstop where Dr Hayward, who is a Fellow in the Senator George J. Mitchell Institute for Global Peace, Security and Justice, took most issue with Mrs Foster analysis:ldquoFoster claims that Northern Irelandrsquos access to the UK single market would be restricted. In actual fact this is entirely in the hands of the British government ndash it is a domestic issue unrelated to UK-EU negotiations, the Queens Reader asserted, before adding:ldquoSecondly, Foster says that lsquoEU access, comes with the requirement for Northern Ireland to fully adopt and implement EU regulations with no changesrsquo. But it is not necessary to have full regulatory alignment with the EU in order to have tarf free access to its market. That would be like saying wed have to have all our laws imposed by Beijingwe are to get tarf-free access to China.Dr Hayward does however admit that major ergence would require an operational backstop:ldquoThat said,the UK erges widely from the lsquocommon rulebookrsquo of the EUrsquos single market, it would not be possible for goods produced in Northern Ireland to have free movement around the single market as is currently the case. It would be in just such an instance that the backstop could come into play. This would not mean that all EU laws would apply in Northern Ireland but rather that goods produced here could be considered to be of EU standardcertain procedures are followed.In her opinion piece last week Mrs Foster stated that:ldquoFree Trade Agreements donrsquot just cover regulation but tarfs too. This would require not just being in the single market but in the customs union. In other words, a total sea Border descending between Northern Ireland and its largest market, Great Britain.Dr Hayward does not agree however and says ldquothere is absolutely no prospect of a total sea border under any scenario.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It has also argued that the current application represents the ldquobest value for money.ldquoThe RNLI applies the highest standards and practices to all its applications for its facilities. The site chosen, from what was available, is the one that represents the best location and value for money for the Institution.That assertion is one that has been challenged by the LEYC who has said in its letter to members: ldquoWe also believe that the cost of the new site will be considerably more expensive overall with higher ongoing maintenance and cost and therefore a waste of donations.The LEYC also claim that the RNLI have changed their mind over the site of its proposed new station: ldquoWhen we originally discussed the proposed site with the RNLI they told us that they preferred to build as part of a bigger development as originally it was submitted as part of a bigger development plan. They later changed this to saying that the newer site would give them more visibility and potential footfall despite it being obvious that the original site was much more public facing.The LEYC also asserts that the original site it refers to would not require as much dredging as what is being proposed by the RNLI. In its letter however the LEYC stated that ldquowe are supporters of the RNLI and any objection we have is only to the proposed siting of the boathouse and should not be interpreted as any fallout with the local volunteers who we respect and support.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The UFU has argued that a ‘no-deal’ Brexit would have a devastating impact on farmers in Northern Ireland.“This has been supported by a number of independent reports from AFBI, LMC, and more. ‘No deal’ has been considered extensively within the UFU’s internal committee structure and has consistently been found to be the worst of all possible options.“The position was confirmed again at our executive meeting in October.”Mr Ferguson said the proposed transition period, which includes the whole of the UK, will allow time to negotiate a UK-wide free trade agreement with the EU.He added: “The specic protocol that relates to NI and ROI focuses on standards but would still allow Northern Ireland to implement our own domestic agricultural policy and would only kick in as a last resort.

North Antrim MLA Jim Allister said its position is “madness”, whilst prominent unionist farmer David Campbell expanded on criticism he heaped upon the union at the weekend, dubbing its leadership “out of touch”.Meanwhile, another Co Antrim farmer declared simply the union has “lost the plot”.It all comes after UFU chief executive Wesley Aston told the Nolan Show on Friday: “We want to make sure we avoid a no-deal situation... We’d support the deal going through and against that background we would ask the DUP to consider voting for this deal.”Whilst a UFU spokeswoman said the union did not tell members how to vote in the original referendum, Mr Aston, back in March , told Parliament’s Northern Ireland Affairs Committee that “in the absence of any compelling reason for agriculture to leave the European Union, we feel that it is better for the minute, given the circumstances and the knowledge we have, to stay. That is the official position”.Among the fears voiced by unionists over the deal which the Prime Minister now backs are that,no wider agreement is reached by the end of the transition period, a backstop scenario would kick in which will keep Northern Ireland under certain EU single market rules concerning agriculture and more – something which will not apply to GB.Mr Allister said: “How the UFU in particular could join this chorus of embracing the break-up of the UK single market – on which they depend – is beyond rationalisation. “Urging MPs to vote for an Irish Sea regulatory border is madness, as well as accepting NI as part of the EU’s custom territory ... rushing to impede GB NI trade is as dangerous as it is absurd.”On Friday night, David Campbell, a former chairman of the UUP who was a negotiator at the time of the Belfast Agreement , had declared himself “shocked” at the UFU’s stance.And now he has gone further, setting out his reasons.When it comes to the rank-and-file reaction among farmers to the UFU leadership position, the -year-old . said: “I think there’s a considerable annoyance. I’m not sure how many of our members will sit down and study the agreement – I’d urge them to do so.“I’ve yet to come across one farmer who tells me he supports this agreement.“I just think unfortunately it’s typical of how the farming union does business, and that needs to change.”Facebook to fund  trainee local journalists in £.M scheme Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"He stressed that on most matters the union works well for members, and that it is run by “honourable people”.However, on this issue it has suffered a “crisis of judgment”.“I just feel on this occasion they’re misguided and out of touch,” he added.His objections to the prime minister’s agreement with the EU are first and foremost constitutional ones as a unionist he said, dubbing the deal “the biggest challenge we’ve faced since the whole negotiations around the Belfast Agreement  years ago”.He asked what would happen– for example – in  or  years time there was a resumption of republican violence in the border areas, and “we are unable to put in a hard border because the EU would have to permit that”.But he has practical farming fears too.Say, for example, he wanted to sell milk to a processor in Scotland, but the backstop means there is now a regulatory border inthe Irish Sea.He wondered“it could well be the case the processor in Great Britain isn’t able to accept our raw material”.He was not alone in criticising the actions of the union.One Co Antrim dairy farmer with around  animals, whose name the News Letter is withholding, said “I think the farmers’ union has lost the plot.”His own view is the UK should simply plump for a ‘no-deal’ situation, and get out now.He said: “They are getting involved in politics by saying they support that deal.“They are playing politics there. I’m saying no. From what I’ve seen of the deal – I’ve just read what was in the newspapers – I think it’s a bad deal.“David Davis, the Brexit secretary, resigned, and Dominic Raab resigned. They didn’t come up the Lagan ina bubble. They think it’s not a good deal. I’d support them.”As he spoke to the News Letter, he said he had just been eating wheaten bread, and had been reading the ingredients on the back.The wheaten bread was made using buttermilk produced by a Northern Irish firm, which buys its cream in from England.“Nowthere’s going to be a red line down the Irish Sea, [they] won’t be able to buy their cream out of England it probably won’t be allowed in because it won’t have been made to the right standards.”The DUP’s Diane Dodds had also hit out at the pro-deal stance taken by the UFU and much of the business community on Friday.The UFU has responded to the criticism, saying, with president Ivor Ferguson saying: “As with any large industry, there are wide ranging views within our membership. During the EU referendum, the UFU didn’t take an official position but following the result we got down to the business trying to secure the best Brexit deal for agriculture. As always, our focus is securing the best future possible for our family-run farms in Northern Ireland.“We are a democratic organisation and we represent around , family farms.“It is unrealistic to expect that all our members will agree  per cent on everything, all of the time. The UFU has argued that a ‘no deal’ Brexit would have a devastating impact on farmers in Northern Ireland. This has been supported by a number of independent reports from AFBI, LMC, and more.“‘No deal’ has been considered extensively within the UFU’s internal committee structure and has consistently been found to be the worst of all possible options. The position was confirmed again at our Executive meeting in October.“Also, we have always called for a solution that allowed NI farmers unfettered access to the GB market, while at the same time allowing the long-standing trading relationship between NI and ROI to continue.“Unpicking the UK’s + year relationship with the EU was always going to be a challenge. Both the UK and EU have had to make compromises.“While the withdrawal agreement is not perfect and we need clarication on some areas, the majority of farmers want to see the process move on. A UK-wide Free Trade Agreement with the EU is the goal. The transition period, which includes the whole of the UK, will allow time to negotiate this deal. The specic protocol that relates to NI and ROI focuses on standards but would still allow NI to implement our own domestic agricultural policy and would only kick in as a last resort.“However, the aim is to never get to that point.“Without a withdrawal agreement, this process can’t even begin and on the th March we crash out of the EU with no deal. This puts family-run farm businesses at risk. Our biggest concerns are not only that additional tarfs and checks would be introduced on our exports but also that the UK market could be flooded with cheaper, lower-standard food from beyond the EU-.”try catch     .               ..

I think they’re wrong to. I think she is a very steely, determined person.“I think she has got a good deal for Britain, for the United Kingdom as a whole I should say, and she has followed through also on her commitments to Ireland and the EU.”The Tanaiste made his comments following a meeting with EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier and Minister of State for European Affairs Helen McEntee.They were in Brussels on Monday to discuss the draft agreement ahead of the special summit of European leaders on Sunday.The indications are that Mrs May will fail to get the draft deal through the House of Commons next month.Mr Barnier described the deal as “fair and balanced”, saying: “It takes into account the UK positions. In particular, we have found a compromise to avoid a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.Both parties want to avoid using the backstop, Mr Barnier said.Mrs May is expected to travel to Brussels this week to meet European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker.In a tweet, Mr Coveney said there had been “strong consensus” across the  EU member states that the withdrawal agreement represented a “balance and fair compromise” between UK and EU interests.“Negotiators now trying to finalise a positive political declaration on future relationship,” he wrote.Earlier on Monday Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said the sooner the deal was done, the sooner negotiators could move forward and start discussing the future arrangement.Man who fell from Belfast ‘party bike’ and later died is named Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Speaking in Dublin Mr Varadkar said: “The intention would be extending the transition period, and activating the backstop would never be necessary and won’t be necessarywe can successfully negotiate a future relationship, so the sooner we can have this deal sealed, and the sooner we can get on to talking about that future relationship the better I think.”While in Brussels, Mr Coveney attended a meeting of EU Foreign Affairs Ministers to discuss Iran, Yemen, Central Asia and Ukraine, as well as security and defence.He said ministers had an exchange of views on Iran and had reaffirmed support for the Iran nuclear deal.The EU’s relations with Central Asia were discussed ahead of an EU-Central Asia ministerial meeting which is scheduled to take place on November .Mr Coveney said: “This is a region of growing importance and we discussed how the EU can take forward our partnership with Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.”The ministers also had an exchange on Bosnia and Herzegovina following recent elections there.Mr Coveney said Ireland was “strongly supportive” of the perspective of EU membership being an agent for the promotion of reform and stability in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the wider Balkan region.He added that the “appalling situation” in Yemen was also discussed and he called on all parties to the conflict to respect international human rights and humanitarian law.try catch     .               ..

The European Union’s focus on the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic has only ever been a negotiating tactic to secure its own aims in the negotiations.“The comments also further underscore how the inclusion of a border down the Irish Sea within the current Withdrawal Agreement is not only unacceptable, but is also unnecessary.“The Withdrawal Agreement was based on the  choice that an internal UK border was the only way to prevent a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.”Ms Foster and party colleagues are angry at the deal’s proposed ‘backstop’ - the trading system that would operate on the island in the absence of a broader UK EU deal - claiming the proposal for Northern Ireland to adhere to a dferent regulatory framework than Great Britain would undermine the United Kingdom.While Mr Varadkar said on Sunday he was not contemplating a hard border in the event of a crash Brexit, on Friday he said one would be “very dficult to avoid” in a no-deal scenario.“In a no-deal scenario it would be very dficult to avoid a hard border because of the obvious fact that, as Ireland remaining part of the European Union, we would no doubt be asked to implement European law,” he said.“Also the United Kingdom having left the European Union would seek to join the World Trade Organisation.“They would have to implement WTO rules so those hard Brexiteers who say that somehow just through political will you can avoid a hard border that doesn’t make sense.”He added: “The only way we can avoid a hard border is by an agreement.”In her latest statement on the controversial backstop issue, Ms Foster said: “The agreement that has been put on the table is clearly not a good deal and no-one should be forced into accepting another  choice.Man who fell from Belfast ‘party bike’ and later died is named Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“This really bad deal would lock us into the EU with no way out.

Brexit, of course. I’ve had my fill. Editorial ImageMy brain is tired trying to understand all its nuances. But worse than that, it is distracting me from what is the most important time of the year – Christmas. I have always loved the run-down to Christmas. It’s a time when we begin to think of others, and shop for the loved ones around us. But Brexit has come between me and the festive season making me feel ill towards anyone raising the subject when all I want to be bothered about is what size the turkey should be this year. Politicians  Do we really care tuppence for them just now  Haven’t we seen and heard enough of them spitting venom over the ‘disaster’ ahead  Surely Brexit cannot be more important than the children in Yemen, dying daily in a ghastly war which shows no sign of abating, a war which like the one in Syria could go on for years  In the middle of the Christmas preparations we are faced with many such tragedies. But Brexit is dferent. It’s a war of bickering, a war destined to open up all our political weaknesses, a war which for the Irish and Northern Irish in particular is alarming in its bitterness and the need to settle old scores.Brexit is a drawn out battle we could have done without and I for one never imagined it would put a ‘damper’ on Christmas, a time of year when the charitable gene in us is thinking of other things and people. But politicians have hard hearts. Do they know it’s Christmas and do they care At this time each year we have Children in Need, which the UK as a whole continues to generously support. Going back much further to the s we had Band Aid, an event which really did capture the imagination thanks to the efforts of a pop star Bob Geldof Ben Lowry: Theresa May has ruthlessly but reluctantly felt she had to jettison unionism in Northern IrelandThe defeat of the EU withdrawal deal is the first imperative Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Yet, despite all our efforts children in many parts of the world continue to endure war and famine and what more can we do about it Regularly we put our hands in our purses in response to television and newspaper appeals but still it doesn’t appear to make much of a dference.Charities target us especially in the run-down to Christmas and I have no problem with that. In fact giving to charity is part of Christmas. Appeals are what we expect at this time of the year and people give generously. Our charity shops are full of beautul festive cards and gts to buy and many of us contribute in this way.But Brexit is getting in the way of all the festive spirit which can do so much good for those who need help. The politics of it all has me sapped, fed up, angry and vowing, at one stage, never to vote for a politician ever again. Did we get our fingers bitten back in the s when we signed up for the Common Market  Did we ever think when we signed then that we would end up being bossed around by a cabal of politicians speaking with foreign accents who dare us to withdraw from the ghastly behemoth they created due to our own politicians not reading the fine print or having the brains to see the problems that might arise in our attempt to extricate ourselves.Here I am in the midst of wondering what height my Christmas tree should be, distracted by the possibility that Sinn Fein could well be celebrating that their wildest dream of a united Ireland may be that bit closer come December. My mind is also distracted by the worry that the DUP, their reputation as kingmakers long gone, will be outwitted by the English politicians who really don’t give a toss about us and would gladly see us unhooked and driven into the Irish sea leaving them to become little England again.Soon I will dispatch Himself into the roof space to unearth the Christmas decorations an event I usually celebrate with a glass of my home made sloe gin. But Brexit is well and truly knocking the Christmas spirit out of me. try catch     .               ..

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community.

Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Plans have now been submitted to construct the homes close to Sprucefield, outside Lisburn. It would also involve a new link road on the M motorway. An initial pre-application notice was issued for the scheme last year, but now the developer behind the scheme – Neptune Carleton – has submitted an outline planning application for the ambitious project. If the plans, which could include , homes on the large site at Blaris, get the go-ahead, it would be one of the largest residential property developments to be built in Northern Ireland in recent years. Elsewhere, this week a major £m housing development in Larne was awarded outline planning permission. Nuport Developments has been given the early go-ahead for  houses on the -acre site at Ballyboley in the town.

Since Wednesday evening, several cabinet members have resigned, opposed to what they see is a softening of Theresa May’s position on leaving the EU. Essentially, for Northern Ireland’s business community in particular, it would remain part of the same customs territory as the rest of the UK and the entire area would be subject to \"level playing field\" commitments requiring the UK to follow EU rules in areas like animal welfare, environmental and workplace protections. Northern Ireland would be in a deeper customs relationship with the EU than where in the UK, and more closely tied to EU market rules. But what do Northern Ireland business groups think   Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium “While it will take some time to go through the  plus pages of the agreement, on the face of it this document provides some reassurance to our industry and the NI consumer. “It provides solutions to customs, tarfs, an innovative solution on VAT, support for the Peace Process and a possible longer transition period. There certainly is some work to be done by both the Westminster Government and  the EU on the checks and administration for goods coming in to Northern Ireland from GB. “That will need to be light touch and be mitigated in further agreements, hopefully to an absolute bare minimum. However this agreement must pass through Parliament. We have always said the backstop is better than no deal.”   Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI director-general “After  months of debate, this agreement by Cabinet is progress. It moves the UK one step away from the nightmare precipice of no deal and the harm it would cause to communities across the country. Securing a transition period has long been firms’ top priority and every day that passes without one means lost investment and jobs, hitting the most vulnerable hardest. “Time is now up. This deal is a compromise, including for business, but it offers that essential transitional period as a step back from the clf-edge. \"More clarity on the final relationship is needed, and uncertainty remains high, but this is an important step forward. “Transition and the backstop are not the intended permanent solutions for either side, but should pave the way for more work on the future deal. This must secure frictionless trade, ambitious access for our world-beating services, and a say over future rules. “The UK has had many months of discussion and ision. A long journey still lies ahead but now is the time for decisions. And the first decision is to avoid no deal.”  Retail NI chief executive, Glyn Roberts and Hospitality Ulster, Colin Neill  “This is a complex and detailed document which needs considerable analysis and further clarication from the UK Government. “We will be consulting our respective memberships on this document and we will set out in greater detail our views when we have completed this process. “Both our organisations have always sought a deal that ensures no delays in the supply chain, which promotes bridges rather than borders and above all , ensures that Northern Ireland businesses have full and free access to the EU and UK single markets. “Retail and Hospitality are two of Northern Ireland’s leading sectors of industry and our voice needs to be heard as this draft deal moves toward a vote in the House of Commons”  Michael Hall, managing partner, EY Northern Ireland “Business will clearly welcome last night’s announcement in that there is now better clarity on the terms of a deal however many will also be reluctant to put contingency plans on hold until there is a stronger signal on whether this will hold politically in the UK and Europe. “The backstop guarantee is a positive development for NI firms operating on an all-island basis, not least the restatement that both sides intend to work towards a free trade agreement longer term, which should not be overlooked. “The scale of political uncertainty and the volatility which this creates can be seen in the signicant currency fluctuations we have witnessed in the past  hours. Firms should not take this lightly and as such, factor these continued unknowns into their scenario planning. “On the positive side, Northern Ireland businesses have continued to expand and employ more people in the period since the Brexit referendum, which we remain hopeful they will continue to do as we look towards a further period of uncertainty. “By focusing on business fundamentals and contingency planning, firms will arm themselves so that they are ready to act when the road ahead becomes clearer.”  FSB NI policy chairman, Tina McKenzie “Businesses have been calling for months for agreement to be reached between the UK and EU negotiators, so it can only be welcome that a text has been agreed and approved by the Cabinet. “We are acutely aware of the political machinations which are ongoing, however it must be remembered that without an agreed withdrawal agreement, the UK will crash out in March , without a transition period, nor agreement on citizens’ rights, nor any plan to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. “While the exact nature of the backstop is being robustly debated, it must be remembered that the backstop will only take effectthe future relationship fails to deliver a frictionless border, after December . “We believe that the Withdrawal Agreement is a signicant step back from the clf edge which would result in a chaotic no deal Brexit that would be deeply damaging and dangerous for our small firms. “We would encourage all political actors to keep this in mind as we move forward.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/shore_1.jpg","title":"alternative london the place to be seen in the city","story":"Posted on Monday  November  by Ulster Business From London’s thriving bohemian hub and street art capital to a food, drink and nightle must-visit... John Mulgrew explores Shoreditch and beyond Once just the purview of the artistic and trendsetting, Shoreditch has fast become a location worthy of a trip in itself when visiting London.Nestled in the East End of the city, Shoreditch offers up a buzzing cultural environment, lots of independent places to eat and drink, and boasts one of the city’s best markets. Now, those in the north west always feel a little hard done by when it comes to connectivity outside Northern Ireland.In this case though, Flybmi now connects City of Derry Airport regularly with London Stansted. From there, it’s a regular train into Liverpool Street station, and then onwards using the tube or bus across the city.Andyou’re visiting Shoreditch, it’s hard to miss Boxpark. Sitting close to the tube station, it’s an array of black-clad shipping containers, with a host of retailers and places to eat. A bite at posh chip shop Poptata helps fuel the day.Journalists often prefer the freedom to explore a city at their own pace – picking up things along the way, without being ferried from place-to-place. But a food-focused tour from Alternative London brought out areas that might have otherwise been missed.Shoreditch is famous for the sheer volume of graffiti and art strewn around the area, but getting an insider’s view on the changes taking place in the area – including paid-for advertising now adorning some of the spaces reserved for artists from the area, or a Banksy – really helps take in as much as possible.Christiaan Nagel’s mushrooms, which can be found in several roof-top locations, led us to teashop T, taking in a salt-beef bagel at Beigel Bake on Brick Lane, followed by the modern, family-run self-styled home-style Indian restaurant, Gunpowder. The aloo chaat is a signature, with punch, depth and zing, while an almost unavoidable venison and vermicelli ‘doughnut’ is worth the visit alone.A brief half in the grade II listed Ten Bells, which has links to Jack the Ripper, was followed by a familiar trip to Old Spitalfields Market. It has a dense, tight offering of top-end food stalls, from Asian steamed buns at Yum Bun, to Portuguese custard tarts and fruit tea at Yi Fang.An unmissable food destination sits across from the market. St John Bread and Wine is one of Fergus Henderson’s London outlets. It’s a casual, laid back and sparse affair, which allows you to same some of the best British cooking available. You can stop by for a very reasonably priced, and one of the restaurant’s signature dishes, such as Welsh Rarebit, devilled kidneys on toast or, my choice on this visit, blood cake and egg. Think richer, chunkier black pudding, crispened in a pan with a rich-orange hued yolk. There are plenty of spots to socialise in and around Shoreditch, with some of London’s better beer bars included. The Craft Beer Co has a location on Old Street, while there’s a Brewdog and the Draft House, hidden in the Bower development.Arriving back to the hotel in the evening, don’t expect dull or leless environment at the Hoxton. The downstairs is thriving during the day, with the usual spectrum of aluminium-clad Apple Macs, but at night, especially at the weekend, it’s very much a nightspot in the area.Butyou’re after a decent night’s sleep, there’s very little sound making its way to the bedrooms from the ground-floor buzz.Leaving the hip surroundings of Shoreditch, and heading to the rather more touristy affair of Leicester Square, the Hotel Indigo is offers a grand view of the London skyline.The new rooftop bar is a superb vantage point to overlook the square, and pick out the city’s most famous structures. Then there’s the National Portrait Gallery – which sits just a short distance away from the Hotel Indigo.During the trip there was a Michael Jackson ‘On the Wall’ exhibition – one for Jackson fans, certainly – but the gallery itself, which is free, is worth a visit for everyone . It also hosts a ‘Friday Lates’ event – opening into the night, and with a small pop-up bar for visitors.Not far away, the Japan Centre offers up a myriad of everything the country has to offer in regards to food and drink in particular – from freshly made miso, to a ied and wide-selection of sake, it’s a stop worth making for anyone keen on trying to replicate the flavours they’ve had while visiting the country.Meanwhile, Shoryu Ramen – located very close to base camp at the Hoxton – offers some of the best casual noodles in the city. Starting off with cleanly flavoured salmon sashimi, followed by the garlic kick of the Dracula Tonkotsu – a heady allium-rich version of their -hour pork broth.For those in and around what is one of the city’s most tourist-heavy locations, Granaio is a reasonably recent addition.It’s a fairly familiar format – Italian classics and a wide-ranging menu, which will keep the majority of visitors content, at a reasonable price, considering the location. A beef tartare was solid, and a ribeye cooked correctly on the inside, despite a lack of charring on the outside.The theatre obviously plays a large part in the attraction to London, but the Immersive Gatsy experience turns a chunk of a Long Lane building into an interactive re-telling of F Scott Fitzgerald’s the Great Gatsby. It’s dferent, but impressively choreographed, and something alternative to spending a huge wad of cash on a West End show.A crisp sunny day before heading back on the train to Stansted offered a chance to try Hawksmoor. The steak restaurant now has nine locations in the UK, and focuses on dry-aged beef and all that comes with it.A Sunday lunch of rich, pink rump of beef comes with a Yorkshire pudding, stunningly crunchy roasties and a roasted bulb of garlic, and shallot – leaving them soft and packed full of umami.

These aspirations are higher than predecessors. Harder to reach than MillennialsGen Z are incredibly tech savvy and have always lived in a world of interconnectivity. Most of Gen Z are connected for more than  hours a day. No wonder they are often referred to as the ‘always on’ generation. Unfortunately, gaining and keeping their attention is extremely challenging. Gen Z much prefer Snapchat and Instagram over Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter.

Here Emma Deighan scours some of the top NI venues to see how they are catering to the corporate Christmas Arguably the most anticipated social event in the work diary, the Christmas ‘do’ has evolved over the years.And many of Northern Ireland’s top hosts agree and have widened their offering in response.Event managers and venue owners say everything from the format of the Christmas party to its timing have changed to accommodate the demands of employees today. How, when and where we celebrate are top priorities.Take the evening do, for example. For many, that age-old three-course setup doesn’t cut the convenience factor, prompting my employers end the work day early to take advantage of lunch dates. It’s a favourable move that delivers on two fronts – it offers time-poor workers the relief of a shorter day but doesn’t infringe on family obligations.Owner of Bishop’s Gate Hotel in Derry and former president of the Northern Ireland Hotel’s Federation, Ciaran O’Neill agrees. “Christmas has changed over the last number of years for our industry with more businesses looking for lunches, as opposed to the traditional party nights of old,” he said. “We do still have ‘big nights’, but these tend to occur on Fridays and Saturdays.”Ciaran says he has also noted an increase in smaller party sizes over the years.“We are seeing less private large events and more small groups dining with us. Employees are arranging ‘get togethers’ with colleagues or teams that they work directly with.”Bishop’s Gate, which has become Derry’s hospitality jewel attracting the AA Hotel of the Year- accolade, among many other awards, pairs an historic setting with parties for Christmas.The Bullitt Hotel in Belfast is setting the scene for the experience-savvy hipster workforce – and this Christmas Bullitt’s ‘experiences’ reflect the discernment of its guests.General manager at Bullitt, Michael Sullivan has seen a spike in ‘experience’ events, upgrading the turkey feast to a cooler, more casual event.“We have had a number of enquiries for informal gatherings in our Good Room event space, with a festive lunch to follow. The Good Room is the perfect space to blur the lines between work and play for intimate company get togethers ahead of a more traditional Christmas do,” he said.“We’ve also had enquiries for private gin and whiskey tastings and can also organise a number of unique events and team-building activities for groups, from candle-making to chunky knitting workshops for a truly memorable Christmas party.”This December Bullitt has a range of packages to suit private and shared s – from sit-down meals in its restaurant Taylor and Clay to VIP packages in its Baltic Bar or secluded enclaves above in Babel – its rooftop bar. And its ‘Tipsy Tea’ is geared towards the day-time revellers. Prices range from £. to £. a head.“Bullitt has brought something new and exciting to the traditional Christmas party market, with a range of novel spaces set within cool, contemporary surroundings. We like to think that we’re helping to shake up the scene somewhat by offering something a little dferent,” Michael said.If you want to push the boat out with your corporate squad, Titanic Belfast is ready for boarding. Its play on Belfast’s shipbuilding heritage and the fateful Titanic is always a crowd pleaser. Laura Cowan, head of sales at Titanic Belfast said: “We host bespoke private Christmas party nights, which are tailored to our clients’ needs across all of the Titanic venues – Titanic Belfast , SS Nomadic and the Titanic Exhibition Centre. “These can range from private dining, iconic tailored experiences, drinks receptions and gala dinners. We also host our traditional Christmas party nights – featuring a Christmas cocktail reception on arrival followed by a delicious four course banquet and live entertainment.”For sheer luxury, the more refined office workers take to the Cathedral Quarter in Belfast to sample the Merchant’s opulent offering.And Clare Mullin, meetings and events manager there, said the hotel’s renowned afternoon teas are bucking the turkey dinner trend but are every bit as fancul. “Over the years we have seen an increased demand for Christmas parties and festive events that offer something a little dferent, memorable or exciting.
