The British Museum has museum long faced criticism over how it sourced its most prized possessions from former British colonies and beyondThey include a figure of an ancestor taken in 1891 from a shrine by the captain of HMS Royalist during an attempt to impose colonial authority on communities in Roviana, and later sold by him to the British Museum a \u0027bird net\u0027 float used to catch fish which was given to a missionary in 1903 who regarded it as a trophy in his campaign against the religion of the Islanders and a string of shell-money presented to HRH the Duke of Gloucester in 1978 during independence celebrations. The display is supplemented by archival and contemporary photography and has been created in consultation with Solomon Islanders who live in the UK.Treasures such as the British Museum\u0027s Elgin Marbles – taken from the Parthenon in Athens 200 years ago – have long been claimed by Greece, but more objects have now been drawn into the row. Last year a delegation from Chile demanded the return of a four-ton Easter Island statue held at the British Museum. Protesters have also called for the repatriation of indigenous artefacts to Australia.Over in France, Emmanuel Macron urged that thousands of French museum exhibits be sent back to Africa – prompting Labour Shadow Minister Diane Abbott to insist that the UK should do the same.         This drum, made by the Akan people, Ghana was taken to Virginia, USA, during the slave trade and came to the British Museum as part of its founding collection, bequeathed by Sir Hans Sloane          These shell-money beads, made in Malaita Island, are another of the artefacts featured in the Collecting histories exhibition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told a Greek newspaper that under a Labour government the Elgin Marbles would be returned to Athens, along with other treasures to their country of origin.  So far the British museum and other UK institutions have resisted repatriation campaigns citing legislation preventing them from breaking up collections and arguing that they can preserve items and present them to an international audience. Hartwig Fischer, Director of the British Museum, said: \u0027The British Museum has always actively researched its collection, and it continues to do so to better understand how we should present collecting histories for our visitors. \u0027The Asahi Shimbun Displays Collecting Histories: Solomon Islands allows us to test out ideas that will inform what we will do in the future.\u0027          This Pukara, showing important ancestral Dreaming traditions, was painted for sale in 2013 by senior Aboriginal men of the Spinifex people of the desert region of Western Australia The Solomon Islands have been inhabited for thousands of years. The first European to visit them was Spanish navigator Álvaro de Mendaña who arrived in 1568. The islands were then claimed by Britain as the British Solomon Islands Protectorate in the 1890s. During the 20th century, colonial government, plantation businesses and Christian missions occupied the island, before it got its independence in 1978 and joined the Commonwealth. Belinda Crerar, Project Manager for The Asahi Shimbun Displays at the British Museum, said: \u0027The Asahi Shimbun Displays in Room 3 the British Museum allows us to showcase important objects and research, create small displays of topical interest, and learn more about improving the display of objects across the Museum. \u0027Collecting Histories: Solomon Islands is an opportunity to find out more about what our visitors respond to, while also showcasing a selection of wonderful objects from a lesser-known part of the collection.\u0027         The biggest rows over the British Museum\u0027s colonial past (interior of museum pictured) involve the Elgin Marbles, taken from Athens, the Benin Bronzes from Nigeria and Rosetta Stone from Egypt  \u0027Stolen\u0027 treasures: The fought-over artefacts on display at the British Museum The British Museum has been subject to mass controversy over how it sourced some of its most treasured artefacts from foreign countries. There is a growing campaign by Left-wing activists for items of \u0027stolen loot\u0027 to be returned to their original homes – despite the fact that some of the countries do not want the relics back.Treasures such as the British Museum\u0027s Elgin Marbles – taken from the Parthenon in Athens 200 years ago – have long been claimed by Greece, but more objects have now been drawn into the row.The biggest debates involve the Elgin Marbles, taken from Athens, the Benin Bronzes from Nigeria and Rosetta Stone from Egypt.             The biggest row to have embroiled the British Museum involves the Elgin Marbles, taken from Athens 200 years ago Last year a delegation from Chile demanded the return of a four-ton Easter Island statue held at the British Museum.

Hundreds of bronzes – including this brass plaque of the king and attendants, above,– were taken from what is now Nigeria by a British expedition in 1897. They now live in the British Museum, which has caused mass controversy And in Nigeria, Iheanyi Onwuegbucha, the curator of the Lagos Centre for Contemporary Art, said: \u0027Nigeria is not ready to receive anything.

The 2016 Brexit vote unleashed political forces which would not only shake British politics but also cause the relationship between Mr Gove and Mr Johnson (pictured together the day after June 23) to fracture.          Mr Gove pledged to support Mr Johnson\u0027s bid for Downing Street in 2016 after David Cameron resigned but he changed his mind and launched his own doomed run         Mr Gove\u0027s decision in 2016 to launch his own bid prompted Mr Johnson (pictured on June 30, 2016) to sensationally scrap his own attempt just hours laterAllies of Mr Gove claimed at the time that Mr Johnson was \u0027chaotic\u0027 and he had been \u0027cavalier\u0027 in his approach to putting together his top team.But outriders for Mr Johnson claimed Mr Gove had been plotting all along to launch his own bid to be PM.The fallout from Mr Gove\u0027s decision immediately drew parallels with the dark days of 1990 when Mrs Thatcher was ousted from Number 10 by her own party.Mr Gove was reportedly spotted with his arm around Mr Johnson at an event the night before the alleged betrayal when he was believed to have told people the latter was the person to take over from Mr Cameron.But the next morning, just after 9am, he announced his own candidacy - apparently without telling Mr Johnson what he was doing.That prompted some Johnson-backers to abandon him and jump ship to Mr Gove as the Conservative Party began to rip itself apart.Just before noon Mr Johnson quit the race, stunning his supporters with the revelation as it came at what was supposed to be his launch event.Mr Gove even suggested in the maelstrom that followed that Mr Johnson did not believe \u0027heart and soul\u0027 in Brexit.The then justice secretary had repeatedly said he did not want to be PM and his apparent change of heart provoked widespread fury.         Supporters of Mr Johnson reacted with fury to Mr Gove\u0027s decision to try for the top job himself as he was accused of treacheryOne Tory MP said of Mr Gove that there was a \u0027very deep pit reserved in Hell for such as he\u0027.Meanwhile, Mr Johnson\u0027s father, Stanley, likened the political hit job to Shakespeare\u0027s portrayal of Brutus stabbing Julius Caesar.But Mr Gove rejected accusations of treachery and insisted his decision to stand had been driven by \u0027conviction, not ambition\u0027.\u0027I did almost everything I could not to be a candidate for the leadership of this party,\u0027 he said.However, within a week his 2016 campaign was dead.He was booted out of the contest in the second round of voting as he secured the support of just 46 MPs which was fewer than he got in the first round amid growing concern about the way he had declared his candidacy.Allies of Mr Johnson rejoiced over Mr Gove\u0027s downfall.One backer of the former mayor of London said: \u0027Gove offered the party and the country vaulting ambition, craven disloyalty and treachery. Today his arrogance was repaid in full - with failure and total humiliation.\u0027A new biography of Mr Gove by Owen Bennett, serialised in the Mail earlier this month, suggested the seeds of the rivalry had been planted when they were students together at Oxford.              The pair had met at Oxford University when a young Michael Gove (left) helped a young Boris Johnson in his bid to become union presidentIn his first year at the university, Mr Gove apparently became a \u0027stooge\u0027 of Mr Johnson\u0027s as the latter fought to become president of the Oxford Union.Mr Gove was apparently a willing member of the \u0027Boris cult\u0027 as he later described his first encounter with him: \u0027It was in the Union bar. He was a striking figure with sheepdog hair and penny loafers, standing in a distinctive pose with his hands in his trouser pockets and his head bent forward.\u0027Mr Johnson, born in 1964, had already been an Oxford for a number of years when Mr Gove, born in 1967, arrived.While Mr Johnson had the seniority at university the pair climbed to relative political parity in recent years as both took on high profile jobs.

It was held in the ancient city of Lijiang and followed pre-Communist traditions. His wife was held aloft in a sedan chair by members of Hunt\u0027s family while he marched alongside her.\u0027We went back to what a wedding would have been like pre-1949,\u0027 Hunt said, recalling how he had to undergo a series of tests before his family could carry away his bride.These included singing, performing 25 press-ups and finding his bride\u0027s shoes. \u0027I had to do three kowtows to the sun,\u0027 he added.                Unlike frontrunner Boris Johnson\u0027s (pictured) car-crash domestic life, Jeremy Hunt would use the stability of a settled home to boost his campaign, writes Richard KayLucia\u0027s impact has been visible in other ways. She ensured that a doll knitted for their four-year-old daughter by Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the British mother jailed in Iran, has been given pride of place on a mantelpiece among family knick-knacks in their grace-and-favour Foreign Office apartment.Despite his down-to-earth manner, Hunt\u0027s upbringing was one of privilege and convention.The son of a senior naval officer, Admiral Sir Nicholas Hunt, the young Jeremy was educated at £39,000-a-year Charterhouse School, where he was head boy.At Oxford, where he took a first in PPE, he was a contemporary of David Cameron.As his Cabinet rival Michael Gove was embroiled in cocaine-taking allegations, Hunt demurely acknowledged that he too had experience of drugs. His was a cannabis-infused smoothie while backpacking in India.After a post-Oxford spell teaching in Japan he made an unsuccessful attempt to sell marmalade there before setting up Hotcourses, an on-line educational publishing business which turned him into a multi-millionaire. He sold the company for £15million in 2017.It was through Hotcourses that he met Lucia, who was a student recruiter at Warwick University. They were married within a year by which time Hunt had already embarked on his political career.It was not all plain sailing. He survived a major storm when Culture Secretary over his links to Rupert Murdoch who was bidding for full control of BskyB. It emerged that Hunt, who had oversight of the bid, employed a special adviser who was in close contact with the media tycoon\u0027s team.But after nine years in the Cabinet, Hunt has rarely tripped up – though there was one infamous clanger when, during a trip to China in 2018, he described his wife as Japanese. It turned out that was the nationality of one of his previous girlfriends.Jeremy Hunt still has a mountain to climb, of course, but by securing enough votes to get on to the slate with Boris Johnson he has proved that in a brutal, polarised political world, decency and niceness – and perhaps that secret weapon – might still have a place. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/06/18/15/14937540-0-image-m-41_1560868850779.jpg","title":"Mastermind slammed amid claims new champion won WRONG answer","story":"Share this articleBBC under fire after furious viewers claim Mastermind champion won with incorrect answer – The Sun"},{"url":null,"title":"PETER OBORNE Tory leadership race civilised","story":"Share this article Mr Hunt is Foreign Secretary — he replaced Boris Johnson — and he has performed the role with more dignity.

Indeed, critics say he made her situation worse by ‘loose comments’ he made in Parliament. I expect the gloves to come off now.And Mr Hunt is entitled to argue that his diplomatic achievements make him much better qualified to be Brexit negotiator than Mr Johnson.I have no doubt that Theresa May, our soon to be ex-Prime Minster, would have cast her vote for Jeremy Hunt yesterday.But for many others — MPs and Tory Party members — of course Johnson, the insurgent candidate, is the one who can excite Conservative voters.

Pratchett’s last request to Gaiman before he died was that he adapt the novel they wrote together Gaiman wrote the screenplay and worked as showrunner on the BBCAmazon co-production, which the Radio Times called “a devilishly funny love letter to the book”.But Christians marshalled by the Return to Order campaign, an offshoot of the US Foundation for a Christian Civilisation, disagree. More than 20,000 supporters have signed a petition in which they say that Good Omens is “another step to make satanism appear normal, light and acceptable”, and “mocks God’s wisdom”. God, they complain, is “voiced by a woman” – Frances McDormand – the antichrist is a “normal kid” and, most importantly, “this type of video makes light of Truth, Error, Good and Evil, and destroys the barriers of horror that society still has for the devil”. They are calling on Netflix to cancel the show.Gaiman responded to the petition on Twitter, writing: “I love that they are going to write to Netflix to try and get #GoodOmens cancelled. Says it all really. This is so beautiful ... Promise me you won’t tell them?”The publisher and science fiction critic Cheryl Morgan tweeted: “Miraculously God has already done it. Don’t tell them She put it on Amazon instead.”Return to Order is based on the writings of the author John Horvat II. It “calls upon Americans to put principles into actions by working toward what is called an organic Christian society”.

This is the answer to the question of what contemporary fiction can do, and the reason I laugh whenever people say (as a character declares ironically in Travellers) that the novel is dead.Originally from Nigeria, Habila lives and teaches in the US. Back in the academic year of 2013-2014, though, he was in Berlin on a fellowship, and it is in this city that Travellers begins. The novel is ided into six sections. In One Year in Berlin, a nameless Nigerian academic, the principal narrator, falls in with protesters – who are “protesting everything” – and in particular with Mark from Malawi, who turns out to have had a previous identity he is now “out-of-status” and therefore deportable. He also meets a Libyan doctor, Manu, now working as a bouncer, who lost his wife and child in a boat that sank at sea. Each Sunday, Manu looks for them at Checkpoint Charlie – the title of section two. Portia, a young Zambian student, is the daughter of a dissident poet in exile in London. She sets off to Basel (the title of section three) with the narrator to interview the woman who married and then killed her brother.In The Interpreters, Karim tells the narrator the story of his flight through Yemen, Syria and Turkey and his year in a Bulgarian jail trying to protect his sons. In The Sea, a woman who has lost her memory languishes in southern Italy and marries again – only to remember the husband she already has. When the narrator comes to London with Portia, they chance upon Juma, an asylum seeker hiding from immigration officials in a neighbouring flat. His whereabouts have recently been made public and now there are two sets of protesters outside – those trying to prevent his arrest and those demanding it. Juma himself is fasting, also out of protest this is the sixth story, Hunger.Travellers is also replete with literary references that twist and gleam through the narrative, adding light and riches and setting off unexpected resonances. There is Flaubert’s image of the “river of shit relentlessly washing away at the foundations of every ivory tower ever built”, and Dostoevsky on love Milton’s drowned Lycidas, Matthew Arnold and John Donne TS Eliot’s The Waste Land and The Leopard by Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa. Shakespeare is everywhere.As Habila reinterprets Europe, so too with European literature you read it, experience it, feel it anew. Arnold’s “Dover Beach”, for example, is invoked from the perspective of a refugee in the Jungle at Calais: looking at the French shore, Juma’s friend comments that “Arnold says something about the ‘eternal note of sadness’”. And Juma replies: “I know what that means.”And this is the novel’s greatest triumph – to conjure in the reader the seemingly irreconcilable feelings of both intense revivification and displacement. By the end, you feel as though you, too, are seeing what Europe means afresh: its racism, its confusion, its attraction, its incoherence, its safeties. But you are also full of stories of African conflict, dispossession and human suffering. Again and again, Habila asks the deepest questions about the relationship of Europe to Africa and Africa to Europe. And with great skill, he makes the unfamiliar familiar and vice versa.

Can linguistics explain the slips?Linguistics experts have been picking over a particularly juicy problem for the last few weeks: why do presenters from James Naughtie to Nicky Campbell keep replacing the first letter of Jeremy Hunt’s surname with a C?When Victoria Derbyshire became the latest of many broadcasters to use a derogatory term for female genitalia to refer to the Conservative leadership hopeful – there’s even a Viz cartoon about it – experts at the University of Pennysylvania’s Language Log started asking why. “I wonder if the leading K sound is because they expect to say Corbyn then change to Hunt too late,” pondered one. Another wrote: “It seems to me that the similarity between a ‘h’ and a ‘k’ sound (at least when it’s a strongly pronounced ‘h’) is part of the picture.”Sam Steddy, a linguistics lecturer at Queen Mary University of London, believes there are a few factors leading to the constant slips of the tongue. First, there’s the spoonerism dating back to the current foreign secretary’s former cabinet role. Or, as Naughtie said on the Today programme in 2010: “First up after the news I’m going to be talking to Jeremy Cunt – Hunt, the culture secretary.”“There are particular circumstances which make that spoonerism so predictable,” says Steddy. “It’s a really good rhyme. The vowels are all the same, particularly in hunt and culture secretary and the expletive. The ‘u’s are all virtually the same, there’s only one consonant and the rhymes of the syllables are identical. They’re all really alike – and the more alike things are, the easier they are to get mixed up.”Adding to this is that the scansion of “Jeremy Hunt, the culture secretary” falls on both Hunt and culture. “When we make sentences we don’t tend to string nouns together, at least not in that number, and that can do funny things with stress,” says Steddy. “If you’ve got a name like Jeremy Hunt, there’s an identifiable stressed syllable in Hunt and then culture, so they’re both the most emphasised syllable. Probably by virtue of that, the ‘h’ and the ‘c’ are more liable to being swapped around.”Then there is the fairly similar tongue movement required to make the two sounds. “You’ve got to get your tongue a little further back in the mouth to make the ‘h’, but the ‘c’ is created at the back of the mouth cavity so the similarity there could well lend itself to confusion,” says Steddy. “Maybe he should have insisted people describe him as state secretary for culture.”But even this might not have solved the issue: presenters might be getting their Jeremies muddled up at the last minute and introducing him as Corbyn. Or, as Steddy says: “There’s also people being afraid of making exactly this mistake” – Andrew Marr made the same slip-up as Naughtie just a week later. “There had been some outcry and he was trying really hard not to do it – and then did.”For anyone clutching their pearls over broadcasters dropping the C-bomb, even Hunt has become accustomed to it, telling the  that it wasn’t always an accident. “I had this when I was at school. Personally I think people should just grow up and get over the fact that my last name rhymes with a rather unpleasant word,” he said.Could the presenters’ views of Hunt’s achievements in politics have anything to do with it? “Well, he’s not popular is he. He’s never been popular,” says Steddy. “That’s obviously a contributing factor, too.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83069aa743c588d34226f197e93b648dd38397eb/0_333_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=91eb80d3bbc8c1996ac164bf5bb17c47","title":"beet this sainsburys opens uks first meat free butcher","story":"Pop-up store offers soya and wheat steaks, jackfruit burgers and ‘shroomdogs’“That mince ain’t doing it for me,” says an unconvinced Jane Taylor, peering in the butcher shop window at a pile of pink string that purports to have emerged from a meat grinder. “It looks like a plastic kids’ toy.”But only soybeans, peas and carrots – and some beetroot for the pink colouring – have perished to make this mince, because this pop-up shop in east London is a meat-free butcher. The store – kitted out like a traditional butcher with strings of (veggie) sausages hanging in the window – is a three day-long initiative by the supermarket giant Sainsbury’s to show vegan food has moved on from worthy plates of lentils and brown rice.Despite the soaring popularity of “flexitarian” diets – where a largely vegetable-based diet is supplemented occasionally with meat – and the growing trend for consuming meat alternatives and plant-based eating, a poll of 2,000 consumers commissioned by Sainsbury’s found more than half of Britons have never tried a plant-based alternative to meat.The survey also revealed that a fifth of those who considered themselves to be meat eaters regarded plant-based foods as “rabbit food”.But what is billed as the UK’s first ever meat-free butchers aims to change that view. The window is filled with slabs of steak (albeit made from soya and wheat protein), jackfruit quarter pounders and chorizo-style “shroomdogs” without the chorizo. Inside, behind the counter, Anthony Maynard, the meat-free butcher, is ready to coax shoppers to try “sweet and smoky” BBQ pulled jackfruit as opposed to pork and Moroccan “vegbabs”.Wrong-footed shoppers looking for the real thing will be left disappointed but Maynard is unapologetic: “I have got sausages – they just haven’t got any meat in them.”This year also saw Greggs launch a vegan sausage roll that was so popular the high street baker has said its annual profits will now be higher than expected. Earlier this week Tesco, the UK’s biggest retailer, also announced a major push into the market with a new ready meals brand – Plant Chef - that would result in a tenfold increase in its vegan range to up to 300 different items.James Hamilton, a Sainsbury’s buyer tasked with developing the supermarket’s meat-free product range, said selling plant-based versions of traditional meal time favourites like burgers, sausages and mince helped remove some of the mystique around cooking with exotic ingredients like jackfruit and tofu.“Whilst we’re seeing a huge climb in sales of our plant-based foods, we know from conversations with customers that there is a sense of trepidation about cooking with them,” he said. “It’s about familiarity. People see tofu and are not sure what to with it but if you see veggie mince it is is simple to communicate what to do with it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/96bcc0bf1736c85bf940d8a93c53da7692913af4/0_115_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d64ca6ae6b456788d0c395f6cdc33ef3","title":"zero carbon energy overtakes fossil fuels as the uks largest electricity source","story":"National Grid is able to confidently predict the 2019 record just six months into the yearZero-carbon energy sources are poised to overtake fossil fuels as the UK’s largest electricity source over a full calendar year.This year will be the first that fossil fuels make up less than half of the electricity generated, according to National Grid, following a dramatic decline in coal-fired power and rising renewable energy.Instead, UK homes and businesses will rely more on clean electricity generated by wind farms, solar panels, hydro power and nuclear power reactors.The “landmark tipping point” is an “historic achievement” in the UK’s journey towards becoming a net-zero carbon economy by 2050, said National Grid.John Pettigrew, the UK power system operator’s chief executive, said: “The incredible progress that Britain has made in the past 10 years means we can now say 2019 will be the year zero-carbon power beats fossil fuel-fired generation for the first time.”“We wouldn’t have said it if we weren’t confident that this will be the year.”National Grid is able to confidently predict the 2019 record only six months into the year following the UK’s greenest ever winter, and the huge number of coal-free days recorded since then.The UK reached a record stretch of consecutive 18 coal-free days earlier this year, which ended on 4 June.The electricity system reached a second record this week after racking up 1,838 coal-free hours for this year, breaking a record set across the whole of 2018 in a little over six months.The coal-free days have effectively prevented 5m tonnes of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere, or the equivalent of over 12bn miles driven in a car.Chris Skidmore MP, the interim energy minister, said coal is “fast becoming the fossil of our energy system and it will soon be consigned to the history books”.He added: “We’ve set in stone our commitment to end our contribution to climate change entirely by 2050 and this is yet another step on the path to becoming a net zero emissions economy.”By the end of the winter the UK will be left with only five remaining coal fired power plants, after SSE said last week it plans to shut its Fiddler’s Ferry plant near Warrington, Cheshire, next March. SSE revealed the closure after EDF Energy said it would shut its Cottam coal plant in September.The government plans to phase out all coal-fired power generation by 2025.National Grid is spending around £1.3bn a year to adapt the grid to run on renewable energy, and believes that it will be ready to manage a completely zero-carbon electricity grid within six years.“Do I expect that this will be a reality? No,” Pettigrew said. “But we won’t be a constraint in a low carbon world. We will be prepared to play our role.”Doug Parr, Greenpeace UK’s chief scientist, said the “watershed moment” is a sign that the UK is “broadly heading in the right direction”. “The question is, are we moving fast enough?” he said.Research undertaken by National Grid alongside its record forecast has found that “climate anxiety” is rising because people believe there is a lack of urgency in tackling the climate crisis.Nearly seven out of 10 people surveyed by National Grid are concerned about climate change and believe it is not being addressed urgently enough.More than a third of young people said their concerns about climate change would drive them to join a protest. Almost a fifth of 18- to 24-year-olds said they are prepared to skip school or work to do this, possibly inspired by student activist Greta Thurnberg who visited the UK earlier this summer.“As the climate emergency hits home right across the globe from Greenland’s melting ice to India’s scorching heatwave, the clock is ticking on our chances to avoid climate breakdown and public anxiety rightly remains high about the speed of change,” Parr said.“This is no time for ministers to pat themselves on the back and uncork the bubbly,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/160992abc2c29667573e6eabc515e7317f7b8a5a/0_0_7952_4771/master/7952.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2e35ea6117b64245f94227a09f130877","title":"from the classroom to the bar the rise of unconventional learning venues","story":"As adult education budgets are slashed, traditional courses and learning routes are becoming a thing of the past. Classes held in less formal settings – where people can learn and unwind – are on the riseWhen the seven McAvoy brothers set up the Seven Bro7hers Brewery in Salford Quays, they were determined to put the Manchester community at the heart of their operation. Five years later, the family business has a bar, the Beerhouse, in Ancoats, as well as the tap room attached to the brewery, with both venues hosting a range of classes – from crochet to beer yoga – on nights throughout the month.Alison Watson is part of the extended family and runs the marketing and events for Seven Bro7hers. She says: “We always intended to put the community at the centre of what we do. It might be painting classes, or our women’s institute evenings, where they teach crafts such as knitting, or educational evenings about beer-making – all of them have made us a community hub.”Evening classes have started to appear in unconventional venues just as traditional adult learning has gone through a tough period. Over the past decade, austerity slashed adult education budgets, with the Association of Colleges warning that adult education “will disappear by 2020” if the sector continues to be starved of funding. But, at the same time, booming interest in arts and crafts has seen more people looking to be taught skills in less formal settings.Lessons are popping up in cafes, pubs, bars and restaurants. Online portals such as Obby and the Indytute advertise classes in calligraphy, embroidery, origami and ukulele-playing, as well as more familiar night courses in languages, technology and business. Many of these classes are held in venues more typically thought of as places to buy a cappuccino or a glass of wine than learn new skills.As education moves out of the classroom and into the bar, the benefits to learners, the businesses that host them and the community at large can be considerable. For the venues, there is the obvious advantage of increased custom at times when trade might otherwise be slow. “Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday nights are good days to schedule things,” Watson says. “People don’t want a heavy night of drinking, but they’re happy to come out and try something new while they have a pint. Chances are, they may order some food while they’re here.”“For independent businesses, such as the Seven Bro7hers, having access to data is vital. By using iZettle, they can see their data in real time – including total sales and peak sales times – so that they can make smarter business decisions and schedule things such as workshops and events accordingly,” says Ed Hallett, managing director at iZettle UK.From the punter’s point of view, they may be encouraged to try an activity – and a venue – they might otherwise have overlooked. Research by the Department for Education suggests adults can be encouraged into taking up learning if they happen across such opportunities in places they use in their everyday lives. And where is more commonplace for many people than a local pub or cafe?Gareth Shelton runs PopUp Painting, a business that hosts evenings on which participants recreate a picture by a well-known artist, such as Van Gogh, David Hockney or Banksy, under the guidance of a practising artist. Classes take place in pubs, bars, restaurants and hotels in cities including London, Birmingham, Leeds and Liverpool. “There’s a bit of fatigue these days at just going out for a drink after work – people want experiences,” Shelton says. “Many of those who come to our classes say they find it really relaxing to do something hands-on after a day working on a screen or immersed in their phone.”Business owners often approach Shelton saying they want something that sets their venue apart from others, introducing customers to them through a class in the hopes they will return at a later date. One hotel where PopUp Painting holds classes sees it as giving added value to the hotel guests. It can also help in terms of marketing, as the business can promote the events, while participants may also spread the word via their own social media.“Getting people through the door and having them come back for more is the most important thing for any business. Offering different experiences and activities is a great way to stand out from the crowd and attract people from across the local community to try out new things. They might come for the workshop but hopefully they’ll come back for the delicious pie and nice atmosphere,” says Hallett.So what sort of business is suited to running these kinds of classes? One that has the right space for the activity in question, of course. But often it is the attitude of the person in charge that is the most important thing. Shelton adds: “The attitude of the manager is everything. Yes, we need a venue that’s not too dark or noisy and that has tables for our desktop easels. But you need to work with someone who’s open-minded enough to try new things.”Watson agrees, and sees great reputational advantages to hosting classes. “It’s about sending out a message that you’re approachable as a business, both to the class organisers and to the customers,” she says. “You’re letting people come to you with ideas and letting them try them out. There isn’t really a negative about trying something new, even if it doesn’t work. You learn something every time and you’re creating a network of people. We consider the community events we hold to be an extension of our business.”To find out how iZettle can help your business, visit izettle"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ff3b56f14276e963d8a8a86bf9bbec2891cc68a/0_274_5169_3101/master/5169.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9873ad09bc6b0168808509c596d69262","title":"inclusive pride flag confronting racism lgbt","story":"Until people from black and minority ethnic backgrounds feel comfortable in LGBT+ communities, the new black and brown stripes are vitalThe first bricks at the Stonewall riots were thrown by Marsha P Johnson, a black trans sex worker, and Sylvia Ray Rivera, a Latina trans sex worker. Yet many seem unaware of the multiracial history of the LGBT+ Pride movement. Activists such as Johnson and Rivera are rarely celebrated instead, we have the racist Grindr bios (“no rice”), the fetishisation of black sexuality and the violence perpetrated within our own community. That’s why it is so important to expand the rainbow flag that symbolises the all-encompassing nature of Pride to include black and brown stripes.Once images of the inclusive Pride flag spread online it was inevitable that I’d have to read: “Where is the white stripe?” There are ignorant and racist people, no matter what communities you belong to.The rainbow Pride flag was created in 1978 by Gilbert Baker, with originally eight colours. Its first inception had a pink stripe to symbolise sex, which has now been removed. There have been many iterations since and I’ve noticed very little concern, until the black and brown stripes were added. It’s telling that those who oppose it – and let’s not evade the reality here, they’re mostly white cis gay men – have something to say now that black and brown people have representation. It’s true, the flag wasn’t first designed to represent the colour of people’s skin, but it’s about inclusion and acceptance. Until black and brown people feel comfortable in LGBT+ spaces, the flag isn’t inclusive without those stripes. It’s a sign of solidarity.The CEO of Manchester Pride, Mark Fletcher, made the decision to adopt the stripes on their official Pride flag for 2019. “Late last year Manchester Pride introduced a new visual identity that encompasses many of the current recognised flags and symbols used by LGBT+ people. This includes an image of a rainbow, representing the colours of the Pride flag, with two colours added to it, black and brown. The use of these colours on the rainbow was a response by the charity to concerning levels of racism and exclusion experienced by black and minority ethnicity (BAME) LGBT+ people in LGBT+ spaces and communities in Greater Manchester.”Racism is still all too common at Pride events, which is why initiatives such as UK Black Pride have been created to give communities a space to celebrate. People will criticise this – calling us isive – and maybe we are, but it’s for our own safety. It’s either this or quietly absorbing the racism that wears us down, slowly hurting our physical and mental states.Racism isn’t just an issue in the LGBT+ community, but we can be at the forefront of challenging it. The inclusion of black and brown stripes on the Pride flag would acknowledge that we have recognised the problem, and are determined to change it. Holding people accountable for their actions and words, whether as an ally or in the community, is vital. As Fletcher says, “I’m not a fan of change for the sake of change. I am, however, a fan of change when it stands to make a difference.”• Sharan Dhaliwal is editor of Burnt Roti"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c3455ebb0cb6e6a8a00e74f005fe236f56ec7dda/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=493ec94fa42c127e3095c48783cf754c","title":"solstice stonehenge therapy prehistoric universe","story":"The prehistoric peoples who built this amazing monument could teach us a lesson about connecting with the universeWhen was the last time you stepped outside and looked up? It’s hard to find the time to do it, and even when we do, high-rise cityscapes, light pollution and – the bane of all astronomy – “cloud” often limit the view of what lies beyond. But perhaps it is something we are fundamentally drawn to do. Throughout time, people across the world have looked up and wondered what was out there. Cultures around the globe have built structures to augment their views of the cosmos, and one of the most important sites for contemplating the heavens is undoubtedly Stonehenge.I recently visited this prehistoric monument and as I stood within the ancient stone circle, I felt, perhaps unsurprisingly, a strong connection to the past. Yet at the same time I felt strongly rooted in the present, and yet again, even under cloudy skies, I had a feeling of being part of the expansive universe that lay beyond. It was easy to imagine that our Neolithic ancestors would have gazed at the same skies. It made me think about our connection with the natural world – or our increasing disconnection from it – and the importance of conservation and protection, not just of this monument and others like it but of the world that has been rapidly changing around it since those enormous stones were raised 4,500 years ago.Was Stonehenge a Neolithic computer for predicting eclipses, an astronomical observatory, a place of moon worship? And how did its use evolve over the years? Standing in the stones and taking in the huge sky above, I am certain that its “skyscape” is as significant in understanding this as the landscape that it sits in.It is thought that even in Neolithic times Salisbury Plain would have been largely wide-open grassland as it is now – quite different from the woodlands that would have surrounded it, and a perfect place from which to observe the night sky. In my mind’s eye, I can see generation after generation sitting around fires looking up at the spectacle of the heavens and telling stories inspired by the movement of the planets and the constellations as a way of imparting knowledge about changes in season, weather patterns and the marking of time. Beliefs about the sky, the stars and planets would have been intertwined with practical daily life.Marking the movements of the sun was clearly important to the people who built Stonehenge, as they went to such enormous extents to carefully align the stones. Exactly why they did this, we don’t know. But as Stonehenge Skyscape – English Heritage’s new digital model of the solar system – or “orrery”, illustrates, at midwinter the sun barely rises in the sky. It’s possible that our prehistoric ancestors saw the winter solstice as a time when the sun almost seemed to die, before slowly being reborn.This may seem absurd, but as recently as 1812 our lack of knowledge about the sun led people to believe that it was indeed dying. Many thought the end of the world was at hand when sunspots appeared on its surface and its light was dimmed by a haze, which was in fact caused by a volcanic eruption.Lord Byron was inspired to write an apocalyptic poem, Darkness, when his summer holiday on Lake Geneva was overshadowed by dark skies, thunder and torrential rain. He imagined the grim fate of humanity after the sudden death of the sun:I had a dream, which was not all a dream.The bright sun was extinguish’d, and the starsDid wander darkling in the eternal space,Rayless, and pathless, and the icy earthSwung blind and blackening in the moonless airMorn came and went – and came, and brought no day, And men forgot their passions in the dreadOf this their desolation and all heartsWere chill’d into a selfish prayer for light.Today, most of us living in towns and cities rarely experience darkness. We check the weather on our phones, rather than going out and looking at it and feeling it. And, unlike our prehistoric ancestors, we take it for granted that the sun will rise and set every day. But it is perhaps they who were more in tune with the world around them.The pleasure of standing alone in Stonehenge was an extraordinary feeling, a feeling that I would tap into later, to bring calm into my busy life. It also gave me a sense of how important our place in the universe must have been to our ancestors. This is something that they seemed to understand better than we do. And maybe, if we understood it better, and connected with it more than we do, we would be better placed to look after the planet and its precious resources for our children, and to inspire them to do the same for theirs.• Maggie Aderin-Pocock is a space scientist and presenter of the BBC’s Sky at Night series"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/626b9c54fe626a5d389eec5921d3129b0b4f5498/310_740_4190_2515/master/4190.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e756b173dc4f94e38b327b975dea45b","title":"summer holiday working parents","story":"The long US school holiday causes headaches for working parents but produces golden moments of childhoodThe state schools in New York break up for summer next week, giving kids almost 10 weeks of holiday. (The private schools have already been out for a week.) Like daylight saving, this appears to be a historical anomaly pegged to the days when everyone worked on a farm, and children were required to work in the fields for two months. In Manhattan most kids will go straight into summer camp, the cheapest of which – not counting subsidised social programmes that are heavily oversubscribed – are about $500 (£395) per child per week and lets them out at a very uncordial 3pm. The annual grouse about the cost of the city reaches fever pitch at this time of year.The childcare hustle is so costly and extreme that if you’re not careful, it can blow through the main advantage of summer: an invitation to spend more time with your children. Research shows, somewhat surprisingly, that during the long break parents actually spend more time with their kids than they used to. According to analysis from the Pew Research Center, in 1965 mothers in the US spent on average 10 hours a week caring for their kids compared with 14 hours now. (For fathers, those figures are two and a half hours in 1965 and eight hours now.) But my instinct is that, of those 14 hours, a large proportion is spent fretting about where to put the kids the rest of the time, how much it’s going to cost, and whether they are being sufficiently improved by the activities they’re doing.My children start kindergarten in the autumn, and their new school has issued parents with a stern warning about “summer slide”, which over 10 weeks of non-attendance is, I’m sure, is considerable. Advising parents to ensure their kids carry on reading every day is sensible, but it does add to the sense of the summer break as a terrible obstacle to overcome rather than an annual release from pressure. I don’t want to get too Swallows and Amazons about this, but the dedication of summer to worthwhile pursuit seems to undermine its very reason for being.It also feels like a particularly noticeable glitch in modern parenting psychology. I sometimes catch myself complaining about how many extra hours I will have to take off over the next 10 weeks, what a monstrous hassle and expense it all is, why the city is set up to punish working parents – on and on I go before stopping short, and telling myself to shut up. This is an insane way to live and it crushes the joy out of everything.No one I know can take two months off work, and most of us wouldn’t want to: but in spite of the difficulties there has to be a way to regard the summer as a bonus, not a chore to approach the shortfall in childcare as a gift, not a source of guilt. After all, based on what many of us know from our own childhoods, it’s unstructured time, not the feverish schlep between camp and classes and play dates, that really helps child development. For the love of God, for a second let’s take our eyes off the meter."},{"url":null,"title":"it takes two creative duos on how collaboration makes them thrive","story":"Two heads are better than one, so the saying goes, and if these Coal Drops Yard pairings are anything to go by, there’s something in it …Creativity and collaboration are at the heart of Coal Drops Yard and its array of independent businesses, offering everything from bras to baguettes. We spoke to three of the district’s creative duos to get some tips on pairing up and the art of compromise.Lots of siblings wouldn’t be able to work together – have you guys always collaborated well?Mazie: We have entirely different skills, which I think is critical to us getting on. Abbie heads up design and I head up the marketing. We don’t step on each other’s toes and we trust each other’s judgments. She’s a bit more daring and I’m more commercial, so we’re a good balance.Abbie: The crossover in our pregnancies, with hormones raging, was pretty much the only time we had a row. One argument in three years of collaborating together on Beija isn’t bad, I reckon. Our working relationship improves all the time, as we gain confidence and toughen up.Has your relationship changed since you began working together?Mazie: It’s definitely stronger. She was my stroppy older sister before, but now she’s my best friend. I like to think we’ve both matured a lot since launching Beija.What do you each think the other brings to the brand?Abbie: Mazie brings so much – ideas, jokes, vision and commerciality. I can get a bit avant garde. She reins us all in.Mazie: Abbie brings gorgeous bras that women want to wear – simple styling and beautiful colours. She has great taste and won’t compromise on quality for price, which is what I really respect about her. She’s got high standards.What’s a day in the life of Beija like?Mazie: No day is the same – it’s a ride of amazing highs and frustrating lows. We’re still in our infancy, so I have a lot of jobs – a mix of copywriting, contacting buyers, planning newsletters, designing digital ads, social media, looking at fabrics, plus planning the future of Beija …Abbie: I reply to emails in the morning and do lab dips – approving and rejecting fabric colour submissions. Then I smash through patterns, make sure all the fabrics are there for cutting, so that the samples can be picked up and sewn. Measuring and fitting, then more emails and catching up with the factories. I meet with fabric suppliers, and then have meetings with my team at various points in the day. When I’m designing I have to get away from the office, as there’s no brain space with so much going on.Has Coal Drops Yard influenced your work?Mazie: I visit Coal Drops Yard twice a week and I never want to leave. It’s got a style about it that I really love – it’s laid-back and effortless. I’m always blown away by how cool and well-dressed everyone is.Abbie: The customers who shop here definitely influence us. They are pretty cool, understated and modern. And architecturally, yes. It’s a super slick, strong and neat space – all characteristics I admire and consider when I’m designing.What’s your working relationship like?Missy: In any successful relationship, work or otherwise, you have to put as much energy into understanding and knowing the other person as you do into the actual work. It’s complex being involved with your work partner in a romantic way, because sometimes you’re restricted by what they know already – about you, about the business and the way you work. Collaboration is as much about space as it is about closeness.Our ideas cross over the most in the creative, fun parts of the business, which is what we both enjoy most, but that’s not all the business is. There are a lot of times we just have to get our heads down and split the crappy jobs that no one wants to do!What do you each bring that’s unique?Gabriel: Bodega Rita’s is the product of two people with very different sensibilities and very different ways of working, and we are extremely lucky that these juxtapositions balance out in a beautiful way. It allows us to split responsibilities based on our inidual strengths, enabling us to encourage and support each other while getting on with what needs to be done.Missy: Gabe’s a brilliant chef but, more than that, he understands the importance of the experience of eating, and the transportive quality of flavour. He brings his references together in a way that is honest and thorough and not at all pretentious, and translates food that belongs in a restaurant into a tiny grab-and-go sandwich shop with eight seats.Has your store been influenced by its Coal Drops Yard location?Missy: The power of food is that it’s unifying, so we are absolutely influenced not only by the history of the area but the fact that it’s a workplace for some people, a day out for others, a place of study … I’m looking forward to summer when we can keep the front doors open, have music playing and create a lovely hangout spot for people visiting the area.What advice would you give to someone embarking on a creative collaboration with someone they’re in a relationship with?Gabriel: Work out your inidual strengths and respect them. Communicate and support each other. And always make time to do stuff together that has absolutely nothing to do with work – regularly. Don’t let work get in the way.How did you become business partners?Joao: We have been mates for a long time and we both share the same love and respect for the craft of tattooing and the piercing industry. Sacred Gold was the perfect opportunity to join forces and create something special.What’s a typical day in the life of Sacred Gold?Guy: Adorning lots of people from all walks of life. From mild to wild, discreet to ostentatious, we have something for everyone.What do you think each other brings to the business?Joao: Guy has a lot of experience and insight into the management and approach of running a studio, and a business awareness that benefits us greatly.Guy: Joao has a very unique style that is instantly recognisable. His tattoos are extremely hard to duplicate, creating something special and exclusive to Sacred Gold.What advice would you give someone starting a creative collaboration with a friend?Joao: I would say a successful partnership consists of friends who have opposing qualities. Guy and I have different strengths, so we can both bring something different to the table and balance each other out.Guy: Collaboration means bouncing ideas off one another and expanding on them. Seeing things from a different set of eyes can really expand an idea. A different perspective can also be refreshing and can help when an idea feels stagnant.Has Coal Drops Yard inspired your work?Joao: It’s been an influence on the interior of the studio. We wanted to reflect the way Coal Drops Yard has held on to the historical structure while adding modern elements.Guy: I think what influenced us the most was the style and high spec of Coal Drops Yard – we knew we had to do something that would do justice to such an incredible project.Looking for a more personal shopping and dining experience, or simply want to discover somewhere new in the capital?

Instead the 2050 date was dropped into a footnote that stated: “For a large majority of member states, climate neutrality must be achieved by 2050.”The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, told her fellow leaders that the EU needed to signal ambition ahead of that meeting. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, called for the EU to agree an unambiguous target for net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.But the Central European trio stood their ground against any mention of 2050 in the main EU summit communiqué.The Czech prime minister, Andrej Babiš, had quipped on his arrival at the summit: “Why should we decide 31 years ahead of time what will happen in 2050?”Inside the meeting, Babiš questioned why Europe should act when emissions in China were rising, prompting a retort from the German chancellor. She countered that the Chinese were taking action that would mean a reduction in Chinese emissions after 2030.While supporters of the 2050 plan were disappointed, they are not giving up. “It’s not a matter of if the EU commits to climate neutrality, it’s when,” one diplomat said.A large majority of EU member states support the aim of net zero carbon emissions by 2050.Hopes had grown in recent days, after Slovakia, Bulgaria and some Baltic states announced their support for the 2050 target, seeing economic gains from the transition to a green economy. “We have come to the conclusion that this is a hell of an opportunity,” the Latvian prime minister, Krišjānis Kariņš, told his fellow leaders.Earlier a senior EU diplomat said the debate among member states had moved on significantly since earlier discussions in March, when countries were “very ided”. They said: “We still do not have unanimity, but an overwhelming majority of member states, including member states you would never expect of being ready to accept such an objective are going in that direction.”The UN secretary general, António Guterres, wants the climate summit in September to put the world on a path to limiting global warming to 1.5C – a non-binding aspiration of the 2015 Paris accord.Guterres wrote to European council president, Donald Tusk, last month and called on him to demonstrate the leadership of the EU. “I write to you today both as a G20 member and as a leader who I believe can bring the ingenuity needed to transform our economic systems and avert the negative impacts of a world with high levels of carbon emissions – from rising levels of pollution to costly natural disasters,” he stated.The letter calls for a change of course to “achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050” and specifies that leaders should curtail current coal-burning power stations and discontinue new ones beyond 2020.Responding to the EU’s failure to agree a 2050 target, green campaigners called on the EU to hold an emergency climate summit ahead of the UN meeting in September.“Hollow words can’t rebuild a house flattened in a mudslide or repay a farmer who’s lost their harvest to drought, said Greenpeace EU climate policy advisor Sebastian Mang. “Merkel and Macron failed to convince Poland and bring others on board. With people on the streets demanding action and warnings from scientists that the window to respond is closing fast, our governments had a chance to lead from the front and put Europe on a rapid path to full decarbonisation. They blew it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d78961f8d86e92a13aeb182857491e95332ae53b/370_191_2762_1657/master/2762.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dba2e70aab1d5ae8408bb44aa5e702fd","title":"what oil companies knew the great climate cover up podcast","story":"Oil firms are said to have known for decades of the link between burning fossil fuels and climate breakdown.

However …I made the mistake of buying some Lancashire Tea bags recently. It seemed like the right thing to do at the time. I was born in Lancaster – and they were on offer in Morrisons.What a disappointment. We Lancastrians may have won the Wars of the Roses* and be vastly better at football than our transpennine rivals, but, by ’eck, the brew bearing my county’s name is an insipid affair. More than once I had to go back to the cupboard and check I hadn’t picked up a decaf bag in error. Lancashire Tea is murky. It has a sinister tinge of that slightly bruised purple you get when suffering a tea with the good stuff removed.Chances are, you have never tried Lancashire Tea. You probably didn’t even know it was a thing. It has only existed since 2002, when Paul Needham and Lynn Hitchen looked enviously at the success of Yorkshire Tea and decided to copy the gimmick over on the rainy side of the M62.It is, I would argue, a bit of a swizz. The website gives little away, but moderate sleuthing reveals it is not even boxed in Lancashire. They blend it in Newton-le-Willows, St Helens, which hasn’t been in Lancashire since 1974. I guess Merseyside Tea doesn’t carry convey quite the same romance.It was all excellent viral marketing for Yorkshire Tea, which used the resulting publicity to clarify that the tea is in fact only blended in Yorkshire, before being shipped around the country.Despite living in Stockport (the west, correct, side of the Pennines), I drink Yorkshire Tea. It’s strong and northern, like me. We don’t even keep it local in the ’s Manchester office, despite the paper’s 198-year foundations in the historic county of Lancashire. We too buy the Tykes’ tea, in 3kg sacks from our stationery supplier.But is Yorkshire Tea really the nation’s finest mass-produced regional chai? I decided to find out, with the help of Jimmy Green, an ex-military man who became addicted to tea when serving in Hong Kong alongside teetotal Gurkhas. He runs Tea from the Manor, which blends loose-leaf teas for hotels across the north-west.He invites me to his office, in an unpromising oblong building on an industrial estate in Denton, Greater Manchester. Appearances deceive. Inside is a tea lover’s paradise. His desk is made of tea chests and two walls are packed floor-to-ceiling with his blends, which include everything from traditional oolong (a superstrong Chinese number only for the hardcore) to a gin and tonic concoction he had made recently for some Cheshire hipsters.A brew with Green is a formal affair. I immediately feel underdressed. He is wearing a dickie bow and pristine white shirt and boils water not in a kettle but in a shiny samovar. Cups are china, naturally, and he has put on a tantalising spread of chocolate eclairs and slices of Victoria sponge that he forbids me from touching until after the tasting, lest I sully my palate.He has laid out some tea leaves on a saucer. One pile, fine brown shavings, he dismisses as “dust”. That, he says, is what we will find inside all the tea bags we are to test today – blends, he suggests, that are fine only in texture. Cheap and tawdry, lowest common denominator stuff. He wants me to compare the dust with the much bigger dried tea leaves he puts into Tea from the Manor blends, which he insists will impart vastly more flavour.I line up the teas we are to taste: Yorkshire Tea, Lancashire Tea, Cornish Tea, West Country Tea, Welsh Tea and Ringtons (which trades heavily on its Newcastle-upon-Tyne origins), plus the only tea I could find that is grown wholly in Britain: Kinnettles Gold, propagated and hand-rolled on a farm in Angus, north-east Scotland, in such tiny quantities that they produce no more than 2kg a year.Green is not keen to taste these heathen teas: “It’s like asking someone used to drinking fine wines to have a bottle of cheap cider.” Nonetheless, he forces down a few mouthfuls, grimacing as if I have made him drink meths. He complains of a “furry taste” (Ringtons), being left with a coating on his tongue (Cornish) and points out some white scum that gathers in the Yorkshire bag. We decide to make each cuppa as I would at home or in the office: straight into the cup. We are not to stir – or worse, use a teaspoon to squeeze out the flavour: “Stirring it is wrong. We should let it steep itself.”I can’t tell the difference between most of them – apart from the fairy-light and appleish Kinnettles, which isn’t an English Breakfast blend and really belongs in a totally different category. I decide I like Ringtons best: it is neither baggy nor crepy and has slightly smoky overtones. Yorkshire and Welsh are pretty much interchangeable: a discovery confirmed by blind tastings in the ’s Manchester office, where even proud Bradfordian Josh Halliday, a lifelong Yorkshire Tea drinker, was fooled by its Welsh brethren.Nazia Parveen, a Brummie, manages to distinguish northern from southern. We all agree the Cornish and West Country brews are a bit too light for our unsubtle palates. It could be the water: ours in Manchester is soft and might not bring out the best in teas blended in England’s lower half. That said, most tea blenders import water from across the UK to check their product will still be drinkable outside their home region.Back at Tea from the Manor, Green reluctantly tastes a sip of Lancashire. He rolls out another simile to explain the offence I am causing his taste buds – “It’s like making a Bugatti owner drive a Transit van” – and makes a face. “Not nice.” He prefers its transpennine rival, too, not that you would ever catch him drinking mass-produced “dust” on his own time.But before Yorkshire folk get too cocky, their brew didn’t come out top in my tasting test. That honour went to Ringtons of Newcastle. Forget the Wars of the Roses: the Geordies win the ’s tea tussle.* Don’t bother the readers’ editor with this one, Yorkshire chums. Yes, there were several wars, not one, and you won a few. But the last one ended when Henry Tudor (later Henry VII), a Lancastrian, defeated and killed Yorkie Richard III (the car park king) at Bosworth Field on 22 August 1485. So we won.Yorkshire Tea (£2.79 for 80 teabags) A no-nonsense brew, befitting a county that gave us Geoffrey Boycott and Sean Bean. Like a Yorkshire terrier: feisty but reliable and surprisingly domineering. 45Cornish Tea (£2.99 for 80 teabags) Pleasant enough but lacking in personality. I was expecting more subversion from a tea with the subtitle “smuggler’s brew”. 35Welsh Brew Gold (£3.69 for 80 teabags) A hearty brew – strong and confident, yet strangely comforting, like a male voice choir. Can double for Yorkshire Tea. 45Ringtons Gold (£3.97 for 100 teabags) Blended on Tyneside since 1907, Ringtons is my fave: a slightly smoky brew with a bright and golden hue. 55Miles West Country Original (£2.50 for 80 teabags) Barely there. Disappointing for a region famed for its cream teas and Cheddar cheese. 35Lancashire Tea (£2.30 for 80 teabags) Odd purplish hue. As satisfying as a weak handshake. Very “meh” for the county of strong women like Thora Hird, Emmeline Pankhurst and Barbara Castle. 25Kinnettles Gold (£40 for a 20g tin) Grown and hand-rolled on Kinnettles farm in Angus, north-east Scotland, this delicate yellow-green tea bears no relation to any of the above but scores highly for refreshment and novelty value. 45"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e54f60048e6b44c702afad7a6bf6d15f2f2d2850/0_71_4700_2820/master/4700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=de6c01de57a066a3e9502e1d4b96a0d0","title":"why are the best footballers in the world suing their bosses","story":"The Women’s World Cup is nearing the knockout stages, with the tournament favourites, the US, in blistering form.

For them, it must have been absolutely heartbreaking. Watching the drama unfold from a distance, I was feeling something quite different: fury.I don’t think I have ever been as incensed by a football rule in my life. I was a fan of VAR at last year’s World Cup: coming in at the right time, cleaning up refereeing errors and making the game more objective. But using it to interpret the new changes to the law covering penalties is ridiculous.VAR was intended to overrule clear and obvious mistakes, not to penalise goalkeepers for being inches off their line. Watching what looks like a bad experiment cheapen the Women’s World Cup feels wrong, and speaks to the fact we’re still not there in terms of equality. The last women’s World Cup was played on artificial turf, another first that was incredibly unpopular with players and coaches. I don’t believe a rule such as this would have been introduced so close to the men’s tournament, and to wheel it out in a competition that stands as the pinnacle of the women’s game is unfair.The Scotland goalkeeper, Lee Alexander, clearly had not been properly prepared. As she faced the second penalty, having been punished the first time for taking the smallest forward step, she couldn’t even e properly. At that point the law was crippling and the penalty taker may as well have had a free shot.Forward movement is part of a goalkeeper’s technique for pushing themselves off into a save and, suddenly unable to stray even an inch off her line, she had no idea what to do. You may be questioning why, as a striker, I care so much about the goalkeeper when ultimately it makes it easier for my fellow strikers to score. I am aware this is the letter of the law, but I like to see a law that improves the game, brings competitive balance and fairness.Players are being put in a position where they are forced to invent a new technique in the 93rd minute of a vital match at the World Cup finals. The fact the Premier League has already announced VAR will not be used to monitor goalkeepers’ positioning at penalties next season is hugely telling.Who was consulted before the decision to interpret the law so rigidly was taken? Were any football teams involved? Were goalkeepers part of it? It seems to me that people have made up this rule without any idea of how it was actually going to affect a player’s movement.At least Alexander had saved the first penalty. In the game between France and Nigeria on Monday night, Wendie Renard put her penalty wide before being given a second chance because Chiamaka Nnadozie had moved slightly off her line. At the second attempt, she scored the only goal of another important group game and left Nigeria’s hopes hanging by a thread.As the rule is being applied, a player could take the worst penalty in history, send it flying into the upper tier or spinning towards the corner flag, and still get another go. If the goalkeeper was three inches off her line in those circumstances, it couldn’t be less relevant.These decisions are an absolute farce. I can understand that officials want to address the issue of goalkeepers coming way off their line before a penalty, but the rule has to be applied with some intelligence. The VAR can see exactly how much a goalkeeper has moved, and could surely give them a few centimetres’ leeway – the technology was brought in to correct obvious mistakes, not to impose perfection. The knockout stage starts on Saturday, bringing the possibility of penalty shootouts. My worry is this may get truly out of hand as the competition is reaching its most important, and most publicly scrutinised phase, and bring the women’s game into serious disrepute. Millions of people are watching these games, people who probably don’t watch a lot of women’s football, and thanks to VAR at times it is looking like a total joke.In total seven minutes passed on Wednesday between the penalty being awarded and it finally going in, and the second half featured five goals and five substitutions. Yet the referee played only five minutes’ stoppage time, leaving both teams incensed at being denied a few more moments in which to find a winner that could have kept their tournament alive. The way the game ended was embarrassing, but as angry as Scotland’s players must have felt, they will know that having led 3-0 as late as the 74th minute against weaker opposition they would still be in the tournament were it not for naivety and poor decision-making.Shelley Kerr has got her tactics wrong: they were too conservative in their first two games and played Kim Little too deep. On Wednesday they pushed her further up, and as a result she got the first goal.England secured a third victory but there is plenty still to work on. Across all three matches they have let teams in the game – Japan were the only team they beat by more than a goal, and even then the second did not come until the 84th minute. In the knockouts they need to be more ruthless and clinical. Defensively they continue to look a bit shaky when pressed.Japan controlled possession impressively, particularly in the second half, but they don’t have much of a cutting edge up front, or from midfield. If they can develop that incision they will go back to being one of the best. They are very strong at youth level, and may come to the fore in the next major women’s tournament, next year’s Olympics in Tokyo. I suspect the penalty law may have been tweaked again by then.• Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure discussion remains on topics raised by the writer.

Such consent requires the young woman to have reached the age of maturity and reason, so that her consent is validly given,” the fatwa read, adding that this age was 18, and quoting parts of the Qur’an and the hadiths of the prophet Muhammad to support it.The summit was organised by Jaha Dukureh, a Gambian campaigner and the founder of Safe Hands for Girls, herself a survivor of child marriage and FGM, who drove a successful campaign to end FGM in her country.Dukureh, who went to Egypt to talk to the al-Azhar clerics last year, described how towards the end of the summit she realised that the fatwa had not yet been issued and went to talk to the imam, Salah Abbas. She, the African Union youth envoy Aya Chebbi and the Syrian journalist Abdalaziz Alhamza worked with the Egyptian imams to turn their rough draft, scrawled on hotel notepaper, into a formal document.“We sat there on the floor with them, writing the fatwa. They had to call Egypt to ensure that everything was in line. And then there was a back and forth about the languages, because in Arabic things can be translated different ways. To me, it was just amazing watching that process.”Four in 10 young women in sub-Saharan Africa are married before their 18th birthday. Boys are affected too – according to recent UN data, roughly one in 30 worldwide were married as children, with the highest number in Central African Republic, where almost a third of boys and men were child grooms.The problem is not limited to Africa – across the world, 12 million girls are married in childhood every year. In Iraq in 2017, parliamentarians drafted a law that would allow children as young as nine to marry, based on the idea that the prophet Muhammad married his wife Aisha when she was just nine years old. The prime minister blocked the bill last year, but there are fears it will be reintroduced.“When you force a girl to get married, you’ve given someone the right to rape her over and over again,” said Dukureh, who was married at 15 and again at 17. “And every single day, every time she’s touched … you don’t forget. I don’t think you forget that. I don’t think you ever get over that.Part of the target group is Dukureh’s own father, an influential imam in Gambia.“If I go to my dad, and give him the same statement that al-Azhar did, he wouldn’t listen to me. But if the deputy grand imam of al-Azhar is here, yes,” Dukureh said.Her father appeared in a  documentary made about her fight to stop FGM. She convinced him not to allow his baby daughter to be cut – the first girl in their family not to go through FGM.Child marriage was something he never discussed, though.“We came to a point of agreement when it comes to FGM. We never had a resolution on child marriage. Even my brothers, they would always tell me, you know, you can talk about FGM all you want. But with child marriage, you can’t touch it because the prophet’s wife was nine when he married her. So don’t even go there.”But Dukureh convinced her father to come to the summit. In his white robes, cap and sandals, he prayed throughout, and later said: “I cried so much, because I learned so much.”As well as the fatwa, the activists, religious and traditional leaders, government ministers and religious officials came up with a declaration on Africans taking a lead to stop FGM and child marriage, which they are asking countries to sign up to. Many organisations aim to eliminate the practices by 2030.Much of the funding for the summit, which cost roughly $1.2m (£946,000) and was supported by the World Bank and UN population fund, came from iniduals and grassroots organisations."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ef20368f8d3af18f782ce60f61b397b7e1628be/126_149_2510_1506/master/2510.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=57ff9b978da0466e46718cd66bd41214","title":"bbc to consider increasing vetting after tory leadership debate","story":"Programme received 31 Ofcom complaints after featuring imam who had allegedly made antisemitic comments onlineThe BBC will consider “additional steps” in its vetting process for guests following a debate between Conservative leadership candidates.Media watchdog Ofcom received 31 complaints about Our Next Prime Minister, which featured questions from an imam who had made allegedly antisemitic comments online.The BBC has defended its vetting process, saying that such programmes are likely to attract politicised contributors and unified opinion on political broadcasts would be “odd”.However, further action may be considered in any similar shows following criticism of the Tory leadership debate which aired on Tuesday.The programme featured questions from members of the public who appeared on a large screen to quiz the leadership hopefuls.The choice of guests has drawn criticism from viewers over partisanship, and an imam who asked the contenders about Islamophobia.Abdullah Patel has been suspended from his mosque following the emergence of past tweets in which he said “every political figure on the Zionist’s payroll is scaring the world about Corbyn”.He also shared an image endorsing the relocation of Israel to the US as a way of solving the IsraelPalestine conflict.A BBC spokeswoman said: “This programme was an important contribution to the current political debate. It was watched by a big audience and the candidates to be the next prime minister were asked legitimate questions which our audience will have expected to have answered.“We have a long history of producing successful debate programmes and this was no different. We did however, adopt a different format for this programme and we will look at whether there are additional steps we might take on vetting and transparency should we repeat it in the future.“We of course have long established procedures for programmes that we make on a regular basis, and it is important to remember that a political debate programme involving members of the public will, by its very nature, attract people interested and engaged in issues who may well have been active in politics.“It would be odd only to have programmes involving the public where everyone agrees with the politics of those they are questioning.”Our Next Prime Minister was watched by more than 5 million viewers and the corporation said the hour-long broadcast from 8pm was the “best performing programme of the night across all channels”.It is understood that complaints over the programme were largely concerned with the overall show, with fewer relating to the selection of guests who asked questions.The BBC has been further criticised for adding to the problem of antisemitism following the leadership debate.The Board Of Deputies Of British Jews has raised concerned over the broadcaster’s use of language in reporting comments made by Patel on Our Next Prime Minister.A letter from the organisation to the BBC’s head of news, Fran Unsworth, has claimed the corporation’s use of the term “anti-Israel” rather than antisemitic in its coverage of the imam’s comments was “deeply problematic”.The letter calls for clearer use of language by the BBC.It reads: “We are deeply concerned by an apparent editorial decision across the BBC to term the tweet ‘anti-Israel’: on the BBC news website, on Wednesday’s BBC News at Ten and by two journalists on that night’s Newsnight.“They did so without mentioning the offensive content of the tweet. This is deeply problematic.“The struggle against antisemitism is hampered by legitimate concerns of the Jewish community being dismissed as mere political disagreements about Israel, and not recognised as actual antisemitism.“The BBC’s reporting has added to that problem.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a3f4d779c55e861c18d73abbf2a67228567b4c8/0_117_6639_3983/master/6639.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9ecdf16f99e4fafe4083f625134d8ed9","title":"glass houses for sale in pictures","story":"You’ll want to avoid throwing stones at these light-filled properties, from Jersey to Scotland"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09dcfd22bff44829f49a24cb7d23890bc38b040e/0_166_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7211b0a742bc396f7a73ec9db56a6a8e","title":"richard ratcliffe hunger strike making embassy work impossible iran","story":"Envoy voices discontent over protest by Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s husband in LondonThe hunger strike by Richard Ratcliffe outside the Iranian embassy in London is making work there impossible and putting pressure on diplomatic staff, Iran’s ambassador to the UK has said.Ratcliffe, the husband of the imprisoned Iranian-British dual national Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, began the protest last weekend and has been visited by a growing number of family members, supporters and politicians, including SNP MPs and Labour’s deputy leader, Tom Watson.Tired but in good spirits and surrounded by flowers and signs, Ratcliffe said on Thursday he would continue at least until the weekend, when he would speak to his wife about the steps she wished him to take next. He said it had been the decision of the Iranians to erect two large corrugated iron barriers in front of the entrance to the embassy opposite Hyde Park. The ambassador, , Hamid Baeidinejad, said they were designed to shield staff from being filmed.In an apparent reprisal for the protest, some of the diplomatic protection provided for the British embassy in Tehran has been removed.Watson expressed solidarity with Ratcliffe. “His family is trapped in a terrifying geopolitical game,” he said. “I urge the Iranian government to assist the de-escalation of military tension and release Nazanin as an act of humanity.”Zaghari-Ratcliffe is serving a five-year sentence for espionage and is on hunger strike in Tehran in protest at her conditions.Baeidinejad, at a briefing called in part to discuss the growing crisis in the Gulf, said of Ratcliffe: “He is now blocking the entrance of our embassy and the peace of mind of our staff is in complete despair.”He said the door of the embassy was blocked because of the action. “There are media cameras 18-19 hours a day focusing on the entrance of the embassy, so any person going in and leaving is filmed which is totally unacceptable,” he said, adding that all meetings were being cancelled as a result.Baeidinejad said he had raised with the Foreign Office his concern that Ratcliffe’s activities were in breach of article 22 of the Vienna convention, which protects the ordinary daily activities of the embassy. “Every citizen has a right to express his opinions and we respect the right to demonstrate but there is a place designated on the other side of the street and Mr Ratcliffe can go there. He can see the embassy and the Iranian flag from there,” he said.“We do not understand why there should be an exception for Mr Ratcliffe, why there should be discrimination and why he has selected just to be in front of our embassy which is blocking our entrance.”Staff were being insulted and intimidated, Baeidinejad said. “His presence is disrupting the work of the embassy and apparently what he has in mind is a campaign of pressure against the embassy.“We have sympathy with him because we know that he is a father and a husband. We are sorry about this situation but this situation has occurred by the wrongdoing of a national lady and she has a verdict of five years in prison. We know it is difficult for a mum to be separated from a kid. Of course, there are frequent visits by the kid, and we have done our best to ensure there are no difficulties in the life of the daughter.”He said Ratcliffe was free to go to the embassy and apply for a visa, but he did not say whether a visa would be granted.“We have always been discussing with the judiciary how they can provide better health facilities and we are happy that the concerns have all been met,” Baeidinejad said.“We are trying our best to accommodate the concerns of the family. He is raising only one demand which is the immediate release of the mother, but the judiciary is the body that makes the final decisions of this. This cannot be done by pressure or political manoeuvring. This is the law and the judiciary should make proper decisions.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da2b749083904a4f08b45dd43afe331dd54287c2/0_0_5472_3648/master/5472.jpg?width=660\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=a8bb6f3c03f976d7642983026141eeae 1320w","title":"the whole thing was dismal readers on the tory tv debate","story":"Candidates for the Conservative leadership took part in a debate on Tuesday – readers have been reacting in the commentsMost of us will have worked with or for a leader who has had the ability to inspire, to motivate, to explain, to prioritise, to delegate, to coach, to be authentic, to involve, to be intellectually agile, to set out a compelling vision and to make following herhim an honour. None of these candidates come close to having any of these attributes and it makes me despair for our country ZeitgitThe whole thing was dismal. What seems striking is that anyone should continue to bother to ask these people exactly how they’ll get Brexit done, when it’s painfully obvious that their plans range from non-existent to laughable fantasy to just-about-possible-if-a-miracle happens.The merits of leaving or remaining in the EU are now beside the point. Brexit has become a vacuous non policy, which depends for its continued existence on not being specified to any credible level of detail. Once you start to pin down exactly how it would be done, support evaporates from one side or the other.Herein lies its real purpose: to create an endless and insoluble riddle, causing sufficient ongoing distraction and chaos to enable the disaster capitalists to ply their trade. There is no actual Brexit that true Brexiteers would support, because then it would become a boring and difficult reality the fantasy is so much more appealing and useful to them. This is why Farage’s party had no manifesto. Michael GallagherEvery single one of them ignored the repeated question regarding the correlation between poverty and their ideological cuts. Johnson well and truly in script mode, maybe his handlers should have instructed basic listening and response skills. Stewart was squeezed out time and time again by Emily and the other candidates. The only solace I can take from all of this, given the majority view of PM candidates on Brexit, is that we will be facing a general election very, very soon. Jazzfunk23My concern is that Johnson is not running for PM, but for ‘having been PM’ and the lucrative reward that this will afford him for the rest of his life. At least Stewart looks like he means it and that he wants to affect change of some sort. Gove, too, is committed I think and has a track record of actually achieving things... disastrous in education, but actually quite good in environment. I only hope the privileged few who get to choose our leader think about this, though I doubt many will be reading here! ExeprattlerIt’s satisfying and fun to rip in to this collection of deluded misfits. None of them deserves the top job, and most sensible people can see how flawed and uninspiring they are. But, the fact is that no matter how much we mock Boris Johnson’s mannerisms, or his hair, or his fecklessness, the UK is on a collision course with an economic crisis. Isn’t it about time we put aside the sniping partisan politics of our echo chambers and worked towards a solution? The first part of any way out of this mess must be the rejection of no deal as an option. The next stage would be a public consultation on what out negotiated leave options are and how they stack up against not leaving at all. It’ll never happen of course, but my point is that until the current tension is diffused nothing objective can be achieved. FreeThinker73Out of this bunch Gove is by far the best candidate. That’s not to say that I like him, or his politics but considering this is a Tory leadership contest and I’ve voted Labour in every election of the last 30 years, I’m not going to like any of them. Gove is the most serious, the most informed and the most likely to be able to elicit some movement from the EU. The fact that he comes across as that annoying little pip from school doesn’t change that. Nor does what happened within education whilst he was there the policies may have been poor but ultimately he delivered them, which was his job. I can’t stress enough that I don’t even want a Tory government, let alone one with any of these people running it. If we have to have one though and if it has to be run by one of these, it’s Gove. AndyOldhamOn the plus side, the Tory party will almost certainly be crucified on the Brexit cross. Whoever takes leadership has a year, maybe two before they befall the same pitfalls as their predecessors. Reality is simply something none of them are able to face (bar Stewart). There is no logic, or ration, or reason, to what they are doing. Still they believe they can abolish legal issues with force of will. Frankly both main parties may well be sacrificed in the altar: If the Tories fail to deliver Brexit, they are doomed. When they deliver it, they have nothing left to offer other than tax cuts. AJVC1991Well, who impressed me the most, and who do I think has and is likely to make the biggest difference by their actions? I thought it was the woman who has fostered over 100 children, and asked the question about funding for children’s services – which none of them bothered to answer.

We can each speak for ourselves, but now a team of economists have put the unsuspecting public to the test in a mass social experiment involving 17,000 “lost” wallets in 40 countries.They found that a majority of people returned the wallets and – contrary to classic economic logic – they were more likely to do so the more money the wallet contained.“We mistakenly assume that our fellow human beings are selfish,” said Alain Cohn, an assistant professor of economics at the University of Michigan and first author of the study. “In reality their self-image as an honest person is more important to them than a short-term monetary gain.”The findings defied the expectations of both professional economists and 2,500 respondents to a survey, who predicted that people would act in self-interest.Research assistants posed as people who had found wallets, hurriedly dropping them off in public places including banks, theatres, museums and police stations. Most of the wallet drops were in large cities, and there were about 400 observations per country.The wallets contained either no money, a small amount or a larger sum, along with a grocery list and business cards with an email and phone number for the “owner”. The amounts were scaled to match spending power in different countries. The entire cost of the project was about £472,000 ($600,000).There were some surprising non-returns: wallets dropped off at the Vatican and at two anti-corruption bureaus were among those that never made their way back to the rightful owners.Almost universally, however, wallets with more valuable contents were more likely to be returned. The only outliers were Peru and Mexico, although these results were not statistically significant.It might be assumed that the findings, published in the journal Science, point to heartening levels of altruism in society, but the economists were aware of a substantial body of previous work showing that while people do care about others, they generally care more about themselves.Instead, the researchers concluded, the main motivation was an aversion to viewing oneself as a thief. “People want to see themselves as an honest person, not as a thief. Keeping a found wallet means having to adapt one’s self-image, which comes with psychological costs,” said Michel Maréchal, a professor of economics at the University of Zurich and a co-author. “The psychological forces … can be stronger than the financial ones.”In surveys the researchers found that people said not reporting a wallet without money felt less like stealing and the failure to report felt increasingly like theft the more money it contained.Altruism played a secondary role, the study suggests. This was quantified by also handing out some wallets with a key, which is of value to the owner but not the finder. Wallets with keys were more likely to be returned. Switzerland was found to be the best place to lose a wallet containing a key but no money. “The effect not only contradicts rational economic thinking, it is rather surprising,” said Shaul Shalvi, an economist at the University of Amsterdam. “The results show just how prevalent civic honesty is, and they raise many questions, such as how environments can be designed to foster civic honesty.” ﻿"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64e30f789ae1dbf8d748a499ab0f92ab3a6a21c5/0_0_2496_1497/master/2496.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8675c215a1d46530c4cf697cf2aabbaf","title":"tell us about organisations deserving of a donation","story":"As Oxford University receives £150m donation from US billionaire we want to hear of causes or projects that you think are worthy of a large donation US billionaire Stephen Schwarzman is donating £150m to the University of Oxford, the biggest single direct donation received by the institute “since the Renaissance.” The money will reportedly go towards creating a single hub dedicated to the humanities, bringing together disciplines which Schwarzman described as ‘critical’ to education, yet often overlooked in favour of STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and maths).Alongside the Schwarzman Centre for the Humanities, an Institute for Ethics in Artificial Intelligence will be built to ensure that such powerful technologies are used ‘to the benefit of society’ not its detriment.Do you think the money could have been spent in other ways, such as scholarship and bursary schemes?

He smiled and joked with López. He nearly decapitated Cabal. And he competed as fiercely as he always has done. So he won, regardless, and, barring any mishaps in the next round, he will be fit to continue his return from hip surgery when he plays at Eastbourne next week with Marcelo Melo.The performance and the reaction were always going to be more important than the result – which went their way 7-6 (5), 6-3 in an hour and a quarter in front of a raucous early-evening crowd on Centre Court – and, on that count, Murray passed his own examination. There is no reason he should not play singles at the highest level again winning a title is the bigger challenge, and it is too early to make a call on that.Murray revealed afterwards he would play doubles at Wimbledon, which starts on 1 July, with the four-times slam champion Pierre-Hugues Herbert (who won and lost in US Open finals against Andy’s brother, Jamie, and Bruno Soares). He said he was keen to play mixed, adding with a smile: “I have spoken to a couple of players, but I’ve been rejected a couple of times so far.”As for the match, he said: “I learned quite a bit tonight. I expected to be the worst player on the court and to not feel particularly good on the court I was prepared to feel that way, which was probably the case in the first set. But I think I started to play better in the second and started to serve better, see the returns better. I have zero discomfort in my hip – like, nothing. If I had done this last year, I’d be here aching, throbbing, and feel bad the next day.“I’ll just keep pushing and see how it goes, but I feel optimistic about the future. I don’t know how long it will take to get to that level, but hopefully not too long.”Looking slim and fit a month after his 32nd birthday, Murray was sharp in his reactions, struck the ball cleanly – at times brilliantly – and, while it was hard to compare his movement on a doubles court to what he will need to find when playing singles, he travelled over the tricky grass with purpose and certainty. He served conservatively, mostly around 110mph, at the start until he warmed up to an impressive 129mph in the second set.López – who has had the added burden this week of denying involvement in an alleged betting scam at Wimbledon two years ago – could only grin sheepishly as they benefited from three net cords in the first-set tie-break, but Murray wrapped it up with a belting forehand winner, so there was the familiar quotient of drama and excitement.In the second set, Murray found two cracking returns down the line as they went 4-2 up, incurred a time violation and served them through a minor crisis. Farah held comfortably to keep his side in the tournament. However, behind López’s left-handed serve, Murray found a feathery tap down the empty line of exquisite precision as they brought their debut to a pleasing conclusion.It has been one crazy week at Queen’s, and day four was probably the craziest. Nicolas Mahut, the gentlest of gentlemen, hit a ballgirl in the face with a practice serve and made her cry. Stefanos Tsitsipas, who grew up on the hard courts of Greece, fell in love with the grass and the fans and then almost crashed out of the tournament. And poor Juan Martín del Potro announced he was going under the knife yet again, which might well end his career.The poignancy of Del Potro’s sympathy for Andy Murray’s struggle with recurring injury in an interview with the  last week hit home when the Argentinian with the long, loping stride and the kindly heart had to admit on Thursday he was losing his own fight against serial pain in his right kneecap. That originally was the result of a tumble in China last October, exacerbated here in the first round when he slipped on the grass while beating Denis Shapovalov.He has consulted surgeons in London and will have his umpteenth operation, “in the next couple of days”. The man who won his only slam 10 years ago in New York will have the good wishes of the tennis world with him.After the near-washout of Wednesday, the players shuttled back and fourth on all available courts. Tsitsipas embraced the grass, the tournament and the fans after beating the British No 1, Kyle Edmund, 6-3, 7-5 in an hour and 23 minutes.“I’m glad that I’ve come here as the No 1 seed and that people love me, people support me, despite not being British. The courts are great. The lawn is one of the most traditional, most well kept surfaces in tennis.”Edmund, meanwhile, heads for Eastbourne after his brief workout, relieved that his troublesome knee had not reacted badly to the switch from clay to grass.It seems wherever Mahut goes lately, there are children and tears at Roland Garros, the Frenchman’s seven-year-old son, Natanel, ran on to the court to console him after he’d lost to Leonardo Mayer, and they left, tearfully, to a standing ovation, with his conqueror applauding as they went. On Thursday, Mahut accidentally struck a ballgirl in the face with a practice serve during his match against Stan Wawrinka, and was admonished by the chair umpire. This time, the girl left the court in tears.Mahut, who was disconsolate, could at least take comfort in his 3-6, 7-5, 7-6 (2) win over Wawrinka to earn a third-round match against his compatriot, Gilles Simon, who beat the recovering Wimbledon finalist, Kevin Anderson, 6-1, 4-6, 6-4."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b89f1ed370b983df6a45f7c6f4a35e29782dd11a/0_182_3300_1980/master/3300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d5104a53abba260c71a47cc4a17b422f","title":"moeen ali 100 cap pressure england batsmen","story":"Moeen set to face Sri Lanka hoping none of England’s big-hitters better his ODI mark for a centuryMoeen Ali will win his 100th ODI cap in Friday’s World Cup group game against Sri Lanka, a deserved milestone for a player who made his debut in 2014 and has flourished to become an integral part of the squad.Recently turned 32, Moeen is among Eoin Morgan’s core of senior players and as an all-rounder, his cricketing value is obvious. But perhaps one of his most under-rated virtues is the sense of fun he brings to a dressing room that is trying to stay relaxed while the pressure to deliver increases.This certainly came to the fore when Moeen spoke at Headingley before the Sri Lanka match. A fair chunk of the talk still surrounded Morgan’s astonishing 17 sixes against Afghanistan. But Moeen, who swatted a nine-ball 31 at the end, could not resist a dig.“I think mine was probably the biggest the other day,” he smiled, in reference to the first of his four sixes which soared 93 metres over long-off and brought up Rashid Khan’s gallon on the day, and thus went a metre further than Morgan’s best.Moeen ranks his 53-ball century against West Indies at Bristol in 2017 – a day that would be overshadowed by events involving Ben Stokes and Alex Hales during in the hours that followed – as his ODI highlight. He also uses it as ammunition in a side that regularly produces such fireworks.He explained: “When players go past 53 balls then I can always say: ‘Yeah, it’s a great knock but still a bit slow for my liking.’ If someone was on 52 balls and needed six or less to get a hundred, I’m always hoping they don’t push me further down the list.“We’re just having a lot of fun and ripping each other all the time. We get stuck into everything – about the football, about Fifa – it is all part of team-bonding and very natural. We are a close team, we don’t have team dinners or stuff like that because every night guys are together naturally.“It is by far the best team I’ve ever played with, not just on the field but the environment. That is credit to the guys in charge.”Another example of this came at the back end of the Afghanistan game when Jonny Bairstow, who had dropped two catches, held one on the rope and turned to the crowd for a huge double fist-pump. The Yorkshireman can be prickly but his teammates were still quick to pounce with the mickey-taking.Moeen said: “Jonny gets stick no matter what he does. He gave it a bit too much with the celebration. You cannot get away with anything and I don’t miss a trick. I do not miss a thing.”All this may sound secondary but for Moeen it is hugely important. The team that reached the final of the World T20 in 2016, he said, never once let up on this front but by 2017, when the Champions Trophy came around, they tightened up before their disappointing semi-final defeat.“We probably took it a bit too seriously,” he said. “We have spoken about it and this time we want to stay true to ourselves even more as the pressure grows, both in the way we play and in the way we are as a team.“We actually need to have more of a laugh and enjoy it as much as we can. We are only going to do this once and it is a great opportunity to win the World Cup at home.”And the biggest six-hitter? “Jos Buttler. With ease. Some guys are brutal. Jonny Bairstow is brutal, but Jos is power with timing. Morgy does hit big sixes, Jason Roy is absolutely about power. But I think I’m the best out of all of them.”England have struck 47 sixes in five matches at this World Cup – they managed 15 in the 2015 campaign – and it is Roy, still out with a hamstring injury, whose 97-metre effort against Bangladesh flew the furthest.It is a good job they have a character such as Moeen in the ranks or the talk could go to their heads."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d6e949bd6a6dbe2fc0f1f9d6ad361e6fb1a0999/0_67_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=75deec9419acf39fc29fff72895db848","title":"talking horses watch me cause upset coronation stakes royal ascot horse racing tips","story":"The selection has a lot of speed and can be seen to better effect on this ground than when floundering in the French GuineasHermosa seeks to complete the GuineasIrish GuineasCoronation Stakes hat-trick that was achieved by her stablemate Winter just two years ago, and there is every reason to expect a big run from Aidan O’Brien’s likeable filly. But the opposition here looks a step up on what she has faced and the available odds take little account of that.Castle Lady, the unbeaten French Guineas winner, is a big danger while, at 16-1, there could be plenty of value in Watch Me (4.20) from the Francis Graffard yard that won Sunday’s French Oaks. Watch Me did not look comfortable on the heavy going and met trouble in running on the way to being sixth in the French Guineas, but she has a lot of speed and can be seen to better effect on this ground.2.30 Albany Stakes The well-related Nayibeth comes from the US with a big reputation but Wesley Ward’s juvenile winners here have been in shorter races and the rain hasn’t helped her. Daahyeh, from the stable that won this five years ago, impressed on her Newmarket debut, beating Raffle Prize, the Queen Mary winner on Wednesday.3.05 King Edward VII Stakes In just a few more strides, Japan would have won the Derby, so strong was he finishing. After a troubled preparation and a disappointing prep run, that was a terrific effort. O’Brien was under no pressure to bring him here with the Irish Derby on the horizon, so he is presumably confident the horse is ready to go again.3.40 Commonwealth Cup Ten Sovereigns’s Middle Park win is the best bit of form and he can be forgiven his non-staying effort in the Guineas but odds of 11-8 are very short about a horse that has not won since September.

A close second to Calyx here last year, he has some excellent six-furlong form and the blinkers could make a difference.5.00 Sandringham Stakes Having landed Thursday’s Britannia with Biometric, Ralph Beckett and Harry Bentley can team up for success in another straight-mile handicap with Desirous. She looked a likely improver when winning her handicap debut at Goodwood.5.35 Duke Of Edinburgh Stakes Having managed to crack a leg bone in victory here last year, Baghdad has made a full recovery and was really game at Newmarket last month.

Adam Silver, because he’s the boss, will take his leave and enjoy the second round as a mere spectator. As will we. That will end our liveblog for today, but here’s a complete list of all the first-round selections:Oh hey Kevin Porter Jr was the last remaining player that I had a blurb written about. This works out perfectly:Porter Jr should be one of the top picks in the draft, with a high three-point percentage. Unfortunately, he was suspended during his last semester with USC thanks to off-the-court behavior and has been stuck with the label of having “maturity issues.” In the right environment, he could be a steal in the draft or he could find his way out of the league.Never mind, the Cleveland Cavaliers have traded up for this pick. That’s a lot of second-rounders. Maybe this is the Bol Bol pick at last?The Detroit Pistons via the Milwaukee Bucks will wrap up a very chaotic first round with the 30th pick.Two more picks here in the first round. Up next is the Spurs, with a pick they received from the Toronto Raptors. They go with Keldon Johnson.Who’s been the biggest steal so far? Who’s the biggest blunder? I (obviously) really liked Brandon Clarke for the Grizzlies at 21. I was really confused with the Rui Hachimora pick for the Wizards. The Warriors pick Jordan Poole, welp my mock draft bracket is busted. Did anybody have him in the first round?The Nets have apparently gotten the 76ers first-round pick in 2020 and the No. 56 pick later tonight.Oh and the Golden State Warriors are on the clock.The Clippers go with Kabengele, who happens to be the nephew of Basketball Hall of Famer Dikembe Mutombo.The Brooklyn Nets fans are getting excited for their pick... it would be a shame if they traded it. Which they do, apparently, to the Los Angeles Clippers.The Celtics have apparently included the 24th pick in a deal that will send Aron Baynes to the Phoenix Suns in return for future draft considerations. The Celtics are obviously clearing cap space in order to make room for a potential big ticket free agent.The Cleveland Cavaliers have selected Dylan Windler out of Belmont with the 26nd pick in the draft. I was distracted because the Celtics have made yet another move…The Cleveland Cavaliers are up next with the 26nd pick, which they received from the Houston Rockets.Email from Thomas Ramsey:This seems like it’s gonna go forever. Also who do you reckon will have a great season who is a low prospect.It will go on forever, haha. Just a reminder that we’re only liveblogging the first round here, although I’ll be watching til the bitter end.As far as the players still available, if Kevin Porter Jr can avoid off-the-court controversy and Bol Bol’s game isn’t altered by his foot injury they are clearly the most talented players remaining. These are, of course, huge ifs.The Trail Blazers agree with me, apparently. Everybody had high hopes for Nassir coming into college but he showed them very Little in his one year with North Carolina. A late bloomer, who projects to be a 3-and-D kind of player, he’s had enough defensive and offensive hiccups to call that into question. Man does he look the part of a stud, however.Nassir Little has fallen so far. I’m not really sold on him, but at this point in THIS draft you figure somebody’s going to roll the dice.The Portland Trail Blazers are theoretically on the clock now if they also don’t trade down.JUST KIDDING. The Boston Celtics pick Ty Jerome based on the Philadelphia 76ers pick but they… have also traded this one down. This time to the Phoenix Suns, apparently.The Boston Celtics are on the clock yet again. This is feeling like Groundhog Day.That’s right “free agent.” Darius Bazley decided to skip college and just a spent a year training, something that makes him a gigantic question mark for teams since they haven’t seen him in a game in a season. The Utah Jazz have decided it’s worth the risk, an interesting player to keep a track of over the course of his career.If Kyrie Irving does indeed leave Boston, leaving the franchise a mess, this quote will win Williams plenty of love among fans.Okay, NOW the Thunder are on the clock.Lots of reports had the Celtics very high on Grant Williams, so this isn’t a surprise at all. He’s considered a great fit when it comes to modern NBA and has a quality basketball IQ. He doesn’t have the frame that teams tend to like, however, so he might be limited.The Boston Celtics are on the clock again. Maybe they take a flyer on Kevin Porter Jr here? Or do they trade down yet again? I am done guessing at this point.The Thunder pick Brandon Clarke, although they will trade him to the Memphis Grizzlies for the 23rd pick and a 2024 second rounder.The Gonzaga big man averaged 3.1 blocks per game last year which is utterly ridiculous. One of the most impressive defenders in the draft and he might be able to contribute on offense as well. No three-point shot to speak of, however, which is not great.The Oklahoma City Thunder are on the clock for their only pick of the evening.Oh that’s because he’s not going to the Celtics. The Celtics want to maximize their chances of coming up with a decent player in this weak draft by trading him to the Philadelphia 76ers for the 24th and 33rd picks.This is a very weird pick. Thybulle is a great defender but provides very little offense. I’m not sure what Danny Ainge is doing here, but he’ll have the 22nd pick here shortly as well so he’s not done.The Boston Celtics are on the clock now with their second of three first-round picks, this one courtesy of the Memphis Grizzlies. Maybe now Brandon Clarke?What a surprise, the Spurs have picked an international player that not many people had on their radar around this point. I would question it, but the Spurs are basically beyond questioning when it comes to drafting players from overseas.Twitter is saying that “Bol Bol is falling,” when around the 20s is actually starting to be around when teams were expected to start seriously considering him. He looks like he could be fantastic, but he’s a huge injury risk.The San Antoino Spurs are next on the clock and whoever they pick will almost certainly end up being great because that’s how it always goes for San Antonio.The Indiana Pacers select Goga Bitadze from Georgia. No, not the University, the actual country. Most mock drafts had him as the second foreign player to go in the draft and they were right, as he played last year for Buducnost. He also has the best name in the draft. I absolutely love this pick for the Pacers, and not just for the name or because I’m a sucker for international players.The Pelicans pick Nickeil Alexander-Walker who is probably NBA-ready, although he’ll never be an All-Star caliber player. He’s a solid combo guard who can do just about everything rather well.The Pelicans are now going to get the second pick that they got from the Hawks (via the Brooklyn Nets) earlier today. Got all of that? Good.Okeke took a heavy slide after his season ended with an ACL tear. The Magic are making a huge risk-reward gamble here, but hey this is the point in the draft where you start to make those bets.It’s been a rough week for Celtics fans and, unsurprisingly, New York is not entirely sympathetic.Oh and the Orlando Magic are on the clock now. The Pistons choose Duomboya, which means I finally get to use my final pre-written spiel.The best foreign player in the mix, the 18-year-old Doumboya currently plays for Limoges CSP. He’s very young, obviously, and would need some time to adjust not only to the NBA but to a new country, but he’s already shown some defensive flexibility. He can turn over the ball quite a bit and is mistake-prone, but he may be the first player to benefit from how Toronto’s Pascal Siakam opened up the NBA’s eyes last year.We’re officially out of the lottery! The Detroit Pistons are here with the 15th pick.The Celtics select Romeo Langford who, despite the fact that I spent literally the last few weeks just focused on the Celtics’ drafting, I know nothing about. He didn’t show up in any pre-draft workouts due to injury, which is not a great sign. Considering that Kyrie Irving is probably gone, they did need a guard. The Miami Heat pick Tyler Herror. Something of a reach, I could have seen Herro easily falling out of the lottery. He’s a quality shooter though and that’s a trait that’s always in high demand. Quality last name too.The Miami Heat are on the clock now. The Celtics fan in me is screaming anybody but Clarke right now.And whither France’s Sekou Doumboya, who I had going in the Top 10? The Hornets take P.J. Washington who improved dramatically during his sophomore year but really might not have the upside or skill to be anything other than a solid role-player. Maybe not a bust, but perhaps not a guy either.That sounds very Hornets.Charlotte Hornets are on the clock with the number 12 pick. We’re officially in on man’s land here as far I’m concerned. Maybe Gonzaga’s Brandon Clarke, just to annoy the Boston Celtics who are probably now hoping he falls to them at No. 14?The Suns will be receiving, via Minnesota, Cam Jordan at number 11. I also did not have him this high. I guess we’re having a run on Cams here. He’s apparently impressed teams with his shooting, including from long distance. The Timberwolves will now be picking for the Suns for the 11th pick of the draft. Yes I know this gets a little convoluted. The Hawks go with Cam Reddish and number 10. It might be an interesting pick but it might depend on how hard Reddish works to become the best version of himself.Reddish had a disappointing Duke career, particularly when compared to Williamson and Barrett, his field goal shooting was particularly poor, and has been labeled something of a slow learner. Still, there’s plenty of talent here, he has all the traits to be a difference-making scorer. He’s 6’8” with a 7’0” wing and if he can learn to harness that at the NBA level he’s going to make the teams that have passed up on him regret it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e4e92eea9749a87aa56e81ae4dd13c751f417a6b/0_229_6232_3741/master/6232.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6371fcf6f6596a5dead790267c11456d","title":"facebook libra cryptocurrency astrology prediction","story":"With Mars in the 12th house at the time of the announcement, the new cryptocurrency should ultimately succeedWhen Facebook announced its cryptocurrency Libra, which shares its title with an astrological sign for people born approximately between 23 September and 23 October, people had a lot of questions.Will this upend the traditional banking system? Is Facebook going to sell my financial data to advertisers? And most importantly, what does an astrology-adjacent cryptocurrency name mean for us all?Facebook says it chose the name Libra based on the Roman form of currency the Libra and for the balance and unity represented by the scales, the symbol of the sign. Many Libras were upset about having their sign co-opted by one of the largest companies in the world.And some astrology fans questioned why a company would name a cryptocurrency after a sign with a reputation of being chronically flaky, unstable, and bad with money. (Source: this writer is a Libra.) So what is in the stars for Libra’s future success? It’s hard to say, said Henry Weingarten, a consultant at the Astrologers Fund, Inc, a company that makes investing recommendations based on market data, behavioral economics and astrology. Astrology readings for cryptocurrencies must be made for the first transaction, not the release of the report describing it.“My reading is skeptical because this is a chart based on conception, not on birth,” he said. “But the reading shows they are promising a lot more than they can deliver.”Raj Chadha, a self-described “stock astrologer”, did a reading of Libra’s conception chart and said his findings show the coin will face criticism and opposition from government and financial institutions, but ultimately succeed.His reasoning? Libra’s chart showed Mars was in the 12th house when the currency was announced. Meanwhile the Sun was in the 11th house, the house of success and support from friends, and Jupiter was in the fifth house – the house that stands for speculation and the stock market.“Based on the astrology chart made for this time and place, it is my opinion that Libra will face a lot of criticism and opposition from government and financial institutions, but it will come to exist,” he said. “I cannot say that it will thrive or shine or outclass other cryptocurrencies, but it will have its desired place in the financial system.”Indeed, Facebook is already facing backlash: shortly after Facebook’s announcement, the chair of the House financial services committee, Maxine Waters, called on the company to put a stop to the project until Congress and regulators could review it. She also called on company executives to testify before the committee.Facebook has agreed to answer questions from Waters, and said it will continue to work with legislators on the launch of Libra, which is set to roll out to the public in 2020.Although it is difficult to create an accurate reading for Libra ahead of its official launch, the stars are aligned for growth in the world of cryptocurrency in general, David Crook, a San Francisco-based astrologer, said.“The planet of Uranus, which is the planet of awakening and revolution and new inventions, is in Taurus, the sign associated with wealth,” he said. “This could birth changes and rise of new technology, like cryptocurrency.”Crook studies “mundane astrology”, an ancient kind of astrology used as early as the ninth century by kings and other world leaders to predict events and interpret world affairs. He has examined Donald Trump’s chart extensively and believes, based on upcoming transits, an impeachment may be on the horizon. His work also guides him in creating timelines for world events such as wars, elections and the climate crisis. But he is quick to say the stars can’t tell us for sure what will happen in the future, including to Facebook and its new project.“Astrology is a way of interpreting the world, it is not totally predetermined and etched in stone,” he said. “In many ways, it’s a recognition of what you already know.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b9d1e070160b7b7d1c11eafbd699174dda12960/0_307_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0af9e3eaf543fcf15830435388871667","title":"5g finally launches in the uk but is it really worth it","story":"We spent two weeks with a 5G phone to find out if it really lives up to the hypeThe future of mobile phones is finally here. You can go out and buy a 5G phone, and if you happen to be in one of the six cities across the UK in which EE’s 5G network is up and running, you can get the blistering mobile broadband speeds we’ve been promised will revolutionise our mobile lives, again. But should you?I’ve spent the past two weeks equipped with the OnePlus 7 Pro 5G on first-out-of-the-gate EE’s 5G network. I streamed 2K HDR movies, downloaded whole albums in seconds and generally used it like I would on my extremely fast 350Mbps home wifi – data caps be damned.So what is 5G like, and is it worth buying into? The answer to both those questions is … complicated.Is 5G faster than 4G? Absolutely. Day to day in the most congested parts of London, it was at least double the speed of EE’s 4G, sometimes up to 10 times faster.That meant speeds varied wildly as I trundled through patches of 5G on the train. At Elephant and Castle in the morning rush hour I got full 5G signal, but only speeds of about 3Mbps – still double the 1.5Mbps 4G could produce at the same time.A few hundred metres down the tracks stuck outside Blackfriars, speeds in excess of 120Mbps were routine, with 4G capping out at less than 30Mbps. A similar experience was had outside Victoria and several other central London stations.On foot in 5G areas such as St Paul’s or Covent Garden, it was clear that speeds were much more transformative. On-the-street speeds of 200-300Mbps were the norm in the lunchtime rush, with peaks of 500Mbps or more at less congested times, which is genuinely faster than my home broadband.The speed can be blistering, with full movies downloading from Netflix in seconds. But what is noticeable is how that speed is delivered. It’s rapid: click the button and something happens instantaneously.It’s a bit like driving a high performance car. More or less any car can hit 60mph, but a Tesla Model S can do so in 2.4 seconds. You’re not driving any faster, but it is so much more instantaneous it feels faster. 5G inherently feels faster because everything happens so much quicker, even if the data actually downloads at the same speed.The other advantage of 5G right now is that you remove the effects of congestion. We’ve all been there: sitting on that packed commuter train or bus with full 4G signal but nothing happening when you tap that link apart from your phone getting hot.Even at this early stage 5G cures that problem, meaning you can do what you want, when you want, even if that means streaming the TV show What We Do In the Shadows on the morning commute.It is very early days for 5G in the UK, but it still feels like we’re more prepared for 5G than we were for the similar transition to 4G and 3G before that.For one, we have compelling handsets that behave exactly the same as their 4G counterparts. Not some bulky, crippled phone that suffers because of the addition of 5G.The OnePlus 7 Pro 5G, for instance, has the same thickness, weight and even battery life as the excellent 4G version. The only difference, as far as the consumer is concerned, is that it can connect to a 5G network when there’s one active and it only supports a single sim.EE too appears more prepared with wider 5G coverage than you might expect. I was surprised to find it in Denmark Hill in London’s zone two, for instance, and every day there appeared to be additional patches where the little 5G symbol began to appear in the suburbs of London. It’s not exactly blanket coverage in the six cities in which it is active and it’s mostly available outdoors, but it’s a good start.Of course, you still have internet when you’re not on 5G, as you simply swap between 4G and 5G. And sometimes that means it can be hard to tell if you’re on the faster network as the 5G symbol disappears when you start to download a track or watch a video.These are the pains of an early adopter. Which is exactly what you are if you buy into 5G right now. But apart from the added expense – which is about £5 a month on EE – you’re not getting a worse phone experience. The traditional first-generation pains of poor battery life and excessive heat have been at least partially mitigated.In the near future buying a 5G-capable phone will be recommended, simply because we’re keeping our handsets for longer. You may not see the immediate benefits of 5G today, but you will in your second, third or fourth year with your phone. Future-proofing is always a guessing game, but a 4G phone in 2022 might look like a new Nokia 3310 now. Delightfully retro. Decidedly quaint.So should you get 5G now? If you’re in the process of upgrading, have the money to burn, live in an area with at least limited 5G coverage and were already looking at high-end phones such as the OnePlus 7 Pro, there’s no real downside.There are a few things of which to be aware. First, if you want a small phone you’re out of luck, as all 5G phones have massive screens right now. Secondly, you will likely need more data allowance than you think you do. When it flows this quickly you end up using more of it. Thirdly, uploads of things such as photos and videos still use the 4G network, as do calls and other non-download related activities.And lastly, by next year the second generation of 5G phones will launch, potentially offering better performance, longer battery life and smaller sizes.EE is the only game in town right now, but Vodafone will launch its 5G offerings on 3 July with Three launching 5G mobile broadband in London in August and O2 by the end of 2019."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a367e6a64395b1dd39af9a5a84e822f2f10f753/306_670_3666_2199/master/3666.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f79a92e200a325568a38ff548c85ed63","title":"wheres the cheapest place to store 500gb of data online","story":"Reeling from a Dropbox price hike, Kate wants somewhere cheaper to store her 500GB of photos and filesI’ve just received notification that my Dropbox account is going up in price to more than £90 a year. I like Dropbox’s interface and ease of use from the mobile app, but £90 seems steep for what I require. What cheaper options do I have for securely storing about 500GB of photos and files? KateMost of us just evolve the way we do things by making convenient short-term decisions. A price jolt should prompt you to rethink how you are storing your data, where you are storing it, and why. Different people have different devices and different needs, so I can’t pick the best strategy for you or anybody else. However, I can give you a few things the think about.The first and best reason is that you often need access to the same data from multiple devices, some of which you use while away from home. The second – very sensible – reason might be that you want an off-site backup where your data will be safe if you’re burgled, your house burns down, or there is some other catastrophe.A third reason might be that you are sharing your photos and (less likely) data with friends and family, or possibly with the public. Millions of people shared their photos on Flickr, and billions share reduced-quality versions on social networking services such as Facebook and Instagram.A fourth reason might be that you have no way to keep a local backup. If so, you are in trouble. Online storage services are like lobster pots: it’s easy to get into them but hard to get out.In a better world, you would be able to move 500GB of data from one service to any other in a few seconds, without downloading it and re-uploading it. Sadly, that’s not the case today. And if your data only exists in one online storage pot, then you have no backup and your data is at risk. People lose data every day because they forget and can’t recover passwords, their accounts are hacked, or their service provider has a hardware malfunction or makes a mistake.You should have local copies and backups of everything, so that you can walk away and just let Dropbox close your account. If you are not in that position, keep paying Dropbox until you are.Dropbox has increased its starting price to £95.88 a year, which is £7.99 a month if paid annually. However, it also doubled the storage allowance to 2TB, which used to cost about $200 (£158) a year, and it has added some extra features. It’s still competitive with other leading services that usually don’t store 30 days of revisions or let you easily undo a file deletion.Google One, as it’s now called, charges £7.99 a month for 2TB, which drops to an annual fee of £79.99 a year. At that price, I’d stay with Dropbox. It’s better.At the moment, your best bet appears to be Switzerland-based pCloud, which offers 500GB for £3.59 a month or £42.99 a year, and 2TB for £7.99 a month or £84.99 a year. Better still, pCloud is currently offering a lifetime 500GB for a single payment of £160 (usually £430) or 2TB for £320 (usually £850). I’ve not used the service, but you could try its free 10GB offering and see if it suits you.Think about splitting your photo storage and your data storage. If you are like me, you have large image files – each jpeg from my Nikon D7500 takes up about 12MB – and relatively small text files. My Work folder holds more than 10,000 files but still consumes less than 3GB. I could zip it, password protect it and store it in any of the free online drives, except Dropbox.Flickr used to be a great place to store 1TB of images for free, but late last year, Verizon sold it to Smugmug. Smugmug charges $5.99 a month or $48 a year for unlimited photo storage. That’s not a bad deal for a service that works really well with photographs.Both Amazon and Google also offer unlimited photo storage, with slight catches.Amazon Photos is free with an Amazon Prime account, and part of its appeal is that it will accept and display RAW files, not just jpegs. And while it can analyse and tag your photos for search purposes, that’s optional.Google Photos, born out of the wreck that was Google Plus, offers unlimited storage as long as your photos are less than 16MP. This makes it useless for most serious photographers, at least as a backup service. Google also uses machine learning to analyse your photos so that you can search for people, places and things. Search is a useful feature, but photos give away vast amounts of personal information.If you use an Android phone, your snaps are stored in Google Photos, and you can choose to clear local copies from your phone to save space and pull them down from the cloud on demand – internet connection required. Amazon Photos can do something similar.Test any photo storage site before you commit to using it. Upload a couple of photos and then download them to make sure they still have the same dimensions in pixels, that the files are the same size, and that they have the same names. This rules out Facebook, Instagram, Imgur and many other services.Online storage sites are really handy for storing smartphone pictures until you can download and archive them, and for sharing photos with other people. However, SD cards are getting so much bigger and cheaper that they’re an increasingly attractive alternative.All my photos are on three hard drives (each PC is backed up to a 2TB or 3TB drive, and the backups are backed up to an 8TB drive), but SD cards make it easy to create an off-site backup.Also, if you have a laptop with a card slot, you can hide as much data as you’re likely to need while travelling somewhere about your person. Micro-SD cards are tiny. The obvious drawback is that, unless you encrypt the data, they are not secure if you lose them.Have you got a question?

The Association of Independent Festivals (AIF) launched the Take Your Tent Home – Say No To Single Use campaign earlier this year, which followed the Drastic on Plastic initiative in 2018. As with other campaigns, such as Eco Action’s Love Your Tent and its #justtakeithome message, the aim is to reduce waste and remind festivalgoers that a tent is for life, not just for a weekend.A cheaper and greener alternative to buying a tent is to borrow one. Peer-to-peer lending sites, such as Fat Llama, include listings for a variety of camping equipment – currently there are four-person tents from £2 a day. Alternatively, give a new home to a discounted display or refurbished tent from Vango’s Camping Recycled site.Down-filled products have long been rejected by ethically minded consumers. Although there are responsible down standards among some outdoor clothing and equipment brands, these vary between manufacturers, and there are still concerns about cruelty taking place. It is often difficult to tell whether down has come from a live-plucked bird or one force-fed for foie gras.Natural rubber seems like an obvious alternative to PVC or plastic-based wellington boots. Rubber wellies are more durable and when they are eventually discarded, they won’t be toxic when they decompose. However, it’s best to find out whether the material comes from sustainable sources or not before buying.This sparkly stuff may seem joyful and innocent but most of it contains microplastics that will eventually end up in waterways and oceans. Along with banning single-use plastics, such as straws, many festivals are now asking onsite stalls to only sell biodegradable glitter. In March this year, campaign group 38 Degrees launched a petition calling for the ban of conventional plastic glitter in the UK, and several retailers, including Aldi and Waitrose, have committed to scrapping it from products by 2020.There are several companies selling biodegradable glitter, in a range of colours, blends and particle sizes. These are all made using Bioglitter, created from plant cellulose, sourced mainly from sustainably-farmed eucalyptus trees. Eco Glitter Fun (from £4 for single tins of loose glitter and £22 for a set of six) and EcoStardust (from £6 a bag)also use recyclable packaging and support environmental projects through donations. The latter also sells an all-natural vegan balm (£6) to use as a base for the glitter.

Is there anything about the current socio-political landscape that might make resonant a televisual take on the spikily satirical novel whose title is synonymous with absurd, contradictory choices forced upon people by institutions that seem to have taken leave of their senses? I just don’t know.Here we are, anyway, with Hulu’s original six-part series, executive produced and part-directed by George Clooney who also plays the volatile General Scheisskopf, now presented for our viewing pleasureas another shove towards the cliff edge of despair. Think of it as a bitter Biloxi Blues, or a torqued M*A*S*H and you won’t go far wrong.Our first sight of John Yossarian (YoYo), whose ability to see through the farcical nature of the military and attempts to avoid the potential tragedy of its outcome form the spine of the book and series, is of him emerging naked and bloodied out of a riot of flames and smoke and roaring at the sky. Then we flash back two years to his training as part of a bomber crew – he chose it because it was the longest and he hoped the war would be over before he had to fly – at the Santa Ana airbase. This mostly involves being yelled at in increasingly convoluted fashion by Gen Scheisskopf and being put on punishment detail whenever his friend Clevinger can’t resist answering Scheisskopf’s spittle-flecked questions. “It’s rhetorical!” YoYo murmurs desperately out of the side of his mouth as his eager compatriot throws up a hand to explain why the platoon is so bad at drill. Not that YoYo’s own decision to drill the general’s wife appears particularly politic, but war is hell and you take your pleasures where you can.His repeated attempts to swing the lead are defeated by Doc Daneeka (Grant Heslov, who also directs some episodes) who tried to certify himself 4F (not fit for service) “You’d think my word would be enough, but no! They send some guy from the draft board to look me over … It’s really a terrible thing when the word of a licensed small town medical practitioner is questioned by the country he loves”.It is Daneeka who explains the eponymous catch to YoYo anyone who has the sense to try and get out of flying combat missions is by definition sane and must fly. Anyone who wants to shouldn’t be flying, but they have to ask for exemption and won’t. And if they did, they would be considered sane enough to…you get the picture. “That’s some catch, that catch-22,” says YoYo. “It’s the best there is,” the good doctor replies.Things worsen when, after YoYo being shipped out to Italy and flying nine of his 25 required missions, new commanding officer Colonel Cathcart (a terrifying, rollicking turn from Kyle Chandler) keeps increasing the quota. His military fervour is untrammelled by the apathetic Major de Coverley (our very own Hugh Laurie, free to let his bald spot show now that he no longer has to play oblique sex symbol Dr Gregory House), who rouses himself from torpor only when an entrepreneurial mess officer brings him toothsome supplements to his army rations. Men are ceaselessly themselves, is the message: lazy, venal, inoffensive, hustling, passive and all points in between. There is nothing ennobling about war.It looks great – the arid palette relived occasionally by the blue of the Italian coast as the men swim between raids – and the cast is top flight. Clooney got the project greenlit (and then co-directed) but is slightly miscast in his role – too inescapably intelligent and twinkly-keen-eyed to convince as a military moron – but it’s far from a main part and he gets away with it. The rest – especially Christopher Abbott as YoYo, whose natural intensity works perfectly with the grain of an endlessly frustrated character congenitally incapable of giving himself up to become an anonymous cog in a larger machine – are brilliant.The only potential problem, beyond whether it actually has anything new to tell us about our predicament rather than simply resonating with it, is Catch-22’s own catch-22 – how to keep up the pace and energy of an essentially nihilistic drama a study in the meaningless and futility of war and, ultimately, life? The detail and stylistic verve that keep you going through the book are quickly eaten or flattened by television. But we can hope for the best while we prepare for the worst. We are, after all, getting quite good at that."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f05994d22549832cd56b4adf71b414529dd65f7/0_88_4096_2458/master/4096.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=57546092dbcfe8559a4d3eb500a7067f","title":"brexitcast makes the move to tv podcasts of the week","story":"The BBC’s popular politics pod will replace Andrew Neil’s This Week.

Gwilym Mumford“I’m back, baby!” Malcolm Gladwell returns with a new season of his popular podcast reinterpreting events from the past. In the opening episode, he’s taking a law school admissions test to see if he can beat his assistant’s score. With anxiety nightmares kicking in, he’ll need more than a clear plastic bag full of trail mix to get through it. Gladwell sounds like he’s messing about, but can’t hide his massive intelligence.

Even the trailer sets up the doom nicely, via a vignette about a teenager breaking off her engagement with a Vietnam vet who throws the ring away in a rage. Over the first few episodes, what starts out as the case of a 70s-style peeping tom or cat burglar soon takes a sinister turn and the crimes start to pile up. It’s properly chilling. HVAs the Tory leadership campaign heats up enough to make Rory Stewart remove his tie, Britain’s exit from the EU continues to play a starring role. But being front and centre doesn’t seem to be bringing any more clarity. Some of the contenders claim, despite the EU saying otherwise, that they can bring back a new deal. Whilst others believe they can push through May’s thrice-failed offering. All of which sounds very machismo. But is there any chance at all that whoever succeeds May will be able to actually deliver Brexit? And if so - what will that look like?

During the past four years, the founder of Maple \u0026amp Co has used this virtue to open four healthy eating restaurants in London and plan the launch of another two for the end of the year.In between running her business, the Le Cordon Bleu-trained chef is a regular on TV cooking show Sunday Brunch, writes for health magazines, and mentors aspiring entrepreneurs. She manages her packed schedule by embracing the best of both new and old tech to maximise her efficiency. And her early morning starts, a focus on team management and her embrace of nifty productivity systems means there are still enough hours in the day for her to enjoy life beyond work – and even spend a bit of time in the kitchen with her first love: food.I normally wake up earlier on Monday mornings – around 4.30am. The rest of the week it’s usually around 5.30am. If I don’t set my week on Monday morning the rest of the week starts falling behind. I can’t work at night so early in the morning I find time to get organised for the day, get my thoughts sorted and understand my own priorities.I have a written to-do list. I know a lot of people on my team use the Sticky Notes function on their laptops so they always have it on their devices. I like having my quiet time in the mornings, if I’m having a cup of tea I don’t really want to get overwhelmed by my phone or laptop. I have my notebook instead and I can think without any distraction about what I need to get done for the day.I usually eat breakfast with my daughter after she wakes up. My mornings are spent with her until her nanny arrives at 10am. I try to squeeze in a quick one-hour workout either with my trainer, or on my Peloton bike – which lives in my room and is a constant reminder for me to work out.I calendarise everything. If I need an hour to check emails, I put it in the calendar, if I need half an hour for a call, I put that in my calendar. If my nanny is off for four hours or my husband needs to travel, that goes in as well. My staff also do it so I don’t bother them when their time is blocked off. I mix all my social plans and work into one big calendar, it’s a tool I find really, really important.Most days I have meetings here and there, but one day a week is dedicated to team meetings. I have about 30 people on my team and we all have one-to-one meetings with our direct reports. Throughout the week we use collaborative online docs to jot down any issues that come up that we want to discuss, for example, if I want to make changes to pricing. It means the team isn’t calling each other every time something happens at a store.It also means less time organising, updating and checking actionable points and more time to think strategically about the business. And it’s much more reliable to have things recorded on a page, as there’s a much lower risk of miscommunication.As a business we probably spend a disproportionate amount of time on good HR practices. It’s so important to have the right team supporting me. To make sure everyone is at their most productive, we ensure everyone’s job description is shared. So anyone from the kitchen porter to the head of operations has my job description and vice versa.I love leaving voice messages for the team on WhatsApp. I started doing this because some investors I work with are based abroad and calling long distance over the time zone differences is not so easy. Now, we all do it. For example, if my head chef goes to see some new central kitchens, he records photos, videos and two-minute voicemails that he sends over instead of writing everything down in an email. This simple technology really makes it much more efficient to communicate and share ideas.I take part in a mentorship program called Mentor Matcher. I take on up to two interns at a time and they come in at least three times a week. I come from a spreadsheet and PowerPoint background so they’re always showing me new and interesting tools. One of them introduced me to Canva for design – it is like Photoshop but online-based and much simpler to use. This reduces the time spent sharing files back and forth.I miss cooking a lot. I have a wonderful head chef who takes care of the day-to-day menus in stores. I don’t get to do as much physical cooking, but I do get to do some recipe testing. Right now, I’m working on a porridge recipe with a magazine and researching vegetable-based recipes for a show I’m presenting.I love having a glass of wine to wind down in the evening. Even though we do nutritious food at Maple and I teach and talk about all things healthy and amazing for your body, I find having a glass of wine really relaxing.I find my brain stops working around 8.30pm. I try to get home around 7pm and see my daughter before she goes to bed. I love to cook dinner at home and watch cooking shows or sitcoms on Netflix. The last thing I do is have a hot shower. I find it super relaxing and it’s one of my favourite things to do at night.SAP Concur provides intelligent solutions to help your business automate admin tasks such as expenses and invoices – giving you and your business the time and energy to focus on growing, innovating and making fruitful connections.

We will be a time-free zone where everyone can live their lives to the fullest … Our goal is to provide full flexibility, 247. If you want to cut the lawn at 4am, then you can do it.”The islanders, whose main sources of income are tourism and fishing, are calling for formal opening hours to be abolished and people to be allowed to “do what we want, when we want” – although children will still have to go to school, Hveding said.Sommarøy spends November to January in darkness, but in summer residents know that when the sun rises on 18 May, it will not set again until 26 July.“It’s constant daylight,” Hveding said on the campaign’s Facebook page. “If you want to paint your house at 2am, it’s OK. It we want to take a swim at 4am, we will.”The residents added: “Here we enjoy every minute of the midnight sun, and yes, a coffee with friends on the beach at 2am is a normal thing.”Tourism officials told NRK they suspected the campaign was mainly a clever ploy to attract more summer visitors, but a philosophy professor has hailed it as an intriguing idea.“It’s a fascinating concept,” said Truls Egil Wyller of the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim. Society had been ruled by the clock “and so disciplined in a very special way” only for the past two centuries, he said.“Before that, you worked mostly as long as it was necessary, you ate food when you were hungry and you lay down when you were tired. In modern society, everything we do is controlled by the pace of the clock, from the moment we get up.”He said though that residents of Sommarøy would not find life without time particularly easy. “I’m not going to say it’s impossible to pull a whole island out of the global clock,” he told the broadcaster. “But it does sounds very difficult.”After a public meeting in May, the islanders last week handed the local MP, Kent Gudmundsen, a petition calling for the scheme to be debated in parliament. He told the iTromsø newspaper it sounded exciting and suggested it could be considered as a third option alongside summer and winter time.Visitors to Sommarøy have reportedly embraced the idea enthusiastically, with some abandoning their watches and attaching them to a bridge leading to the island.But not all residents are so sure. “I can foresee challenges with some guests when it comes to checking in and checking out, and the opening hours of the bar and restaurant,” said Malin Nordheim, a receptionist at the Sommarøy Arctic hotel. “I’m a little sceptical.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e975d3b4de20960d6d83e0b795571e56cbe0a421/0_187_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3e8ca67cbe44ad2a7b9de1acb8e4f1e4","title":"italy church singles matchmaking event padua st anthonys basilica","story":"Friars at St Anthony’s basilica in Padua hope saint can help hundreds of people find loveFriars at one of Italy’s most revered and beautiful churches are endeavouring to play cupid to hundreds of single people due to converge on the building in search of a soulmate.The friars at St Anthony’s basilica in the northern Italian city of Padua have organised a festival inspired by the tradition among the faithful in the saint’s homeland of Portugal, as well as Latin America, who invoke his intercession to help them find a life partner.People turn to Saint Anthony to retrieve either lost items, stolen goods or people, but also when in search of love.The event on Saturday – called Saint Anthony, matchmaker – is open to singles aged between 20 and 50 and will begin in the afternoon with a meeting to allow people to get to know each other. A mass will follow, during which the participants will say a prayer called If you look for miracles. A party labelled Love is all around will take place in the evening.Two hundred people had already registered online for the festival within hours of it being officially announced on Wednesday.Fr Oliviero Svanera, the rector of the basilica, said: “I’m a little worried there won’t be enough room.”This is the second time the friars have organised the event. Although the 2018 edition was more low profile, it brought together two couples. “So Saint Anthony has already played his part,” Svanera said.The idea came about after Svanera and his fellow friars noticed a growing number of people who had yet to find a partner.“Especially in the 35-40 age group,” he said. “There are people who are single by choice and who are happy, but there are others who feel the loneliness and would like to meet someone to construct a life with.”Svanera added that other commitments often stop people finding a relationship. “Especially in Italy, where it takes people a long time to settle – they feel they have to get a degree and a job before they can do that,” he said.The festival, however, is not just about finding love. “It’s about socialising and making friends,” Svanera said. “And yes, with the hope that Saint Anthony intervenes.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f9f6c8fad738da98283ba84fbd8f3eb5fef211c/313_153_1467_880/master/1467.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f753f9e5b63cf4d14df34789f9b1058c","title":"north korea rolls out red carpet for xi jinping in pictures","story":"Xi Jinping is greeted warmly in North Korea on his first state visit there as China’s president.

Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillThe Government is to hold “town hall” meetings throughout the country on its climate action plan in an effort to encourage communities to buy into its ambitious but difficult targets. Minister for Climate Action Richard Bruton will host the first meeting in Cork on Friday, along with Tánaiste Simon Coveney.The meetings are part of a concerted effort by the Government to begin work immediately on meeting the onerous targets on greenhouse emissions reductions set for 2030 and 2050. The number of electric vehicles (EVs) in Ireland, now in the low thousands, would need to increase by an average of 100,000 annually over the next decade to reach the plan’s target of almost one million EVs by 2030. Similarly, some 50,000 homes will need to undergo deep retrofits each year to meet the the plan’s targets. The plan also includes a ban on oil-fired boilers in new homes from 2022, and for gas boilers by 2025 and the phasing out of coal and peat-fired electricity generation, among 180 other measures.“Every generation wants to leave the world in a better place than they found it for their children,” Mr Bruton said. “We have a short window of opportunity to act. We must act now and leave a better, healthier, more sustainable Ireland for future generations. This plan provides our way forward.”Mr Bruton has said he will set out his approach to climate action at the Cork meeting and will also be receptive to views and opinions from those in attendance. Extreme weatherHe said that Cork has seen first hand how rising greenhouse gas emissions have negatively affected daily lives. “In recent years extreme weather events such as the recent flooding devastated large parts of Cork city and county, destroying homes, businesses and important infrastructure,” the Minister said. “The farming community of rural Cork have also experienced fodder shortages as a result of further extreme weather conditions of drought and heavy snow in recent years.”One of the major actions for agriculture is a commitment to plant 8,000 hectares (19,768 acres) of new forest each year. However, the report acknowledges the lack of enthusiasm among the farming community for forestry. A key part of the plan will be to persuade farmers to designate some of their holdings for tree-planting in the future. Mr Coveney said that as Minister for Foreign Affairs he wanted to make sure that responding to climate change was at the heart of the State’s development aid programme across the world. He said Ireland wanted to help those most impacted by climate change and assist vulnerable small islands.

Photograph: Douglas HealeyProperty developer Sean Dunne offered former taoiseach Bertie Ahern a €1 million commission in 2010 if he helped him find a Chinese buyer for his hotel in South Africa. The Co Carlow developer made the offer to Mr Ahern in an email that emerged in the recent US court case taken by Mr Dunne’s bankruptcy trustee against the developer and his wife, Gayle Killilea. The bankrupt businessman told Mr Ahern, then still a Dublin TD, that he would pay him a 2-3 per cent commission on the sale of the Lagoon Beach Hotel in Cape Town, which he valued at about €33 million.He was seeking a buyer for the hotel after he fell into financial difficulty following the property crash. Mr Ahern told The , through a spokeswoman, that he did not contact anyone in China about selling a hotel for Mr Dunne on the back of his email, “nor would he have those contacts in China”.Mr Ahern is a regular visitor to China, where he attends annual conferences since he stood down as taoiseach in 2008.Long-standing relationshipMr Dunne had earlier, in a March 2010 email, raised the possibility of one of his executives accompanying Mr Ahern, who has a long-standing relationship with the developer, on a trip to China to find a buyer for the hotel.In the later email, dated April 15th, 2010 – sent after a meeting between the men – Mr Dunne identified three wealthy Chinese businessmen involved in property as “key people in China” that “we should concentrate on”. He attached a brochure of the hotel in his email to Mr Ahern, which he said was “a good document to forward to anybody you wish to discuss the project with”.Irish bankruptcyThe hotel was never sold and is the subject of an ongoing Irish court case taken by the official assignee handling Mr Dunne’s Irish bankruptcy over his alleged fraudulent transfer of assets to Ms Killilea. A jury awarded €18 million to Mr Dunne’s US bankruptcy trustee after finding against the developer and Ms Killilea over the illegal transfer of some assets to put them beyond the reach of creditors. The March email was entered in the case but the judge disallowed the “€1 million commission” email following objections from Ms Killilea’s lawyer.

Photograph: Olivier MatthysEPAEU leaders last night put themselves on a collision course with the next British prime minister, insisting there would be no changes to the backstop or the withdrawal agreement, while Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said the EU had run out of patience with the UK.Mr Varadkar also said there would be no further extension of the Brexit deadline without an election or a second referendum in the UK.With both Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt, the two remaining candidates for the Tory leadership after yesterday’s votes, claiming that new arrangements to leave the EU by agreement can be concluded before October 31st, EU leaders made clear that no such renegotiation is possible.Mr Johnson and Mr Hunt will face Conservative activists in 16 hustings around the country before the party’s 160,000 members choose Britain’s next prime minister.Mr Johnson won the support of 160 MPs, more than half the total, with Mr Hunt on 77 and Michael Gove on 75. An earlier ballot on Thursday saw home secretary Sajid Javid eliminated. Mr Johnson’s supporters denied they had lent votes to Mr Hunt to push Mr Gove out of the race in the final ballot.Amid signs of hardening attitudes in Brussels, Mr Varadkar said many EU leaders had “lost patience quite frankly with the UK”. He added there was “enormous hostility” to any further extension of the Brexit deadline.Directly dismissing suggestions from Mr Johnson that the UK could work out a trade deal with the UK during an implementation period after a no-deal Brexit, Mr Varadkar said bluntly: “There is no withdrawal agreement without a backstop and there is no implementation period without a withdrawal agreement.”Other EU leaders also ruled out reopening the withdrawal agreement and European Council president Donald Tusk is expected to restate the position formally after the leaders discuss Brexit at the end of the summit.If Mr Johnson, the clear frontrunner to become prime minister by late July, and the EU maintain their current positions, a stand-off between the two sides seems certain in advance of the Brexit date of October 31st.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Alan BetsonThe European Commission has strongly emphasised the need to preserve a frictionless border in Ireland if longstanding and extensive North-South co-operation is to be sustained.In a working paper published on Thursday, the commission sets an exercise conducted with the British last year in “mapping” 147 North-South projects and programmes in the context of obligations on the UK to protect the Northern Ireland peace process under the 1998 Belfast Agreement. The UK parliamentary Brexit committee published the British government’s own report on the mapping exercise on Thursday but without the same political emphasis in the commission’s version, which stressed the importance of maintaining an open border to sustain North-South co-operation. The UK government published a 12-page “technical explanatory note” on the North-South co-operation mapping exercise in December, but had refused to publish the documents in the exercise, which run to more than 60 pages, until the report was provided to the Westminster committee. The parliamentary panel said the document was provided to the committee following a disclosure from the UK cabinet office to a Freedom of Information request from a member of the public.The mapping exercise report was never shared with the Brexit committee despite repeated requests from its chairman, Labour MP Hilary Benn. Areas of interactionThe UK document on the exercise, carried out in September 2017, specifies 142 areas of joint North-South co-operation, ranging in areas of healthcare from congenital heart disease to alcohol misuse to rules covering the transport of firearms, civil explosives and “national treasures”. The 2017 study formed the basis of the joint political declaration in December of that year and later the withdrawal agreement, including the backstop insurance policy to prevent a hard Irish border.The UK government committed to sustaining cross-Border projects under the terms of the 1998 agreement. A British government spokesman insisted it remained committed to upholding the peace agreement “in all scenarios” around the UK’s exit from the EU. “It was consistently recognised that virtually all areas of North-South co-operation are predicated on the avoidance of a hard border, including related customs or regulatory checks and controls,” the European Commission’s report says. In detailing areas of co-operation ranging from animal and plant standards to cross-Border healthcare and environmental protection, the report warns that a hard border threatens the viability of such projects.More than tradeTaoiseach Leo Varadkar said in Brussels he was glad the mapping exercise report had been published. “It really sketches out the very large number of areas where there is North-South co-operation, co-operation between Northern Ireland and Ireland,” he said.Mr Varadkar said that North-South co-operation runs “so much deeper than trade issues – it applies to so many other things”.“So when we talk about avoiding a hard border and also protecting the Good Friday Agreement, they are not the same thing. It is both of those things that we seek to protect.”The commission’s report strengthens Dublin’s argument that the UK’s obligation to the backstop – the contentious part of the withdrawal agreement that has caused the House of Commons to reject the proposed Brexit treaty three times – predates the backstop to the Belfast Agreement. The reports show that cross-Border co-operation extends beyond trade and customs, which were the focus of “soft border” technological solutions proposed by pro-Brexit UK politicians but ultimately rejected by the European Union in negotiations.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: BloombergA US official said the military made preparations for limited strikes on Iran in retaliation for the downing of a US surveillance drone, but approval was abruptly withdrawn before the attacks were launched.The official said the targets would have included radars and missile batteries.The New York Times reported that US president Donald Trump had approved the strikes, but then called them off.The White House on Thursday night declined requests for information about whether Mr Trump changed his mind.According to the official who spoke to the Associated Press, the strikes were recommended by the Pentagon and were among the options presented to senior administration officials.It was unclear how far the preparations had gone, but no shots were fired or missiles launched.The military operation was called off around 7.30pm Washington time, after Mr Trump had spent most of Thursday discussing Iran strategy with top national security advisers and congressional leaders.Asked earlier in the day about a US response to the attack, he said, “You’ll soon find out.”‘Big mistake’Mr Trump declared that “Iran made a very big mistake” by shooting down the US drone over the Strait of Hormuz.But he also suggested that shooting down the drone was a foolish error rather than an intentional escalation of the tensions that have led to rising fears of open military conflict.“I find it hard to believe it was intentional, if you want to know the truth,” Mr Trump said at the White House. “I think that it could have been somebody who was loose and stupid that did it.”On Capitol Hill, leaders urged caution to avoid escalation, and some politicians insisted the White House must consult with Congress before taking any actions.US secretary of state Mike Pompeo and national security adviser John Bolton have advocated hardline policies against Iran, but Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House intelligence committee, said “the president certainly was listening” when congressional leaders at the meeting urged him to be cautious and not escalate the already tense situation.House speaker Nancy Pelosi said no specific options for a US response were presented at the more than hour-long meeting.Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell said, “The administration is engaged in what I would call measured responses.”And late on Thursday, House Republicans on the Foreign Affairs, Intelligence and Armed Services committees issued a statement using the same word, saying, “There must be a measured response to these actions.”Deliberate defenceThe downing of the huge, unmanned aircraft , which Iran portrayed as a deliberate defence of its territory rather than a mistake, was a stark reminder of the risk of military conflict between US and Iranian forces as the Trump administration combines a “maximum pressure” campaign of economic sanctions with a build-up of American forces in the region.On Thursday, Iran called the sanctions “economic terrorism”, insisted the drone had invaded its airspace and said it was taking its case to the United Nations in an effort to prove the US was lying about the aircraft being over international waters.It accused the US of “a very dangerous and provocative act”.The drone — which has a wing wider than a Boeing 737 — entered Iranian airspace “despite repeated radio warnings” and was shot down by Iran, acting under the UN Charter which allows self-defence action “if an armed attack occurs,” Iran’s UN ambassador Majid Takht Ravanchi said in a letter to the UN secretary-general.Late on Thursday, the Federal Aviation Administration barred American-registered aircraft from flying over parts of the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman. –

In other words . . . the car was exactly as I’d left it.“Well at least they didn’t steal anything,” I mumbled. The first he’ll know of the truth is when he reads this. Tidiness isn’t one of my strong points and nor, it seems, is PM hopeful Boris Johnson in possession of the neatness gene.The photo of his Toyota Previa’s interior makes my messy misdemeanours seem very Mini indeed. Naturally, with the age-old adage of “tidy room, tidy mind” at the forefront of their smugly neat brains, plenty will make the leap that Boris’s untidiness makes him unsuitable to lead the country.His many critics might also throw in the other car-related evidence that, when he was GQ’s motoring correspondent, he accrued enough parking tickets to paper a downstairs loo and frequently misplaced the vehicle he’d been loaned.A potential PM needs to be across the small print of every situation, they argue, and Boris is just too “chaotic” to do so. But is that true  After all, Gordon Brown and Theresa May were sticklers for detail and look what happened to them.So perhaps it’s time for a “bigger picture” personality with the strength of character to lead the country through a series of inevitably dficult decisions while leaving the crossing of Ts etc to several trusted lieutenants.According to journalist Andrew Gilligan, who worked for Boris when he was Mayor of London, his former boss has the “factory setting” of one nation Toryism and the ability to “master detail whenever he wanted to” but seldom wanted to.“A leader’s job,” Gilligan adds, “is to set the general direction and tone, choose the right people and inspire them to implement it. Lots of folk can do detail.”My friends would tell you that, despite the chaotic mess of my office at home , I possess clarity of thought when it comes to work and le’s general admin.So let’s hope that,he becomes PM, Boris is the same. Watch this messy space.MODEL Irina Shayk has reportedly split from Hollywood actor Bradley Cooper, father of her young daughter.The couple haven’t confirmed or denied the reports, but the rumour mill went in to turbo- boosted overdrive when Irina was spotted leaving their US home with this suitcase.Puh. The story might be true, but this puny bag proves nothing. It would just about hold her mascaras.ANY chance of seeing all of Prince Archie  So far we’ve been treated to a glimpse of his nose and one cheek when Meghan and Harry posed for the first post-birth photocall, followed by a pair of feet on Mother’s Day and, on Father’s Day last weekend, just his eyes.It’s like playing a royal version of Beetle Drive.LIAM GALLAGHER has given a “Father’s Day” interview along with three of his four children by four dferent women.He’s a lucky man that, despite his often erratic behaviour and, in his oldest daughter’s case, a -year absence, all the mothers have clearly brought up their children to bear no ill will towards him. Good for them.Not all dads are as lucky and, consequently, many spent yet another Father’s Day estranged from their children through no fault of their own.My thoughts are with them.VIETNAMESE model Ngoc Trinh is in trouble with officials in her home country after wearing this barely-there frock to a film screening at the Cannes Film Festival.Nguyen Ngoc Thien, Vietnam’s Minister of Culture, Sports and Tourism, says: “Her outfit was improper, offensive and has caused public outrage.”A matter of opinion, of course, but he’s launched an investigation that could lead to a heavy fine for Ms Trinh. Personally, I found myself more intrigued that she was attending the premiere of A Hidden Le, a thought-provoking film about a conscientious objector who refuses to fight for the Nazis in World War Two.Ms Trinh isn’t in it and, as far as I can tell, wasn’t reviewing it either. Meaning, presumably, that she was simply working the red carpet to boost not only the movie but her impressive .million Instagram followers who slavishly follow her every, choreographed move.No such thing as A Hidden Le in the modern world, eh In the morning and evening rush hour, you’re luckyyou reach ten.ENGLAND women’s football manager Phil Neville and his we Julie have completed a £million makeover of their home, including a cinema with armchairs that extend to become beds.Eek.

He’s just done so again.People who want a second vote on Brexit should go and live in North Korea, he said. Meaning that they had no time for democracy.Gallagher — like almost every bloody pop musician — backed Remain in the ­referendum. But he said: “There’s only one f***ing thing worse than a fool who voted for Brexit. That’s the rise of the c***s trying to get the vote overturned.”His message, then, to the relentlessly moaning Remainers who have tried every trick in the book to get that democratic decision overturned is: Don’t look back in anger — get on with your lives and let Brexit happen.As we decided it must.And here’s the thing. I suspect most Remainers think exactly the same. The people I know who voted Remain were saddened by the referendum result and they wished we’d all voted dferently.But they all believe that the vote must be upheld. And there should not be a second vote.And when I talk to them, they don’t call me a Nazi or a fascist for voting Leave.They don’t suggest I’m too thick to be allowed to vote or that I hate all foreigners.They just agree to dfer on that simple issue of in or out, and there’s no bad ­feeling at all.This is the thing. The politicians and commentators insist Brexit has ­brutally ided the nation. That the wounds will take a long time to heal. That we’re all at each other’s throats. The .million versus the .million.It’s not so at all. The only real ide is between the four or five million Remain voters who simply won’t have it — and the rest of the country.A lot has been written about the people who voted Leave — most of it codswallop.“It was just the poor and the left-behind, the uneducated and the ­xenophobes.”The statistics simply don’t bear that out.People of all walks of le, all levels of education, all ages and all ­backgrounds voted Leave.This is not, however, true of that hardcore of Remainers, between a quarter and a third of that million, who demand we run the vote again.They are insulated from the normal world. When they say they don’t know anyone who voted Leave, they’re telling the truth.They work in professions where ­virtually nobody voted Leave.In our ­universities , in schools , and among luvviesand scientists .And the BBC — I don’t have figures for the BBC but I would guess it’s close to  per cent for Remain.This is the real ide. Between a ­liberal middle-class elite who simply do not understand the hopes and aspirations of the rest of us. And react with absolute fury when they don’t get their own way.When Brexit is over, one way or another, that liberal elite will still be with us, utterly out of touch with the rest of the country.That’s the ide that matters today. A small minority determined to inflict their liberal policies upon the rest of us.THE BBC shoved an imam from Gloucester on to its Tory leadership debate programme and has now had to apologise.Abdullah Patel asked questions of the candidates about anti-Muslim bigotry in their party. Turns out he’s been accused of plenty of bigotry himself.A whole bunch of social media posts from Patel attacking Israel and praising Corbyn were uncovered. There were “Zionists” hiding behind the Holocaust, a suggestion that Israel should be transported to the centre of the US and so on. The usual stuff.None of it surprised me – and he’s not alone in pushing this view. Is it any wonder anti-semitism is now so entrenched in the Labour Party, and in our country Bob lived in Zimbabwe. Bob was standing in the middle of a road at night when a car hit him.The car cartwheeled, killing both of the people in it. They were rhino-horn smugglers – scumbags who kill rhinos so the valuable horns can be sold in powder form to sad Chinese men who can’t get a stfy.Anyway, Bob’s now dead. But his le was not given in vain.Thank you, Bob.THE latest social media trend is the bubble-tea selfie. Japanese girls take photos of themselves with a carton of the sugary drink nestled between their baps.Nope, I don’t know why.The craze is spreading west, too.People have been seen doing it in Thailand and Vietnam.Will it reach here Well, it’s got to navigate its way through Pakistan, Iran and Saudi Arabia – so I wouldn’t bet on it.THE Breakthrough Listen Project was a massive scheme using millions of computers.It was dedicated to finding intelligent extra-terrestrial le. It has found . . . nothing. Just light year after light year of utter silence.I think it’s time we accustomed ourselves to the fact there’s nothing out there and we’re all alone. The rest of the universe is cold, silent and devoid of intelligent le. Just like Canada.IT’S a shame to see Rory Stewart crashing out of the Conservative leadership race.Not because I agree with him about anything – I don’t. I’d just thought it was high time we had a PM whose real Christian name is Roderick.If people called Roderick ran the country we wouldn’t be in the mess we are now.Sure, Mr Stewart doesn’t use “Roderick”.He’s shortened it to “Rory” in order to sound more dashing and maybe a bit Celtic. Big mistake.Be proud of your given Christian name, Roderick Stewart. It means great ruler. Rory, I think, just means drunk Glaswegian eating a pie.THE bigger and richer charities get, the less likely they are to do the job they were set up to do. The RSPB is a case in point.It’s very rich indeed, with mugs like me paying for its upkeep each month.Incredibly, this organisation has flogged part of a crucial nature reserve near Middlesbrough – so a huge power station can be built on it. What possible right do they have to do that The RSPB says the Saltholme reserve is not one of high ecological signicance. But it was home to some of the UK’s most endangered birds. Not for much longer. At least the RSPB made a fast buck.HAVE you seen Joe Hart’s new tattoo  Christ help us all.It looks like half his torso has been draped in a torn bin liner.Joe doesn’t care what other people think of it – fair enough.But remembering his performances in goal for England, I wondera dferent sort of tattoo might have been more helpful. On one wrist the words: “Stand in the centre of the goal when facing a free kick, you idiot.” And on the other: “Have a go at catching the ball from time to time.”THE oldest woman in Europe has died at the age of .Italian Giuseppina Robucci credited her long, long le to avoiding alcohol.A week ago, however, the oldest woman in the UK died. Grace Jones was  when she popped her clogs, and put her longevity down to regular glasses of whisky.Hmmm.

It will be a shiny new global currency for the st Century, taking on the dollar and the Pound.But I’m not fooled. I think we all know what Facebook is really up to.This is yet another way to harvest data about our financial habits which it can then use for targeted marketing. Critics are already calling it the “most invasive and dangerous form of surveillance ever designed”.Collecting and exploiting information about us is, after all, the whole reason for the company’s existence.Years ago it was basic stuff, like quizzes asking, “What kind of personality type are you ”Fill that in and you are practically begging to be ­targeted in marketing and ­political campaigns. But handing over our spending details is quite another matter.This may be spun as ­connecting the world and ­revolutionising payments but it is really all about tapping the modern-day version of oil — the wells of data.Facebook already knows who you are. Accept Libra and it will know what you are buying, who you’re paying and how much you have.Will it be regulated by the UK Financial Conduct Authority, as banks are in this country  Certainly, the company has not shown much desire for regulation so far — of which more later.But what do we know about how trustworthy, secure or morally sound this would-be money broker is The Cambridge Analytica scandal, where data from million users was shared with political consultants, led to a fine of £, by ­Britain’s Information ­Commissioner’s Office.Last September the company admitted that data from million of its users had leaked due to a security flaw.In  it failed to stop the live broadcast of the torture of a disabled man in Chicago. It has also refused to take down neo-Nazi content.Facebook is under criminal investigation by US prosecutors who are looking into data-sharing deals with, among other, Amazon and Apple. It has been caught out farming data from apps whose users might have been unaware they were feeding information to Facebook.The company was found to be harvesting the dates of female users’ periods via an app which tracked ovulation.Facebook has also been accused of doing little to protect ­vulnerable children from ­promotions of self-harm. British father Ian Russell has directly linked Facebook-owned Instagram to the suicide of his -year-old daughter, Molly.Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg refused to attend the UK ­Parliament’s committee on ­disinformation and “fake news” last year, amid concern the social media giant is ­positioning itself as a news publisher but without ­compliance with any of the regulation or laws governing traditional journalism.The  has been blamed for spreading hatred. In March this year an ­Australian white supremacist live-streamed on Facebook his massacre of  people at two New Zealand mosques.It has further been accused of putting IS terrorists in touch with each other via its “suggested friends” application.When challenged as to why it does not do more to tackle ­terrorism, it falls back on the explanation that it does not have the technology to watch what its .billion users are doing all the time.Yet somehow that does not seem to stop it farming commercially valuable data from our accounts.The same will no doubt turn out to be true about Libra. This week French finance ­minister Bruno Le Maire warned that the cryptocurrency would inevitably be used by terrorists and criminals to sht money around undetected.When it happens, Facebook will no doubt shrug its corporate shoulders once more and say it is powerless to stop it.In theory, the very complex nature of cryptocurrencies means that it should be near impossible for anyone to steal our money.But we have all heard the horror stories. The best-known cryptocurrency, ­Bitcoin, ­at first soared in value, ­making millions for people who latched on to it early. But  months ago it crashed.Of course, most of us like to shop on the internet — and e-commerce is only likely to grow in the coming years.But most of us do it with our bank cards or direct from accounts which hold our money in a ­currency which is backed by the central bank of a First World country.This means we can be ­reasonably sure the currency won’t ­suddenly disappear or become valueless. It is quite another matter doing business in a currency that is backed by internet firms.How can we be sure that Facebook will still be around in a few years’ time Of course, banks sometimes go bust, but at least we have some protection in the form of the Government’s financial services compensation scheme which will refund up to £, of savings in the event of a failure.Facebook claims Libra will be backed by an independent foundation in Switzerland and will be free from the kind of speculation that drove the value of Bitcoin, because its value will be linked to a basket of currencies.But I’m sorry, I’m just not buying it. I’m sticking with sterling when I do my online shopping.It might not be very exciting but I feel confident it will still be around well when Libra, and Facebook, have long ago ­disappeared. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Yes, you heard it right.As a member of the Work and Pensions Select Committee I’ve heard heart-wrenching stories from travelling the country to visit some of the poorest Brits with our chair Frank Field, seeing first-hand the effects of the benefits freeze and the rollout of Universal Credit.Brexit has completely paralysed politics and taken our focus away from what should matter to Government the most - helping the neediest in our society.The design of the new benefits system means they won’t get paid for five weeks and it’s a issue I won’t let go of.As both The Sun’s Make Universal Credit Work campaign and the food bank operator Trussell Trust argue – that wait is five weeks too long and we need to fix it to make the benefits system work properly.Making the advance payment the first payment rather than a loan to pay back is the best way to stop thousands falling into poverty.Time and time again I hear stories from people who are pushed further into poverty and destitution because of Universal Credit’s five week wait.And for years the recommendations we make to Government based on the evidence we hear are ignored as they relentlessly try to defend the fundamental design flaws in the system.And the heartbreaking thing is I can see how easily we could transform people’s experience of Universal Credit.The DWP say the ‘solution’ to the wait is for people to apply for an advance. But what they continue to fail to recognise is that this ‘advance’ is a loan which can push people into deeper debt, with record numbers forced to use food banks.For the most vulnerable, the answer is clear, make any advance payment their FIRST payment. If they have no money and no prospect of income, why on earth are we waiting for a four week assessment period for them to prove they have no money It makes no practical nor moral sense.One million people are already receiving it and by the time the system is fully rolled out in , nearly  million will be on it.But there are big problems with the flagship new system - it takes  weeks to get the first payment and it could leave some families worse off by thousands of pounds a year.And while working families can claim back up to  per cent of their childcare costs, they must find the money to pay for childcare upfront - we’ve heard of families waiting up to  months for the money.Working parents across the country told us they’ve been unable to take on more hours - or have even turned down better paid jobs or more hours because of the amount they get their benefits cut.It’s time to Make Universal Credit work. We want the government to:Together, these changes will help Make Universal Credit Work.% of claimants are taking up an advance payment as they can’t afford to wait for five weeks, so the money is going out of DWP’s door anyway!This would stem the spiral of debt and give the most vulnerable a fighting chance.Couple that with an immediate lt of the benefit freeze and our welfare system would start to motor again.Heidi Allen is the independent MP for South Cambridgeshire and a member of the work and pensions select committee.Apply for an advance - Claimants are able to get some cash within five days rather than waiting weeks for their first payment. But its a loan which means the repayments will be automatically deducted from your future Universal Credit pay out.Alternative Payment Arrangements- If youre falling behind on rent, you or your landlord may be able to apply for an APA which will get your payment sent directly to your landlord. You might also be able to change your payments to get them more frequently, or you can split the paymentsyoure part of a couple.Budgeting Advance - You may be able to get help from the government to help with emergency household costs of up to £youre single, £youre part of a couple or £you have children. These are only in cases like your cooker breaking down or for help getting a job. Youll have to repay the advance through your regular Universal Credit payments. Youll still have to repay the loan, evenyou stop claiming for Universal Credit.Cut your Council Tax - You might be able to get a discount on your Council Tax or be entitled to Discretionary Housing Paymentsyour payments arent enough to cover your rent.Foodbanks - If youre really hard up and struggling to buy food and toiletries, you can find your local foodbank who will provide you with help for free.

We did however, adopt a dferent format for this programme and we will look at whether there are additional steps we might take on vetting and transparency should we repeat it in the future.”Rob Burley, editor of the BBC’s live political shows, continued to defend Tuesday night’s show, telling critics on Twitter: “The questions were good ones.“We didn’t say the questioners were representative or selected by anyone but us on basis of the questions.”He insisted that researchers were unable to spot Mr Patel’s offensive social media comments – which included claiming that “every political figure on the Zionist’s payroll is scaring the world about Corbyn” and calling for Israel to be relocated to the USA – because he had deactivated his Twitter account before the BBC One programme aired.Broadcasting watchdog Ofcom has received more than  complaints about the show so far but viewers are meant to raise concerns with the BBC first so the true number will not be known until its next fortnightly report is published.The Conservative Party is still considering whether or not to lodge a formal complaint but many senior MPs are urging it do so, and even considering boycotting future leaders’ debates.Former leader Iain Duncan Smith called the BBC the “Stop Boris Johnson Broadcasting Service” and told The Sun: “I think it is an utter disgrace what happened. I’m astonished the BBC has the utter arrogance not to apologise.”Former Brexit Secretary David Davis called it the “Boris Bashing Corporation” while the debacle was raised in both houses of Parliament yesterday.Veteran Tory backbencher Sir David Amess called for a debate on the future of the BBC, saying in the Commons: “There have already been concerns about taking away free TV licences from the over-s, but frankly, after that dreadful debate on Monday between my parliamentary colleagues, the quality of public broadcasting needs to be looked at.“Presumably, during the course of our debate, we could find out who the idiot was in central office who agreed to the format of that programme in the first place.”Commons leader Mel Stride replied: “I have to say that I agree with my hon. Friend’s observation on the televised hustings, which made the candidates look like some kind of boy band perched on their stools.”And in a House of Lords debate on anti-Semitism, Lord Polak said: “The BBC clearly has many questions to answer about Abdullah Patel from Bristol.”Its leftie journalists gave a  to a Corbyn-backing anti-Semite and a former Corbyn staffer and passed them off as random punters. Neither was interested in honest, fair scrutiny. Their agenda was to benefit Labour.Nor were their questions “good ones”, as its live politics editor feebly insists.One stoked flimsy claims about a Tory Islamophobia problem, a naked attempt to distract from Labour’s genuine ­epidemic of Jew-hatred.

Belugas are thought to suffer in captivity, and there had been mounting pressure on the British firm that runs the aquarium.Merlin Entertainment, which also runs Legoland and Madame Tussauds, bought Changfeng Ocean World Zoo where the two whales lived in , and started looking for a home for them.Their new sanctuary is some , milesfrom Shanghai, in Klettsvik Bay, on the Icelandic island of Heimaey. Their long voyage will also include travel by truck, and a ferry.“We have been working with Little White and Little Grey for the last  months to make sure that they will be prepared and ready for the long journey,” said Andy Bool, head of the British conservation charity Sea Le Trust.The bay is the world’s first open water beluga sanctuary, and will “provide a more natural sub-Arctic environment and wilder habitat for these amazing whales to call home,” the charity said.The same bay was previously home to another showbiz whale, the orca Keiko from the Free Willy film franchise. He was released in , but died of pneumonia  months later after swimming to Norway and making his home there.This time the bay, which measures , sq m , will be netted off to protect the two female whales. It is thought Little Grey and Little White would not survive on their own in the wild.There are plans for a visitors’ centre, and tourists will be able to view the whales from boats.The two will be studied by scientists to see how they adapt to their new home. If they thrive, they could live to between  and  years old.Depending on how Little Grey and Little White fare, the sanctuary could become home to other belugas as well. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The rabbits are prisoners in their small cages and they will know only these cages their whole lives. They will never get out.The research centre said only six cows have been fitted with the windows.It says they need the windows to carry out an experiment to find out how to reduce the use of antibiotics in the farming business.Avril spokesperson Tom Doron insists the experiments come with rigorous veterinary monitoring and are considered painless for the animal.They also claim to be studying how to reduce methane production, a major contributor to climate change, according to the European Commission.Helene Thouy, Ls lawyer, said: The Rural Code provides that animal testing is permitted only when strictly necessary.

You conducted inappropriate relationships with them.“We consider that your conduct towards these women amounted to exploitation of them. It also demonstrates a sexually promiscuous nature.“The behaviour we find proved fell very far below that required of those holding the office of minister.”The report revealed Smith struck up an affair with a parishioner within days of taking up his post in , meeting her in a pub.The married woman, who was separated from her husband, told the church committee she was in a “dark place” and “craved healing” — believing “God perhaps wanted her to take this course”.Smith “abused his position of care and pastoral support” by starting the ten-day affair after he admitted he’d found her “very attractive”.The randy preacher also had an -month affair with his long-suffering girlfriend’s - year-old neighbour.They lived together for a spell and she stayed over at his manse from January .But they stopped romping by August that year over the teenager’s concerns on sex before marriage.And a Presbyterial Commission report found the churchman had “inappropriate sexual behaviour” with a pal of his girlfriend he’d contacted on Facebook and sent personal messages about how he hated himself.They kissed in a boozer and shared a bed at her flat after Smith said he “couldn’t afford a taxi home”.The report said that he’d offered to sleep on the couch but the woman had suggested sharing the bed without sex.But she later fondled him then “got on top of him and kissed him”.The report added: “The respondent had accepted that there would be no sex.“He then put her on her back and kissed her down her body. She told him to stop and he did so.”The probe found the minister hadn’t been acting in a “sexual” manner in this case but rapped him for being intimate with her while in a committed relationship.Kirk chiefs also blasted him after finding he’d branded his partner a “mess, a dog and a failure” and saying he must like “stocky birds”.The American, a St Andrews Uni graduate, further heaped embarrassment on her in public by slating her clothes, behaviour and “stupidity”.And after the woman, who suspected he was cheating, accused him of lying, Rev Smith replied: “If you want to keep on with that, f*** off.”The probe slated his “emotional and psychological abusive and bullying behaviour”.REV Smith’s sacking is the latest scandal involving sleazy churchmen.Roddy MacNeil, dubbed Father Flash, was axed by his Barra parish for fathering a child with his cousin amid claims he bedded five other women.He fled the area after the revelations in .Two years ago a reverend was found dead amid claims his we accused him of seven affairs with churchgoers.Dr Iain D Campbell, , had been a senior official at the Western Isles Free Presbytery.In , we told how panto-loving cleric Mike Erskine, , had an affair with a BB owner after conducting her husband’s funeral while a minister at Crail and Kingshorn Parish in Fe.The Rev Alec Shuttleworth, , was suspended by the Kirk in  after he was caught paying £ for sexual activity at a sauna in Kirkcaldy.And Reverend Ian Bradley, , had “inappropriate intimate sexual relations” with a wo­man, including a weekend tryst at a cottage in Argyll.His former mistress Gill Toosey wrote a book about their steamy affair and declared: “We were connected in every way.” Smith was suspended in March after the allegations emerged and was visited by a parish worker who wanted him to consider “stepping away from the church” over the complaints.But after he denied using porn, he started to play her a tune on his guitar.The investigation said the woman saw the minister “was visibly aroused and that the position of his hands had changed and that he was fondling himself”.Rev Smith denied this allegation and told in a blog how his Asperger’s Syndrome meant “all too often I misinterpret what I’m told”.The preacher — who was ordained in January  — told investigators he felt remorse over the relationship with the -year-old.He said: “I knew thatI was in a relationship that I should not be showing any physical affection let alone sexual expression to any other person. And I also hid these things from her.“So I experienced regret because I did not believe that those were actions becoming of a minister and I did not believe those were actions that she deserved”.But Kirk committee members unanimously upheld all claims against him — describing the women who had given evidence as credible and his behaviour “censurable by the Word of God”.Their findings added: “You must be prevented from acting as a minister and you should not be permitted to resume your calling unless and until you are in a position to demonstrate that you are capable of fulfilling your duties in a proper manner.“The behaviour proved fell far below that required of those holding the office.”A Church of Scotland spokeswoman confirmed Smith was axed as minister at a sentencing hearing on May .Tonight, at his home in Crosshill, Glasgow, he refused to apologise for his actions.Smith, who was the Kirk’s second youngest minister, told our reporter: “I’m not going to make any comment.

None of them were named in the report and it is unknown for how long the scandal has been going on.The watchdog said it wouldn’t be launching an investigation to find out the scale of the problem.The five MPs have since repaid the rental income.

It’d be Britain the “do-as-I-say-not-as-I-do” years.An horric thought that certainly added a bit of perspective to the penultimate episode of Years And Years, which was written by Doctor Who’s Russell T Davies in a fit of anti-Brexit Trump rage, thereby guaranteeing it would age about as well as Neil “Razor” Ruddock.The blasé assumption that went with it was that this series would be one of ’s big hits, so I won’t pretend the fact it’s died like the proverbial flea in a Russian’s beard hasn’t given me a lot of pleasure.It will have been a huge shock, though, to the BBC because, on the face of things, it was a bold and imaginative idea to travel ten years into the future with “an ordinary, everyday” family like the Lyons.Or it was up to the point when it became clear they were the sort of “ordinary, everyday” family who lived in a million-pound mansion and had more ticked boxes than Stephen Hawking’s homework.They were mixed race, naturally. One daughter was a lesbian left-wing activist, another was in a wheelchair, there was a gay son, with a refugee boyfriend, a cross-dressing nephew and niece who was “trans-human” and could take photos by blinking her eyes. All of them were bloody insufferable.The plot didn’t offer a lot of joy or surprises either, as it began with Donald Trump starting a nuclear war. An idea that secretly thrills all thosereaders who long to shout: “I TOLD YOU SO.”Armageddon quickly fizzled out, though, and was replaced by the melting of the North Pole, bananas becoming extinct, poor people being banned from London’s Kensington, Biblical downpours of rain and the Ukraine causing a refugee crisis when its Christian regime started arresting homosexuals, as Christian regimes so often don’t.Ben Shephard: “What is the fth letter of the alphabet ” Faith: “F.”And Love Island, Tommy: “What year did World War One start ” Molly-Mae: “.”Cheerful and brave, it most certainly wasn’t. The BBC doesn’t get a real buzz, though, unless it’s sticking it to the mother country.  So, on last week’s episode, Viv Rook became PM and immediately started planning genocide on asylum seekers. It’s not an original drama idea, obviously.Dennis Potter did the groundwork for Davies in Brimstone  Treacle, over  years ago. On Years And Years, however, plot twists come with a gear-crunching speech or a history lesson, spelled out here by the Thompson character.The thing about giving history lessons, though, is you’ve got to get them right. Years And Years didn’t.Simple Googling would’ve told the BBC concentration camps were actually a Spanish invention, during the Cuban wars of independence, and forced labour dates back centuries.I suspect they didn’t bother because the BBC and Russell T Davies are both so full of self-loathing they want to believe the worst things they hear about their own country.If you didn’t pick up that contempt for the audience from Years And Years last week, you certainly will have got a sense of it from the fact the BBC decided to land .million people over the age of  with a £. bill for the licence.It’s unlikely anyone would volunteer to pay that sort of money to endure the Years And Years lecture, no matter what it conjures up in tonight’s finale.Though how the hell it ever survived to , under the current management, will be the real mystery for most viewers.Shelley Kerr: “The one thing we want to do is win or get a draw.”Claire Rafferty: “England need more of the same but dferent.”Rachel Brown-Finnis: “Phil Neville is the female version of Gareth Southgate.” He is .LONG, cold evenings in a Highland yurt, staring at the same ruddy animals year after year, can lead presenters down all sorts of weird television cul-de-sacs.Take, for instance, Springwatch’s Michaela Strachan who, after a couple of weeks huddled in the Cairngorms, on BBC, suddenly piped up with some hot news about: “Starling testicles.”Yes. Starling testicles, which are a bit like Aston Villa, apparently.  Timid, puny little things in the winter but quite magnicent come the spring.A fact that led Michaela to wonderviewers could “imagine flying round with testicles the size of a bean ”  I could, and it quite took the thrill out of my new superpower, I can tell you.If that wasn’t a vivid enough image for you, though, co-host Chris Packham was on hand with a starling testicle-size graph and a prop, to tell her thathuman testicles swelled to the same scale, they’d be the size of basketballs.“And that’s quite a thing to get your head around, isn’t it ”I’ll take your word for it, Michaela.HAVING gone absolutely nowhere for over a week, Love Island was transformed on Wednesday by the arrival of a heat-seeking missile in human form. She’s Maura Higgins, an Irish “ring girl”. A description you can interpret pretty much any way you like.Because she may look like one of The Corrs, but Maura has a gob on her like Father Jack and, within five minutes of meeting Molly-Mae’s partner Tommy, was telling anyone who’d listen: “I swear to God, the things I’d do to that man. ‘Oh Tommy, Tommy, Tommy’. I can imagine screaming his name already.”That was just for starters, though.By Thursday, Maura was announcing her intention to “wrap my legs round his head”, which Tommy said was “doing a -degree turn”, without any danger of cutting off the blood supply to his brain. And on Friday she told all the other girls Tommy was giving her “fanny flutters”, who I think I once backed to win the  Guineas.Tommy’s now wearing the same haunted expression as a male praying mantis just before his head’s removed during the mating process, but by far the best thing about Maura’s arrival in the villa has been her verdict on herself. “I’m a girl’s girl.” RemarkableThe naive but still widespread belief Madonna will one day give a good interview. Channel  imagining it was doing us some sort of favour by replacing the brilliant Gogglebox regulars with witless minor celebrities.And The One Show’s Matt Baker telling Clare Balding that women’s football is: “Much better than the men’s game.”Suggesting Matt Baker’s either never seen a game of football in his le or he’s a disingenuous creep who’ll say absolutely anything he thinks will help him grovel his way up the BBC career ladder. Pitul behaviour.ITV’S England v Soccer Aid XI match was more entertaining and funnier than expected, largely thanks to Mark Wright’s penalty miss and Ant Middleton’s above-the-knee sock arrangement, which I think was meant to give him the graceful air of Thierry Henry, but actually just looked more like Lord Percy from Blackadder II was playing at right back.So why then did commentator Clive Tyldesley choose to cheapen the occasion by questioning Piers Morgan’s ethnic credentials for managing the victorious World XI, when tests have already confirmed he’s so authentically Irish  per cent of his DNA can be traced directly to Mayo, the other quarter to chips Paddy McGuinness’ and Freddie Flintoff’s first Top Gear already looking like a vast improvement on all the other post-Clarkson versions.BBC’s landmark Thatcher: A Very British Revolution series.

Despite almost a decade of austerity, research shows that % of the group want public services to receive less cash. And just % think that the tax system should redistribute from the rich to the poor. Research by Prof Tim Bale at Queen Mary University of London highlights just how unrepresentative of the UK the Tory Party is. The average member is in their s – % are white and % are male. They are predominantly middle class and based in the South. And most of them are pro-Brexit.

Calls are mounting to sack Mark Field after he manhandled a Greenpeace protester who invaded last nightaposs glitzy event at Mansion House in the City of London. Around  climate change activists gatecrashed the annual banquet for bankers and politicians - forcing Chancellor Philip Hammond to break off his speech. Footage emerged showing the Cities of London and Westminster MP manhandling one of the protesters wearing a climate emergency sash. It shows the woman passing behind the MPaposs chair. He then stands, shoves the woman against a pillar by her neck, and appears to push her away out of the room. Mr Field issued a statement in the early hours apologising but saying he thought she might have been armed.  But Tory whips and police are now examining the footage - and Mr Field has referred himself to the Cabinet Office to establishhe broke the ministerial ethics code. MPs condemned the behaviour and called for Mr Field to be sacked. Do you know the activist  Email webnews@mirror.    Labour MP Lisa Nandy branded the footage horrying while fellow MP Tonia Antoniazzi added: Mark Field should resign and be arrested. I don’t care in what order. No one who reacts like this to a peaceful protest should be sitting in our parliament. Former Tory Sarah Wollaston said it was absolutely shameful, a male MP marching a woman out of a room by her neck. Labouraposs Shadow Women and Equalities minister Dawn Butler said: This is horric. Conservative Foreign Office Minister Mark Field violently grabs a woman as she protests about climate change at the bankers’ banquet. This appears to be assault. He must be immediately suspended or sacked. Due to Violence against women. Labour MP Paula Sherf told the Mirror: “It’s really disturbing to see the video footage which appears to show Tory Minister Mark Field using disproportionate force against an alleged protester at Mansion House. The Conservative Party must take robust and swt action.” Labour MP Jess Phillips, a former domestic abuse worker, said: She posed no credible threat from what I can see. There is very little  that could justy this and anyone can see that this could have been done without physical contact. Conservative Party chairman Brandon Lewis confirmed the Chief Whip will investigate Mr Fieldaposs behaviour. He told ITVaposs Good Morning Britain it was very hard to defend the footage, adding: Itaposs hard for anybody to look at that and not be astonished at what they have seen.  As a Foreign Office minister Mr Fieldaposs boss is Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt - one of two candidates for the Tory leadership. When contacted by the Press Association Jeremy Hunt responded with a text saying sorry canapost talk now. The Tory MP later apologised for the incident and said he reacted instinctively fearing the protester may have been armed. In a statement to ITVaposs Paul Brand, he said: “A major security breach occurred at the dinner I attended last night when a large number of protesters suddenly and noisily stormed into Mansion House.  “In the confusion, many guests understandably felt threatened and when one protester rushed past me towards the table I instinctively reacted. “There was no security present and I was for a split-second genuinely worried she might have been armed.” He continued: As a result, I grasped the intruder firmly in order to remove her from the room as swtly as possible. I deeply regret this episode and unreservedly apologise to the lady concerned for grabbing her but in the current climate I felt the need to act decisively to close down the threat to those present.  In view of the the publicity around this incident, I am referring myself to the Cabinet Office to examine whether there has been a breach of the minsterial code, and will of course co-operate fully. Some MPs defended Mr Fieldaposs behaviour. Tory MP Alistair Burt said on BBC’s Newsnight: “It looks to be a very dficult situation for everyone concerned.” Tory MP Sir Peter Bottomley added: The woman clearly was trying to create a fuss... he reversed her direction and she looked as though she went willingly. I think thereaposs no reason to criticise Mark Field ... Of course it wasnapost an assault, it was a reversal of direction. But Greenpeace campaigner Areeba Hamid said the woman was a victim of physical assault and in shock. She told BBC Breakfast: When she came back last night I did meet her briefly. She was still in shock obviously but has been reassured by the outpouring of support she’s been seeing online and she is recovering from what was a very busy night for her and other activists.She added: “Mark Field should really have a long hard stare at himself and think about whether that behaviour is in keeping with someone who is in public office.” The environment protesters were bundled out of the Mansion House annual Bankers and Merchants Dinner after gatecrashing the Chancelloraposs speech to highlight a climate emergency. The activists in red evening dress had piled into the black tie event in London last night to interrupt Philip Hammondaposs address to the annual banquet attended by key political and City grandees.    After the activists were ushered out Mr Hammond remarked: The irony is that this is Government that has just led the world by committing to a zero carbon economy by . The comment was met with applause. Mr Hammond went on to tell the banquet the UK faced a quandary as Parliament would not allow no deal Brexit , and, based on the evidence so far, MPs also would not support the only deal on the table. Issuing a direct warning to the last-standing Tory leadership hopefuls, Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt , the chancellor said he could be wrong, and the EU could renegotiate the deal, and the Irish backstop question could go away. ButIaposm not -the deal the current PM has negotiated turns out to be the best deal possible and Parliament continues to reject both it, and no deal, then the question to the candidates is not aposwhat is your plan,apos but aposwhat is your plan Bapos.  Becauseyour plan A is undeliverable, not having a plan B is not having a plan at all. After its activists were kicked out, and before the footage of Mr Field emerged Greenpeaceaposs climate campaigner Areeba Hamid issued a statement saying climate science demanded radical policy interventions and public investments. She accused the serious, sensible, grey-suited grown-ups in the room of crashing the economy in , and urged them to act to avoid crashing the climate too.  This is a climate emergency. Business as usual is no longer an option. The real bottom line, the priority that needs to come before all others, is not profit, revenue or growth, but survival. That needs to be recognised in every boardroom and on every balance sheet, starting with the Chancelloraposs, she said. The people in this room have been funding climate change, and weaposre not giving the banks and hedge funds a pass for their unethical investment decisions anymore. In response to the Mark Field incident, she said: “We were shocked at the footage of an elected MP and government Minister assaulting one of our peaceful protestors at the Mansion House tonight. The protestor in question was hoping to discuss climate change and the economic reforms we need with the financiers and bankers at the dinner. Mark Field is the MP for the City and represents many of those financiers and bankers. We hope they will show a greater willingness to listen and understand the necessity for urgent action than their representative.” City of London police said: “We have received a small number of third party reports of an assault taking place at the [Mansion House] event. These reports are being looked into by police.” "},{"url":null,"title":"paul routledge uk women aborting","story":"NewsopinionPaul Routledge: UK women aborting unborn babies because of Tory benefit cutsForcing a woman to choose between aborting her unborn child and poverty is an assault on motherhoodShareCommentsByPaul Routledge:,  JUN NewsopinionOf all the nasty, penny-pinching, ­punitive policies imposed on the have-nots, this must rank as the most ­heartless\"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailI would not have believed this report had it not come from a respected source. Women in this country are aborting their unborn babies because of Tory benefit cuts. In his  Budget, austerity Chancellor George Osborne capped child credits at two kids per family, hitting an ­estimated , families. It gets worse. The British Pregnancy Advice Service says “The two-child benefit cap was designed to influence reproductive decision-making. We are certainly aware of cases where that has been a factor in a woman’s decision to end a third, unplanned pregnancy.” The BPAS doesn’t say how many cases, but even one embryo aborted – one child who isn’t here – because the Tories think the poor shouldn’t have big families is appalling.    Some say the policy deters feckless parents from having too many children. That patronising view is an argument for contraception, not abortion. Of all the nasty, penny-pinching, ­punitive policies imposed on the have-nots, this must rank as the most ­heartless. Forcing a woman to choose between aborting her unborn child and poverty is an assault on motherhood. I am not anti-abortion. I go along with the woman’s right to choose, albeit it with a heavy heart. The ,-plus terminations a year in Britain, equal to the population of York, is not a figure to be proud of. And this isn’t really a woman’s choice. It is Chinese-style state control on the freedom of less well-off couples to decide on the size of their family.  Naturally, this inhumane embargo doesn’t worry wealthy ministers. Home Secretary Sajid Javid, who earned £million a year as a banker before entering politics, has four children with we Laura. Soon-to-be Tory leader Boris Johnson can beat that. He has five children, four with his soon-to-be ex-we Marina, and one from an extramarital affair. “Do as we say, not as we do” has always been their motto. Extending it to parenthood shows just how hypocritical they are.

Debating, endlessly interviewed. Questioned by the public, grilled by presenters, popping up in their own videos. But still the elephant in the Tory hustings remains. Even now the Tory leadership race is down to just two, they still know not to mention the A word –Austerity. To these two, the UN report on the human devastation caused by austerity might as well have been unwritten.Even St Rory voted enthusiastically for every welfare reform. And, certainly, no candidate is left in the running now who is remotely bothered about addressing the deep inequalities that led to Brexit .So, when at last week’s BBC ­Question Time, comedian Francesca Martinez, who has cerebral palsy and describes herself as “wobbly”, threw the austerity elephant on to the stage, it came as an almost visceral shock.    Martinez shamed the Government with a figure from the IPPR think-tank – that austerity has led to , preventable deaths since . “As a ‘wobbly woman’, I really have to highlight the tens of thousands of disabled and sick people who have died after being found fit for work,” she said. “Austerity has caused the death of over , human beings in Britain, that’s absolutely outrageous. “That’s , mums, dads, ­daughters, sons, uncles and aunts who have died because the Tories and the Lib Dems decided to make ordinary people pay for a crash that was caused by bankers who we bailed out.” These deaths go on and on. In recent days, while the Tory lovelies have been parading themselves on the airwaves, the mother of Jodey Whiting, who took her own le after having her disability payments stopped, met DWP officials. Joy Dove told them how it felt to find a note saying, “Please, Mam, look after my babies”, after Jodie took her own le just  days after her benefits ended.  “I told them that five minutes away from here, my daughter is in that cemetery,” Joy told ­Disability News Service. “I could see a tear in the official’s eye but at the same time she had to hold it back.” The DWP says it has “since reviewed and strengthened procedures to ensure that all vulnerable claimants are ­safeguarded.” But Jodey’s mum says: “It hasn’t really changed things because Jodey’s dead and she’s not coming back.” What have the last two Tory leadership ­candidates got to offer this grieving mother  What single thing about this broken and brutal system would they change  Yesterday, as the leadership circus continued, the DWP reported back from its internal review into the shocking death of Stephen Smith, who weighed under six stone and was gravely ill before he died, but was ­apparently “fit for work”. The department’s astonishing conclusion was that although “crucial safeguarding opportunities were missed”, “policy guidance was followed”. Proofany last shred were needed that the system is rotten to its core.  This was a -year-old man with devastating illnesses from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease to osteoarthritis, who could barely walk, and was forced at one point to get a note to leave hospital so he could attend an appointment with the DWP. In February, the DWP admitted its error, paying back £, in wrongly denied benefits. That money was used to pay for his funeral. If Mr Smith died and the system was working, that system must be ­immediately scrapped. But that would take a total reworking of the welfare safety net that not one candidate is considering. No contender to be Prime Minister has unveiled any intention of bringing the current cruelty to an end.Yesterday, as Sajid Javid and Michael Gove were eliminated from the ­leadership race, new homelessness figures showed what anyone who works in London – as both Tory ­leadership contenders do – already knows. Homelessness in London is now off the scale, with a record high of , people sleeping rough last year. An eye-watering increase of % and two- and-a-half times the number recorded in the last year of the Labour ­Government of -. No doubt, Trump hate-tweet endorsing Jeremy Hunt will try to blame this on London’s Mayor Sadiq Khan . But the causes lie again in austerity measures – welfare reform, lack of investment in social housing, and, increasingly, the horror of Universal Credit .What’s Boris’ plan to tackle the unprecedented levels of homelessness across the country  Tax cuts for the rich  What’s Hunt’s  The answer is, we don’t know. Because the Tory leadership contest continues in a parallel universe, where no one is starving to death, and no one is committing suicide, or homeless and , people didn’t just die preventable deaths.

Mrs Clevely choked back tears and added: “It’s enough to put you in a box. “You feel like you’ve got no fight left in you.” The pairaposs hell began when the council approved plans to demolish an existing bungalow and replace it with a two-storey house on the same site.

A spokesman from Lichfield District Council said: “The building height and the distance to the neighbouring boundary are in line with the plans.    “The application was thoroughly assessed, taking account of its contemporary design and how this met relevant planning policies.” Residents have been told there is nothing they can do, as planning permission has been granted.

The hard-working Plumridge family from Exeter moved to Perth, the Western Australian capital, four-and-a-half years ago. Amanda, , and Steven Plumridge, , and their daughters Rosie, , and Megan, , moved Down Under to be with relatives while setting up a kiddies therapeutic drama class business, Pyjama Drama.It grew so successful, bagging several local awards, that they were able to franchise it, reports Devon Live .But after a years-long long battle, reported on national Australian television, their permanent residency has been denied - dooming the business and their chance to stay in the country.    According to the Plumridges, they are victims of legislation changes and delayed processing times. After waiting for confirmation from the Australian government they were finally told their fate on Tuesday. The reason given was that it was aposnot in the public interest for them to stay.apos The final decision was rubber-stamped by Australiaaposs Minister of Immigration David Coleman. After being given a bridging visa without work rights, the family has been unemployed since Christmas. They have been relying on friends and strangers to help pay rent, alongside required police and medical checks, and they say they cannot actually afford four flights back to the UK.    Speaking with Australiaaposs Channel  news programme Today Tonight, Steven said: Over the last six months it is has been absolutely horrendous and, well really, shame on you for putting people through this. Former Devon County Council worker Amanda added:If anything weaposre so much in the public interest to stay. Everything now is about learning through play and thataposs exactly what my business does. She also said there was: no words to express the pain and torture in our hearts. To add insult to injury, the family is being forced to fundraise to get their dog Max on a plane home with them.  How did it happen  The family says recent changes in Australiaaposs migration laws have moved the goal posts. That included the abolishment of a self-sponsored temporary skilled work visa which has been tightened to only allow migration based on genuine skill shortage areas. Perth is also no longer being classied as regional in Australiaaposs migration policy, the job role aposdrama teacherapos has been taken off most occupation lists and the age limit has been reduced to  years old. As the family applied for permanent residency, several reasons were given that denied them their stay. In early January their working rights were taken away. Amanda explains: In a nutshell, we are being chastised for our first year of trading because a migration officer speculated that the company couldn’t sustain employment over a two-year period. We have been fighting this ever since, costing us and our company thousands and thousands of dollars in legal fees over the past  years. We have done nothing but contribute to the economy, paying our taxes and liabilities. Also our drama program is of exceptional value.    What do Australians think  Many Australians have rallied to the Plumridgeaposs cause, with more than , people signing a petition of support. Amanda explained: The community support has been amazing from people stopping me in the street to ask how they can help, to food hampers and vouchers, free services from local community businesses, donations from the public and businesses. [There has also been] media coverage and Members of Parliament support. Chris Hucalak said: As a foster carer living in a regional town, I value the work of therapeutic practitioners regardless of all disciplines. Iaposm sure that this family provides a welcome service in Perth,moving their business to a regional location such as here in Portland, Victoria gets them over the line, then Iaposm sure I could arrange a warm welcome. Moya Hughes said: Appalling! this family have made a lovely le for their children, made a successful business and contributed to the Australian economy more than most. What is going on  Seriously, the Australian government need to show more common sense. This family is an asset to this country.

Neil Maxwell was thrust into the spotlight on Channel ’s Benefits Street as a tattooed skinhead who was seen dealing cannabis, smoking dope and taking pills. And he had won fans from the very first episode, when he strolled to court in a vest and shorts, only to miss a bus and turn up late. Today he has been jailed for  years for the brutal murder of Lee Cooper. Mr Cooper, , was brutally kicked, stamped on, stripped naked, slashed and bludgeoned to death in a rampage of violence shortly before Christmas, the court heard. He suffered  injuries including multiple skull fractures, bleeding and swelling to the brain and  puncture wounds to his back. As he was jailed, Maxwell shouted that is absolutely sound.    The self-styled King of Kids was also a role model to young boys on the Tilery Estate in Stockton-on-Tees, who were often seen congregating outside his flat. But Maxwell was a far nastier piece of work than the TV cameras captured. In fact by the time the show aired in May , the cocaine addict was serving a two-year sentence for stabbing a man in a block of flats. He had slashed him across the back leaving three deep wounds, one cm long, reports Teesside Live . Then in December , soon after he was released, Maxwell was jailed again for two and a half years for a series of brutal assaults on his former lover after featuring on the programme. High on Spice, jobless Maxwell pushed his ex-partner down the stairs, swung her around by her hair and threw a television at her at the home they shared. When the woman tried to climb out of the window, Maxwell pulled her back, punching her in the face before throwing a car seat at her and pouring a can of pineapple juice over her head, the court heard.  Maxwell claimed he had “ramped up” his drug taking because of the fame the show had brought him, and he had launched the attack after his girlfriend had gone to the cashpoint to take out money to buy crack cocaine. The charges of assault and  imprisonment added to an already shameful rap sheet, which included robbery, fraud, resisting arrest, dealing drugs and shining laser pens at police helicopters. But any pretence that the reality star was just a lovable yob ended on December  last year. After hearing that Lee Cooper was among men who had attacked a friend living in a Stockton hostel, he sent a text message saying “al put this blade straight through that scatty **** lee”. Cooper, , was arrested for the assault, then bailed at am. At .am Maxwell’s injured friend was chased down a town centre street after he saw Cooper and heard someone shout “that’s the one that grassed you up”.  Within minutes Neil Maxwell, with cocaine and cannabis in his system, was on the warpath. During a two-hour rampage, he and Luke Pearson, , attacked Matthew Elsy, slashing him on the back and maiming him for le, before assaulting his own school friend James ‘Jogga’ Jackson at a hostel for no apparent reason. Then, shortly after am, Lee Cooper and two other men arrived on the street, armed with a hammer, a pole and a vacuum cleaner pipe. After emerging from the house, Maxwell and Cooper began by hugging each other. But violence erupted as Cooper headbutted Maxwell, knocking him into a car then kicking him. After a stand off, Maxwell took a weapon - most likely a hammer - and chased Mr Cooper down the street.  After knocking him to the ground, he carried on hitting him, slashing his face and body and Pearson joined in. Lee Cooper was also attacked with a Stanley kne, knuckle duster and a TV stand, stripped naked and sustained more than  injuries including multiple skull fractures. After the attack Maxwell reportedly stood over dying Cooper and said: “You deserve it, ‘coz you did my mate.” Later at a police station, Maxwell showed no remorse, even bragging about the murder to officers. He crowed: “He got a good hiding, yeah, and he deserved it and I’m proud I did it. I leathered that daft ****.  He dismissed Cooper’s injuries as “chicken scratches”, adding: “He’s lucky I didn’t cut his f***ing throat.” Stepping into the witness box months later, however, Maxwell claimed partial amnesia due to drug use, saying: “I just went berserk”. And he apologised to his victim’s family, claiming he felt “disgraced” and “gutted for the lad and his family”. He said: “Whatever happens I deserve what I get, basically.” Maxwell’s court evidence revealed glimpses of a shockingly warped view of violence. Slicing victims’ backs was in Maxwell’s eyes simply “a bit of a warning”, a message on the back not to p*** about with me, “nothing that’s going to be seen”. He said matter-of-factly: “I know it’s not nice and I don’t condone it but it’s generally what I’ve done, under certain conditions. “I would rather do that than kill somebody or take an organ out. It just sends a message out. There’s no internal damage or nothing like that.”  He denied Mr Cooperaposs murder and tried to reduce his responsibility to manslaughter on the grounds of loss of control. But the jury never got to consider his case after Judge Stephen Ashurst rejected his defence. He said: There is no sufficient evidence from which a properly directed jury could reasonably conclude the partial defence of loss of control might apply. Put shortly, there is compelling evidence that Neil Maxwell did not lose control at all. From the first hammer blow to the last disfiguring slash to Cooperaposs back, he was completely in control. He said the evidence pointed to the administration in cold blood of ferocious violence. Both Maxwell and Pearson were found guilty at Teesside Crown Court on Monday. Maxwell was jailed for  years and Pearson was sentenced to a minimum term of  years.

Meghan, who is currently on maternity leave, joined the charity after she and Harry announced their engagement in late .  Author and body language expert Judi James tellsabout the subtle signs that suggested a ide was on the cards... It was relatively easy to see this foursome wasn’t going to work out as a team when they first launched on stage. Meghan might have been the newbie team member but when it was her turn to speak her pace, energy and her keenness to establish the fact that she had experience in this kind of work - and therefore value to the team - was both unexpected and rather pleasantly stunning. She was eloquent and confident and sounded very much like someone keen to hit the ground running, making as much change as possible in a short space of time.    While the others referred to scribbling notes and ideas down on the back of a fag packet Meghan sounded organised and passionate - and more like a woman who uses wall charts and forward planners. Kate had always been a rather unconfident speaker and it was probably expected that Meghan would start in a similar way and build up her confidence as a royal slowly and gradually. But there was a distinct air of leap-frogging about the dynamic as though Meghan had arrived fully-formed and raring to go. Then there was that memorable moment when the ‘team’ were askedthere had been conflicts and William immediately let out that ‘Oh yeah’ reply that was almost a groan.    Kate and Meghan laughed knowingly, with Meghan allowing her hair to form a cut-off to hide her facial expression. She even touched Harry in the way you often do when you’re trying to make light of any arguments or rts. The four obviously work in very dferent ways.  Anyone in a business situation would have spotted the lack of team potential among them from the outset.

Construction worker Chris Lodge, , and business owner Sharon Lodge, , are so busy with work and caring for their disabled dog Dice, , that they havenapost been able to take time off to go abroad. But Chris decided in June  to bring that holiday feeling to them by turning their back garden into a tropical tiki wonderland. He threw every free evening and weekend he had over  months into the mammoth project - despite having no experience of gardening whatsoever.    After digging out the lawn, Chris built a beautul timber, drtwood and rope bridge across the garden which is surrounded by luscious green palm trees and succulents. The bridge leads to a tiki hut, which Chris and Sharon call their aposFreaky Tikiapos, filled with a timber bar built by Chris, tropical trinkets and gorgeous timber engraved bar stools. While it has been no small undertaking with the couple forking out £, on the project, Chris says every penny and hour of hard work has been worth it. Not only can he, Sharon and boxer dog Dice now wander to the bottom of their garden and aposescapeapos but the venture has also ignited a passion for gardening in Chris.    Chris, of Wollaston, Northamptonshire, said: We used to love our holidays but we have a big business and I work a lot. The business suddenly took off and went a bit crazy and weaposve really been pushing it so we struggle to find the time now. We havenapost been able to go on holiday for about six years. Our dog also suffers from little seizures now and then so we donapost like to leave him. Weaposre both housebound and office-bound.  So I decided, I would bring the holiday to us so we can enjoy. Now we can go to the bottom of the garden and escape in a tropical paradise. We can come down here to our tiki hut and grab a cocktail or a latte and relax. You feel like youaposre on the other side of the world. Youaposd never guess youaposre at the bottom of a garden in the UK. I want it to be a place where all our friends can come tootheyaposre having a bad day or feeling down. I want it to be a place where people can just get away.    I just love to do things that make people happy and put a smile on their faces. It has taken some time and itaposs swallowed up about £, but itaposs all worth it as long as it makes us and other people smile. After living in their home for  years, Chris finally found the time to build an extension two years ago and decided to tackle the garden at the same time.  A willow tree at the bottom of their lawn reminded Chris of a jungle-themed fairground ride he used to go on as a child. Chris poured hours into researching which tropical plants could best withstand British weather and used online tutorial videos to learn all the tricks of the gardening trade. With an aposeye for detailapos, years of construction and a helping hand from his mate Rob, Chris has really put his own aposfunky and dferentapos stamp on his garden. His aposFreaky Tikiapos hut was a wooden shed purchased for £, which Chris then transformed with dried grass roofing, an optical illusion tropical window and exotic decorations.    No expense has been spared with some plants costing £ each and tiki mugs that adorn the barn specially imported from America. Chris said: I didnapost have any gardening experience at all before this - apart from keeping the odd cactus or venus fly trap on the window sill when I was younger. But a couple of years ago I started an extension on our house and decided it was time to do the garden as well. Thereaposs a willow tree at the bottom of the garden that really inspired the jungle theme. The way the canopy hangs down made it feel a bit like a rainforest. So I started looking into tropical gardening and all the things you could do even living in this country. It really got me. I was hooked. So many friends have seen what Iaposve done and theyaposve never been into gardening before but now theyaposre starting to take it up. I love that Iaposve showed people what you can achieve.

As with all royal events, the celebration comes with a whole host of unusual and strict traditions, and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge stuck to these when they christened Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis. Despite their previous record of breaking the rules itaposs believed that Meghan and Harry plan to stick to the royal aposrulesapos for Archieaposs special day.  Here are some of the royal christening traditions: Gown Despite being a senior member of the royal family, Archie wonapost get a fancy new gown for his christening. But instead, he will wear something extremely special which is an important part of his familyaposs history. Heaposll wear a replica of the silk and lace christening gown worn by all royal babies since .    The original was commissioned by Queen Victoria for her daughter Victoria and was worn by  royal babies, including the Queen.

Parts of Britain looks set to bake in the heat, although it may be ruined by thunderstorms, which are expected this weekend and next week. The Met Office has issued a yellow weather warning for Sunday and Monday for nearly the whole of England, apart from the south-west, and all of Wales. Forecasters think thunderstorms will batter the UK on both days, with a chance of flooding, hail and strong winds, although temperatures will reach the mid s in some places.  However, things will pick up on Tuesday as a heatwave hits the UK, with the country set to enjoy the hottest days so far this year, although there is still a chance of storms. A Met Office spokesman said: Unsettled, very warm and humid weather is likely to continue for many through Tuesday with showers breaking out, especially in the south. There is uncertainty in the location of these, but they will be heavy with thunderstorms bringing the potential for torrential downpours.    Through the second half of the week, much of the UK is likely to remain humid and very warm, perhaps hot giving the possibility of further heavy showers and thunderstorms. Some cooler conditions are expected to spread in from the west at times, perhaps most likely towards the end of the week. A spokesman for netweather.tv added: The weekend is nearly here, and June will soon be over. There is a signal for heat and humidity next week accompanied by thunderstorm. The fresh east winds spread over Scotland later on Monday, falling light further south leaving a muggy night before the heat could really build on Tuesday and temperatures may reach into the s. The June record is .C from .  London should see highs of C on Monday, C on Tuesday, C on Wednesday and C on Thursday, with the temperatures then dropping.  There should be sunshine in many places, although there will also be showers. There will be sunny intervals for most of the country today and tomorrow, with fairly temperatures reaching C. The warm weather is a welcome relief from the flooding and rainfall of the past week, which saw the Met Office issue an amber aposdanger to leapos weather warning. June has been a washout so far this year, with the month looking to be one of the wettest on record.  The dampest recorded June was in , although it appears this month will smash that record given the extreme rainfall in recent days.

Who in Argyll and Bute is responsible for this plan  How many of the outcomes have been achieved As someone who has been involved with autism personally and professionally for many years, I find it extremely disappointing there seems to be an inability by those in authority to get organised enough to address the issues and provide services for autistic people and their families.There is no need for further drafts and consultations.Someone in the authority needs to take responsibility for the existing strategy and implementation plan and get on with it.Maureen Mackintosh, Ardrishaig.Sir,Scotland’s small building firms had a strong start to , in contrast to the UK construction small and medium sized enterprisesector, according to the Federation of Master BuildersScotland.The FMB State of Trade Survey for the first quarter of , the only quarterly assessment of the UK-wide SME construction sector, showed SME workloads declined for the first time in six years.In Scotland, however, there was a jump of  per cent compared with the previous quarter. Thirty per cent of weighted responses were positive, up from  per cent from the fourth quarter of .It is encouraging the Scottish construction industry is bucking the wider Brexit trend with workloads and enquires in rude health. The UK-wide picture is very dferent, with the construction SME sector overall contracting for the first time in six years.Scotland’s good fortune could be due to fewer EU workers being based north of the border compared with other parts of the country, like in London where one in three construction workers are from the EU.Relying less heavily on migrant workers has meant the Scottish construction industry hasn’t fallen foul of thousands of EU workers ing home during the long march to Brexit due to no longer feeling welcome in the UK or sure of their future here.Scotland’s builders, however, must not be complacent. Looking ahead, the First Minister has indicated thatthe UK does leave the EU later this year, she wants a second independence referendum before the next Scottish Parliament election in . This additional political uncertainty, on top of the continued uncertainty stemming from Brexit, could impact on the construction sector in Scotland.The fear is a looming second referendum could test consumer confidence this year and next. For construction SMEs, this is particularly concerning as their prospects are vulnerable to dips in consumer confidence as so much work comes from the private domestic sector.Gordon Nelson, Director of FMB Scotland.Sir,I was joined by my fellow Conservative councillors in Kilmory recently as we discussed atthe numerous challenges facing Argyll and Bute.Ferry sailings, roads, education and the SNP#s late single farm payments were all mentioned.With the SNP hammering local authority spending and cutting our budgets, challenges in delivering services will become more prevalent.Despite this climate of cuts from the separatists, Conservative councillors are delivering for Argyll. This includes extra funding for the Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund, more funding for infrastructure and an increase in roads winter maintenance resources across Argyll.As ever, my fellow Conservatives and I will continue to fight non stop to make sure our rural constituency is not sidelined by this unceasingly urban and separatism-obsessed over centralising Scottish Government.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and Islands ward.Sir,I photographed this unusual visitor to Kilduskland Road, Ardrishaig, on April .

Design fleets comprising the Sigma s, Sonatas, Etchells and Hunter s joined the racing at Tarbert.Amid a flurry of rib activity laying and moving marks, it was not long before the CYCA  passage race fleet approached the finish line.The teams later caught up in the bar for the day one prize giving as new event chairman Glenn Porter welcomed everyone to Tarbert. With a number of races omitted due to protests, it was a nice easy start for Glenn.The Hunter s and Sonatas saw a spread of results after some close racing. The CYCA class  fleet on the Largs passage race was won on corrected time by Celtic Spirit. Additional prizes were awarded to Encore for the passage race line honours and Shona of Ashton for toughing it out at the rear of the passage race.Saturday was a much more challenging day on the water with a light wind and dreich drizzle.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"fountainhead megayacht spotted in tarbert harbour","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowTarbert enjoyed a short visit from the megayacht Fountainhead, a  Feadship built for American billionaire Eddie Lampert, chief executive officer of American store Sears.At .m , she is the th biggest yacht in the world, registered in the Cayman Islands.

fluttering in the breeze above them.Father Tony Lappin was a newly welcomed guest to this spectacle only a year prior.

The day after the crash, Superintendent Jim Guy of Strathclyde Police said there had been no evidence from the crew of any problems before the tragedy.He said the evidence available suggested an accident rather than terrorist attack.

These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area. In the winter one would have to wear a wetsuit, of course, but the conditions are ideal and the wave forms have great potential # after all, they are coming straight in from the Atlantic over the north of Ireland.#What I#d like to see is a surf club established in Campbeltown. It could become a great asset from a tourist and amenity point of view.#And any Kintyre people who really took up the sport would have a great advantage over other surfers when it comes to competition because they have the benefit of readily available beaches all year round.#If this club gets going, the chances are that the British surf champions in the years to come will be Kintyre people.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOOrr Ewing CupFootballers were favoured with beautul weather last Saturday and the games played on Kinloch Park in the Orr Ewing Cup competition brought together very large gatherings of spectators.The match in the afternoon was brought to a sudden termination by an unfortunate dispute over the award of a goal. The opposing teams were Kintyre and HMS Thames.Kintyre opened strongly and after  minutes# play had scored twice. The dispute arose over the award of the second goal, which Thames claimed to be offside.The referee, Mr Duncan McCallum, an old Hearts player, was of a dferent opinion, and on his allowing Kintyre the goal, the naval team without more do walked off the field.It is understood that the Thames team intimated to the league at the weekly meeting on Monday night their withdrawal from the competition.The teams were: Kintyre # Jas McKinlay: James Black and Archd Sharp: M Muir, A McCrank and T Cameron: R McGeachy and D Brown: Dan McNaughton: N Scally and J Donaldson.HMS Thames # Meese: Jesseman and Love: McCloud, Hirst and Fernie: Dunnell and Weekes: McGeachy: Slynn and Segrott.Referee # Mr D McCallum.In the evening, the opposing teams were Campbeltown and Kilbrannan. A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week june 7 2019","story":"As I retreat into the comfort of a warm house and an even warmer coffee, I wonder what it must have been like for Columba and his fellow monks as they made their way from the shores of Ireland to the wilds of Argyll.The fragile shell of a coracle was not the most effective shelter against the wildness of our coastline.Yet they came.

To kick everyone out after a few incidents seems to me really unfair.ldquoThere were young kids there who were very upset and humiliated.ldquoAs I understand it, the people responsible for what happened had offered to leave so that the rest of us could stay. It seemed cruel to kick every single one of us out.ldquoWe were on the bus when members of the security team came on and cut the childrenrsquos wristbands off [for entry to the park] which was really unnecessary.ldquoMy daughter was crying, it was disgusting behaviour.ldquoWhen it came time for us to leave after packing up our stuff, we had to walk to the place of pick-up and wait for the buses, watched by security guards the whole way.ldquoWhen we got to the place we were getting picked up from, we then found out that they werenrsquot going to allow the buses into the park. My daughter had her walker with her instead of her chair and was already struggling at how far she had had to travel there was no way they could ask her to walk another fair distance to the buses.ldquoIt was after what felt like ages, and I had kicked up a bit of a fuss, they finally let the buses come down to us to collect us.

Itrsquos in such a beautul part of our county that the journey there was an adventure in itself.The loch is hidden, surrounded by a wood which embraces its secrets. Irsquod never visited it before, but Irsquod been told how magical this place is and that it has a story attached to it.Finding an appropriate place to park was our first challenge. There is no direct access to the loch and no car park with signposts, so care is needed in finding a suitable place. A private farm road that takes you to the entrance gate is not an option, so initially I struggled to find a suitable place, but some kind advice from a friendly farmer helped us out.Itrsquos a perfect time of year for such an adventure. The woods are fully clothed and still echoing with birdsong. I like to explore new places initially without a map or guide. It adds to the adventure, as we had to decide which way to go and initially wonderedwersquod taken the wrong route. But there is a circular walk around the loch, so once the path is discovered there isnrsquot a wrong way.It is a beautul and tranquil place, and as we wandered along the tree-lined loch I thought about the story of the man responsible for its creation.That man was Harry Younger, of the well-known brewing family. His ancestor, William Younger, had been the man who had built up the famous brewing business which produced Youngerrsquos Ale. A huge chunk of the Canongate in Edinburgh was taken over by their Holyrood brewery, including the site where the Scottish Parliament now sits.When William Younger died in , he was a hugely wealthy and successful businessman but also, it seems, exhausted and overworked. The empire he left was continued by the family but eventually in , the Younger enterprise was merged with rivals McEwanrsquos, to form Scottish Brewers Ltd.This merger, the reasons for which are another story, meant the Younger family branched out into other ventures. In the s, Harry Younger, the then head of the family, bought the land at Baro and began transforming it into the haven of nature it now is.Harry led an interesting and privileged le. He was an internationally known curler who regularly competed and won trophies. His intention was to create a new home amid the beauty of this area of East Lothian. He set about building a house, but also developed Bara Loch as it now exists and surrounded it with an embrace of trees.But the dark clouds of the Second World War intervened in his plans to enjoy this paradise. He had attended Sandhurst in his earlier years and seen the last months of the First World War. He remained involved in the Territorial Army and in January  he was sent to France as commander of a mechanised unit.It is recorded that he was killed in action on June  at St Valery-en-Caux. His unit, the Lothian and Border Horse, had been part of the brave and ferocious defence of the Dunkirk beaches. Anyone with knowledge of this action will understand the hell and desperation of that defence, and the supreme courage and sacrice of the defenders.Harry died on the day these brave defenders had to finally surrender, after over , had been evacuated from the beaches. How he died, what horrors he witnessed, we can only guess. He lies buried in the St Valery-en-Caux Franco-British Cemetery.And so this is the story attached to this beautul place. The man who began its creation never got the chance to enjoy it.In our walk, we arrived at a stone seat overlooking the loch. It had a worn inscription on it. We could make out the words lsquoin memoryrsquo or lsquomemorialrsquo and lsquoYoungerrsquo, but the rest was too worn.But I knew this must be a memorial to Harry Younger, which was later confirmed when I found a wonderful blog called Walking East Lothian in which the author explained he had traced the inscription to reveal Harryrsquos name and the date , the year of the lochrsquos creation.I sat on the seat and watched my kids play in the wood. The trees on the north side arch over the waterline to catch the sunlight, creating a canopy which dips into the loch. The serene tranquillity and beauty of the place is no doubt what Harry intended.But that in a sense is part of the magic of this place. As the pioneer Nelson Henderson once said to his son: ldquoThe true meaning of le is to plant trees under whose shade you do not expect to sit.It was these words I was reflecting on as I watched my children play. Harry was of course wealthy but we can all plant trees, either real ones or metaphorical ones, as a legacy for others.The recent death of a fellow storyteller and all-round wonderful woman, Ros Parkyn, was also on my mind. I had spoken about this place to her and of my intention to visit it. She loved nature too and would have gladly come along with me. But I sadly left it too late.Ros encapsulated all that was good and compassionate about humanity and she also planted many trees, some in the ground for she was a nature lover, but even more were planted in the hearts of those who knew her. They all now will grown as part of her wonderful legacy.As we left the wood, butterflies and blue dragonflies accompanied me, along with thoughts of my friend Ros and a man I didnrsquot know but whose trees shaded us.I willin autumn to see the colours and pay quiet homage to those who leave this world having made a positive dference."},{"url":null,"title":"new-primary-school-at-letham-mains-starting-to-take-shape","story":"Work began on Letham Mains Primary School, on Haddingtonrsquos western edge, earlier this year.The

Tranentrsquos eastern edge, despite the land being earmarked solely for economic development.Developers insisted that the only way to bring businesses onto the site was by generating funds from the sale of the new homes.They argued that making the site suitable for development would cost pound.million and it was not viable without housing.However, East Lothian Council rejected their plans at a meeting in August when officers insisted the site should be retained for employment use.Councillor John McMillan, economic spokesperson, referenced the Kevin Costner movie Field of Dreams when he told colleagues: ldquoIf we build it, they will come.Developers appealed to the Scottish Government to overturn their decision, insisting the local authority had failed to acknowledge the evidence they had provided which, they said, demonstrated the need for enabling residential development on the land.However, the Scottish Government Reporter appointed to investigate the appeal has now rejected their argument, siding with the council.He said that the Local Development Plan for East Lothian had set aside the land at Kingslaw for economic development and it should be retained as such.And he pointed out that the housing proposed by Barratt,which was described as lsquowindfallrsquo housing ndash which refers to a site which becomes available unexpectedly ndash would ldquosimply supplement an already generous housing land supply.Despite rejecting the appeal, the reporter said that he accepted the views of the developers and the District Valuer that the site was not financially viable as employment land in the current market conditions.He said: ldquoWhile I cannot be certain that there is no prospect of a business or industrial use being realised on the whole site, the information for this appeal indicates that, in the current economic conditions, it would be unlikely.However, he questioned whether the plans to build  houses and provide the local authority with . hectares of ldquoserviced land to build business units on it were possible, with no evidence the units would be created or could operate next to the new residential development.The reporter said: ldquoI find that the housing proposed would not directly enable commercial development to take place.ldquoAlthough not likely to be currently viable, the site would be removed as a strategic long-term employment option.East Lothian Council welcomed the ruling which is the first housing appeal to have been ruled in their favour since their new Local Development Plan was adopted.Councillor Norman Hampshire, planning convenor, said: ldquoWe welcome the outcome of this appeal both in the context of the Scottish Government Reporter upholding a decision that was carefully considered by East Lothianrsquos Planning Committee, and of course in respect of our adopted East Lothian Local Development Plan , which is now the basis of all planning considerations in East Lothian and provides clear guidance on

There are several factors influencing this, but the major factor which has tipped the balance is the extended funding hours and the negative impact this is having both financially on small businesses, like Mary Poppins, and to the quality of early learning and childcare.New Scottish Government policy instructs councils to increase their funded childcare hours from  to , by . This move also includes longer opening hours and a move from term time to year-round opening hours to attempt to make childcare more nationally accessible.Ms Dewar said: ldquoThe money received for funded places does not cover the costs of providing the quality of early learning and childcare which we want and are required to provide, especially with regards to staff costs.ldquoThe timescales and measures that the Scottish Government has put in place to educate a workforce to meet the increased requirements are insufficient, and there is a serious shortfall to meet the requirements of the extended funding.ldquoEast Lothian Council indicated it estimated it would require approximately  staff to facilitate the increase in funded hours in East Lothian. The majority of these posts are early learning and childcare practitioners.ldquoThe local authority advertises early learning practitioner posts at between pound. and pound. per hour. Private nurseries are unable to compete with these rates of pay due to the funding rates we are allocated.A group of parents and staff, including Ms Dewar, are visiting county MSP Iain Gray to discuss the problems, but Ms Dewar added that unless he can ldquowork a miracle and change the policy, then it is unlikely the decision to close the nursery will be reversed.When asked about the nursery, Mr Gray said: ldquoThe loss of any nursery provision is disappointing, particularly with the Governmentrsquos , funded hours policy set to be implemented next year.ldquoIn the case of the Mary Poppins Nursery, the owner has highlighted a number of factors that have contributed to their decision to close.ldquoI have written to East Lothian Council about some of these issues.ldquoHowever, there are also wider issues at play here. The nursery sector has been warning the Scottish Government that private nurseries are struggling in the run-up to the roll-out of its flagship , policy from August .ldquoMinisters must act quickly to address the sectorrsquos concerns and ensure that the capacity exists to deliver the funded hours next year.A Scottish Government spokesperson said: ldquoIt is, of course, concerning to hear of any nursery considering closure, and the obvious effects this might have on staff, parents and children.ldquoEast Lothian Council has provided assurance that they will support families to find alternative early learning and childcare places for children who had been expecting to use the Mary Poppins Nursery from this August.Ms Dewar added: ldquoI am distraught that circumstances have forced me to this decision and that such a wonderful place for children to experience their early years is to close.The decision was met with an outpouring of grief on social media.The nurseryrsquos recent th birthday was marked with a garden party.The nursery was founded by Sue Armstrong, affectionately still called lsquoMiss Suersquo, after she had written to Mary Poppins author P L Travers to askshe could use the name.Miss Sue said: ldquoI received many letters from P L Travers about the nursery.ldquoAt the beginning, she wanted to know what the nursery was going to be like. She had no objection to me using the name, she just wanted to find out more. I ended up meeting her as well.ldquoWe were hoping to get her to come and open the nursery  years ago, but her arthritis was bad. We stayed in touch, however. I would send her letters about how the nursery was getting on along with photos, and she would write back saying how she liked it, and ideas of what to do.ldquoShe said that the children should be encouraged to make up their own stories. lsquoChildren like doing that,rsquo she said.Miss Sue sold the nursery to Ms Dewar in  as she was ldquosick of all the paperwork.She said. ldquoWhen I heard it was to close down, well, itrsquos just all so sad really. Itrsquos such a terrible shame.ldquoIt is such a nice and happy place for the children, homely and warm. Itrsquos just awful that it canrsquot stay open.Miss Sue still attends events at the nursery, dressed as the iconic nanny Mary Poppins.She added: ldquoIn the film, Mary Poppins says that shersquoll stay until the winds change.

This really is an exceptional moment in politics. Everyone says that Boris Johnson is unreliable, untruthful, unfaithful, unruly and unpredictable. Yet, he is almost certainly going to be our next Prime Minister. How did we get here Hes a chat show celebrity, of course. But its not ashes seen in a positive light by the media glitterati. Last week, Ian Hislop, the lead list on BBCs Have I Go News For You, on which Boris famously starred, called for him to be jailed. TV presenters loathe Johnson, which is why his minders have tightly controlled his TV studio exposure. He has been pilloried in the press, rubbished on social media and disowned by Tory cabinet ministers.Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Tory leader, made no secret of her dislike for the former London Mayor and even launched a campaign, ldquoOperation Arse to stop him. The Conservative Scottish Secretary, David Mundell, said he ldquowouldnt serve in a Johnson cabinet . But somehow all this bounces off the Teflon Blonde. In last weeks first round of voting, Johnson won more that twice the votes of his nearest rival.The short answer of course is Brexit, but that doesnt explain why Tory MPs are so keen to have this recklessly outspoken politician as their leader. The other candidates are no less Brexity than he is. Yet he is crushing the le out of them.Iain Macwhirter: Brace yourselves, wersquore in for a Trump-Johnson double actHard man Dominic ldquokarate Raab, is a dedicated No Dealer, yet he was left gasping on the canvas after last weeks votes. The Environment Secretary, Michael Gove, is still in the race, despite his cocaine confessions, but only just. Sajid Javid, has ldquoalso ran written all over him, despite winning the support of Ruth Davidson.This just leaves the Foreign Secretary, Jeremy Hunt, as the safety-first candidate. Hell probably win enough votes to come second to Johnson and be one of the two candidates offered to the wider Conservative Party membership. But he is so colourless - a male version of Theresa May - that hes most unlikely to succeed. Tories realise that this isnt the time for safety-first candidates. Theyve been there done that.Media commentators have been talking up the ldquoWhite Walker, Development Secretary, Rory Stewart, who squeaked into the second round. He certainly has a good back story, with his wanderings in Afghanistan, and possesses the effortless self-confidence that only an Eton education can provide. Hes a youthful breath of fresh air, but Tories arent interested in fresh air right now. They prefer the fug of populism.Which leaves us with Boris Johnson as the next Prime Minister. Even as I write that again I can still hardly believe it. Consider this testimonial by one of Johnsons former employers. ldquoHe is a far more ruthless, and frankly nastier figure than the public appreciates...I would not take Boriss word about whether it is Monday or Tuesday.. He is not a man to believe in, to trust or respect, save as a superlative exhibitionist.That was Johnsons former editor, Max Hastings, of the Tory-supporting Daily. In the same article, Hastings said thatJohnson ever became Prime Minister hed be ldquoon the first plane out of Britain. I hope hes booked his tickets.: Scottish Tory MP warns Boris Johnson against trying to \"subvert\" leadership voteEveryone knows that the former London Mayor was sacked as a journalist for lying, and then again as a junior minister for lack of candour. His infidelities are legion. Hersquos barely capable of appearing in public without provoking offence, usually from ethnic minorities. Three years ago he won pound from the Spectator magazine for a limerick that referred to the President of Turkey having sex with a goat.You think Im making that up, dont you  But the next PM really did write this about of President Recip Erdogan: ldquoThere was a young fellow from Ankara. Who was a terric w@nkerer. Till he sowed his wild oats. With the help of a goat. But he didnt even stop to thankera. Dont think hell be reprising that when he meets the Turkish President.The Tories used to be the sober, serious and sensible party. The political wing of the Anglican Church. Its in the name: ldquoConservative. So what are they doing electing this man  Are Tory MPs so addled by Brexit they cant see whats coming  A Prime Minister as chaotic and unpredictable as Donald Trump.In many ways, Boris Johnson seems the polar opposite of Trump. In terms of education, wit, literary ability and social background, he couldnt be more dferent to the belligerent billionaire. But they share one important characteristic: they are charismatic populists. They are rule breakers, who can be guaranteed to defy convention, for good or ill. Theyre not really politicians in the conventional sense, but anti-politicians, repositories of popular discontent.Many voters like Boris because he is the embodiment of political incorrectness. He is guaranteed to provoke outrage from the professional offence-takers and social justice warriors who populate social media. Many middle Americans voted for Donald Trump, not because they expected him to be a model president, but because he would upset self-righteous scolds who tell people what to say and what to think. The woke s of the culture wars, who police the language of ersity, and condemn jokes about gays, women or racial minorities.Boris is also someone who will make trouble, and many voters want to make trouble right now. That is why, paradoxically, the party of the establishment, is embracing someone whose demeanour seems so anti-establishment. Conservatives know that the only thing that matters is getting power and keeping it. Back in the day, this involved electing boring politicians in sensible suits who wouldnt frighten the middle classes and would invite deference from in the lower orders. Politicians behaved like bank managers, headmasters, churchmen.But the middle classes have been plunged into insecurity by the financial crash, working people no longer defer to authority figures, and respect for religion has largely vanished from our secular public realm. In many ways, the passing of deference is a good thing. But we have also become an irritable and fractious society that doesnt know what it wants, but wants it now. Brexit is a touchstone issue here: a political project which no one really understands, because it is about complex trading law, but on which everyone has an emotionally-charged point of view.Boris Johnson, is natural material for these emotive times. He is a performance artist, really, a living commentary on the state of society. A politician of shting principle, who is not expected to honour his promises, and whose moral compass is his own ambition. So, prepare for a bumpy ride. The one thing Boris Johnson will never be is boring."},{"url":null,"title":"Marianne Taylor  March on the Tories  not the BBC  over free TV licences","story":"Older folk on this side of the Atlantic are indeed preparing to change out of their slippers, albeit for a very dferent cause. Thousands of pensioners plan to march this week on BBC sites across the UK in protest at the corporationrsquos announcement that from  it will stop giving free TV licences to everyone aged over , at a cost of poundm a year, moving instead to a means-tested system where only those claiming pension credit will be exempt from paying the pound. annual fee.Read more: Pensioners to march in fury over BBC licence fee grabThe National Pensioners Conventionwhich is organising the protest, off the back of an Age UK petition that has already garnered more than half a million signatures, has called the BBCrsquos move ldquocallous and cruel.The NPC claims the issue is ldquouniting generations when the reality, of course, is that universal benefits for pensioners like this one and the winter fuel allowance ndash which costs around poundbn a year ndashincreasingly ides society by age, with the gap between older, private-pensioned, property-rich haves and younger, debt-ridden have-nots growing by the day.What really dispirits me about the outcry over this move, however, is the way in which large sections of society have fallen hook, line and sinker for the Tory ploy to blame the BBC. The corporation was, after all, left in a no-win situation when it was landed with free licences as part of its settlement in . If it continues to fund them for all over s, the very services viewers and listeners say they value, that mark the corporation out from lesser commercial broadcasters ndash the peerless radio output, BBC and BBC ndash would have to go.Read more: Pensioners to march in fury over BBC licence fee grabAnd make no mistake, this isnrsquot just an opportunistic shting of responsibility for an unpopular policy from Government to BBC, though it seems ridiculous that anyone would believe a broadcaster would or should be in charge of welfare policy. Rather, it is a calculated move as part of a much bigger, more ideological and potentially damaging attack on our public institutions.How George Osborne, the former Tory chancellor who made the decision to cut funding for free TV licences, must have laughed over the last week as he put out article after article about the brouhaha in the newspaper he now edits, the London Evening Standard.The joke, of course, is on us. Mr Osborne and his chum David Cameron were two of the most blatantly mendacious politicians of the modern era. It is they who sowed the seeds of the dangerous political situation we currently find ourselves in, who set the standard for the motley crew of charlatans and nersquoer-do-wells lining up to lead the country further into oblivion.Letrsquos do a quick recap. Despite casting themselves in  as modern, centrist one-nation Conservatives, the Cameron administrationrsquos post-crash austerity narrative disguised a strategy specically designed to run-down, undermine and under-fund our public institutions and services. Indeed, this agenda, taken alongside the EU referendum, suggest Cameron and Osborne were doing the work of the Tory hard right from the off. We should have remembered from the s that the Tories are past masters when it comes to ide and rule. And yet here we are in , iding ourselves into ldquothem and ldquous politically, constitutionally, culturally, economically, on the precipice of a disastrous no-deal Brexit under an odiously populist leader. The services and institutions that used to anchor us on common ground, the post-war settlement that encompassed social housing, the NHS, the BBC, have or are in the process of being deliberately, ideologically undermined.And by attacking the BBC over free licences, we are doing the work of these ideologues.Though I do not agree with the view that all over-s should get a free TV licence, I respect the NPCrsquos demand to retain the benefit. The plan to march on the BBC, however, is not only wrong-headed but plays straight into the hands of those who would like to see our remaining public services either privatised or obliterated.More likely to vote than other groups and with higher incomes, older people now have more clout than ever before they should use it by putting on their marching shoes and heading to Conservative HQ."},{"url":null,"title":"TV REVIEW  Who won the Tory manspreading contest ","story":"Not THE Boris Johnson, blonder than Harlow, more reclusive than Garbo, the dude the media cannot tame  The very same.

This could take the form of increased headage payments under the existing beef calf support scheme.The SBA, along with NFU Scotland and other industry stakeholders, have been pressing Mr Ewing on the issue and SBA chairman, Neil McCorkindale, was hoping for an announcement by the Cabinet Secretary at the event.This didn’t materialise but Mr Ewing indicated he was sympathetic to the plea and accepted the argument that headage payments would be a more effective approach than area based support which would simply encourage inertia in the industry.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..!

Not content with writing just one book, he decided to author two: one will be the scuttle story in photographs, From Scuttle to Salvage, which will be launched this Thursday, June . The  other, The Last Days of the High Seas Fleet, is the more in depth story of the German Naval mutiny, and how the Fleet came to be interned in Scapa. Both are on sale at the Orcadian Bookshop.As with Jutland, Nick decided to tell the story in film. He is passionate about passing history on to his childrens’ generation, and says he felt that this would be a best way of reaching younger people who prefer video to text. The -minute animation has already been seen by more than , people online, and was made possible through crowdfunding and the help of numerous museums and archives, the Kirkwall Library and Archives being among them.Nick will be talking about the scuttle on June  at pm at the St Magnus Centre, where with him, many of the descendants will participate. He’ll also talk at Stromness Academy on Monday June , and at Kirkwall Grammar School that afternoon.

No less a figure than Vernon Bogdanor dismissed the prospects of regional devolution or an English parliament in his latest book, preferring more of the same piecemeal municipal efforts that have created ‘metro mayors’ in Manchester and Liverpool.This despite the truth apparent to anyone who looks at the UK’s constitution: the English are born free, but everywhere they are in chains. The  Brexit referendum and everything that’s followed proves there is a growing English political identity, but no specic representation to express it. : Cross-party trio seek constitutional reform to keep Scotland in unionOf course, England and English concerns dominate the UK parliament and the machinery of Westminster government, which presents its own problems. David Cameron’s clumsy, ill-timed attempt to answer the West Lothian question, English Votes for English Laws, is unloved by everyone and has only put the Union at greater risk.The status quo can only endure with continued English indference about how disenfranchised it is. But the level of interest in and support for the Power up the North campaign by  newspapers across the north of England, spanning dferent publishers, is a sign that indference is cracking.Commuters on creaking northern trains know they aren’t being served well by decision-makers in London, and they know there’s no one closer to home who can do anything about it. There’s an inevitable logic to the solution. The north isn’t wealthy, and with the Tories in power, it isn’t particularly powerful either.

The Conservative Party has gone missing before, staying out long past its curfew before dragging itself home days later in a sorry state. This time, though, it looks like it might run away for good.Theresa May’s premiership began with a repudiation of David Cameron’s legacy, both in rhetoric and personnel. She chucked out most of his cabinet, and told the UK’s biggest commercial interests they were harbouring “citizens of nowhere”.Cameron’s project was dressed in social liberalism, on issues like the environment and gay marriage, but on welfare and education reform, and crucially in fiscal policy, it was faithful to core conservative values.May borrowed the outfit with her talk of solving burning injustices, but the shop mannequin that filled it was carried out to skip in the alley.In its place, we were promised a revival of reforming liberal conservatism in the mould of Joseph Chamberlain, delivered by May’s top adviser Nick Timothy.It always seemed unlikely, against the economic and political backdrop of Brexit, and after the  election, those ambitions left Downing Street with Timothy.Even though I’m writing this before the final two candidates for the Tory leadership are confirmed, we know the next Prime Minister is going to be someone who,necessary, is willing to take the UK out of the EU without a Brexit deal, despite the risk that poses to the Union and the economy.We also know the next Prime Minister is likely to pursue deep tax cuts. Boris Johnson, the prohibitive favourite to step into  Downing Street in a month’s time, says it’s his “ambition” to cut tax for higher earners on between £, and £,.: Brexit zealots are happy to throw ‘uppity Jocks’ out of UK – Kenny MacAskillHe has also explicitly rejected the appeal from the current Chancellor to keep to the current policy of continuing to reduce the deficit.Other than Rory Stewart, every candidate has stood on a  of both offering tax giveaways and promising to turn on the spending taps, calculating that the disaffection expressed in votes since  can be blamed on austerity, and at least partially fixable with cash.They are probably right. But it isn’t particularly conservative – and Brexit can be called many things, but it certainly isn’t a One Nation pursuit.Privately, many of Johnson’s supporters admit that they’ve been driven to him out of fear of Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party. They ask for him to be given a chance to govern. He listens to advice, they say, and has the personality to hold his party and the country together. They’re probably going to get the chance to test those pleadings out.Anyway, are there even any small-c conservatives left out there  Are they voting for the Brexit Party or the Tories – and which of the two requires them to hold their noses tighter  It isn’t clear. When even George Osborne as editor of the London Evening Standard is willing to back Johnson, as he did yesterday, you have to question whether the traditional framing of conservatism works anymore.: Brexit: Jeremy Corbyn takes step towards backing second voteBut given the country is probably going to get a Tory Prime Minister reported to have said “f*** business” in response to the concerns of the UK’s biggest employers and taxpayers, whoever and wherever they are, those sorts of conservatives can’t be under the illusion that their values are setting the political agenda.Jeremy Corbyn’s rise and the collapse of the Liberal Democrats made it easy to argue that the centre-left has been hollowed out since the European elections it looks more like the centre-right has gone missing, lured away by the thrill of nationalism.Analysis of the European election results shows the Conservatives have as much,not more to fear from the Liberal Democrats than the Brexit Party. The Lib Dems have a party machinery and a base across the south of England to build on, while parties led by Nigel Farage have won just one Westminster seat in general elections.Whoever it is that leads the Tories back home again, they may find that the electorate has changed the locks.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"bbc scotland figures branded deplorable after 21 shows have no viewers at all","story":" shows recorded no audience some days, according to the Mail on Sunday.The viewing figures prompted media watchers to brand the channel a waste of taxpayer money.But a BBC spokesperson said: \"Its not unusual for digital channels outwith the main five to occasionally record zero audiences.\"According to the Sunday newspaper report, on one particularly quiet day last month the new channel had an average audience of only , people.The figures were gathered from The British Audiences Research Boardbetween February  and June  this year.

If you#re going at a high speed and that thing comes at you, what can you do  Swerve  There#s a good chance you#re dead, in hospital or best case scenario, your car is totalled.Just because you think you#re a competent driver, doesn#t mean everyone  is. Drive safe.Of course, accidents do happen even to competent,confident, safe drivers but there are people who cast aside such standards in favour of dangerous, unlawful behaviour.These are the ones who need to be severely apprehended.Try to be less pedantic when reading comments.Johan, youseemto have missed the point of Kat’s letter.Nobody has said that overtaking is illegal or wrong but It was estimated that the Audi was travelling at around  to  mph. An offence.In addition , about six or more cars were overtaken in one fell swoop.Not advisable by any stretch of the imagination. Suppose there had been a need to suddenly pull in due to an unforeseen hazard.Something would have had to give , possibly causingan accident.My father used to say to me when I was learning to drive “ always drive asother drivers are stupid”.In short, drive defensively NOT offensively.It seems to me that the Audi driver falls into the stupid category.Better to be ten minutes late in this world than fty years too early in the next.Have you seen this stretch of road  It is the only place in Shetland where there is a lane for overtaking # that is two lanes going up a hill.Very often you are overtaking quite a few things even at  mph going up because of slow things and other cars not overtaking.Unless she actually had a speed gun she cannot judge the speed of things. I regularly see traffic pouring down Herrislea hill and I know that although it looks fast, some of them are actually sticking to the  mph limit.I maintain that it’s better to be safe than sorry.Ease off and keep the undertaker waiting !! Or,you feel so inclined, speed up and become a statistic.Your choice.You need a fair few horses to go up some of our hills at  mph. She is right in that respect, it would need to be a #sporty blue audio or similar#.Johan, I’ve driven on the roads of Shetland and I can’t recall any that could be called steep.Gentle slopes maybe but nothing to compare with the really steep roads of Scotland and Wales. Even England has some pretty steep examples in the Lake District.The sharpest inclines I’ve experienced in Shetlandare on Foula.I doubt that quad bikes would be much use on the hills though I have seenthem being driven on the low level road.It would be interesting to gauge why people bought a certain model of vehicle in proportion to its top speed, and whether or not this was a deciding factor  The power of an engine could be compared as well  How often would the said person go well over the speed limit just to test the engine or impress a passenger in the vehicle with them regardless of any safety  If a vehicle can do  # mph, why would this be allowed  Why would there not be a limiter to say mph installed If the law allows such vehicles to be sold, why would this be the case Good questionI think more and more there will be speed limiters on cars and insurance companies and Companies already want these.Johan,The EU has already sorted this one for us.Thanks MHJ. Electric self charging cars available by then too I would think.It’s an attractive and interesting idea Johan but I doubt that such a short time scale will see the hope come to fruition.Predictions do not suggest that the high cost of EV manufacture will reduce for quite some time to make such purchases viable in the immediate future.Motor production is going through an increasingly lean time and it seems unlikely to me that the decline will bounce back into the black by trying to incrrease the sales of expensive electric cars. Even China where progress has been rapid is feeling the pinch and the clamour for Range Rovers has dropped off.I wonder how long it will take for SIC to provide an adequate number of electric charging points and at what cost..."},{"url":null,"title":"dozen young sailors to join tall ships races ","story":"Sail Training Shetland sail trainees and sponsors on board the Faroese sailing smack Westward Ho at Victoria Pier.

As a result of its strategic importance both sides concentrated some of their best armoured regiments and equipment in this area. The Guards Armoured Brigade comprised of three tank battalions and had been set up and trained in England. The three battalions were the nd Battalion of the Grenadier Guards, the st Battalion of the Coldstream Guards and the nd Battalion of the Irish Guards. The Irish Guards were recruited from Northern Ireland and the nd Battalion contained men from the Province. You can see it in the tank commanders names. We have Agnew, Brennan, Carson, Connolly, Healy, Harbinson, Mahoney, McCorkell, McGuire, McHugh and Robinson amongst others.The nd Battalion Irish Guards was equipped with American Sherman tanks. These were  ton Medium tanks and mainly equipped with a  mm gun, a useful weapon against infantry but not entirely satisfactory against tanks. The battalion was organised into sub units. There were three squadrons in the battalion, each composed of four troops and each troop had four tanks. The Irish Guards named their tanks after towns and the nd Squadron named theirs with B’s. So we have Ballina, Bangor, Bantry, Belfast, Benbane and Ballynahinch. We also have Ballyraggett and BallymenaBallymena was a special Sherman tank. Ballymena did not have the standard  mm gun. The inconvenient truth for the Allied tank crews was that their tanks were not as good as the best of German ones. A German Tiger tank, for example could destroy a Sherman tank at a distance of over a mile. A Sherman on the other hand would be lucky to harm a Tiger at  yards.  The Britsh crews themselves had already concluded that a Sherman tank was not considered as safe a location as many would have been believed. Hence they covered the front with extra metal tracks and the propensity of the Sherman to do a “Ronson”, that is light up, encouraged the crew to get out very quickly.To deal with the stronger German tanks the Allies devised a way of mounting a bigger gun on some of the Shermans. This new gun was so big it meant redesigning the tank and reducing the size of the crew. These Shermans, now armed with a  pounder gun, which referred to the weight of the shell it fired, were nicknamed FireflyThe Irish Guards arrived in Normandy  days after the initial D Day landings. Caen had still not been completely captured so the Irish Guards eere given a mission to help bypass the city of Caen by gaining ground to the east of the city and drive towards the village of Cagny. This was Operation Goodwood, named after the racecourse in England.Undercover of darkness on the night of th July, Ballymena and the other tanks moved over the River Orne on newly constructed bridges and prepared for battle.The smoke, noise and movement of the battlefield created chaos. Units became mixed up and both sides sometimes got lost. This led to one of the most famous incidents of the battle. By the middle of the afternoon of July th the Irish Guard’s assault is under fire, stalled and mud bound outside the village of Cagny. Lt John Gorman of B Squadron th troop commanding a mm armed Sherman called “Ballyraggett” gets slightly ahead of his comrades and spots a German King Tiger at about yrs. Knowing his gun could do little damage to the King Tiger, Lt Gorman chose a dramatic course of action. He had previously briefed his crew Gunner Albert Scholes, Driver James BaronRadio operator Agnew, and told themhe got the chance they would adopt “Navy tactics”. He instructed Baron to drive at full speed ahead and prepare to ram the German tank. Firing a high explosive shell at close range stunned the inexperienced German crew but had little impact on the tank. However, the high speed collision effectively immobilized both tanks. The Sherman and the King Tiger were abandoned and their crews hid in the fields.Lt Gorman realising the King Tiger was still a viable threat ran towards the nearest Sherman Firefly, in the knowledge only a  pounder gun on the Firefly could do any meaningful damage. This was Ballymena. Some of Ballymena’s crew were already either dead or injured but Gorman jumped in and directed fire on the abandoned King Tiger.  The fighting continued for a while but eventually Gorman was able to rescue his own and other crews and get back to safety.For his exploits Gorman - later Sir John - was awarded the Military Cross. Editor’s note: Sir John, who died aged  in May , was a Northern Irish Roman Catholic Unionist with an unflinching sense of service.After the war he joined the Royal Ulster Constabulary before becoming a senior manager with British Overseas Airways Corporation, then head of the Northern Ireland Housing Executive. Finally he was elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly as the sole Roman Catholic member of the Ulster Unionist Party, and served as Deputy Speaker until the Assemblys suspension in .

At the time it was taken in the iconic Flamingo Ballroom, they were members of local rock’n’blues band, Tailor.The band was formed in the early s by Tucker McIlwee and John Tennant.“Other band members who played with Tailor over the years were Ronnie McAuley, Hubert Dunlop and Ricky Maybin, Henry McQuillan, Dave Moore Trevor Erwin andGerry McNeely. We were transported to and from the gigs by Brian Surgenor, ” says John.“Our first gig was at a place called Betty Staffs in Belfast but we travelled throughout Ireland playing most of the towns on the circuit.“Amazingly, we had never played in Ballymena until Sammy Barr of the Flamingo approached our manager to offer a booking.”It transpired that Tailor were playing on the same bill as Rory Gallagher. As you would expect, the group were excited but, in their own words, ‘not overwhelmed.’John remembers: “We met with Rory and his band during set up,. Rory was a very down to earth guy. We discussed what songs we were going to play as we were going to have a one hour set. The Flamingo was full to the brim, the crowd were electric and Tailor recieved a tremendous welcome.“Following the gig we met with Rory for the photo call. The rest is history. Tailor continued to travel theand breadth of Ireland entertaining the young and not so young ravers until the group members went their seperate ways after six years of traveling on the road.”After years of inaction the group reformed to play two gigs for Cancer research, The Countryman Inn and the Telecom Club were filled to capacity for the night of nostalgia and entertainment. pound was raised for charity.And John ponders: “Will the group do it again  Watch this space!”Rory Gallagherwas an Irish blues and rock multi-instrumentalist,songwriter, and producer.Born in Ballyshannon, County Donegal, and brought up in Cork, Gallagher recorded solo albums throughout the s and s, after forming the band Taste during the late s. His albums have sold over  million copies worldwide.Gallagher received a liver transplant in , but died of complications later that year in London at the age of .He began playing after school with Irish showbands, while still in his early teens. Having completed a musical apprenticeship and influenced by the increasing popularity of beat groups during the early s, Gallagher formed The Taste, which was later renamed simply, Taste, a blues rock and RB power trio, in .Performing extensively in the UK, the group played regularly at the Marquee Club, supporting both Cream at their Royal Albert Hall farewell concert, and the blues supergroup Blind Faith on a tour of North America.After the break-up of Taste, Gallagher toured under his own name. The s were Gallaghers most prolic period. He produced ten albums in that decade, including two live albums, Live in Europe and Irish Tour . November  saw the release of the album Deuce. In the same year he was voted Melody Makers International Top Guitarist of the Year, ahead of Eric Clapton. Though he sold over thirty million albums worldwide, it was his marathon live performances that won him greatest acclaim. He is documented in Irish Tour , a film directed by Tony Palmer.During the heightened periods of political unrest in Northern Ireland, as other artists were warned not to tour, Gallagher was resolute about touring Ireland at least once a year during his career, winning him the dedication of thousands of fans, and in the process, becoming a role model for other aspiring young Irish musicians.

He told the : “This has been an ongoing campaign for me and my constituents who use this Junction sometimes on a daily basis .“ I first contacted DFI Roads some years ago in September  when they told me that due to recent collisions an investigation was under way. “They also informed me at that time they had a scheme proposal under development with a number of options being considered. “Writing back to them a year later in  DFI Roads then stated they hoped to be in a position to compete for funding in the next three years works programme which was being developed at the time. “By  we then managed to convince DFI Roads to put in place a number of additional measures at the junction. “New Junction warning signs and Slow markings were provided along with new enhanced signage on the Woodtown Rd.”Mr. Frew said that DFI Roads are now proposing to spend pound, on upgrading the junction although he did not specy an actual timeline of when the work will take place. He added: “ The primary aim is to change the junction priority from Woodtown Rd to Sand Rd to accommodate the predominant traffic movements. “This will also improve stopping sight distances throughout the approaches. I would like to thank DFI Roads for this upgrade and hope it gets rolled out very soon.”  "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1561026848803.jpg--ni_s_major_winners_feature_in_mount_rushmore_style_tribute.jpg?1561026851000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20190620newsni s major winners feature in mount rushmore style tribute","story":"With The th Open at Royal Portrush set to shine a global spotlight on Northern Ireland like never before, Tourism NI today unveiled a fitting and fun tribute to our global golfing legends. In a specially commissioned visual, the iconic clfs of Fairhead in County Antrim have been digitally transformed into an eye-catching sculpture featuring the images of local golfing greats, past and present. Rory McIlroy, Graeme McDowell and Darren Clarke, who will all now be competing in the tournament, feature in the design, alongside former Open Champion and Portrush man Fred Daly. Engaging the talents of Hollywood digital CGI artist Mike Campau, the tongue-in-cheek stunt has been designed to reflect how Northern is truly ‘Made for Golf’, illustrated not only by our sporting talents but also in our landscapes and rugged coast. The timing of the tribute could not be more fitting as Northern Ireland golfers celebrate their recent triumphs on the course, with Rory McIlroy winning the Canadian Open by seven shots to secure his th PGA Tour title and fellow Northern Irishman Graeme McDowellafter finishing tied eighth on  under. Tourism NI last week marked the last official stop of a -mile community engagement campaign ‘The Epic Journey to The th Open’, and with just a month to go, Open fever is starting to take a grip of the nation as the spotlight falls on Portrush. Tourism NI Marketing Director Naomi Waite said: “With ‘Open fever’ beginning to take a hold, we wanted to honour the global golfing heroes who collectively have played a key role in bringing The th Open to Northern Ireland and, through their talent, have made Northern Ireland a growing international golf destination. It is just one of many activities we have planned to celebrate the enormous pride that the people of Northern Ireland have in the achievements of our golfing greats. “While Northern Ireland might one day boast its own ‘Mount Rushmore’ for golf, we can reassure everyone that this stunt is digital theatre and something we hope will raise a smile ahead of July.” Robin Daly, son of the late Fred Daly, said: “Our family are extremely honoured that my father is being remembered in this way. We are really looking forward to theof The Open to our shores for the first time in nearly  years and this sculpture is a wonderful tribute to the talents of these local sportspeople who have earned their place in the history book of golf.” McIlroy and McDowell will tee up at Royal Portrush alongside fellow local and former Open Champion, Darren Clarke, in front of a passionate home crowd when one of the world’s greatest sporting spectacles - The Open - s to the famous Dunluce links for the first time in nearly  years. The th Open at Royal Portrush will be beamed to over  million viewers across the world and is set to attract , spectators, with a team of , staff and  volunteers warmly welcoming visitors. Unprecedented demand from fans has led to record-breaking ticket sales and the event will be a sell-out on Championship Days for the first time. Rory McIlroy commented: “The Open ing to Portrush is massive for Northern Ireland - everyone is so excited and is getting behind it. I never thought I would have the opportunity to play in a major championship at home and I’m really looking forward to it.” Fans can still book their place at Royal Portrush on Practice Days with a limited number of new official hospitality packages also remaining on sale.

Kenneth stands aghast as chants of ‘Greysteel seven, Ireland nil’ rain down from the stands as the match kicks off.Shell-shocked following the match and all that went on during those fraught  minutes, Kenneth brings Ernie home and begins to question what could be his inevitable pathhe doesn’t start making some changes.Lead actor Matthew Forsythe has a total of  roles to portray in this fast, furious and incredibly demanding one-man show. It’s no easy task but each character is brought to le vividly through his tone, his stance and his voice. Even a simple fold of the arms can work wonders, whether’s it’s Kenneth’s ‘keeping up with the Jones’ snooty we Deborah, his boss Gerry, or Wee Ernie, the bitter and wheezing father-in-law.Chris Hunter’s set design is in a sense the only other character beside Kenneth and that too is brought imaginatively and effectively to le. Astro turf gives us our pitch, but it’s the innovative scattering of cardboard boxes that turn into Kenneth’s car, his desk, chair – even the soaring New York skyline – which work to greatest effect. A particularly effective ploy is the backdrop of a distorted mirror showing us, the audience, and inviting us to join Kenneth on his journey of reflection.The play comes  years after the curtain first came up in Dubblejoint’s Whiterock theatre space. It remains as dramatic, funny, poignant, worrying and challenging as it was when it burst into our consciousness all those years ago. The question is, how much has changed outside the theatre A Night in November runs at the Lyric Theatre until June  and will then go on tour.

Parishioners and well-wishers packed into Corpus Christi Church for am Mass as the Springhill congregation came together to give thanks for Fr Des’ dedicated service to the West Belfast community.Parish Priest of Corpus Christi Fr Paddy McCafferty, who celebrated the special service, praised Fr Des’ “immense strength and dedication” within and to the community and said the depths of gratitude felt towards him are “immeasurable.” “Fr Des is a champion of the people, Fr Des saw was needed to be done and did it, he is a man without equal.”“Fr Des co-ordinated, instigated and educated the community. I’m almost lost for words when it comes to describing him. I was looking up the meaning of the word ‘platinum’, it means hard wearing, hard, Fr Des was rock hard in his work for the community. What would people have done without him ”On celebrating his Platinum Jubilee Fr Des said: “I never thought I would get this far.“There were more than  priests ordained the same day as I was, most of them are gone from this world, a mere handful of us laughing about which of us will reach the th birthday first.“What I want to do now, most of all is to thank God for allowing me to live among such good family, friends and neighbours during those years. You taught me what le means you taught me that especially during the bad, sad times. I believe we are seeing the beginning of a renewed Ireland, a renewed Christianity, a renewed city of Belfast – and we are privileged to live in one of the most beautul parts of the city – between the beautul mountain that is full of surprises like the feast of bluebells in the beginning of summer to the snow topped hills in winter, between the sweeping magnicent valley of the Lough and the Lagan,” he said. “This must surely be one of the most beautul places for a city to be in.”Fr Des continued: “This is where I learned the best lessons about le and I am grateful to family, friends, neighbours who taught me and even had great patience when I learned so slowly. I learned how good people show their dignity even during the hardest of times, show it most of all during the hard times. “So I am grateful to God for being here, grateful, to all whom I have had the privilege of being family and neighbour to. And very, very hopeful for the future.“Coming out of the worst of times we could now be facing into the best of times. May God and good people make it so. Father Paddy, like our friend Father Aiden, you are with us all at the beginning of a newly awakened Church and a people refreshed by what they have suffered and achieved together. We have good reason to be thankful for that and for each other.#"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"from detroit to north belfast how a big name does a big job","story":"TO say the name Kronk Boxing Gym is iconic in the sport would be an understatement. Located in Detroit and once led by trainer Emanuel Steward, the name is a household word in the sport of boxing.But North Belfast has its a Kronk Boxing Gym, located in the Duncairn Centre on Duncairn Avenue.Formed as Belfast ABC over  years ago by Bobby McAllister, one of the best coaches in Ireland at the time, the club has come a long way since.In December , former secretary of the gym, Damien McCann, played a pivotal role in Limerick boxer Andy Lee turning pro. He then negotiated a lucrative financial management agreement for Lee to turn professional with Emanuel Steward from the world renowned Detroit Kronk Boxing GymLee was Ireland’s rising amateur boxing star and when he beat USA champion, Jesus Gonzales in the semi-finals of the World Junior Championship, a new relationship between Steward and Kronk in Detroit was born with Belfast ABC gym, hence its name today, Kronk ABC Belfast.Past professional coach Tony Dunlop has been a key figure throughout the history of Kronk ABC Belfast and spoke about the club’s illustrious time.“This place started over  years ago when Bobby McAllister walked past the building which was derelict at the time and thought it would be perfect place for a boxing gym,” he explained.“He asked people in the community who were very positive and said that it would be great for young people in the area.“After a period of time, a lot of kids came through the doors. Ryan Burnettt and Paddy Barnes both started off here.“Burnett was groomed from his early days in here to become a superstar. He left here at  fights undefeated and was one of the best in the world at just  years old.“The turning point I suppose was when Emanuel Steward from Kronk gym in Detroit, which is the best gym in the history of boxing, got in touch.“He saw some of the work we were doing and Belfast Kronk Boxing Gym was born –the rest is history as they say.“We have continued to bring through a lot of champions including professionals James Tennyson and Daniel McShane.“Tommy McCarthy is also here now fighting professional.”Today, the club is going from strength to strength under the stewardship of a new breed of coaches in the shape of Paddy Saunders and Martin McCullough.The duo have embarked on a new programme of coaching young people from North Belfast with the aim of using boxing to their benefit.Tony added: “Paddy Saunders and Martin McCullough are both fantastic coaches. They are flying the flag for Belfast Kronk Gym today.“They have started off a new programme with the youth of the area. They are both giving it a million per cent. I’ve never seen two coaches work as hard. Kronk Gym could not be in better hands.”Classes for - to -year-olds take place every Monday, Wednesday and Friday from .pm to .pm with classes for  years and older from .pm to pm on the same days.Paddy Saunders explained: “Many of the kids have behavioural problems and some suffer from autism.“These classes are an outlet and something to focus and concentrate on.“It is not all about boxing but something for them to do. They don’t miss classes.“If we get a few champions out of it, then brilliant, but it is for the kids.“Most boxing clubs don’t take kids at eight years old, but we do.“All the kids start off exercising and running about the big hall before they come into the boxing gym itself.“They are putting their energy into something positive instead of being on the street and engaging in vandalism and anti-social behaviour. I believe there is a bright future for boxing in North Belfast. We have a top-class facility and there are a lot of good kids in here.”To find out more about the club and to get involved, check out the new Kronk ABC Belfast Facebook page."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"local mla gets brexit safety alert","story":"POLICE have delivered an extraordinary advice list to the West Belfast home of a Sinn Féin MLA suggesting ways in which he can improve his and his family’s personal security post-Brexit.The document has already been delivered to the homes of all  MPs across the United Kingdom, but officers who called to the home of Máirtín Ó Muilleoir said they are widening distribution of the document to take in Brexit spokespersons of parties in the north. The leaflet – headlined ‘When It Goes Too Far’ – outlines steps that politicians should takethey are targeted by extremists in any wave of public unrest that may break out post-October , the latest deadline for the UK leaving the EU.The document – which Mr Ó Muilleoir yesterday branded “Brexit bollox – has been compiled by a number of UK agencies: the National Police Chiefs’ Council, the Crown Prosecution Service, the College of Policing and the Electoral Commission. Despite its wide experience in dealing with public unrest, the PSNI has not been involved in drawing up the guidelines. But local police officers have been tasked with distributing it to MLAs closely connected to the Brexit issue.To the fore in the security advice is what Mr Ó Muilleoir and his family should do in the event of being targeted with a hazardous substance. Police advice is to:• Leave the house and seek fresh air.• Treat itchy or painful skin with water.• Remove outer clothing – but not by pulling it over the head.• Remove any substance that may contact clothing or skin by using a dry absorbent material or brushing it off.Advice is also included on what signs may signal the presence of hazardous substances in the home.The leaflet also advises politicians not to engage with iniduals who may be “stalking harassing” them, either online or offline. It urges them to seek further advice on personal safety and building security from their local police force and to conduct a review of what personal information about them is available online.The leaflet explains that the advice is being forwarded for politicians to consultthey are subjected post-Brexit to “unacceptable levels of harassment and intimidation”. It continues: “In some cases, these behaviours and actions have reached the criminal threshold. The worst examples have led to violence and injury.”The most serious example of Brexit-inspired violence was the murder of Labour MP Jo Cox in June  in West Yorkshire by a gun- and kne-wieldingman holding extreme pro-Britain views. Mr Ó Muilleor said: “It seems preposterous to me that the PSNI is promoting Brexit security advice compiled at the behest of a UK government which for three years has shown itself so thoroughly inept in its handling of the issue.

Nicole’s Instagram notications are testament to that.But in sleepy Sion Mills in north Tyrone, she’s also quite a celebrity too.Although she has played across Europe in the likes of Switzerland, Croatia and Sweden, it was in the USA that, just three months ago, a mutual friend put Nicole and Sion Swts manager Tony McGinley in touch as a potential route to fulfilling her second football dream — to play in the English Super League.“I reached out to my friend about a goalkeeper but I wasn’t expecting to get someone of the quality of Nicole,” said the Swts boss. “Her dream is to play in England, so the thinking is that it’s easier for people to come and watch her here than in America. It’s a shop window for her.“Everybody loves her at the club. After the World Cup, she’s the talk of the town.”Little wonder.EvenSion Mills proves a stepping stone towards England and the very top of the women’s domestic game, it will carry much more signicance than that.“I like it here,” she said. “The people are fantastic, extremely friendly. “They’ve taken my heart.“I’ve played all over Europe, and honestly, you might think it’s funny, but Strabane is one of my favourites.” She added: “Even when I do move away, I’ll still come back and visit.” "},{"url":null,"title":"revealed five schools share the top spot in gcse league table results","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

This is to ensure that staff welfare is protected and that the delivery of front line services is not adversely affected.\"With overall absence levels at Northern Irelands councils at their highest in   for two consecutive years and consistently ranking as the highest in the United Kingdom, with no indication of improvement, I have decided that councils could benefit from a more detailed report in this area.\"She said the Audit Office would investigate the matter more extensively.Overall, councils are in a financially strong position and managed their finances well in  , the report continued. The £m spent providing services to the public works out at £ on average for every person here.Councils received income of £m, % of which was from district rates.As of March , councils had outstanding loans totalling £.m. In   councils paid almost £m towards the principal outstanding balance and £m in interest costs.Use of agency staff not giving value for moneySome councils are still too heavily reliant on agency staff, leading to warnings that using them is not delivering value for money.In  , total employee costs totalled £m — around % of operating expenditure — with agency staff accounting for a further % .The overall cost of agency staff has continued to increase year on year, rising by £.m last year.Most of this increase was attributed to Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council, and Lisburn and Castlereagh City Council.Agency costs at seven councils either reduced or remained relatively stable. That is an improvement on the previous year, when nine councils saw agency staff costs rise.Local government auditor Pamela McCreedy said: “In   some councils continued to be dependent on agency staff to deliver local services.“I will continue to keep the costs associated with agency staff under review across all councils, and I will also focus on the types of work they perform and theof time they have been working in the council.“There is a risk that over-reliance on agency staff over an extended period of time does not provide value for money.”Severance payouts cost £m from  to Almost £m was spent on council exit packages in the last year.Councils are required to disclose the number and costs of these payments.Expenditure includes compulsory and voluntary redundancy costs, pension contributions and other departure expenses.Over the four years from   to  ,  councils have paid a total of £.m in exit packages to staff. A total of  exit packages were agreed, with  exceeding £,.Many of the payments were linked to the reform of local government, which led to the creation of  super councils in .In   councils agreed  exit packages at a cost of £.m.

The outworkings will have most impact on those councils which have a border with the Republic of Ireland.”The report also warns thatthe UK Government and EU fail to agree a withdrawal deal, there will be no transition period and councils will need to respond immediately."},{"url":null,"title":"survey proof support for union waning sinn fein","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Its the UK that has the border with the Republic of Ireland and its for us to come forward with a solution that would work.\"I think everyone here would agree that what we cant have is ato border infrastructure on the island of Ireland.\"Mr Hunt added that the UK needs to show that it can keep the border open. \"I think that through technology we can do that but we have to do that in a way that doesnt trap us in the customs union,\" he said.Home Secretary Sajid Javid said he was \"% committed to the Good Friday Agreement and keeping an open border\".\"In my department, Borderforce has looked at this issue and its perfectly possible to have an open border with two dferent customs arrangements on either side of the border using existing technology,\" he said - although Ms Maitlis pointed out that the existence of the technology to do so is in doubt. \"Obviously it will take time to put that in place and it will cost money. I would have a time limit on the backstop. There will have to be some sort of compromise.\"International Development Secretary Rory Stewart said that he had visited Enniskillen and Londonderry recently and argued that Mr Johnsons plans wouldnt deal with trade tarfs for farmers in border regions.Mr Johnson said that there would \"be no tarfs or quotas\" and that he wanted a \"standstill in current arrangements\" until a trade agreement was negotiated.Mr Stewart said that the Withdrawal Agreement was legally binding and would not be renegotiated before October , and accused the other candidates of not explaining how they would enact their Irish border plans.Following the answers, the questioner Mark said that there was \"a lot of fear and confusion in Northern Irelandwe come crashing out without a deal\", adding that he had been \"hoping for more\" from the candidates.The backstop aims to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland after Brexit, but opponents have claimed it could keep the UK aligned with the EU indefinitely and create a trade border in the Irish Sea.The backstop effectively ended Theresa Mays hopes of getting her Brexit deal through Parliament and its failure hastened her departure as Prime Minister.However, the EU has said it will not renegotiate the deal, which includes the backstop.Ballots of Conservative MPs will continue over the next few days to whittle the race down to the final two candidates. The final stage of the leadership race will begin and members will then vote on the next Party leader and Prime Minister, with the result expected on July ."},{"url":null,"title":"thousands mark summer solstice sunrise at stonehenge","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The Korean Central News Agency report did not give any specics on the stalled nuclear negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang over disagreements in exchanging sanctions relief for disarmament.“The supreme leaders … broadly exchanged their opinions on the political situation of the Korean Peninsula and other serious international and regional issues,” KCNA said. \" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Kim Jong Un and Xi Jinping acknowledge crowds in Pyongyang They assessed that deepening their relationship was in line with the “mutual interest of the two countries in the face of serious and complicated changes in the environment and would be favourable for the region’s peace, stability and development”.Chinese state media earlier reported that Mr Kim told Mr Xi he has not received a desired response from Washington and that the US should meet North Korea halfway to “explore resolution plans that accommodate each other’s reasonable concerns”.Mr Xi said his government is willing to play a constructive role in the denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula. “The international community expects the US and North Korea to continue to talk and achieve results,” he said, according to Chinese state broadcaster CCTV.His visit to North Korea was the first by a Chinese president in  years, and Mr Xi’s first since taking office six years ago.Mr Xi is expected to meet US President Donald Trump next week in Japan and could pass him a message from Mr Kim about the nuclear negotiations.Following Thursday’s banquet, the leaders and their wives attended a mass performance of music, dance and calisthenics at a packed ,-seat stadium.The spectacle featured gymnasts, dancers and flip card-holding spectators performing in precise unison – at one point producing a huge image of a waving Chinese flag in the stands, then flipping their cards to show the North Korean flag.Mr Xi and Mr Kim waved to cheering crowds during the performance, dubbed Invincible Socialism, according to KCNA. \" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Chinese President Xi Jinping is welcomed by North Korean children at Pyongyang International Airport Performing groups sang Chinese favourites and put on what KCNA termed “the peculiar display of Chinese folk dances”.

Durkan said that many of the  staff at Foyle House, on the Duncreggan Road, will be made redundant as it will be \"impossible\" for them to relocate to Belfast.In  HMRC announced that the Derry tax office would close in  .It came as part of a move to reconfgure its offices into thirteen regional centres serving every nation and region in the UK, with one of these centres being located in Belfast.In July  HMRC declared that its Belfast Regional Centre would be based at Erskine House, Chichester Street, Belfast, and expected to open in late . It is on schedule to open later this year.This week, Sir Jonathan Thompson, Chief Executive and Permanent Secretary of HMRC, sent a letter to Mark H. Durkan asserting that based on current plans Foyle House will close in September , with staff moving, where possible, to the Belfast Regional Centre.There are currently around  staff in Foyle House and Mr Thompson accepted that the majority live outside reasonable daily travel to Belfast.Mark H Durkan had asked that consideration be given to the integration of HMRC workers in Derry into the Northern Ireland Civil Service.Speaking to the Derry News yesterday, he said: “The intention of HMRC to close their offices here in September  is something I have been appealing against since it was announced in November .“I had written to Head of Civil Service, David Sterling to consider the integration of Derry staff to available DAERA positions in Ballykelly. Why this obvious solution has not been given due consideration is beyond me.“And while HMRC have acknowledged a duty of care to ex-employees, the current plan to relocate  staff members to their Belfast offices is a highly impractical approachnot virtually impossible for those with families and caring responsibilities. For many the only option they have been left with is redundancy.“It is a ludicrous and tin-eared approach to remove employment opportunities, chronically lacking in the North West, and in effect to move more of our skilled workers to Belfast.“These experienced and highly competent staff would be an asset to any organisation. The inability to provide these people some peace of mind as well as affording them opportunities to apply their skills in similar roles closer to home, has been completely overlooked.”However, in his letter Mr Thompson said, “regrettably, there are no priority arrangements for redeployment of our staff into Northern Ireland Civil Servicedepartments.“The NICS is entirely separate from the Home Civil Service and, as such, HMRC staff can only apply for roles in the NICS which may be advertised externally, including those at the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs in nearby Ballykelly.”Mr Thompson added that it has always been made clear that HMRC wants as many people as possible to transfer to their new location and continue their careers in Belfast.“That is why we have committed to hold one-to-one meetings between staff and managers around a year in advance of any move, to discuss inidual circumstances.“The meetings will establish who can and cannot move and what level of support will be needed to keep people working for HMRC. The one-to-ones for this office will commence in September ,” he concluded.The letter went on to say that those who decide to travel to Belfast will be given financial support in terms of travel costs and in some cases with home moves.The option of working in other government departments would also be explored.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"creggan men mixing mayweather dream las vegas boxing encounter","story":"A boxing coach and personal trainer from Creggan has spoken about an ‘amazing’ trip to Las Vegas spent in the company of many of the fight game’s legendary characters never mind his best friend who just happens to be international footballer James McClean.James McClean recently decided to celebrate turning  by inviting a few of his close friends and their partners to go on a trip to Las Vegas.

However, he dropped his religious studies in favour of a career in journalism.However, prior to this he had gained a doctorate from Edinburgh University for his contribution to charting the history of the church. It was during this particular course of study that he submitted some articles to the Belfast News Letter that led to an invitation to become a member of its staff.He accepted this position and by  he was the paper’s editor.In , after a political dispute with the News Letter’s owner he resigned and briefly became editor of the Londonderry Standard.Then, between - McKnight was appointed editor of the Banner of Ulster and it was in this period, as a result of the tenant grievances that he witnessed, he became fearful that another rebellion in the mould of the  United Irishmen would erupt.When he ed as editor of the Londonderry Standard he further developed the campaign for tenant rights. Also upon histo the Standard he married the owner of the paper’s sister-Miss Catherine McPherson of Balloughry.At this time the majority of small farmers in Ulster relied on weaving to bolster their income as well as working the land.The coming campaign of agitation was a daunting one and its success depended upon defeating Tory landlords who held all the Parliamentary representation in the country.In effect, farmers were serfs who were obliged to pay rents regulated solely by landowners who also firmly held the reins of political power. As a result, tenant farmers lived in almost perpetual fear of increased tarfs and evictionthey failed to pay them.As Repeal of the Union agitation gathered strength in the south of Ireland, James McKnight simultaneously championed the cause of Presbyterian farmers in the north. The fight centred on the three F’s-fixity of tenure, fair rents and free sale.An example of Dr James McKnight’s famed oratory was captured in a speech he delivered whilst on the tenant rights campaign trail in Newtonards in this era.“I have no language sufficiently strong to convey my contempt for policies which, under the hypocrisy of religion, degrade Christianity to an engine of State intrigue,” he said.The journalist’s abilities seemed to be sufficiently feared by the English political hierarchy to the extent that after he had led a deputation to meet Prime Minister Robert Peel on the issues at hand, he was offered a Parliamentary seat in County Wexford in an obvious attempt to bring him ‘from the cold.’ James McKnight declined the offer.The Tenant Right League was established in August of  and was formed chiefly by Charles Gavan Duffy and Frederick Lucas.The movement was remarkable in that for a time it united Protestant and Catholic tenants. In fact, Duffy named his movement The League of North and South.The political battle was framed against the backdrop of the Encumbered Estates Act of . Essentially, this legislation enabled the sale after the Great Famine, of Irish estates whose owners could not meet their financial obligations.In the north of Ireland, Anglican and Presbyterian ministers feared these new landlords would destroy the established Ulster custom of compensating tenants who made improvements to the land.At the same time in the south, politically conscious Catholic priests wanted to adopt the compensation custom in the north as a measure of reform in their part of the island.The League was a conglomeration of the Tenant Protection Societies and the Ulster Tenant Rights Association led by William Sharman Crawford. Unity between the organisations was unfortunately short lived because of objections to the involvement of Catholic clergy in the south.Larger tenant farmers were primarily interested in securing Fixity of Tenure while the smaller farmers prioritised fair rents. To strengthen the campaign the leaders of the League sought the support of Irish MPs to oppose any government that would not back the ‘Ulster Custom.’In this respect, the Tenant Rights League achieved success through the efforts of its national organiser John Martin. It garnered the support of the surviving Repealers of the Union in the House of Commons as well as a number of radical English radical MPs.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshAnd, all of these supportive elements agreed that a Land Act incorporating the three F’s would be the overall objective of the political campaign.Then, at the  General Election some fty Tenant Rights candidates including Gavan Duffy, Frederick Lucas and John Sadlier all won seats at Westminster where they sat as the Independent Irish Party.The League’s success however proved short lived when it was first weakened and then ultimately destroyed by the resurfacing of old sectarian isions.Firstly, a number of prominent members broke away and formed the Catholic Defence Association-referred to as the ‘Pope’s Brass band’ by some in the organisation. Supporters of the League were also subjected to a campaign of intimidation by the landlords.However, the most serious blow came when Frederick Lucas came into conflict with the Archbishop of Dublin, Dr Paul Cullen. The high-ranking cleric had forbidden his priests from involvement in political issues causing Lucas took his complaint about Dr Cullen to Rome. This succeeded only in alienating the Catholic church in Ireland from the fight.Then, Frederick Lucas died in October  shortly after the failure of his plea to the Papacy. A month later, Gavan Duffy emigrated to Australia.The League finally fell apart in  with the Independent Irish Party following it into oblivion the following year.It was not however the end of the tenants rights campaign. The baton that had been dropped by the League and the Independent Irish Party was picked up again by Bishop Thomas Nulty of Meath. It was then spearheaded by the Land League in  and the three F’s became anchored in legislation under the Land LawAct in .In general, the cause of tenants rights was more successful in the south of Ireland. In the north, landlords were more firmly entrenched and the issue of the Repeal of the Union had caused many northern delegates in the League to walk away and fight the cause as unionists or Liberal Tenant Righters.However, almost  years before the Land LawAct enshrined the F’s in law, in the north Mr SM Greer had gained the County Derry seat against the power of landlordism.Thirteen years later in  when Gladstone introduced a Land Bill that embodied the principles of tenant rights, it was Dr James McKnight that the government of the day consulted. That same parliamentary term also saw the introduction of the Ballot Act which ended intimidation.This shows that the journalist had at the outset been for a period a lone voice advocating social reform in Ireland.Without doubt, Dr McKnight had been regarded as the leader and champion of the rights of the Presbyeterian farmers and for his efforts was presented with a testimonial and £ by them. He died on June ,  aged  at his house on East Wall in his adopted homeplace of Derry.A glimpse of the le of James McKnight and his we outside of the newspaper business and political campaigning came around  years after his passing when his former paper, the Derry Standard marked the death of his spouse Catherine on February , .The Standard said: “We greatly regret to record the death of Mrs McKnight, formerly of this city, which took place at College Square East, Belfast, on Monday after a somewhat protracted illness during which she was tenderly nursed by her sister, Miss Rebecca McPherson.“The deceased was the we of the former editor of this paper, James McKnight L.L.D and was well known in this city thirty years ago, when Dr McKnight’s house on the East Wall and subsequently at Warrenhill, was the rendezvous of a circle of congenial spirits, who often met to enjoy the refined society of Dr McKnight and his accomplished we.“Among the welcome guests were generally to be found the late Rev William McClure, Reverend Professor Wallace and Reverend Richard, afterwards Professor Smyth MP.“At an earlier period in their domestic history they had the honour of entertaining the late Thomas Carlyle, who met at their house all the leading Derry celebrities of the time and in the book which he afterwards published made some remarks on his fellow guests that were more plain than pleasant but he said all that was kind and complimentary of the host and his gentle helpmate and commended the quality of the doctors tobacco.“After the death of Dr McKnight, Mrs McKnight visited the principle cities on the Continent, and spent some time in Italy enjoying the beauty and art of that classic land, which she was so well able to appreciate.“Although highly cultivated, and possessing good literary abilities, she was not successful as a writer, and her only work, ‘The Friend of the Poor’, was not read beyond her personal circle of friends.“For some years past Mrs McKnight has lived in Belfast, and there she passed away on Monday morning last, after a lingering illness, which she bore with patient and cheerful resignation.“The interment will take place in the Cemtery at Derry today, the funeral leaving the terminus of the Northern Counties railway at ten o’clock.”Dr James and Mrs Catherine McKnight had no children.CAPTION: Dr James McKnight."},{"url":null,"title":"pictures bishops castle hotel garden party celebrates","story":"Castle Hotel owner Henry Hunter with hotel manager Meg Lewis greets guests for tltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgthe garden party.

Suzie has an extremely busy summer ahead of her and is so looking forward to the challenges ahead.ldquoMy focus now is Traithle Europeans in June in Madeira, then Worlds in Florida in October.

They have also branded claims the mercury bath poses a health and safety risk as a ldquored herring and fear that replacing the existing mechanism could potentially damage the Fresnel lens.Described as a ldquoworkshop, the January meeting lasted over one hour with the official council record of the debate that ensued only amounting to a paltry two and a half lines.The Lecale Lightkeepers vehemently argued that they had a case for briefing councillors on the impact the loss of the beam would have but, surprisingly, the request was initially rejected.Instead, council officials insisted that officers from the the Commissioners of Irish Lights would be invited to future meetings of the districtrsquos respective DEA Forums to discuss the future of the lighthouse.The local authority said this was to ensure that information could be shared and that local stakeholders and communities were fully consulted on any proposals for the lighthouse in the immediate future, before any plans are finalised.Council officials also insisted that wide ranging public consultation on the future of the lighthouse would take place.Campaigners mdash who were at a complete loss to understand why they were initially refused an opportunity to meet directly with councillors over five months ago mdash have now been told they will get a chance to brief them and outline their case for the retention of the beam.The Lecale Lightkeepers have described the plan to remove the beam as ldquototally inadequate and unacceptable and are looking forward to outlining their case for its retention.They are also pleased that having heard from the Commissioners, politicians can now have face-to-face dialogue with campaigners.Campaigners have held several discussions with the Commissioners and frequently engage with the organisation as part of the bid to retain what they have described as a key facet of Lecalersquos heritage.ldquoWe welcome the opportunity to meet with councillors to demonstrate just how passionate people are about the retention of the beam, the spokeswoman declared. It is a symbol of unity in Lecale and has brought together all sides of our erse community. It must be retained.ldquoMeeting with councillors is particularly important for us. We have put together a detailed presentation on the lighthouse issue and will outline our concerns about the future of the beam which we cannot afford to lose for a whole host of reasons.The spokeswoman said that in the interests of fairness and given the sensitive nature of the beam issue, it was important that they meet with local politicians.ldquoCouncillors have had the opportunity to hear from the Commissioners and it is important that they hear what we have to say as the group representing those opposed to this controversial proposal, she continued.ldquoThe beam must be retained for future generations given that it is an intrinsic part of the maritime history and heritage of the area and is a stunning feature of the Lecale landscape.The spokeswoman added: ldquoNewry, Mourne and Down Council is backing the campaign to retain the sweeping beam and it is it important that councillors hear directly from campaigners. The beam must be retained we simply cannot afford to lose it from this area and see it consigned to the pages of history..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Curran steps down from government association position  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK councillor Dermot Curran is stepping down from his role as president of the Northern Ireland Local Government Association this Friday.The group is the representative body for the provincersquos  councils and Cllr Curran will leave his position at the grouprsquos annual conference which is taking place at Newcastlersquos Burrendale Hotel.The Ardglass man is Northern Irelandrsquos longest serving district councillor, having been elected to the former Down Council in , following the reorganisation of local government.He has served as NILGA president twice describing the accolade as both a ldquoprivilege and a challenge.While stepping down as the organisationrsquos president, Cllr Curran will remain a key member of the NILGA Executive.Cllr Curran mdash who was last month re-elected to Newry, Mourne and Down Council mdash has been a councillor for  years and while already Northern Irelandrsquos longest serving politician, some of his council colleagues believe that he is the longest serving in the British Isles.Dedicated to public service, Cllr Curran said he has ldquothoroughly enjoyed his second term at NILGArsquos helm and looks forward to continuing his work with the organisation.He also believes that local councils will continue to play increasingly important roles in their respective areas and that an opportunity exists to unlock the potential of local government as the hub of public services.Cllr Curran said that over recent years councils had changed dramatically, as had the political, financial and legal environment in which councillors operate.He said while local authorities had more responsibilities and power than before, they were also increasingly stretched in terms of finances and resources, an issue which has been compounded since the suspension of the Assembly.ldquoThe  councils are a key element of investment and public service delivery, but they control just % of the public purse.

However, I doubt many think that it is the cradle of horse racing, but it is.We do of course have a famous racecourse, which has just hosted a festival of racing as part of the DownTime Summerfest.Some of you, dear readers, may even know that there is an earlier racecourse in Downpatrick mdash at Old Course Road. So racing has been going on for centuries in our beautul corner of the world. And we have also played a vital role in the foundation of the Sport of Kings.The breed of horse associated with modern horse racing is the thoroughbred. A mere glance is enough to tell even the casual observer that the thoroughbred does not look like other horses.When compared to a pony or carthorse, the thoroughbred is leaner, taller and sleeker. In fact, these horses are perfectly designed for racing. They have big lungs, a big heart and long, slender legs that can move swtly.They also need special care when compared with native breeds. They have thin hair coats and so need to wear rugs or live in stables in bad weather. They need special food to give them energy to race. So these features tell you that the ancestor of the modern thoroughbred came from somewhere hot mdash from the desert, in fact. The ancestor of our racehorses is from Arabia.Back in the th century, horses were bred for work and war, not pleasure. Officers prized horses that were fast to get them in and out of battle and keep them alive. By this time, the medieval charger of knights mdash the destrier mdash was out of fashion. They were too slow and cumbersome, and soldiers no longer wore heavy suits of armour.So the horse evolved through selective breeding to become fleet of foot. There were no horses faster than the Arabian, which was specially bred to become bigger and faster than its wild cousin. The armies of the Ottoman Sultan developed special studs to create this new war machine.In , one of these fine stallions, known as the Byerley Turk, found himself outside the gates of Vienna. The Ottoman Sultan wanted to capture the imperial capital of the Holy Roman Empire, an objective he failed to achieve when the Polish King John III Sobieski led the greatest cavalry charge in history to defeat the Ottoman forces.The Byerley Turk was captured and eventually brought to England, finding himself in the ownership of one Captain Byerley.His adventures were not over though. Recognising a fine animal, Captain Byerley adopted the Turk as his war horse. In  hewas called to Ireland to fight for King William and in  he fought at the Battle of the Boyne. Indeed, Captain Byerley later attributed his surviving that battle to the swtness of his favourite war horse.After the battle, the Turk was entered in a horse race mdash in Downpatrick. Of course, he went on to win that race and go on to be one of the most famous horses in history. The Flying Horse housing development to the east of Downpatrick is named after this famous race.The remarkable career of the Turk continued mdash and now we come to his ultimate destiny. He was put out to stud in Yorkshire. His pedigree was highly prize and he became the first of only three foundation sires of the modern thoroughbred breed.Genetic testing has revealed it is his DNA that is the most common in all modern racehorses. His progeny are successful right to this day including names such as Dr Devious, Ahonoora and Indian Ridge.And it all started with a fateful race in Downpatrick over  years ago. Needless to say,Downe Vets had been around then and caring for his veterinary needs, we feel he could have achieved more..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Hurlers seeking big upset at Croke Park  ","story":"DOWN senior hurlers go into Saturdayrsquos Christy Ring Cup final at Croke Park against Meath as rank outsiders.Few pundits outside the Down camp expect anything other than a comfortable win for Meath, but say that quietly in and around Ronan Sheehanrsquos new kids on the block.The Newry man, who has close connections to several Cork hurling legends, has engendered a new-found enthusiasm and confidence in his charges.His young hurlers are a real surprise packet this season and getting to the Christy Ring Cup final is a major achievement for his fledgeling side.Sheehan has invested heavily in youth and has two schoolboys in his starting .Downpatrickrsquos Tim Prenter, who plays his club hurling for Ballygalget and Ballycranrsquos Phelilm Savage are both in their final year at St Patrickrsquos Grammar School and De La Salle, Downpatrick, respectively.Both lads were in the Down Schoolsrsquo side that lted the Mageean Cup earlier in the season and both hail from famous sporting families.Prenter, who also won a MacLarnon Cup medal with the Red High a few months back, is the son of former Antrim senior football defender Kieran Prenter and his grandfather Seamus Burns was a well known member of the all-conquering Belfast Celtics basketball team that swept all before them in the s and s.Savage, whose brother Liam is also in the team, is the son of former Ballycran and Ulster midfielder Gary lsquoGazarsquo Savage, who was also a noted centre half with Ballycam Celtic in the Newcastle League.There are also several other young players in the  with Portaferryrsquos Matthew Conlon, Ronan Blair, Darragh Mallon, Tom Murray, Caolan Taggart and Eoghan and Daithi Sands all in their early s.Throw in Liatroimrsquos Oisin McManus, P J Davidson and Ruairi McCrickard and Ballycranrsquos Stephen Keith, Gerard Hughes, Huw Flynn and Liam and Phelim Savage and you have the nucleus of squad that could dominate Ulster hurling for years.In addition to Prenter, Ballygalget provide the squad with, John McManus, Danny Toner, Marc Fisher and Cathal Coulter with Newry Shamrocks providing Paul Sheehan and Jordan Murphy.Helping Ronan Sheehan from the sidelines is Cork legend Diarmuid OrsquoSullivan and the Down manager believes his support has been critical in moving the side forward.ldquoDiarmuid has been doing a bit of defensive coaching for us and he has been there for all of the Christy Ring Cup games, he said.ldquoHe would know a lot of the boys from the development squads because he wouldrsquove come and done coaching sessions down through the years. The first set of minors he was involved with were probably the likes of Conor Woods, so, itrsquos going back a bit.ldquoHaving him there with what people would probably say is a relatively inexperienced management team as well as a relatively inexperienced team on the field of play has become very important, he added.ldquoWe see this as a bit of a journey over the next two to three years and Diarmuid being there to help build along the way will make a massive dference. Sheehan also believes that OrsquoSullivan has made a big impact on the players and he canrsquot praise him highly enough.ldquoIn terms of his knowledge of the game and the wee bits of coaching he does around how to tackle, there have been huge strides, Sheehan said.ldquoTackling was definitely something we felt we needed to work on, we were giving away too many frees in the past. You can see the dference even in the way the likes of Tom Murray, only  and Darragh Mallon at , are playing like demons, he beamed.ldquoThe other thing be brings is a great calmness on match days.The lads respond well to that, when he has a quiet word with them beforehand.This will be Downrsquos fourth appearance in the Christy Ring final, but they have only lted the cup once and that was back in ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"New working group to run local mountain bike trails  ","story":"A NEW working group is to be established to assist with the management of the hugely popular mountain bike trails in Castlewellan Forest Park.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is keen to meet with those who use the trails and organise local events, alongside representatives from Cycling Ireland, to discuss what have been described as a number of challenges in managing the facility and sister trails in Rostrevorrsquos Kilbroney Forest Park.Over pound.m has been invested in developing trails in both parks and together they attract over one million users each year, with pound, invested annually in their management.The success of both authorised and unauthorised trails within both parks presents challenges for Newry, Mourne and Down Council, members of its Enterprise, Tourism and Regeneration Committee were told on Monday.The local authority manages the bike trails under licence from the Forest Service and is also responsible for their maintenance.Politicians were told that in addition to the authorised trail network, an unofficial or lsquonaturalrsquo network also exists and has been in place for many years.

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them. This has been carried out in towns and cities across the UK to protect the local heritage.The petition can be found at www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-the-victorian-heritage-of-penarth u .I will continue to work with your local Labour councillors on these issues.

And under my leadership, a Conservative administration will proudly put the people of the Vale of Glamorgan first.ldquoNaturally, we are open to working with other councillors who share those ideals.ldquoOthers - including those who resigned from the Conservative party - will have to explain to voters where they stand on these issues - and I would urge them to back us, rather than propping up a Labour administration that was rejected by the Vale at the last election.Cllr Bailey said he had a six-point plan for the Vale.He pledged to deliver the Dinas Powys bypass stop inflation-busting council tax rises scrap proposed parking charges review the local development planto curb inappropriate development protect rural schools and oppose the Barry Biomass plant.Cllr Bailey said that he was also keen to improve engagement with the public, after a series of hugely unpopular decisions taken by the existing cabinet.He said: ldquoDuring the elections in , we promised to build a stronger relationship with local residents by consulting them on key decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, too many people feel that their views are simply being ignored and that Vale consultations are just tick box exercises. Take the proposals around car parking charges, or the closure of Llancarfan School. I donrsquot think anyone outside of the Civic Offices believes that those decisions werenrsquot already done deals, and thatrsquos simply unacceptable.ldquoAnother good example is the councilrsquos failure to listen to the public over Penarthrsquos original Victorian lamp posts.ldquoIrsquove been criticised for wanting to listen to the people who elected me, and I make no apologies for that.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John.

If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people. We have to say these are the facts and whether we like it or not we will have to do some things dferently or not at all.Cllr Burnett added. ldquoBut we have to be honest about the levels of pressure on local government.ldquoOur priority has to be services to the most vulnerable.The Labour-led coalition includes members of the former Conservative cabinet, which quit the party when former leader John Thomas was deposed as leader of the Vale Tories. The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for. It will be realistic and fair for everybody.School improvementsThe new cabinet says delivering on major new school buildings is a priority for the new administration.Developments in the pipeline include new builds forPencoedtre and Whitmore High Schools, and expansion and refurbishment of Ysgol Gymraeg Bro MorgannwgAgeing schools in the Vale are set to get a pound. million cash boost for repairs.Llancarfan Primary SchoolLlancarfan Primary School was set to be lsquoclosedrsquoand moved to a new pound million facility in Rhoose.The previous cabinet had approved the plans despite protests from parents and campaigners.Cllr Moore said Llancarfan School move was ldquopremature - but did not commit to scrapping the plan entirely.ldquoIf itrsquos justiable itrsquos justiable, he said. ldquoIf itrsquos not, we will look at alternatives.ldquoItrsquos not an easy decision to take. Itrsquos something we have to take some time about.ldquoWhat Irsquom not going to do is jump or kowtow to people who shout the loudest.Cllr Burnett has previously tweeted the closure of Llancarfan ldquowouldnrsquot be happeningLabour were running the council.New roadsWork continues on outline business cases for two major new roads being proposed ndash the A to M link around Pendoylan and Dinas Powys Bypass between Barry and Cardf ndash but no decision has been made whether either will actually go ahead.The future of both roads rests on whether Welsh Government and the council deem them viable, and whether ministers cough up the cash to fund them.But Cllr Moore said he doesnrsquot think Welsh Government will find the money required for the Dinas Powys Bypass.ldquoItrsquos out of our hands, he said.IncineratorCllr Moore said he believes Welsh Government will order the Barry Biomass incinerator to carry out an environmentalimpact assessment.Cllr Moore, who has previously attacked what he termed ldquoscaremongering and lies around the biomass plant, said he did not want the facility in Barry Docks.He said: ldquoWe opposed it vehemently, both as a council and as a party and personally. It shouldnrsquot be there.ldquoBut now it is there it has to operate within legal parameters.ldquoIf it does, therersquos nothing anyone can do about it.The council refused the original planning permission for the facility, but a planning inspector allowed it in  following an appeal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Abandoned - BlissThe first dog to arrive at the centre was -year-old Spaniel Grace, found by a member of the public at the side of the road. She was taken to the vet immediately, but after an owner didn’t come forward, she was brought to Dogs Trust.Two weeks ago, another Spaniel - aged eight and nicknamed Bliss by the team - was found tied to a fence not far from the rehoming centre. Like Grace, the Spaniel has not been microchipped, which has been a legal requirement for all dogs since  and the easiest way to identy a dog who has become separated from their owner. Shockingly just one week later, a Cairn Terrier - less than a year old, was found by a rehoming centre staff member at the very same spot where Bliss was left. Terrier Rizzo was lucky to be found as she is quite small and it would have been easy to miss her in the long grass.The most recent addition to the ranks of abandoned pooches is Sally, an eight-year-old Collie cross, who was found as a stray by a member of the public and brought to the rehoming centre.Abandoned - RizzoOonagh Philips, Rehoming Centre Manager said: “We want to remind anyone who no longer feels that they can care for their dog to contact their local rescue organisation for support. When a dog is abandoned on the road side, it not only puts them in danger, but also drivers. We are so thankful that all four of these dogs were found when they were.“Grace and Bliss were very shaken up by their ordeal when they came into our care and it took them a couple of days to build trust around people again. We could tell Rizzo hadn’t eaten in a while, which could have resulted in a deterioration of her physical health. Sally is incredibly sweet natured, and just like the others, will make a wonderful addition to the right home.“We are not sure why there has been a recent influx in dogs being abandoned. We always remind people that ‘A Dog is for Le®’ but we understand that le happens, and places like Dogs Trust are there to support any dog owner who experiences a bump in the road and needs our help. Sometimes the most responsible thing we can do as a dog owner is admit that we aren’t coping with our pets, but it is important to ensure they are kept safe and not left to fend for themselves.”If you

offices in Portadown, Lurgan and Banbridge.Sinn Fein MLA John O’Dowd has written to the NIHE’s Chief Executive opposing any plans to close local offices.The NIHE admitted it is looking at the way customers access services. A spokesperson said: “We can confirm that in south region specically, we are looking at a number of options which include phased relocation and reduced hours given there are five offices within a short geographical distance of each other. But no decision has yet been taken.”Mr O’Dowd said: “I have been made aware that the Housing Executive is intending to a close a number of district housing offices including, Banbridge, Lurgan, and Portadown offices. Staff are being transferred to Marlborough House in Craigavon and other regional offices.“I am very concerned about the implications of this news for Executive tenants. They are losing a much valued local service and contact with Executive staff.“I am calling on the Housing Executive to carry out a full Equality Impact assessment and rural needs assessment before any final decisions are made about the future of the local offices.“The Housing Executive are a vital part of community infrastructure and should not be disappearing from local areas.“I have written to the Chief Executive of the Housing body to express concern and to request an urgent update on the future of local district offices.” A Housing Executive spokesperson said: “The Housing Executive is currently looking at how to best deliver its service and we are committed to maintaining services in local areas in line with customer demand.“Any proposals would be subject to a formal process to include consultation with union, staff, customers, the local community and political representatives. It will also assess the impact on equality and rural areas.“We would like to reassure customers that any decision taken by the Housing Executive will not affect the high quality service we deliver to them. We have also reassured our staff that there will not be job losses as a result of any changes to how we deliver services locally.”The spokesperson added: “The way in which our customers access services is rapidly changing. “We have seen a % reduction in footfall into our offices in the last four years, and a marked increase in telephone and online contact and we expect this trend to accelerate in the future.

develop our online services for our tenants within the next year and have already extended our phone service operating hours. “We have also changed the way in which we deliver services to our tenants and those who are seeking social housing by increasing the number of front line officer and having them call directly to customers’ homes rather than them having to visit our offices. “We are, of course, mindful that our customers are requiring our assistance now more than ever, and that is why we offer services online, on the phone and face to face across Northern Ireland. “We want to be able to respond to the needs of our customers and provide the services they require, while at the same time ensuring value for money and effective use of our offices.“Currently, we have offices in buildings which we either own or which we rent from private or public sector landlords. “We would prefer to spend money on services than unnecessarily on buildings. “If we have any proposals to alter services across Northern Ireland or in a local area, we will of course be consulting with the local community, staff, their unions and political representatives.”try catch  TrendingFriends urged to

The application area also stretches or borders on  Areas of Special Scientic Interest from the boundaries of Belfast Lough to the glacial peat deposits of Benburb.“We have serious concerns about the impact oil and gas exploration will have on bioersity, on intensying our reliance on carbon-heavy industry and on people and communities here. “We consider this a regionally signicant application and, as such, the decision is likely to be taken by the Department for the Economy. “It is important that the Department hears and understands the strength of opposition to these proposals,” they said calling for the restoration of an Executive.Cllr O’Hanlon said: “Where we dfered with Councillor Lavery is that he sought to form a Council view in a Council Committee when the correct prcedure is to formally bring a notion of motion to Full Council.We advised Councillor Lavery of the proper process and said we would support such a motion. “The SDLP are opposed to fracking, just as we are opposed

Thats signicantly higher than % of bosses globally. And according to the firm’s latest Global CEO Outlook, Northern Ireland’s bosses are leading the way when it comes to embracing the ‘fast fail’ culture in an effort to make their companies as innovative as possible. Of the Northern Ireland bosses surveyed, % said they want their employees to feel ‘empowered to innovate. On the issue of Brexit, around two thirds of business leaders see the UK’s exit from the EU as the greatest threat to growth. Looking at overall growth, all of those questioned said they expect ‘top line revenue growth over the next three years’. But just % of company bosses said they ‘expect to increase headcount in the next three years of more than %’. John Hansen, partner in charge of KPMG Northern Ireland, said: “Successful CEOs know they need their companies to be as innovative as possible and it’s clear that the right environment is being created in Northern Ireland to do just that. “Our leaders aren’t afraid to give their teams the scope to try new ideas which may have a risk of failure and that opens up a world of potential. This level of freedom will no doubt make sure that Northern Ireland companies are at the cutting edge of innovation in the years to come.” Angela McGowan, CBI director in Northern Ireland, said: “KPMG’s  Global CEO Outlook gives local business leaders some great insights into what is on the radar for chief executives across the globe and raises some important and interesting ideas around what leaders should doing to maintain competitive advantage despite the uncertainty.”  View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/glandore_web.jpg","title":"glandore the family flexible workspace on the rise","story":"Posted on Wednesday June  by Ulster Business High-end flexible office company Glandore has expanded rapidly into an all-island family business with further growth on the horizon. Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/tradeniiii.jpg","title":"new northern ireland trade alliance formed","story":"Posted on Wednesday  June  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s newest trade body alliance will take its message to Westminster later this year amid the ongoing political vacuum at home and with Brexit on the horizon. Trade NI is an alliance between Hospitality Ulster, headed by Colin Neill, Manufacturing NI, Stephen Kelly, and Retail NI, Glyn Roberts, and aims to represent a wider swathe of Northern Ireland’s private sector amid the “paralysis” surrounding a lack of Executive and therefore a lack of local political voice on the UK’s exit from the EU. The group will take its message to London on September , hosting an event to once again bring together politicians, businesses, stakeholders and the media to raise awareness of the issues and challenges facing companies here. The alliance, which has been supported by the likes of Heathrow Airport, Danske Bank and Flybe, outlined its aims at its launch in the Cathedral Quarter, Belfast, to an audience of business leaders from across Northern Ireland. “Northern Ireland is facing huge economic and political challenges ahead with Brexit, no Assembly, and a rapidly changing global economy,” the group said. “Trade NI will seek to give leadership on behalf of our three sectors and provide new policy solutions to creating a modern local economy.” “The paralysis that has been created with the lack of an Assembly and Executive has developed a situation where very little has been done to address the needs of our sectors or the economy at large. “The sht of power from Stormont to Westminster means that we must press decision makers there to implement policies and make legislative changes that will help grow Northern Ireland. Our local economy and businesses have taken a back seat and we simply cannot afford that situation any longer. “Our three organisations represent most of the businesses that make up private sector jobs in Northern Ireland. Therefore, a louder voice needs to be heard on their behalf so that they don’t suffer in the wake of the local political issues. We want a reboot of the economic policy of Northern Ireland, in order to benefit our economy and safeguard our growing business community.” “Last year we held a NI business reception with over  people that brought together the Northern Ireland Secretary of State, MPs, lords, ministers and key political influencers in Westminster to bring focus to Northern Ireland issues.” “This was a great opportunity to be able to discuss the key concerns of the business community with national political decision makers and help them understand the priorities needed for Northern Ireland, and to promote Northern Ireland as a great place in the United Kingdom to locate or start a business.” Kevin Kingston, chief executive of Danske Bank, the main sponsor of Trade NI’s forthcoming Westminster reception, said that “Northern Ireland has a strong business community and should be considered across the United Kingdom as a thriving business hub for the global market”. “The vitality of the private sector is imperative to the strength of the Northern Ireland economy. We must ensure Northern Ireland businesses are well positioned to be able to compete in the post-Brexit environment. We will continue to work alongside the Trade NI alliance and other key influencers to make sure that Northern Ireland, as a constituent part of the United Kingdom, remains a key priority at Westminster.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
