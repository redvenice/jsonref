It falls asleep inches from my head and wakes up beside me. I breathe its breath. I’ve always been reluctant to call my apartment “home” here in Catania. Over the past 10 years I’ve traversed the Middle East, photographing cities, their inhabitants and the conflicts that have ravaged that area of the world for decades. The streets of Baghdad, Mosul, Kabul, Amman, Khartoum and Tehran have been my home. I’d always considered those 50 sq metres in Catania as a pied-à-terre, a place to keep my clothes and my photo archive. I never could have imagined that after documenting the desperation of refugee camps in Iraq or mass graves in Sinjar, or aboard an ambulance collecting the dead among the Kurdish resistance in northern Syria, that I’d have to confront the world’s biggest story in my own small apartment.I’ve been living with Covid-19 since mid-March. My mother, my partner, the war reporter Marta Bellingreri, and other people close to me have been infected, but somehow I have been spared. I interpreted this peculiar twist as if Covid-19 had chosen me to photograph it from a different perspective. And I met the challenge, also because the reasons that brought the virus into my apartment are also extraordinarily tied to my career as a photographer.Last 25 February I hosted some friends and family members for a celebratory dinner. World Press Photo had just announced the 2020 winners, and, for the second time, I was selected, for my photograph of an Isis bride embracing her child in the prison camp of Al-Hol, north-east Syria. At the same time, cases of Covid-19 throughout Italy had risen from four to 322. No one could have imagined that Sicily’s patient zero was at that dinner table, a friend who had returned from Germany. He had no idea he was an asymptomatic carrier of the virus. I left the day after for Khartoum with Marta to photograph a country in the throes of revolution for over a year.The call that changed that trip and the following weeks came six days later, in early March, as Italy and the world were changing for the worse. My friend who had been in Germany had tested positive for Covid-19. The alarm was sounded: phone calls to notify those who may have been infected and tests for the older adults who were at the dinner. Some of my family members tested positive, and my mother was taken immediately to an hospital. She’s 69 and has suffered from respiratory illness in the past. Her life was at risk and my world caved in.Turkey, where we had a connecting flight on the way to Sudan, had already cancelled all flights to Italy. Other countries had restricted entry for anyone who had been to Italy in the previous 14 days. Marta started manifesting symptoms: slight headache, a light fever. We started a self-imposed quarantine in Sudan. But we needed to go back. We returned to Italy with a connecting flight through Asia. Later the ministry of health in Sudan contacted us to track down the people we met: no one had symptoms, tests were negative and all were placed in preventive quarantine. Knowing that Sudan still has only six Covid-19 cases made us breathe a sigh of relief.Upon our arrival, everything seemed surreal. People wearing masks, deserted streets. As soon as possible, we had ourselves tested. Marta received a phone call from the doctor: “Good morning. Unfortunately, I have to inform you that you’ve tested positive. You mustn’t leave the house for any reason. If your fever exceeds 38°C or if you have difficulty breathing, call this number. Do you understand?”I tested negative and was incredulous. I’d been with Marta since that dinner on 25 February. And yet, the virus did not seem to be interested in me. The doctor believed that the test was a false negative, because I began developing symptoms. My temperature ranged between 37.3°C and 37.7°C for days. I decided to grab my camera and do something I had never done before: while I had always photographed others’ suffering, now I had to photograph Marta’s suffering and my own, just as Marta’s condition began to worsen. She had trouble breathing and chest pains, as if a stone were lodged in her ribcage. I put myself in self-isolation, spending the next 14 days with Marta, in my apartment, using protective gear.The doctor suggested that we order an oxygen saturation monitor from the local chemist. It became our best friend. “If the level is 95, everything is fine. If it drops to 92, you need to run to the hospital.” My level was 99 Marta’s 98. But she was not doing well: she told me that it was as if she were wearing a bodice with the laces pulled tight. Friends brought us our groceries, leaving them outside the door. We did our best to plan our days: take our temperature, drink our freshly squeezed orange juice, take our temperature again, call the doctor. We included the oxygen monitor in our daily regime and moved on. I saw my mother on Skype. She was now breathing more easily. We exchanged smiles, but I was out of sorts.The doctors asked me to take a second test, but again I tested negative. Perhaps I’m immune? The days dragged on in my apartment, in black and white, like my photos. Sometimes we tried to smile, imagining that I was asymptomatic, because I was the virus. Our smiles seemed to bring good news. My mother left hospital, but I won’t be able to see her for weeks. Marta started breathing well again, and so did I. I would have liked to photograph my country in the midst of this emergency, the battles that the doctors wage on the frontline, the hospitals pushed to their limits, Italy on its knees fighting an invisible enemy. That enemy, a day in March, knocked on my door instead.Alessio Mamo was talking to Lorenzo Tondo."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/74d7500e698e92ed18497a246b80df9d27330fe5/0_169_1277_766/master/1277..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=743b8d8e27674709971278ecab0ec440","title":"how i became the duke of urbino getty museum recreate masterpiece","story":"The Getty Museum is challenging people to recreate masterpieces during self-isolation. Could my wife and I become a Piero della Francesca painting using tinfoil and headphones? • The best arts and entertainment during self-isolationLike most great ideas, it came from my wife. She had discovered the Getty Museum Challenge while scrolling through Twitter and concluded it would be a good idea if we were to join in and recreate a work of art using household objects. It sounded like a lot of hard work – not to mention an impossibly high bar, as one genius had recreated Dalí’s The Persitance of Memory using a cardboard box and a laptop – so my first, and indeed second, instinct was to refuse.But Jill was insistent and said she had found the ideal painting: a portrait of the Duke and Duchess of Urbino by Piero della Francesca, of which she had postcards on her study wall. Ideal because the duke looked every bit as gloomy and miserable as me. So she set to work. For her own likeness, she found some old lace she had bought in a French market years ago and turned it into a sleeve and a choker round her neck. For her headdress, she adapted a pair of headphones with tinfoil and paper. She contemplated going to Budgens to buy some Smarties to finish off the jewellery round her ears, but decided it was neither within the spirit of the challenge or the quarantine.My own transformation was rather more straightforward. First a white T-shirt, whose neckline would peep out above the bright red piece of felt – bought years ago to patch up one of the children’s Christmas stockings – through which she had cut a slit for my head. The big choice was the headwear. Either a dark red saucepan that was far too big or a heavy Le Creuset orange one that fitted rather too well. We agreed the orange worked best.Once kitted out, we lined ourselves up in profile against the kitchen wall and took photos of each other. Jill had to work hard to get the right expression for the duchess. I had no trouble looking like the grumpy duke. We then WhatsApped the pictures to our son, who turned them into a diptych frame. Job done. And the undoubted highlight of a rather miserable weekend. Now it’s your turn."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d8f5a0a94093be66c8d20b814b0102cb71f743e2/297_183_3476_2086/master/3476.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8af7565a2fcfbe99a673263cb36f018","title":"french writers corona getaways prompt backlash leila slimani marie darrieussecq","story":"Accounts of bucolic isolation by Leïla Slimani and Marie Darrieussecq prompt charges of elitism and comparisons to Marie Antoinette Leïla Slimani and Marie Darrieussecq may be two of France’s most acclaimed writers – but their accounts of life in lockdown in their second homes in the countryside have unleashed an outpouring of resentment among French readers, with one fellow writer even comparing Slimani to Marie Antoinette.Slimani, who won the Prix Goncourt for her bestselling novel Lullaby, wrote in Le Monde of how she had left Paris and sequestered herself and her children in their countryside second home since 13 March, telling them that it was “a bit like Sleeping Beauty”. “Tonight, I couldn’t sleep,” she wrote. “Through my bedroom window, I watched dawn break over the hills. The icy grass, the lime trees on the branches of which the first buds appear.”Darrieussecq, meanwhile, wrote in Le Point of how she hid her car with Paris number plates in the garage after arriving at her second home, using the older car that she keeps there to get around because “I feel it’s not good to drive around with a 75 on our behind”.“Two hinds graze in our fallow garden,” she continues. “We go to see the sea. It beats, heavy, strong, indifferent. The beach is deserted. I have a vision of a planet without humans.”As rural France turns its back on Parisians fleeing to the countryside, accusing them of spreading coronavirus, and while police checkpoints are set up to prevent city-dwellers from leaving to go to second homes during the Easter holidays, Slimani and Darrieussecq’s pieces received a less than warm reception from readers and fellow writers.“Hey poor people,” tweeted the journalist Nicolas Quenel. “Is all well in your 15m apartment for three? To pass the time and take off the pressure of confinement, you can always read the journal of a writer in her family home in the countryside.”In Brain, Félix Lemaître wrote that contemplating the horizon, as Slimani does in her piece, is a “class privilege”, and that the author’s photos of her country idyll have “a little taste of porn, of obscenity, for all those whose vision for the next few weeks will boil down to an inner courtyard or the building opposite”.The Lullaby author’s experience of confinement in her half-timbered house in the countryside is “in a parallel universe dreamed up by the Grimm brothers”, wrote author Diane Ducret in Marianne.“Our intellectual elites sometimes seem to me ungrounded, as if the French revolution did not take place in all areas, and that only a certain social class was authorised to express the taste of the time,” Ducret wrote.“From my window, you can’t see the sky. The building opposite is dirty, the empty streets fill me with roaring anxieties. Being stripped by a virus in my 30s, dying alone, perhaps, in a two-room apartment, tempts me only moderately. It would have been less of a seller than the golden hills and camellias of Leïla Slimani, but it would have been more representative of what we are experiencing.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c9c0703f7a31d6fad352827015058e2326dae1c0/7730_0_3750_2256/master/3750..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=143f69b9516514bb42e78630c8357a45","title":"poem of the week easter by roisin kelly","story":"A chance sighting of an ex-lover sets off very ambivalent emotions, but also a kind of miracleYou walk by holding a bunch of flowersnever knowing that you’ve just performed a miracle.Are those flowers for your girl?I imagine her dressed up like an Easter eggin yellow and pink. I’d tap at you like an egg,cracking your thin chocolate shell.If I were made of chocolate too, I’d breakoff parts of myself to give to you and your girl.Once, I gave my words for gardenand water and moonlit and loveto a man who kissed me. After he rolleda stone over my heart and shut me offfrom the world, I had no words leftto describe the dark dream that followed.Now you’ve walked by, godlike in jeansand an old t-shirt, the sun glinting on onesilver earring. Now a rose is once againnot only rose but also soft and redand thorn and bee and honey.Now a bird is singing song and treeand nest in a high place and blue speckled egg.You yourself are glowing with words, they moveup and down you as if they’re alive.The words bring themselves to meand tell my tongue sweetness over and over.The words are everything. With them,I’ll turn water to wine at your wedding.From Mercy, the first full-length collection by the young Belfast-born poet, Róisín Kelly, Easter seems to have a special glow to it. And no, the glow isn’t only that of romantic love. The latter is a strong contributory factor, of course: its pains are rekindled for the speaker when her ex-boyfriend walks by “holding a bunch of flowers”. The question “Are those flowers for your girl?” contextualises it a little, while retaining the tonal mystery. Is the voice angry, sarcastic, sorrowful? We might guess it’s all three.I like the mixed emotions playing throughout the earlier passages of the poem, and how they are finally resolved. Easter eggs initially supply the poetic calories. All three players in the love triangle are turned into chocolate, the man’s current girlfriend being a particularly sickly and triumphant example “dressed up …  in yellow and pink”. The man is seen as the more vulnerable.Writing a kind of verse letter to the man in question, the speaker imagines tapping him and “cracking your thin chocolate shell”. Birth may be suggested, but death occurs first. She imagines her own comic-extreme self-sacrifice, breaking off parts of her chocolate self to give the man and his girl.Later on, imagery from the Passion of Christ recalls the numbness and sense of being buried alive “after he rolled  a stone over my heart  and shut me off from the world”. Probably the same boyfriend was the culprit, though not necessarily. Kelly’s change of pronoun leaves it ambiguous. The “sepulchre” analogy is pitched high, yet it’s also faithful to the experience of severe depression, a suffocating stone that’s all too real.Now the speaker returns the ex-lover to mortal form, a little self-mockingly at first – “godlike in jeans  and an old t-shirt, the sun glinting on one  silver earring”. The mood has changed, perhaps with the recovery of simultaneously erotic and sublimated feelings.Words withheld and words given become the dominant theme. In line nine, the first of the special, italicised words and phrases, garden, helps the transition to biblical analogy. There is an implied betrayal. But the words are magically potent. They ignite the rose, although they include thorn. They produce birds who lay “blue speckled egg(s)” in nests high in trees. Kelly’s italics slow the reader, so we savour these archetypal symbols, these ordinary happy words, and, importantly, imagine them as the especially meaningful gifts originally offered in the poet’s native Irish language.Six lines from the end, the poet turns on her full power with that marvellous image of the man clothed in, covered in, words that “move  up and down you, as if they’re alive”. Most significantly, “the words bring themselves to me  and tell my tongue sweetness over and over”. They enable the speaker to find her own words and “The words are everything…” Once more, I was reminded of a passage from the New Testament: “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God. And the word was God.”Out of the rediscovery of inspiration and language comes the generosity of forgiveness – and, of course, the miracle. A miracle was first attributed to the man in the poem’s second line: now, an old-new miracle is performed by the speaker. What could be more generous than turning water to wine at a rival’s wedding feast? And of course the wine is also the poet’s gift-to-self – part of her own word feast, now freely flowing.• Easter is reproduced with permission from Róisín Kelly’s collection, Mercy (Bloodaxe Books, 2020)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/968d61551dfa7c4b8c1a800a041c1089f85cc13a/0_308_1080_648/master/1080..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c1e5c0423ca9f6dede2b6ea2a82caec1","title":"tips links and suggestions what are you reading this week","story":"Your space to discuss the books you are reading and what you think of them Welcome to this week’s blogpost. Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from the last week.Let’s start with a “good read for the times”. MissBurgundy recommends Xavier de Maistre’s 1794 “delight” Journey Around My Room (Voyage Autour De Ma Chambre):He’s in lock-down in his room for six weeks under house arrest and makes the most of it by describing its contents, his conversations with his servant Joannetti and his dog Rosine. Amongst other things.I don’t know what I said last time but it’s a good read for these times - not long, like nothing else before or since and full of nice people (well his love interest Madame de Hautcastel could be a bit more affectionate) and a lovely dog.Paul Auster’s City Of Glass feels resonant to PatLux:I know he did not write the book with me in mind but it feels as if he did. His main character loves walking in New York City and on pages 106 to 108 of the Faber and Faber 1987 edition he takes a walk from the Upper Westside down to Bowling Green and then back up to the UN building.. On the walk he passes a whole host of places and streets which have huge personal significance for me who lived and worked in the city for nine years. The memories came flooding back, some happy some sad. All crystal clear.David Foster Wallace’s 1989 book of essays, Girl With The Curious Hair, has been similarly evocative for WildIrish:What if you could summon the dearly departed back to Earth? Reading David’s essays always feels as if a big brother has stopped over to tell me a beautiful wise story. A story with real purpose. A somewhat mostly true story. One that is guaranteed to make me laugh and smile and yes, even cry. And I think of David as I read his words and I whisper, “you are so right, so incredibly right,” in my mind I have had so many long lingering conversations and dinner dates with David Foster Wallace. Maybe we all meet up a bunch of fellow writers at a secluded location say, the French Countryside home of another writer, or maybe just a benevolent host. Long drawn out conversations mixed with gusto, passion and humor. Together we solve all the world’s problems over some really great wine, gin and tonic, I’ll take my Amaretto Sour Neat, please … Yes. I think I would like very much to return to 1989 and do every single thing all over again. Just to see what might happen....Missing David Foster Wallace in these times and identifying with his writing like no other.Norwegian Wood by Haruki Murakami has elicited greenmill’s sympathy:My second by him and the latest in a bit of a Japanese rampage (fiction and non) having visited that country for the first time last year. A conjunction of messy student sex and genuinely poignant lost love with some quasi-philosophical meaning of life stuff mixed in. An enjoyable read which elicited my sympathy for the main characters. The word Wood (American slang) in the title gives advance notice that there is a colossal amount of masturbation in this book, solo and otherwise.Iris Murdoch continues to delight with her picture of a shudder-making pious community, notably the portrait of the blandly bullying and passive-aggressively smug Mrs Mark. Sinister overtones emerge.Tana French’s In The Woods has made booklooker rush to the end:Ever peeked at the ending of a detective novel? I have not done so before, but Tana French’s In the Woods in combination with the virus situation seems to have upped the suspense and my stress levels so much that I did ... It did not spoil my pleasure of reading the book, though.Some useful tips for coping with low concentration levels from MalaclypseTheYounger:Like others here, I’ve been struggling to concentrate on reading for very long, or to get emotionally invested in fictional characters or plot, or to follow a sustained argument to its conclusion. Can’t think why...But this week I’ve been able to enjoy reading some poetry (Anne Carson, Stephen Dunn), and also reading some books about how poetry works (Rhian Williams, Mary Oliver).I’ve also started reading some lyric essays, which is a hybrid genre or category that draws on aspect of essays and lyric poetry. Last night I was reading Eula Biss’s lyric essay, “The Pain Scale”, and it made me laugh aloud - something I wasn’t expecting to happen any time soon, let alone while reading about pain!Finally, BlogWriter has just finished The Old Man and the Sea by Ernest Hemingway:It has been several decades since I first read it, and it felt as fresh as new. The fighting race of the old man with the great fish, and its bloody aftermath, is handled with writing skill combined with the author’s first-hand experience: when Santiago hits a shark with his tiller we hit with him, when his hands bleed ours bleed, too. And when the boy Manolin cries by his bedside, we cry with him. A masterpiece worthy of the Nobel prize.I think so too.

However, this was the weakest March since the late 90s, when the twice-yearly number plate change was introduced.Britain’s car industry was already struggling before the pandemic – hit by a combination of falling sales, a shift away from diesel vehicles and Brexit uncertainty.Government to back £330bn of loans to support businesses through a Bank of England scheme for big firms. There are loans of up to £5m with no interest for six months for smaller companies.Taxes levied on commercial premises will be abolished this year for all retailers, leisure outlets and hospitality sector firms.Britain’s smallest 700,000 businesses eligible for cash grants of £10,000. Small retailers, leisure and hospitality firms can get bigger grants of £25,000.Government to increase value of universal credit and tax credits by £1,000 a year, as well as widening eligibility for these benefits.Statutory sick pay to be made available from day one, rather than day four, of absence from work, although ministers have been criticised for not increasing the level of sick pay above £94.25 a week. Small firms can claim for state refunds on sick pay bills.Local authorities to get a £500m hardship fund to provide people with council tax payment relief.Mortgage and rental holidays available for up to three months.The figures are a stark indication of what happens when economies grind to a halt, said Mike Hawes, the chief executive of the SMMT.“How long the market remains stalled is uncertain but it will reopen and the products will be there. In the meantime, we will continue to work with government to do all we can to ensure the thousands of people employed in this sector are ready for work,” he said.Forecasts suggest the continued closure of car plants across Europe and North America will cost the auto industry more than $100bn (£82bn) in lost revenues if the shutdown lasts until the end of April.All major European carmakers have suspended production because of disruption caused by the spread of the coronavirus and if this continues as expected until the end of April, this will account for €66bn (£58bn) in lost sales in Europe, or 2.6m cars. In North America it would lead to lost sales of about $52bn (£42bn), or 2m cars.The calculations have been made by Ian Henry, the owner of the consultancy AutoAnalysis, who produces forecasts for the SMMT, along with the automotive team at consultancy GlobalData.Assembly lines ground to a halt in March as the lockdown across Europe disrupted global supply chains, and analysts predicted large falls in demand in all key markets.All volume manufacturers from BMW to Toyota and Nissan to Jaguar Land Rover sent their workers home after the worsening outbreak on the continent led companies to examine the health implications for their workers.The story was repeated across North America as the Detroit carmakers, including General Motors, Ford and Fiat Chrysler, shut down their plants.Auto firms initially closed their sites for a number of weeks, saying they would keep the situation under review, but the shutdown is anticipated to last longer than first expected.Henry predicts that each additional week of plant closures in Europe will cost the industry an extra €8bn (£7bn) in lost production value and similarly $7.5bn (£6bn) in North America.International supply chains complicate the question of when car plants can reopen, Henry said, while it is also difficult to predict when consumers will starting buying cars again.“What will be the state of consumer demand after this?” Henry said. “Will the man in the street want to buy a new car? A huge proportion of cars go to companies and fleet managers won’t be looking to buy cars for executives.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ecf53640c246f7c415e61ac51cb5fe2fa88466d6/0_0_4608_2765/master/4608..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=499ef554f305b4fb01735fa89380271d","title":"debenhams appoint administrators second time in year coronavirus lockdown","story":"Department store chain seeks to protect assets from creditors during coronavirus lockdownDebenhams has confirmed it intends to appoint administrators for the second time in a year as it tries to protect its assets from creditors during the coronavirus lockdown.The struggling department store chain said the process would provide it with protection from the threat of legal action “that could have the effect of pushing the business into liquidation while its 142 UK stores remain closed”.The retailer’s creditors will be prevented from pursuing legal action for 10 working days while the company tries to secure a rescue deal.The company, which has 22,000 staff, was rescued by its lenders after collapsing into administration only a year ago.Debenhams said it had the support of its lenders to enter administration and was engaging with its employees and suppliers.“The group is making preparations to resume trading in its stores once government restrictions are lifted,” the retailer said.The majority of the group’s employees in the UK are being paid under the government’s furlough scheme following its order for all non-essential stores to close.Debenhams is continuing to trade online across the UK, Ireland and Denmark, and customer orders, gift cards and returns are being accepted and processed normally.Despite continuation of online trading, Debenhams could not generate enough revenue to keep itself afloat, said Julie Palmer, a partner at insolvency firm Begbies Traynor.“Debenhams has been in financial difficulties for a while so this doesn’t come as a major surprise, but it will leave its 20,000 plus strong workforce in a precarious position who will struggle to get new employment during the ongoing uncertainty,” Palmer said.Debenhams was taken over last year by a group of its financial backers, including the US hedge funds Silver Point and GoldenTree, after collapsing into administration. It then used an insolvency process known as a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) to cull unprofitable sites and cut rents.Since then, it has closed 22 stores, 19 of which shut in January, resulting in more than 700 job losses. A further 28 of its remaining stores had been slated for permanent closure next year.Debenhams’ renewed collapse into administration could lead to a revival of interest from Mike Ashley’s Frasers Group, formerly known as Sports Direct, which has previously suggested a merger with its House of Fraser department store chain.Ashley’s £150m investment in Debenhams was wiped out in the retailers’s administration in 2019 and he later argued for a legal challenge to the chain’s CVA store closure plan.Debenhams, which has more than £600m of debt, is one of many retailers in financial difficulties because of the coronavirus shutdown.Since the lockdown began, Debenhams has written to its landlords asking for a five-month rent holiday, a move echoed by other chains including New Look and Topshop owner Arcadia. Two of Britain’s largest shopping centre owners, Intu Properties and Hammerson, reported that they had only received around a third of rent due from their tenants for the second quarter of the year on its due date at the end of March.An extended period of store closures has left Debenhams and many of its fellow fashion retailers with a large amount of stock which they cannot sell, as an estimated £10bn of clothing piles up in warehouses.Retail insiders reported that major firms including Primark, Peacocks, Arcadia and Next had all stopped taking deliveries to their warehouses because they had no more room.Many brands have continued to trade online during the government-mandated store closures.

The main difference between the two is that Aids at first appeared to afflict specific populations, while coronavirus is an equal opportunity malady. I remember when I visited Paris in 1981 I told Michel Foucault, the French philosopher, about Aids and he laughed at this American invention that seemed to target both gay men and Haitians. He said: “That’s too perfect, blacks and gays, only American racists and puritans would have come up with that delusion.” He died from the disease in 1984.In the mid-80s, I wrote an article in which I said American gays, at least younger ones, had worked through their self-hatred in the post-Stonewall 70s but that internalised homophobia had come back with the Aids stigma in the 1980s. We knew we were a hated community relatives wouldn’t let us hold their babies. Eventually the viral nature of the disease became known and we discovered the only two significant modes of transmission were blood and semen, but in the early days people feared physical contact, mosquitoes, kisses, coughs. Actually, coronavirus is much more easily communicated than Aids ever was.I was the first president and one of the six founders of the Gay Men’s Health Crisis in 1981 we felt we were so isolated, so alone, in our struggle that we could only imagine giving a disco fundraiser for gay men. When later I observed Foucault’s widower, Daniel Defert, in 1985 start the charity Aides, I was impressed that he went immediately to the French health minister American gays had such low self-esteem they (we) didn’t think we had the right to societal concern.Aids bore a badge of shame even in the gay community – if you were infected it was your own fault for not practising safe sex – whereas everyone feels sympathy for coronavirus victims. Whereas Aids was a death sentence for almost all who were afflicted, most people with coronavirus show only mild symptoms and even those who are hospitalised mostly recover. Whereas doctors and nurses did not get Aids from working with patients (except for a few unfortunate healthcare and lab workers who accidentally were contaminated with infected blood) health workers are highly vulnerable to coronavirus, and shortages of protective equipment only increase this vulnerability.Coronavirus is the first pandemic of the social media era, and misinformation, conspiracy theories and racist slurs flood various public sites. Have you heard the one that Boris Johnson invented the infection in order to win back public sympathy? Such scandals were also perpetrated by hearsay in the Aids era, but social media has amplified them.While the rumour mill might be taking the same approach, official pronouncements from the White House take a different tack. Ronald Reagan only mentioned Aids once, whereas Donald Trump has turned his daily televised briefings into self-congratulatory rallies. Which is worse? Presidential indifference or the politicisation of the bully-pulpit (not to mention Trumpian rumours)? Remember when Trump said there were just a few cases in America and those were being cured, that the virus would vanish miraculously? Or remember when he wouldn’t let the sick passengers disembark from a cruise ship because that would augment “his” numbers? Just as Aids was first dubbed Gay-Related Immune Deficiency (Grid), the president has worked hard to dub this virus the “Chinese virus”.Both pandemics have had their folklore “origin” stories. Randy Shilts in his 1987 book And the Band Played On later claimed he was forced by his publisher to pin the American spread of Aids on “patient zero”, a handsome Canadian flight attendant, just as the American plague is being traced back to a mythical Wuhan businessman. At least most educated people don’t try to locate the person who “gave” them coronavirus, whereas many Aids patients sought to blame a particular sex partner. Now the contacts are ubiquitous and might be your granddaughter or nephew or your murderous teen who’s still playing basketball or enjoying spring break in Florida.Ironically, the same doctor, Anthony Fauci, was the “villain” of the Aids epidemic (the activist group Act-Up accused him of not releasing life-saving drugs) and is the hero of coronavirus (the voice of scientific reason in the Trump administration). In both epidemics he has insisted on running studies of new drugs. In the crazy Trumpian far right he has been accused of undermining the president’s looniest pronouncements.Whereas Elizabeth Taylor’s compassion and Aids fundraising, for instance, seemed remarkable, New York governor Andrew Cuomo’s intelligent take-charge attitude sets the civilised norm. In any event, by embracing the coronavirus cause, he runs no risk to his reputation.Aids was surrounded from the beginning by moral opprobrium in America, especially because the disease was linked with perversion and sexual excess coronavirus is already associated with maskless renegades who don’t keep their social distance.Whereas I became positive for Aids in 1985, I survived because I was a “slow progressor” and my T-cell count fell very, very gradually. Now I’m going into my third week of coronavirus quarantine – I wonder if I’ll survive this one.• Edmund White is the author of 30 books.

From the BBC to bin collectors, shop workers to care home staff: all have suddenly been recognised as vital and appreciated by public and politicians alike.However, as pressure mounts over the capacity for coronavirus testing and the supply of personal protective equipment and ventilators, finding someone to blame rather than fixing the problem seems to be the priority for some at the heart of government. Well-placed anonymous sources have started pointing fingers at everyone from the cabinet secretary, Mark Sedwill, to Public Health England.They “bumble along, occasionally banning Coco Pops or something, but for the most part entirely out of sight” is how one source from within government described some of the most senior public health professionals in the country. Elsewhere, an unnamed minister has been happy to lay the blame for the lack of testing at the door of Public Health England, while a “senior figure” was busy pointing the finger at NHS England for a “system” that had given “incorrect” and “overly optimistic” information to ministers. Imagine being on the frontline of planning for a pandemic, knowing the consequences of the decisions you’re making while potentially risking your own health, then seeing that this is what some within government think of your work.For four short weeks, the briefing war against the civil service that had characterised the government before coronavirus had abated. Witnessing the incredible response of the service, I had hoped that this government would not return to some of the bad old ways. From the job retention scheme, repatriating travellers abroad and processing an extra million universal credit claimants, to those trying to understand and plan for the consequences of this virus: this list is endless, and mostly unseen.The service itself has also had to completely reorganise, with hundreds of thousands of staff working remotely and in different ways to keep vital public services functioning. Many are also on the frontline, because some public services simply cannot be delivered remotely, and we’re witnessing the first tragic consequences of that necessity.If mistakes have been made, ministers and civil servants will rightly be held accountable. Every government in the world has been overwhelmed by this virus and will have made major mistakes – some avoidable, some not. While ministers and officials must be scrutinised for their decisions as events unfold, many of these questions will inevitably be for another day.Right now, we need ministers and their advisers focusing on saving lives, not their careers. While public servants across the UK are working night and day – literally putting their lives on the line for the country – some within government are still putting self-preservation first. It is not only cowardly and shameful, it’s also destructive.• Dave Penman is general secretary of the FDA union, which represents civil servants"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7fe978acfa65ddbc7d2ffb6a3da801b82e244cf6/0_11_1603_962/master/1603..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=38001046b23e3331df753dc01d45de5e","title":"eu stronger pandemic merkel dictatorship germany coronavirus","story":"One member state has become a dictatorship as others spiral into debt. Germany must lead through the coronavirus crisis “Europe will be forged in crises,” said Jean Monnet, one of the founding fathers of the European Union, “and will be the sum of the solutions adopted for those crises.” What kind of Europe emerges from the coronavirus crisis will depend on the answers given to three tests.First, the Hungarian test: can a dictatorship be a member of the EU? Even before this year, Viktor Orbán and his Fidesz party had so far eroded democracy in Hungary that the country would not qualify for admission to the EU if it were a candidate for membership. He has now used the coronavirus pandemic as justification to take sweeping emergency powers, allowing him to rule by decree for an unlimited period. Hungary is – for the duration of these powers – a dictatorship. Monnet also said a dictatorship cannot be a member of the European Community (which subsequently became the EU). Today, one is.The sanctions available to EU institutions are slow and complex, but there is one organisation that can and should act decisively now: the European People’s party (EPP), the hugely influential centre-right grouping to which Fidesz still effectively belongs. (Although the party is notionally suspended, Fidesz MEPs still operate as part of the EPP group in the European parliament.) The EPP should have kicked Fidesz out long ago. Instead, it has pursued a policy of appeasement. If it does not expel the Hungarian dictator’s party now, it will lose any last shreds of credibility. When EPP politicians make fine speeches about democracy, the rule of law and European values, young Europeans will be more than justified in shouting: you utter hypocrites!Next, the Italian test. Is there solidarity in the heart of Europe? Will the eurozone enable its hardest-hit member states to recover? Last month we watched with horror as one of the most highly developed parts of our continent, with one of the best health services, was overwhelmed by the pandemic. When Italy emerges from this Gehenna, it will face a huge challenge of economic recovery, handicapped by the fact it already has one of the eurozone’s heaviest burdens of national debt. Its ability to borrow the large sums needed will depend on the credibility of mutual support inside the eurozone.And finally, there is the test facing Germany: can it save the day? Will Europe’s central power finally face up to the logic of a monetary union from which it has very significantly benefitted? Germany has produced the most impressive national response to the pandemic of any democracy outside Asia. Its provision of large-scale testing, ventilators and critical care beds shows the advantages of having both good public services and a strong medical industry. Angela Merkel gave an outstanding television address to the nation – a lecture on democracy, solidarity and inidual responsibility, delivered with the brain of a scientist and the heart of a pastor’s daughter. Only one thing was missing. The word “Europe” was not mentioned.In the meantime, Germany has shown solidarity with its hard-pressed European neighbours, sending consignments of face masks to Lombardy and transporting critically ill Italian and French patients to German hospitals. But it is in responding to the economic and political crisis that German leadership is really called for.Germany can help Europe pass the Hungarian test, not least because Merkel’s Christian Democrats are the most powerful party in the EPP. Now they must surely come out for the expulsion of Fidesz. All the candidates to succeed Merkel as leader of the Christian Democrats should be asked where they stand on this.It is in meeting the Italian test, however, that Germany’s contribution will be decisive. As one recent headline put it, Italy’s future is in German hands. If the eurozone – and therefore Europe – is to recover economic health, the Italian government and other southern European governments must be able to borrow money using the financial credibility of Germany and other northern European states. In the dry jargon, there would be “debt mutualisation”. Next to Italy, Spain has been hardest hit by the crisis. The Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, has talked of the need for Europe to build a “wartime economy” and appealed for a new intra-European Marshall plan.Seven leading German economists have cogently argued that this recovery plan should include the issuance of €1tn of community bonds, jointly guaranteed by all eurozone governments. Unlike the eurobonds discussed after the financial crisis, this would be new money, dedicated to addressing the results of a disaster for which no southern European government could possibly be held responsible. To ask how precisely this support is best given would take us into the acronymic weeds of ECB, EIB, ESM and even EFSM (don’t ask). But the basic question is simple: having cast aside its own fiscal taboos (“debt brake”, “black zero”) to help itself out, to the tune of what may well turn out to be close to €1tn, is Germany prepared to do a fraction of that to help other countries in the same boat? In the case of a monetary union, “the same boat” is not just a loose metaphor. Whatever package European leaders agree upon this week, it must be big, and be seen to be big.Germany’s leading tabloid, Bild, recently published an open letter to Italy headed “We are with you!” It praised Italy for having brought “good food” to Germany and concluded: “Ciao, Italia. We’ll see you again shortly. Here’s to an espresso, a vino rosso, whether on holiday or in the pizzeria.” An interesting idea of solidarity. A few days earlier, the same paper published an article headlined “What will become of the euro? Debt mutualisation is threatened.” Dear Bild reader, what Italy needs is not your custom over a holiday espresso in Tuscany, charming though that would doubtless be, but the mutualisation of debt, as a necessary consequence of a European monetary union from which you, dear Bild reader, have benefitted greatly.There is one person in Europe who can both take and defend the necessary actions: Chancellor Merkel. Last year, I argued that Germany needed a change of government, because the grand coalition was exhausted and was strengthening the political extremes in opposition to it. That is out of the question now, in the middle of a force-10 storm. Instead, Merkel has an unexpected last chance to go down in history as a major architect of a stronger European Union. Bismarck said a politician’s task is to hear God’s footsteps advancing through history, and then jump to hang on to his coattails. That coat is passing now."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45437c22b849bad6f7a060888aaef7b2eb25ca4b/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fcbba60f82e1865a4003f602e3968ee0","title":"matt hancock biotech germany coronavirus health system","story":"The health minister should look to other factors in Germany’s response – including a continually well-funded health system• See all our coronavirus coverageWhen Olfert Landt first heard about a novel virus ravaging parts of China, he sprung into action, and by the 10 January, according to Bloomberg, the microbiologist, working with researchers at Berlin’s Charité hospital, had developed a viable test for the disease.TIB Molbiol Syntheselabor GmbH, the small company Landt leads, had produced more than 4 million tests by 12 March. It’s the kind of story that has fuelled claims that Germany’s strong biotech industry has provided the country with a unique advantage in combating the coronavirus. Donald Trump retweeted the Bloomberg story about Landt. The UK’s health minister, Matt Hancock, who held his first press conference on Thursday after recovering from coronavirus himself, didn’t mention Landt, but he was quick to point to the strength of the German pharmaceutical industry as the primary reason for the country’s aggressive testing regime and low death rate: “My German counterpart, for instance,” Hancock said, “could call upon 100 test labs ready and waiting when the crisis stuck, thanks in large part to Roche, one of the biggest diagnostic companies in the world.”It’s easy to understand why the UK, in particular, is feeling defensive: while Germany has tested nearly a million samples for Covid-19, the UK, according to data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, has tested just 152,979 people for the Corona virus according to the Department of Health and Social Care has tested just 195,524 people up until yesterday morning.But Hancock’s attempt to attribute Germany’s success to a strong biotech sector rings false. The four million tests produced by Landt’s company have been distributed throughout the world. Indeed, the biochemist told Deutsche Welle that he would like to start delivering tests to Russia, Myanmar, Pakistan, and Iran – countries that are currently under embargo. It isn’t an accident that, unlike the UK, Germany has had such success in engaging a wide network of laboratories to conduct Covid-19 testing. The country’s federal system has long assigned the national government to a coordinating role, and regional autonomy over large parts of the healthcare system may have helped to create more resilient systems, better able to coordinate the work of different laboratories.Even as the country’s more distributed healthcare system has helped to spread the burden of testing more evenly, a strong bureaucratic state has stepped in to help coordinate testing, containment and treatment efforts. In Bavaria, teachers and other furloughed state employees have been reassigned to service at the health departments, where they help to coordinate the logistics of the response.Despite the success of Germany’s response to the pandemic so far, many voices in the country have called for caution. The virus seems to have gained a foothold relatively late here, which has allowed for a more coordinated response than would have been possible in Italy or China. Even so, and despite aggressive testing, it is still entirely possible that the number of cases will spike, overwhelming the healthcare system and leading to much higher mortality.Still, if current trends continue, Germany will have shown itself to be uniquely capable among western nations of dealing with a global pandemic. The huge number of tests and its low mortality rate can be attributed to a number of different factors –  the relative youth of many people infected by the virus and potential underreporting especially – but the country’s proximity to a major Swiss biotech firm is very low among them indeed. If Hancock insists on reducing the success of the German response to a single factor, he would do far better to look at continued investment into the country’s health system. Germany has more hospital beds per person than anywhere else in Europe – 8.1 per 1000 inhabitants, compared with 3.2 in Italy, 2.8 in the US, and 2.6 in the UK. These hospitals host some of the testing facilities that have enabled Germany to respond to the crisis so aggressively. For now, they also have the capacity to treat patients from France and Italy while other healthcare systems collapse under the strain of the pandemic.• Peter Kuras is a writer and translator based in Berlin"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3fe9816a1e8a885e787ccdf42173f6157865e116/0_133_4000_2400/master/4000..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3a2c3159604e16d283063ecc2b7957a5","title":"why are we talking about morrissey and buffy because cultural nostalgia is now king","story":"We are living out of the cultural store cupboard – and I’m saving Jilly Cooper’s Riders for when stocks get really lowThis period is a hall of mirrors, all we have is all we have.

In my ideal world, this would be an efficient and resourceful stockpot rolling on a back burner, a legion of preserves in the larder, no stale slice of bread or cake left behind, meals cooked with two in mind (the cook’s answer to a child’s one for me, one for you – “you” being the freezer). And while I sometimes achieve some of this, reality is often milder, even in lockdown.Leftovers are a relay baton into the next meal: a parmesan rind prompting soup, a no-cook jam, the surplus from a lasagne, rolled into cannelloni and then frozen. Then there is the continuation of ideas, the variations on a theme, which feels like the cooking equivalent of wearing the same outfit again and again, washing it but then putting it back on again because it is comfortable and familiar. For the last month of lockdown, I have been wearing a black polo-neck, a denim skirt and black or red opaque tights and making variations on a yeasted dough theme.When I can find yeast and flour, that is. Fortunately for me, both our local bakery – with its two-metre-distance masking-tape stripes – and supermarket are calling out greedy shoppers. Quite literally shouting “Oi” across the aisle, reminding whoever that they will still be here tomorrow and not to panic. I do panic, almost every day, my fears about the domestic minutiae and the huge alike, spiralling outwards like radiation. It would be untrue to say I’m calmed by dissolving yeast in warm liquid for focaccia, milk rolls, last week’s maritozzi or this week’s cheesy Easter bread. But I am steadied and distracted by the process, the congeniality of the bubbling yeast, the promise of the thick smell as I bake, and thoughts of eating.Most recipes seem to suggest letting this sort of pizza di pasqua al formaggio, or crescia di formaggio, rest overnight, which has as much to do with flavour (it certainly deepens) and consistency (firms), but also timing. You make it the day before in preparation for a late breakfast on Easter Sunday. While different regions have different types of yeasted bread enriched with cheese, some sweeter, some made with ricotta, others studded with cubes of salami, the accompaniments are pretty consistent: sharp and salty cheeses, hard-boiled eggs, salami or cured meats, big bowls of broad beans or peas in their pods … abundance we almost certainly won’t see this year, but that we can imagine. I think it is better still after two days, whether that be Easter Monday or any day, cut into slices (which invariably crumble at the edges), toasted and spread generously with butter.25g fresh yeast, or 10g dried250ml milk, tepidA pinch of sugar2 eggs75g parmesan, grated75g pecorino romano, grated60ml olive oil7g saltBlack pepper250g 00 flour250g strong white bread flourIf you are using fresh yeast, dissolve it in the milk with a pinch of sugar, a spoonful of flour and leave to activate for 10 minutes.

The sudden shortages, the constant meal planning, the rationing of fresh ingredients and the eking out of every last scrap ...There’s no doubt that these are good habits to get into, and that this period has the potential to make better cooks of us all. We might become more conscious about food waste, realise we don’t need to eat meat as much as we thought we did, grow more creative with the ingredients we have available.Below are 10 recipes from my archive that I’m revisiting most at the moment: nourishing, hearty family meals that give us the goodness we need as resourcefully as possible. If, like me, you suddenly find yourself at home with children, some of these make an excellent ersion for little hands and big appetites.Apples, carrot, nuts, raisins, herbs, and the eponymous rice, a dish that’s packed with both flavour and nutrition, making it a brilliant lunchtime filler for all the family. If you don’t have the wild rice I suggest in the recipe, use whatever you have, such as basmati.Comforting, utterly delicious and cheap as chips! My children were fascinated by how to make baked beans from scratch and to see how the various ingredients add different levels of flavour. Leave out the meat for a veggie version, and the eggs and sour cream for vegans.This macaroni cheese is a great way to make a bit of cheese go a long way and is spiked with broccoli, giving the whole family all the nutrition it needs to stay happy and well.If you are finding eggs hard to find in the shops try making this silky, indulgent and incredibly delicious Catalan-inspried allioli, using apples to bind the mayonnaise instead of the normal egg. Layer it over sliced parsnips with hints of garlic and toasted nuts for a magical, warming gratin.Sweet soft wedges of red onions cooked in butter and balsamic vinegar popped into pastry with blue cheese, thyme and black pepper.The rich, warming spices so loved in Mexico add delicious layers of flavour to this fun, family dish. The sweet onions, tomatoes and pulses make the small amount of meat go a long way adding extra bang for your buck in terms of key protein.The tomato sauce can be made in minutes with tins from the cupboard, leaving you to focus on making the dumplings. Experiment with different greens and get young people involved.The glorious flavours and textures at play here – buttery, crispy pastry filled with salty feta and sweet spinach – belie the simplicity of the recipe. It makes a killer of a lunch or dinner with remarkably little fuss.A brilliantly cheap but tasty supper. Serve with rice or bread or with some sausages on the side.These roasted roots are infinitely adaptable – swap vegetables in and out, try feta if you haven’t got goat’s cheese, and, while saba is hard to get hold of at the moment, I suggest reducing some balsamic vinegar to a syrupy glaze in its place."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/242035e1955c4d63ef0d05332b4734a28dd7d59f/0_894_4306_2583/master/4306.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c030f23843368c67d313a3d5e5526617","title":"vegan easter moroccan cauliflower spice tahnini tom hunt recipe waste not","story":"A vegan alternative to an Easter roast: whole cauliflower, smothered in spices, and dressed with tahini and sweet molassesThis is an elaborate way to serve a majestic cauliflower, and makes a great, plant-based alternative to the more traditional Easter roast lamb. The whole plant – including the leaves – is roasted whole and intact, seasoned with an aromatic, Moroccan-style spice mix, then dressed with a satisfying layer of glorious tahini sauce and sweet molasses. Ideally, use a cauli that has plenty of leaves, because they go crisp, umami-rich and flavoursome when roasted.This makes use of a spice mix that’s traditionally used on lamb. The cauliflower is best served whole and carved at the table to share. To save energy, fill the oven with other ingredients while you’re cooking this – roast veg and meat will keep in the fridge for up to five days, and are handy to have around for making quick meals throughout the week.Serves 4-61 head cauliflower, with leaves1 glug extra-virgin olive oil1 tsp ground cumin1 tsp ground coriander½ tsp ground caraway (optional)½ tsp freshly ground black pepper½ tsp cayenne pepper (optional)2 tsp sea saltPeel of ½ unwaxed lemon, finely sliced1 drizzle blackstrap or date molasses2 tsp black andor white sesame seeds, toasted in a dry frying panFor the tahini sauce60g dark tahini¼ unwaxed lemon, zested and juiced½ small garlic clove, peeled¼ tsp sea saltHeat the oven to 180C (160C fan)gas 4.

Produced with the excellent Dutch football writer David Winner, the former Arsenal striker’s memoir is all the richer for allowing Bergkamp to share his footballing philosophy instead of being a chronological journey through his life. But thanks to Winner’s conversations with Bergkamp and the Dutchman’s former teammates and managers, it also contains plenty of great stories. A top insight into the mind of a true artist. Jacob SteinbergThis is an old-fashioned football book, full of evocative photographs, interviews and anecdotes rather than philosophical musing or tactical theory, but as its subject matter neatly encompasses my formative years and childhood passions I turn to it regularly and with pleasure. Everything that matters is in here, from Gordon West’s handbag to Stan Boardman’s frustration as a Liverpool A-teamer to Gary Lineker’s lucky boots, with special mention of Clive Thomas of Treorchy. The underlying theme is Liverpool’s gradual rise to supremacy, of course, but I can even forgive that. These were happy days. Paul WilsonWritten with the US audience in mind, this might be more of a recap for the peeled-eyeball obsessive. But it is an excellent recap, with wonderful access and forensic detail on the Premier League’s rise to global alpha status. At a time when there is a chance to reset and possibly even – no, really – do things differently, it’s useful to remember how finely poised many of the choices that got us here were. All told with an arch sense of humour. Barney RonayIn 1996 Castel di Sangro, a team from an impoverished town of 5,000 inhabitants, sealed their spectacular rise from the amateur leagues to Serie B courtesy of a penalty save from a veteran substitute goalkeeper making his first appearance of the season. McGinniss, having become obsessed with the sport thanks to Roberto Baggio and the 1994 World Cup, immerses himself in the club and town for what comes next. Tragedy and scandal expose the late author to the cynical side of Italian football, but miracles ensure his love for the game and the country survive. A gripping tale, brilliantly told. Andy HunterA Liverpool supporter’s account of following the team during the 1997-98 season feels like something that should appeal only to, well, a Liverpool supporter, but this is a book that transcends tribalism. Partly because Sampson’s stories, involving the likes of Jegsy Dodd and the Urban Dub Poet, are those of all match-going fans and partly because, as is the case with the author’s work in general, they are told with great wit and warmth. Sachin NakraniThe best books transport you to another place and time, making it, and its inhabitants, seem real. All Played Out does precisely that, taking readers back to Italia 90 with access all areas. It tells the inside story of that watershed tournament thanks to the sometimes startling, and always very human, insights accumulated during the nine months of unparalleled access Davies was granted by Bobby Robson and his England players. Spiced by three-dimensional portrayals of journalists, fans and hooligans, it could not be written today. Louise TaylorIn 1985, on the final day of the season, a 12-year-old Martin Fletcher went to watch Bradford City with his father, brother, grandfather and uncle but he would be the only one to leave alive as a fire engulfed the wooden main stand, killing 56 people. This is a stunningly brutal account of that horrific day and aftermath by a man still scarred and searching for answers. Suzanne WrackA book which begins as a stark social history of Northern Ireland during its most troubled sectarian times develops into a superb memoir. Ferris was a childhood superstar who left his native Lisburn and everything he knew to sign for Newcastle United. Ferris’s experiences, in football and an incredible life beyond, are blissfully easy to relate to. Triumph, tragedy and everything in between are beautifully encapsulated here. Ewan MurrayWhat better way to pass the time during the suspension of the Premier League than by catching up on all the top-flight title races that took place before English football got its glitzy makeover? There’s very many a yarn to be celebrated, and Scott Murray – also of this parish – proves the perfect guide, breezing through more than a 100 years of heritage with customary style, deep knowledge and an infectious appreciation for the characters who shaped the “epic saga” of English football pre-1992. Paul DoyleThere are other histories of football but none that tackle it so well from a socio-economic perspective, and few that have the same global vision. This is a remarkable work of synthesis. Goldblatt’s triumph is to take a wealth of theory and information from an extraordinary array of sources from across the world and construct from it a narrative that is both convincing and readable.

But they fell in love, he gave up smoking for her, and they now live together in the south of FranceIn 1983, Christine Harris and Robert Frati were both working for a technology company. “I was based in the UK and he was in France,” she explains. To prepare for a corporate takeover, they were put in the same classroom for a two-week training session. “I took an instant dislike to him,” says Christine. “He was a sales manager and I think he was trying to get his staff excited, but I thought he was an idiot.” While her first impressions were bad, his were non-existent. “I don’t remember her being there at all,” he admits.The following year, Christine was staying at a colleague’s house in London after a flat purchase she was attempting fell through. A few weeks later, several people from the company were invited to stay, ahead of a big trade conference. “I came down one morning and was horrified to find Robert there in his underwear. I had no idea what to do so I had to be polite,” she says.“They were very nice underpants,” he points out. The pair spent the next few days getting to know each other, as they travelled back and forth from the trade show. “We both liked to be on time, so we were the only ones up early,” says Robert.It wasn’t long before she realised she had been wrong about him. “He was funny and made me laugh. He was more intelligent than I had thought and had a serious side, too.” Robert says he found his partner vivacious and clever. “Love is a funny feeling. You either get it or you don’t and we just got it.”On the last night of the trade show they went for dinner with friends, where Christine told the group she would never date a smoker. “I knew he was serious about me when he threw his cigarettes and lighter over his shoulder,” she says. Despite being a heavy smoker at the time, he has never picked a cigarette up since.For the next two years, they had a long-distance relationship between London and Paris. “It was in the days where it cost about £600 for a return trip to France. Sometimes we’d use the ferry to save costs,” says Christine. Over time, they realised the lifestyle wasn’t sustainable and she made the decision to leave her job and move to rural France. “It was in the days where men made more money, so it made more financial sense.”The couple got married in their remote village in 1987. ”It was the first foreign wedding they had ever had and the mayor who was meant to marry us was terrified,” says Robert. “We had people from all over the world as our witnesses and I think he was afraid of saying the names wrong. On the day he pulled a sickie and sent his deputy.”After the wedding, the couple endured a disastrous honeymoon to Crete. “I was really ill and we had terrible storms,” says Christine. “I had a raging fever and couldn’t leave the bed because the floor flooded.” But they have laughed about it ever since, they say.While Robert worked full-time, Christine spent her time learning French. “We left the little village in 1988 and went to Lille before we settled in Lyon,” says Christine. The couple remained in the city until 10 years ago, when Robert retired. They now live in the south of France, where their daughter plans to have her wedding.Robert has had cancer twice since they married, and is now going through chemotherapy. “I just want to get rid of this bloody cancer and get back to doing the things we enjoy again,” he says.Christine says her husband “never gets angry” and they don’t argue. “I love that he’s able to differentiate between what’s really important and what isn’t.” Robert agrees: “Although we’ve faced health challenges, we’re also very lucky in many ways.”France is currently in lockdown. “We usually love going out for meals, so we are missing that,” says Christine. “But we are making the best of things right now by lighting candles and enjoying cosy nights in. We just love each other’s company.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00cb5ee0e006f3b82b073cb988c9cd40efa8ee2b/48_0_3405_2044/master/3405.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=392e5e997e8704f0234e45edc32c04f2","title":"sainsburys wont deliver shopping if youre not considered vulnerable coronavirus","story":"Readers find that despite illness and disabilities, getting a response during coronavirus crisis is difficultI received an NHS text telling me to stay home and to have no contact with other people for the next 12 weeks.

I also receive personal independence payments because I have to wear a rigid back brace due to 11 vertebral compression fractures. I live on my own in a rural location.I have had delivery passes for Sainsbury’s home delivery for the last six years but their website will not let me book a delivery as their system states that I am not a vulnerable customer. According to its website, my 85-year-old mother who lives on her own and has dementia is also not a vulnerable customer. When I ring the helpline it is either engaged or there is a message and then I get cut off.I really need help getting food delivered in the next 12 weeks and don’t seem to be able to even talk to any member of staff at Sainsbury’s. Please can someone help to get them to acknowledge my status?As a vulnerable woman aged 78 with multiple disabilities I have been trying for a week now to inform Sainsbury’s of my situation in order to get my regular online shopping given priority. The website is useless and the telephone help centre is permanently engaged.My disabilities include type 2 diabetes, osteoarthritis and asthma. I have no help whatsoever and have been online grocery shopping for some time now.On 17 March I started trying to inform them of my situation. At that stage each day I hung on for periods ranging from 30 minutes to an hour and three-quarters. Finally on the Saturday I spoke to a man who assured me a form to fill in would be online on the Monday. No such thing has appeared and telephone lines are now permanently engaged.With the latest government advice to stay at home and unable to contact Sainsbury’s, I am at my wits’ end. Please can you help? We know retailers are buckling under the strain but what has not helped has been little clarity about the definition of who is deemed to be vulnerable. The problem is that while you, AK, appear to be among the 1.5 million most vulnerable identified by the government, you still struggled to get your delivery. Amazingly, MR does not seem to qualify. In addition to correspondence via this column from other readers unable to get their deliveries, the ’s switchboard has been swamped with calls on the same problem.We contacted Sainsbury’s, which agreed to escalate both your cases. You have subsequently managed to book slots – and another for AK’s mother – with, we understand, all three deliveries successfully made.The retailer apologised to you both for the inconvenience caused by the long wait times and said: “We are doing our absolute best to offer online delivery slots to elderly and vulnerable customers. Elderly and vulnerable customers have priority over all slots. We have proactively contacted 270,000 customers who had already given us information that meant we could identify them as elderly or vulnerable. Our customer careline is working at full capacity to help other vulnerable customers and we are able to give an additional 8,000 customers a day access to delivery slots over the phone. We have already booked in slots for 115,000 elderly and vulnerable customers this week and this number is growing every day.“We will (shortly) receive the government database which tells us which people the government considers to be most vulnerable. Where these people are registered with us, we will start to write to them next week to offer them a delivery slot.”It later added: “MR and AK have both been added to our vulnerable customer list and received priority delivery slots.”Sainsbury’s is also prioritising elderly and vulnerable customers with its click-and-collect service, which is also busy.In response, AK told us: “Thank you so much for all your help, which has given me the best possible result and has made my birthday a much happier day today.” MR said: “Delivery arrived with very knowledgable driver. Sainsbury’s should be asking them for their opinions as they get to know their customers very well.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/df90591dd78ed866d4612a2f5178f006b155e340/0_152_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cceb4c3bc6ca79975c796eb3fcb40b1c","title":"stevie wonder where to start in his back catalogue","story":"In Listener’s Digest, our writers help you explore the work of great musicians. Today: the audaciously ambitious soulful pop pioneer Stevie Wonder• Read other pieces in the series The man born Stevland Morris began the 1960s an 11-year-old harmonica prodigy and exited them as one of Motown’s hottest artists, thanks to hits such as My Cherie Amour, I Was Made to Love Her and Uptight (Everything’s Alright). But as the next decade dawned, the contract Stevie Wonder had signed as a minor expired and, desperate not to lose his star, Motown boss Berry Gordy granted Wonder hitherto-unknown creative freedom from the label’s legendary “hit factory” production line.Wonder recast himself as an auteur with something powerful to say – and, thanks to a fruitful creative relationship with early synthesiser pioneers Malcolm Cecil and Robert Margouleff, a revolutionary way of delivering that message. Further breaking from Motown tradition, the newly liberated Wonder treated the album format as an art form in and of itself, rather than just bundling his latest hit single with lesser, filler tracks. Armed with a bank of still-futuristic Arp and Moog synthesisers, Wonder went on to deliver five solid-gold masterpieces across the decade. It’s tough to pick a favourite from the bunch, but Talking Book’s devotional fervour wins it by a nose.Talking Book mostly eschewed the political edge that would characterise its follow-up, Innervisions – love is its dominant theme. Where contemporary Marvin Gaye investigated love’s darker side, finding inspiration in its paranoid shadows, Wonder was an apostle of the light, proselytising for love as a sacred, ecstatic, rejuvenating force. And Talking Book’s master stroke is how it eulogised love without ever succumbing to schmaltz, drawing power and profundity from Wonder’s superlative lightness of touch (You Are the Sunshine of My Life, Tuesday Heartbreak) and otherworldly sounds – You and I (We Can Conquer the World), a sublime secular hymn, saw Wonder duetting with soaring, theremin-like synths.His other key collaborator on Talking Book was the inspiration for You and I, his wife, singer-songwriter Syreeta Wright. Though the couple orced during the album’s production, she wrote the lyrics for two of the album’s final three songs, a redemptive arc tracing a path from heartbreak and recrimination (Blame It on the Sun), through healing (the achingly happysad Lookin’ for Another Pure Love), to hope (the closing, gospel-esque I Believe (When I Fall in Love). She remained Wonder’s close confidante until her death in 2004 – he later said they “were better friends when we weren’t married than when we were” – and their enduring relationship seemed a testament to Wonder’s belief in the power of love.Talking Book’s biggest hit, meanwhile, ditched Wonder’s romantic theme. The sharp, cynical Superstition saw Stevie lay down one of the most instantly recognisable drum-licks in pop history, and realise all the funky potential within the clavinet on a track so blessed with groove it turned even the set of Sesame Street into a raucous dancefloor. Indeed, Talking Book was enough to suggest there wasn’t anything Stevie Wonder couldn’t do – and he would hold the world under that spell for the rest of the decade.Music of My Mind (1972)Wonder’s first post-emancipation release had its shaky moments – not least the misjudged Sweet Little Girl, where Stevie warns his obsession, “Don’t make me get mad and act like a nigga” – but Music of My Mind was a bold statement of intent. Juggling ambitious epics like Superwoman (Where Were You When I Needed You) and Love Having You Around with the deliriously pretty pop of Happier Than the Morning Sun and I Love Every Little Thing About You, the album sounded drunk on the possibilities of new technology, and revelled in the abundant talents of Wonder, who – aside from one guitar solo and one trombone part – sang and performed every note.More ambitious, perhaps, than Talking Book, you can hear Wonder’s confidence flexing throughout the many audacious strokes of Innervisions. He made the first of many successful experiments with Latin rhythms (Don’t You Worry ’Bout a Thing), proved himself a one-man funk colossus to rival Sly Stone on the synthesiser and clavinet-driven Too High and Higher Ground, and revealed himself an astute observer of human character on the closing He’s Misstra Know-It All. Best of all was Living for the City, tracing the journey of an unsuspecting country boy who falls foul of the racist system across a seven-minute track that played out like a movie.Songs in the Key of Life (1976)With his contract up for renegotiation again, Wonder briefly considered quitting music for charitable works in Africa before signing again with Motown for an unprecedented $37m. The label got its money’s worth with his next release, however: 105 minutes of music across four LP sides, plus a bonus EP. Its epic sprawl is part of Key of Life’s charm, switching between genius hit singles (the infectiously joyful Sir Duke and I Wish), blasts of deep fusion (Contusion), moments of disco-gospel ecstasy (As), visionary synthesiser symphonies (Village Ghetto Land) and effervescent, impossibly beautiful balladry (Knocks Me Off My Feet). Songs in the Key of Life is vast, it contains multitudes – and it maintains a standard most artists could only dream of.While Wonder’s 70s output was inspiring in its quality and abundance – also producing classic albums by Minnie Riperton and Wright, and giving songs to the Supremes, the Pointer Sisters and Chaka Khan – the next decade witnessed a precipitous descent into triteness, signalled by 1984 chart-topper I Just Called to Say I Love You. But this soundtrack to Spike Lee’s edgy romance Jungle Fever signalled a late-period rally, reuniting Wonder with Cecil and Margouleff. The elastic funk of the title track and the excellent Queen in the Black were Wonder playing the new jack swing generation at their own game, but Jungle Fever’s peaks were firmly in his own voice: the keening ache of I Go Sailing, the unabashedly emotive These Three Words, and the precious whimsy of If She Breaks Your Heart.The Wild Stevie Wonder, by Ben Fong-Torres An in-depth 1973 Rolling Stone magazine profile that finds Wonder reminiscing about his early days at Motown, talking on-the-road tensions with the Stones, and discussing his love for synthesiser music.Stevie Wonder: ‘I never thought of being blind and black as a disadvantage,’ by Paul Lester Wonder tries out his cockney accent on the ’s Paul Lester, revisits the 1973 car accident that almost ended his life, and muses, “I’m always optimistic – but the world isn’t.”Stevie Wonder producer Malcolm Cecil breaks down the making of Music of My MindWonder is rarely the most revealing interviewee. This engaging conversation with one half of the team that helped shape his classic period offers perhaps the clearest insight yet behind the scenes of his landmark LPs – and on working with Cecil’s legendary early synthesiser, Tonto (The Original New Timbral Orchestra).

Below are three examples, including a toughie which appeared in the 2020 UK puzzle championship last month. Pencil-and-paper puzzles like Double Choco are very absorbing hopefully they provide a stimulating and escapist activity during these days of quarantine.The rules of Double Choco are as follows.1.Divide the grid into blocks by drawing solid lines over the grid lines.2.Each block must contain a pair of areas of white cells and gray cells having the same form (size and shape). One area may be a rotated or mirrored image of the other.3.A number indicates the number of cells of that colour in the block (half the total number for the block). A block can contain any number of cells with numbers.The puzzles now follow. If you want to have them all on a single printable page, click here. Otherwise, you can solve them on screen with an app like Markup.Now for the tutorial puzzle (printed at the very top, and just below). My way in was to look at the 3 in the top left cell. This 3 tells you that there must be three white cells, and three grey cells, in that block. The only possible white cells are the three top ones in the leftmost column, since the white cells must form a contiguous area. The three grey cells must have the same shape as the white cells, in other words they must be in a line. There is only one possible position for a line of three grey cells that touches the white cells (and thus makes a single block.) I’ve marked it below.Likewise, the 3 in the top right corner means that the grey area must consist of three adjacent grey cells. There is only one possible position for those grey cells, and also only one possible position for three white cells that share the same shape (three in a row). I’ve marked that block too.The white area at the bottom left has two 3s in it. At first you might think they refer to two different blocks. They actually refer to the same block. (It is fine for the same block to have more than one cell with a number in it.) It has to be the same block, since the white area of this block has three cells in it, and there are only three possible cells, the ones I have shaded orange. The area of the block covered by grey cells must have the same shape, and thus must either be cells ABD, or cells BCD.Let’s assume it is BCD. Then where is the block that contains the remaining 3 on the white cell in the second bottom row? It cannot exist, since there are no three contiguous grey squares left on the board for that block. Hence The block with the three white squares on the bottom left contains ABD. The rest falls into place. Note that one of the blocks has no number-cells.Double Choco was invented by Japan’s legendary Nikoli magazine, which over the last 40 years has introduced many puzzles to a wide audience, most famously Sudoku and Kakuro.Last month, Double Choco was one of the featured problems at the UK Puzzle Association’s annual open tournament, which took place at a Croydon hotel, and consists of a sudoku competition and a general puzzle competition.The competitions are a bit like an exam: the contestants are presented with a series of papers, with each puzzle graded by difficulty. The hard Double Choco above was one of the hardest puzzles this year.This year’s results for the puzzle event were: 1st Neil Zussman, 2nd Vincent Bertrand, 3rd Tom Collyer.

The time when it mattered that much more, when the blade, now long dulled by experience, cut right through to the core. For me, that peak came at Bramall Lane on 15 May 2003.In truth I can’t recall much about events surrounding the game. Googling the date today reveals – unexpectedly – that it was a Thursday. So I must have got the train up from London where I was at university. My dad would’ve driven up from Derby with my brother, uncle and cousin, parking up near Heeley city farm in an awkward traffic-bothering style that had long been known as “the Manoeuvre”. At that time my uncle’s superstition was, I think, at the everybody-has-to-have-a-lucky-mint stage.And that season the mints had been working wonders. Neil Warnock’s cobbled-together Blades had reached the League Cup semi‑finals (losing against Liverpool over two legs), the FA Cup semi-finals (losing against Arsenal at Old Trafford) and finished (a pretty distant) third in the First Division behind a very useful Leicester and a cracking Portsmouth side.And it had all come from nowhere. Warnock, in his fourth season at Bramall Lane, had done a decent job of keeping the club competitive in the ision on a shoestring budget and had reforged a connection with the fans. This was a side of dogged old pros and free transfers buoyed by a pair of terrific youngsters (Phil Jagielka and Michael Tonge) and a midfielder having the season of his life. In Michael Brown’s 650-game career he scored 58 goals – 22 of them came in that campaign alone.The first semi-final leg, at the City Ground, had finished 1-1 – Forest’s David Johnson (another player on a never-to-be-repeated season-long scoring spree) opening the scoring, Brown equalising from the spot – so the advantage lay with Warnock’s side as they emerged with the packed Kop bathed in late‑spring evening sunshine.At first it all went horribly wrong. Thirty minutes in John Curtis’s miscued clearance fell straight to Johnson, who thundered the ball past Paddy Kenny. Thirteen minutes into the second half Andy Reid volleyed home to make it 2-0. Semi-final heartache was on the cards once more.But seconds later (Sky Sports was still showing replays of Reid’s goal) Des Walker tripped Carl Asaba on the edge of the box. Brown’s free-kick deflected past Darren Ward in the Forest goal: 2-1. Then came Steve Kabba. Kenny, genuinely an early, glitchy version of a sweeper-keeper, booted long Kabba flicked the bouncing ball up and crashed his volley home.Two-two. Extra time. Into the 112th minute. Kenny thumped the ball forward again. Paul Peschisolido chested down, 25 yards from goal. Inside. Outside. Inside? Again? A scuff. Perhaps the most beautiful scuff you’ll ever see. Ward going the wrong way. And then. Oh my god! Oh MY GOD! OH MY GOD!!!Peschisolido’s celebration has gone down in Blades folklore but despite it taking place right in front of me in the John Street Stand I can’t say I saw any of it. As the ball trundled over the line, the terraces exploded. The three of us (my dad was on the Kop my uncle, it transpired later, had abandoned his seat at the end of our row and was sprinting gleefully along the concourse) formed a tiny part of a huge broiling, cavorting mass of joy.There was still time for Walker to score an own goal and our Robert Page to set nerves fluttering with one of his own but the team that had fallen just short against Liverpool, that had been denied by David Seaman’s wonder-save at Old Trafford, this time wouldn’t be denied. It ended 4-3. It was the best I ever felt in a football ground. I’m pretty certain it always will be.Let’s not mention the final."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c1062ef8e58c4c725b26463535d505cc85f1a631/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7425560f7258431802d505f77446fc91","title":"at least 20 uk phone masts vandalised over false 5g coronavirus claims","story":"Industry body assures people in open letter there is no link between 5G and pandemicAt least 20 mobile phone masts across the UK are believed to have been torched or otherwise vandalised since Thursday, according to government and industry sources who are increasingly concerned about the impact of baseless theories linking coronavirus to 5G networks.There have been noticeable clusters of attacks on masts around Liverpool and the West Midlands. Owing to the slow rollout of 5G in the UK, many of the masts that have been vandalised did not contain the technology and the attacks merely damaged 3G and 4G equipment.There is hope that the rate of attacks may now be slowing. Network operators are particularly concerned about the safety of their staff, as members of the public have confronted telecoms engineers maintaining critical infrastructure, sometimes filming the encounters to share on social media. Mobile operators and home broadband providers estimate there have been at least 30 such incidents in the last week.Engineers for O2 have been issued with signs to display in their vans while working. The signs, which read “Key worker, keeping your network running”, are intended to spread the message that communications workers are playing a crucial role during the current crisis.Social networks will meet the government in the coming days to explain what they can do to stop the spread of baseless claims about 5G, although there is a limited amount that can be done to stop videos and messages spreading on messaging services such as WhatsApp.Despite repeated assurances from international radiation watchdogs that 5G is safe, baseless theories about its purported risks have long bubbled away at the fringes of the internet – in common with previous generations of the telecoms technology. However, the rapid explosion over the last week of claims linking the new telephone standard to the pandemic – fanned by some celebrities and influencers – has caught the industry and the government off guard.While many long-running Facebook groups have opposed the rollout of 5G technology, in the last week the social network has had to delete multiple pages encouraging vandalism of the phone network. The number of attacks rose rapidly following a suspected arson attack on a mast in Birmingham on Thursday night. Vodafone confirmed that six sites were targeted over the weekend, and other networks suggested they had seen similar numbers.MobileUK, the industry group that unites the UK’s four main mobile networks, published an open letter to customers asking for help to stop the vandalism.“We have experienced cases of vandals setting fire to mobile masts, disrupting critical infrastructure and spreading false information suggesting a connection between 5G and the Covid-19 pandemic,” the open letter says. “There is no scientific evidence of any link between 5G and coronavirus. Fact.“Please help us to make this stop. If you witness abuse of our key workers please report it. If you see misinformation, please call it out. Your help will make a real difference.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d7356c5bc9a851f64c8329b28561c7093dfb20c/294_203_1858_1115/master/1858.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=84978fda69dbc80bdf07c63304392f4a","title":"the psychology of firsts and why they stick in our memories","story":"Anecdotally, we all know that first-time experiences hold a unique and  formative power over us. But why? Fiona Cowood investigates ...First love, first kiss, first job, first car … it’s easy to transport yourself back to those heady experiences, even though decades may have passed since they happened. Contrast that with a simple question about what you did last Wednesday … can you honestly remember?Meik Wiking runs the world’s only Happiness Research Institute in Denmark, and in his latest book, the Art of Making Memories, explores the hold that first experiences have over us.“First experiences stick better to our memories,” he says. “Several studies show that we are better at remembering the novel and the new, the extraordinary days when we did something different.” This helps to explain why, as we get older, we might have dozens of treasured memories from our youth while our present flashes by with perhaps only a house move and a holiday memory-banked for safekeeping. Wiking refers to this phenomenon as the “reminiscence bump”, AKA “the good old days” – that period from 15-30 that is the source of so many of the stories we tell about ourselves.“Firsts in my 40s are rarer than when I was 15,” says Wiking, “but that’s why I seek them out now. First experiences are able to stretch the flow of time – they can help stop the feeling that the years are going by quicker and quicker.”“When we’re out of our comfort zone, we make sure we record every aspect of the experience in case we need to retrieve the memory later on,” he says. “For example, we might not know if the situation is safe or dangerous so we open up our senses to pick up all the signs and signals.”First experiences also serve as building blocks, helping us to construct a solid sense of who we are in the world. Any parent will know how much children love being told the stories of their first steps, or their first trip to the swimming pool. Those moments are insights into identity-building, as kids make sense of how they got to where they are today. As we get older, these “firsts” become bookmarks that distinguish between chapters – who you were before a major breakup, versus who you became, for example.“Each of us has an ancient and universal human need to be seen and to be remembered,” says Wiking, “and firsts, and changes of scene, play an important role in organising autobiographical memory.”To avoid the mid-years of your life becoming a depressing blur of chores, childcare and days spent at the same desk, Wiking advocates opening yourself up to new experiences to ensure a steady imprint of new, vivid memories. Memorable grownup firsts can come in all shapes and sizes – from big, bucket-list adventures in far-flung places to practical, domestic endeavours, like hosting your first Christmas or driving your first electric car.And making these little adjustments not only enriches your own life but will positively affect others too, says Wiking. “One of my biggest ‘a-ha’ moments in writing the book was going from a perception that memory is something random that we don’t control to realising that my memory – and that of my friends and family – is actually something I can influence. Realising I can influence what my friends remember in 10 years’ time is very empowering. It makes you want to do new things – and share those experiences with others.”You’ll always remember your first EVUnlock the thrill of a game-changing first for yourself with the New Renault ZOE – the ideal first electric car.

Motoring journalist Maria McCarthy explains why they’re more than just a passing trendThere’s no doubt that this acceleration is in part being driven by increased awareness and fears about the climate crisis. But while we know that EVs are greener than traditional internal combustion engine cars, making the transition from the familiarity of fossil fuel to embracing electric can feel daunting, no matter how urgently you feel the climate emergency. Will vast amounts of number-crunching and spreadsheets be required to work out if an electric car will fit your lifestyle? Might you have to draw on vague memories of what Kws are from long-ago physics lessons? Thankfully, that won’t be necessary.“People often worry that deciding to move over to an electric car will be a chore and involve a lot of research,” says Emily Rice, product manager at Renault Electric Vehicles. “But once they get started, they discover there’s lots of independent, accessible information out there, and the process can be very straightforward.”When electric cars first came on to the market, there was a lot of hand-wringing about “range anxiety” – the fear of the battery running out before you can get to a charging point. But it turns out that unless you embark on epic road trips on a regular basis, range anxiety isn’t a cause for concern. “The New Renault ZOE has a range of up to 245 miles according to WLTP testing*,” explains Rice. “And that’s plenty for most of us.”According to the Department of Transport, the average annual mileage for private cars in 2018 was 7,400 – this works out at just over 20 miles a day, so the New Renault ZOE will easily meet most people’s day-to-day needs.And when you do need to charge your battery, it’s as easy as charging your smartphone. Most electric car drivers charge at home – something made even easier by Renault, which provides a free home charge point for new retail customers purchasing a New Renault ZOE**. Once you set off with a full battery, you rarely need to top up on regular journeys. And if you do run out of juice on the go, there’s no need to panic – the UK now has more EV charging points than petrol stations (almost 10,000 locations now offer public charging points, according to Zap-Map).And best of all, the mileage costs are significantly cheaper. Costs will vary depending on your electricity tariff but, according to the Energy Saving Trust, charging an electric vehicle at home will cost on average 4-6p per mile, and 8-10p if using a public charging point. This compares with 13-16p for a petrol or diesel car.But choosing a car isn’t just about drawing up budgets – it’s about how it feels. And if you’ve never driven an electric car before then it’s time to get behind the wheel. “I find electric cars provide a versatile, relaxing drive,” says Thomas Clifton, electrification and new mobility manager at Renault. “As there’s no gear changes, they’re ideal for navigating city traffic. Then out of town, they handle just as well as a petrol or diesel car on motorways and rural roads. Forget the myth that electric cars are like driving a milk float – they give a smooth, powerful drive with great acceleration.”“If you’re curious about electric cars, then do take one for a test drive,” suggests Rice. “And don’t just try it out in town – take the New Renault ZOE out on a motorway or dual carriageway and let it show you what it can do. I would recommend asking to borrow it over night if you can and see how easily it could fit into your lifestyle.”It’s easy to put off making the switch to electric car ownership until some vague, undefined point in the future – but the truth is, there’s really no need to. If you have any reservations about the costs, charging options or drive, a little research and a test drive will quickly allay your fears. Once motorists take the plunge, they quickly become “electrical evangelists” with zero interest revisiting the dark days of internal combustion engine ownership. The only question is: when will you join them and start reaping the benefits of greener motoring?Curious to learn more about EVs?

Forecasts suggest a medium-term crossover point, probably towards the end of this decade, where the car industry is making more EVs than internal combustion engine (ICE) cars. Against that, there still exists a great deal of scepticism in the minds of consumers.“An EV wouldn’t work for me because …” is a familiar conversation starter. It’s true, there are some people for whom an electric car is simply a non-starter – but that number is a vanishingly small percentage of the population. For most, an EV is going to be a money saver that makes no obvious impact on lifestyle.Emily Rice, Renault UK’s product manager for electric cars, answers three readers’ questions.I live in a terraced house and park in the street, so I’m unable to have a home charging point. What are my charging options? Elaine Hills, BrightonAlthough it’s true that many current EV owners like to charge their cars at home using a dedicated wall-mounted charger in their driveway or garage, the good news is it’s far from the only option.The charging infrastructure to support EVs is constantly growing and evolving. For instance, it was reported in May last year that 1,076 new residential EV charging points had been installed in London as part of the Go Ultra Low City Scheme (GULCS), and this figure continues to increase. Virgin Media recently began a pilot project to convert its broadband cabinets into charging points, with a view to eventually providing 40,000 EV charging points across the UK. Elsewhere, there are initiatives such as the MK Promise, through which Milton Keynes council offers to install, within a short walk, an overnight charging point for all new EV owners lacking access to private parking.Access to a public residential charger is, however, still rare, and the much more common practice is to charge at the other end of a regular journey. “If you’d like to buy an EV, but don’t have the ability to charge it at home, check whether your workplace has charging facilities,” says Rice. “It’s common to simply not notice charging infrastructure if you don’t own an EV – but once you start thinking about switching, you really start to notice how many charging points are around you.”It’s worth noting that the notional “full charge” is an ICE hangover, driving until the warning light comes on and then filling the tank. Getting a full charge in Sainsbury’s or Starbucks may take a few hours – but with EVs such as the New Renault ZOE having a driving range of 245 miles*, it is unlikely you will need to find somewhere to charge every day, so owners aren’t arriving with the (usually metaphorical) needle in the red.If you charge an EV and then don’t use it, have you wasted your electricity? Jonathan Bailey, SheffieldThe short answer is: no. Or rather, not really. “The thing people tend to ask about is leaving their car when they go on holiday,” says Rice. “If you leave your car at the airport for a couple of weeks, you’re not going to notice a discharge. There’s lots of inbuilt technology in a Renault ZOE designed to ensure the batteries are as efficient as possible. Even if you leave your EV sitting around for a few months, it’s not going to be an issue for the traction battery.”The concern allied to this is the idea that battery performance will be less impressive as the vehicle gets older. While battery capacity can drop as the vehicle gets older – it won’t be to the extent it did a decade ago when the technology was in its infancy.“I think a lot of people worry that the battery in an EV is like the one in their phone, and they’re going to see the performance decline after a couple of years – but it really isn’t like that,” says Rice. “We all know that a phone reaches a point where you’re having to charge it a couple of times a day – but the technology in the lithium-ion battery of the car is far superior to that. If you’re driving it in the same way as a petrol or diesel car, you’re not going to experience any problems with an EV. We know it’s an area of concern, though, which is why Renault gives its EV batteries an eight-year or 100,000-mile warranty**. Hopefully that inspires confidence in the technology.”Is it more difficult to get a problem with an EV car resolved because there are fewer expert mechanics? Edward Jones, NorthamptonshireThe downside is that most of these technicians are employed by mainstream dealerships, with relatively little EV expertise in backstreet garages. EVs are, however, selling in ever-larger numbers, and mechanics are not immune to market forces. More technicians will train on EVs because, slowly but surely, that’s where the market is heading.Curious to learn more about EVs?

The aim was to take the spy genre and make it sexy with a young and largely unknown cast, a set of slick action stories filled with double crosses and betrayal and a sense that these weren’t pen-pushers but people genuinely trying to save the world.If that sounds slightly ludicrous then in truth the great appeal of Spooks was the way in which it always walked a fine line between the sublime and the ridiculous. From the knowing tagline – “MI5 – Not 9 -5” – to the glossy action scenes and hot young cast, Spooks could be seen as BBC One serving a marker to its audience and the competition. Forget worthy, important drama, this was a naked attempt to make a slick American-style TV series for British eyes.It could have been a disaster but, instead, it would go on to be one of the BBC’s biggest hits, running for 10 series and being nominated for multiple Baftas. That it did so was largely down to three things: the sharply written scripts, which gave real depth to the action set-pieces, a willingness to take increasingly bold risks with the plotting and some near-perfect casting.Looked at today, the original cast reads like a who’s who of British talent. Alongside Macfadyen’s suave yet tormented Quinn, the first series included roles for Keeley Hawes (junior officer Zoe Reynolds), David Oyelowo (junior case officer Danny Hunter), Lisa Faulkner (admin support officer Helen Flynn), Jenny Agutter as senior case officer Tessa Phillips and the great Peter Firth bringing a wonderful world-weariness to the role of counter-terrorism head Harry Pearce. The first series would also feature appearances from Hugh Laurie, Tim Pigott-Smith and Anthony Head, while the second series saw the arrival of Nicola Walker as Senior Intelligence Analyst (and fan favourite) Ruth Evershed.The plotting, too, was ambitious, covering everything from security in a post 911 world (and the fact that old enemies such as Northern Irish terrorist splinter groups didn’t simply disappear in the wake of the attack on the twin towers) to the pragmatic trade-offs committed by governments in the name of diplomacy.Most of all, though, Spooks was adept at balancing the soapy with the spectacular, as keen as peeking into the private lives of its various operatives as it was in dealing with their dangerous day jobs.It is that ability to balance the political with the personal that made it such a superior slice of escapism and which is why I hope you’ll join me at 7pm tomorrow to discuss series one, episode one.See you all there (just remember the first rule of Spooks club is that we never mention the film) …• Join Sarah Hughes on Tuesday at 7pm to watch the first episode"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d3e3e0d2b01e4c6f7ac8b0d8edf19d251616aeae/0_125_3736_2242/master/3736..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d7c90d882d9a4a2160874b44d5c3d816","title":"coronavirus testing kits could be unreliable uk scientists say","story":"Concern continues over whether government’s virus pledges stand up to scrutinyThe huge stock of 17.5m antibody home testing kits ordered by the government after Boris Johnson said they could be a “game changer” could in fact be unreliable, scientists have said, saying that they may fail to detect up to half of coronavirus cases.After the prospect of the pregnancy test-style kits was first raised, it was suggested the tests would be made available “within days” on Amazon and via Boots, to allow people who have had the virus to return to the workplace confident in the knowledge that they are safe.But in recent days, ministers have appeared to play down the likelihood of the tests being universally effective, with the health secretary, Matt Hancock, saying on Sunday that the tests were not yet “good enough”.The warnings over the limit to the value of the tests came as another 621 deaths were announced, a drop on the previous day’s record total of 708.Meanwhile on Sunday:• Hancock criticised the “unbelievable” behaviour of people packing into parks at the weekend and said rules on exercise could change before clarifying that the government was “not planning any changes imminently”.• Scotland’s chief medical officer, Catherine Calderwood, apologised after it emerged that she went to her second home during the lockdown and withdrew from being the public face of the government’s information campaign north of the border.• Italy recorded its lowest number of cases in two weeks, with the total number of people in hospital with the virus falling for the first time since the beginning of the crisis.• Sweden prepared legislation to allow it to take “extraordinary steps” to tackle the crisis, as concerns continued that its unusual “slow spread” strategy was not working.• A nurse and a midwife who died last week in the UK were named, while the Marquess of Bath, the owner of Longleat safari park, was also announced to have died.The scepticism over the value of the tests comes at a time of ongoing concern over whether the details of UK government pledges on coronavirus stand up to scrutiny. Last week ministers were widely criticised for fluctuating claims over the total number of tests that could be conducted each day, with Boris Johnson’s initial claim that 250,000 was possible superseded by Hancock’s promise to scale up to 100,000 a day by the end of April.On Sunday, Hancock appeared to contradict himself over the production of the ventilators crucial to treatment of the most severe coronavirus cases, telling the BBC that there “should be another 1,500” in a week’s time before telling the Downing Street briefing “we haven’t got an exact figure”.He had announced the purchase of 3.5m antibody test kits on 24 March but a week later it emerged that they had not been bought, but rather had “contracts agreed subject to testing”.The big range in immune response seen across the population also raises the troubling prospect that those who have had mild symptoms may not have long-term immunity against Covid-19.Prof Marion Koopmans, head of virology at the Erasmus University Medical Centre in Rotterdam, whose lab is assessing home testing kits in the Netherlands, said: “So far, I’m not aware of any home tests that have passed our quality mark. Based on what I’ve seen so far I’d be hesitant to give you an immunity passport based on a rapid test result.”A senior UK scientist who is working on lab-based antibody testing for Covid-19, said that given the current state of knowledge he was “amazed the government had sufficient confidence” to go ahead with the purchase of millions of tests. “A lot of us did a double-take,” he said.Another UK scientist said that none of the home test kits currently under evaluation in the UK were performing well enough, but did not give specific performance figures.Last month, Boris Johnson described the kits, which take as little as 20 minutes to use, as a potential “game changer” and their use is outlined in the government’s five pillar testing strategy. However, this weekend Hancock played down expectations, telling BBC One’s The Andrew Marr Show that there were no immediate plans to roll out antibody testing kits. “We’re getting the test results through every day, I was looking at some last night,” he said. “But we still don’t have any that are good enough.”Emerging evidence suggests that there is a wide range of antibody responses to coronavirus across the population, which may make the development of a simple, reliable home test that will work for everyone a considerable challenge. Dr David Ho, a leading infectious disease specialist at Columbia University in New York, said that, based on patient samples analysed by his team, those with severe illness tend to develop a faster and stronger antibody response. In people with milder symptoms, the presence of antibodies in the blood tends to ramp up more slowly, meaning that tests need to performed later.A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “Antibody tests offer the hope that people who think they have had the disease will know they are immune and get back to life as normal. We are currently working with several companies who are offering these tests and are evaluating their effectiveness."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8cf207a66d805a23fd678e5a97baaa1985e56661/0_331_3638_2183/master/3638..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0781267042441a1ddeaa8a820fba746f","title":"irish taoiseach leo varadkar to work a day a week as a doctor","story":"Fine Gael leader was a junior doctor in Dublin and qualified as a GP in 2010Leo Varadkar is to work one day a week as a doctor to help combat the coronavirus pandemic after reactivating his medical credentials.Ireland’s taoiseach has offered his services to the Health Service Executive (HSE) in areas that are within his competence, a spokesperson for his office said on Sunday.“Dr Varadkar rejoined the medical register last month,” a spokesperson told the . “He has offered his services to the HSE for one session a week in areas that are within his scope of practice.“Many of his family and friends are working in the health service. He wanted to help out even in a small way.’Varadkar, 41, worked as a junior doctor in Dublin and qualified as a GP in 2010 before quitting medicine to become a full-time politician, and later becoming premier.Last month the HSE appealed to all healthcare professionals who were not already working in the public health service to register to be “on call for Ireland”. Thousands of nurses, doctors, medical students and others have responded, some coming out of retirement, others flying back from abroad.The , which first reported the story, said the taoiseach was understood to be doing phone assessments, in keeping with the protocol to advise people who could be infected over the phone rather than in person.Varadkar’s father Ashok, an Indian immigrant, was a GP and his mother Miriam was a nurse. His partner Matthew Barrett is a cardiologist.He has won plaudits from across the political spectrum for his handling of the coronavirus crisis. Ireland adopted early restrictions and appears to have avoided an unmitigated pandemic, though cases are expected to surge this week.Varadkar succeeded Enda Kenny in 2017 as leader of Fine Gael, a centrist party, and as taoiseach. He earned praise for his handling of the economy and Brexit talks but in a general election in February voters punished the party for failures in housing and healthcare.Varadkar was expected to run a caretaker administration before leading Fine Gael into opposition. However Sinn Féin, which won more votes than any other party, has not formed a governing coalition. Fine Gael and another centrist party, Fianna Fáil, are in talks to form a historic coalition that would see Varadkar rotate the position of taoiseach with the Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17449dd9c68c6dac3909a57a4146c574405b6be5/0_200_2290_1374/master/2290..jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=f02f6cded9a3e5d7cc0295398d03f163","title":"calls to seal off ultra orthodox areas adds tension to israels virus response","story":"Rules enforcement highlights problem of getting message across to minority communityIt wasn’t a typical police operation. Two Israeli officers were to go undercover, although not posing as drug dealers or arms traffickers. For this particular assignment, they were to disguise themselves as ultra-Orthodox Jews.Their mission on Friday was to bust an illegal gathering in a synagogue. People were praying together, a practice that is now against the law in the era of the coronavirus. Once the officers got inside to confirm the crowd, more units barged in and dispersed people.Forces left the area, according to police, but: “An hour later, it was reported that people had returned again.” At that point, officers handed out fines amounting to nearly £4,000.The operation in the county’s north was one small part of a sometimes fruitless nationwide effort to impose Covid-19 restrictions on a deeply religious and often cut-off community that has been slow, or even opposed, to change their way of life.In the most extreme case, an entire city, Bnei Brak, has been surrounded with barricades. Israel’s cabinet declared the city a “restricted zone” last week, sending in 1,000 police officers who blocked residents from leaving except under special circumstances. The army has also be deployed to deliver food to the elderly.Many Israeli ultra-Orthodox live in poor, often congested areas with large families where infections can spread rapidly. Some religious leaders have refused to order their people to stay inside long after the rest of the country was locking down.Chaim Kanievsky, an influential rabbi, had initially refused to close packed synagogues and religious seminaries, where hundreds of boys and men gather daily. “The Torah protects and saves,” the 92-year-old said. Only in late March did the rabbi relent, calling for lone prayer.There have also been several anecdotal reports that ultra-Orthodox communities in other countries, including the UK, are suffering an above-average infection rate.In Israel, the outbreaks have deepened entrenched grievances between secular and religious populations that have festered since the state’s founding.Ultra-Orthodox Israelis, known in Hebrew as Haredim, or “God-fearers”, occupy a unique role, with laws allowing them to avoid military draft and live off stipends while they study religion, leading to secular resentment.Many abhor Israel’s interference in their traditions. Some are vehemently anti-Zionist, rejecting the country whose Jewish majority is mostly secular, which has frustrated government coronavirus efforts when public trust and obedience are vital.Attempts by police to enforce quarantine restrictions in religious neighbourhoods of Jerusalem have led to sometimes violent standoffs. Paramedics have been hit with rocks.“When a population that regards its religious leaders as infallible are told that the Torah will protect them and that the secular law enforcement agencies are Nazis and anti-Semites, there is no motivation to comply with orders,” wrote Jessica Apple in the progressive local Haaretz newspaper her article also called for ultra-Orthodox jews to wear face masks.Now the cabinet is discussing using the Bnei Brak lockdown as a model for other outbreaks, and local media have cited an unnamed health official as saying more ultra-Orthodox areas could also be sealed off.Yehuda Meshi-Zahav, an ultra-Orthodox Jerusalemite who used to take part in anti-government demonstrations, said some rabbis took a “long time to internalise the severity of the situation … and they truly believe that studying Torah is more important than anything else.”However, he said the government was also slow to communicate with more radical parts of the community, many of whom have no internet, television, radio, smartphones or even newspapers and usually get news from posters stuck to noticeboards.Meshi-Zahav, who runs a volunteer emergency medicine group that has been helping coordinate the Covid-19 response, has written posters on the rules. Still, he added: “It is not our job, it should be the Ministry of Health’s responsibility.”He said he was concerned about growing anger. “In normal times, there are discussions on this, but now the seculars are saying, ‘you are infecting us’. This is terrible, there is a lot of antisemitism around the world, and now the seculars are doing this?”“There are things they say that are correct, but to accuse a whole community? To generalise? Some people are using the situation to attack the Haredim.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7200859fb487792e1336e456cb1a1b0c126614c/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c3503426875ecac8614c1ddb0a46742","title":"coronavirus at a glance april 6","story":"A summary of the biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreakKey developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:With deaths in Spain declining for the fourth consecutive day, Italy reporting its lowest death toll in two weeks and France recording a decline in new hospital admissions, there is tentative hope across Europe that lockdowns are starting to show results.Austria became the first European country to announce plans to lift its lockdown, with some shops being reopened from next week, and Spain said it would start widespread testing as a first step towards slowly easing restrictions.The communities secretary Robert Jenrick has not ruled out the prime minister spending more nights in hospital but said he expects him to return to Number 10 “shortly”. Jenrick said he had heard Johnson is “doing well” and hopes he will be back in Downing Street soon. Asked if the PM will spend more nights in hospital, Jenrick said: “He will obviously take the advice of doctors and nurses who are doing those tests and act accordingly.” He insisted Johnson remains in day-to-day charge of the government.Meanwhile, Japan’s government is poised to declare a state of emergency on Tuesday after a surge in coronavirus cases in Tokyo. The prime minister, Shinzo Abe, is also expected to announce an “unprecedented” 108 trillion yen ($989bn) package in response to the “biggest crisis” the global economy has faced since the second world war, a draft document has revealed.In airline news, British Airways announced it would be suspending direct flights between Japan and the UK, and American Airlines Group Inc said late Sunday it would suspend more flights in and out of New York City’s three main airports for about a month.Indonesia recorded its biggest daily jump in cases, with 218 confirmed on Monday, and the Philippines recorded 414 new infections.

Hungary, like almost every other country in Europe, has banned large gatherings of people because of the coronavirus crisis, making live concerts impossible.Many orchestras and opera houses have instead taken to streaming archive performances online, but the MAV orchestra has drawn on its unique, itinerant history to take things a step further.Every day, musicians from the orchestra drive two cars mounted with loudspeakers around Budapest and its surroundings, belting out recordings of past performances. It is currently forbidden to leave the house except for essential activities in Hungary, but the idea is that people should open up their windows or step on to their balconies and enjoy an uplifting blast of classical music.“It seems like we managed to make many generations very happy with playing music, even in these weird, stressful times,” said Kovács, who said that while pensioners formed the majority of the audience, in recent days young people too had been enjoying the music.“People came out to the streets, keeping the proper distance between each other, and started to clap and give us a thumbs up. Some of them were even dancing,” he said.The reaction over the past week has been almost universally positive, said Kálmán Kovács, a trumpeter in the orchestra who has been driving one of the cars. An elderly woman conducted from her balcony, a trio of young foreigners danced “as though they were in a nightclub” to a Strauss waltz, and a truck driver wound down his window and asked for the volume to be increased as cyclists stopped to listen.There was only one negative reaction, a woman who raced angrily on to the street to shout that her child was sleeping and they should turn the music off immediately. The music selection changes daily, but is always drawn from recordings of the orchestra and there is an emphasis on light and uplifting music. “We’re not going to be playing the Shostakovich Leningrad symphony,” joked György Lendvai, the orchestra’s managing director. If people want to request an appearance near their homes, they can message the orchestra’s Facebook account with their address.Lendvai said the idea came from the orchestra’s unique history as the house ensemble of MAV, the Hungarian railway network. It was set up at the end of the second world war by the music-loving head of the state railway concern, who felt music was essential to lift the people’s spirits in the ruins of postwar Hungary.It was initially a brass and wind ensemble, and later it became a full orchestra. With communist rule firmly entrenched, it became an arm of the Soviet ideal of bringing high culture to the masses, and was the orchestra for the so-called “rolling opera” which took operatic performances to the provinces. For the first decade, the orchestra performed in navy-blue railway uniforms.The railway provided the orchestra with three coaches: one for male musicians, one for female musicians and one for the instruments and props. Most weeks for several decades, the orchestra would leave Budapest for the provinces and perform symphonic concerts and operas in small towns or sometimes even in factories, before returning to sleep in the railway carriages and then moving on to the next destination. On Fridays, the orchestra would be back in Budapest and perform in the opulent surroundings of the city’s Liszt Academy.“Even now, when I’m in the smallest village in the countryside and say I work for the MAV orchestra, there will always be someone elderly who says: ‘Oh, that orchestra was the first time I ever heard classical music or the opera,’” said Lendvai.After the fall of communism, the orchestra began to travel more abroad, but it is still partially funded by Hungarian railways, and it was this history that formed the basis for the current idea of bringing music to residents on lockdown.“Today we have a crisis and I think people need to be cheered up and given a little hope,” said Lendvai. “But right now we cannot do it with an orchestra. So we thought that we could bring music by car to all the people in quarantine in their home.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e50383f78884279bf30f0af9219e01355610f62a/0_182_3790_2274/master/3790..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=325f3cd42cb05af27e3e965d588045a0","title":"frenchman gets lost in pyrenees on cross border trek for cigarettes","story":"Frenchman found ‘exhausted and shivering’ after getting lost in PyrénéesA Frenchman caused a major alert this weekend after setting off across the Pyrénées to buy cheap cigarettes in Spain.The unnamed man had first left his home in Perpignan in southern France intending to drive to La Jonquera across the border, but was stopped by police at a checkpoint and turned back.Instead, he decided to walk across the mountains that separate the two countries, only to fall into a stream, then into some brambles before getting lost and deciding to call the emergency services.Mountain rescue teams sent up a helicopter and he was found “exhausted, shivering with cold and lost” above the border village of Le Perthus, according to rescuers.“The young man left Perpignan by car but was turned back at the border posts between France and Spain as he tried to get to La Jonquera.

While public servants across the UK are working night and day – literally putting their lives on the line for the country – some within government are still putting self-preservation first. It is not only cowardly and shameful, it’s also destructive.”A Times article on Saturday quoted an ally of Johnson saying that Sedwill’s performance was under scrutiny for failing to control government departments. “He’s more present now but there is a bit of a mystery about where he was in the early days of all this,” the source was quoted as saying.The same article claimed that ministers were blaming PHE officials for an inflexible attitude and insensitivity to public pressure for answers. “What this has exposed is these people’s utter lack of accountability,” a senior official told the newspaper. “It’s not just PHE, it’s a whole world of these bodies that bumble along, occasionally banning Coco Pops or something but for the most part entirely out of sight.”In a following article, a “senior figure” told the Sunday Times that NHS England was being blamed by ministers for failing to get a grip on PPE supply.Civil servants have also been angered this weekend by claims that the prime minister was “extremely unlikely” to sack the home secretary, Priti Patel, even if she is found to have bullied civil servants across three separate government departments.The Cabinet Office investigation was launched last month after claims from civil servants and the resignation of Sir Philip Rutnam, the home office’s most senior official.Sir Alex Allen, the prime minister’s independent adviser on ministers’ interests, is expected to pass on the findings within days.He will decide whether Patel broke rules. However, the final say rests with Johnson, who can overrule Sir Allen.Rutnam, who resigned after anonymous briefings against him in the media, is suing the government for constructive dismissal after accusing Patel of “swearing and belittling people”.As well as witnessing Patel’s alleged bullying behaviour, Rutnam claimed he was briefed against across the media by sources said to be from either No 10 or friends or allies of Patel. He was accused of being unable to do his job, of being undeserving of his pension, and was compared to the Winnie the Pooh character Eeyore.Patel has denied the claims.One Whitehall source said: “If Patel is cleared without a thorough inquiry into the many claims of bullying against Patel, it will be seen as a whitewash and will heighten mistrust across government.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3188c09feb5f15567d3bc536941cfc3ecb124cad/0_134_2216_1331/master/2216..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=60bc5ff03f2ec8df08461f1a244e32a1","title":"russia defies calls to halt victory day parade rehearsals","story":"Defence ministry presses on with plans for 9 May event with 15,000 troops, despite coronavirus pandemicRussia is holding rehearsals for its Victory Day parade, scheduled for 9 May despite the coronavirus crisis, as the Kremlin resists cancelling a patriotic holiday with major political significance.The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, is supposed to host France’s Emmanuel Macron and other world leaders at a military parade to mark the 75th anniversary of the end of the second world war. The event is a significant historical landmark for Russia and a coveted photo opportunity to claim Putin’s re-emergence from political isolation in the west.But with 12 million Muscovites confined to their apartments and a global pandemic ushering in a period of self-isolation, preparations for the parade have raised concerns in Russia.A leaked video has shown up to 15,000 soldiers lined up on a parade grounds outside Moscow, where Russia’s defence ministry has confirmed that it is holding rehearsals for the event, most recently on 1 April.“How many people are there, 15,000? Fuck, and they’ve said no more than 50 are supposed to gather in one place. Not one fucking mask,” said one voice on the video, which was shot anonymously.Refurbished T-34 tanks have also been filmed performing parade manoeuvres at the grounds in Alabino, where authorities say they have built a to-scale model of Red Square.Russia’s general prosecutor has censured a news website for writing that the parade may be cancelled in one Russian region due to the coronavirus, sayingits article violated regulations on fake news.“May 9th is a sacred date for millions upon millions in Russia and CIS countries,” a foreign ministry account wrote on Twitter. “The Victory Day parade is scheduled (sanitary measures taken) and will march on Red Square.”The opposition leader Alexei Navalny blasted what he called the “idiocy” of the defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, for going forward with the rehearsals, calling the crowds of soldiers a potential “breeding ground for the coronavirus”.Russia’s defence ministry has said that it is taking precautionary measures to ensure the soldiers’ safety, including regular temperature checks. “All the members of the rehearsals are burning with desire to participate in this historic event and are training their hearts out,” said Igor Konashenkov, a spokesman for the ministry.The virus has wreaked havoc on an important political season in Russia. Putin has already delayed a symbolic public vote on constitutional amendments that would allow him to run for another two terms as president, potentially ruling until 2036. A major business forum in St Petersburg scheduled for June has also been cancelled.Victory Day is the most important public event remaining in Russia’s calendar. Western leaders have snubbed the parade since 2014, following Russia’s annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. Moscow’s alleged meddling in the US presidential elections and the poisoning of Sergei Skripal in Salisbury in 2018 have made relations even chillier.Still, the Kremlin has sought to leverage the memory of the second world war to bring foreign leaders back to Moscow. Macron, who has been keen to rebuild relations with Putin, had agreed to attend the parade, as had the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, and the US national security adviser, Robert O’Brien.But with more than 7,500 deaths due to coronavirus in France, it appears less likely now that Macron will attend, and Japanese media have also reported that Abe does not plan to go.The Kremlin has said that it understands if foreign guests choose not to attend and has said it is considering “a wide variety of options” for what to do, but that so far it plans to go forward with the parade. The Russian business newspaper RBC has said the Kremlin is quietly considering either holding the parade without spectators or postponing the event until August.This 9 May marks the 75th anniversary of Victory in Europe Day, elevated under Putin to the country’s most important holiday. Russia holds a military parade on Red Square with with soldiers, tanks and intercontinental ballistic missiles and sees hundreds of thousands march with pictures of their relatives in a new tradition called the Immortal Regiment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f719bf9ca04d061c56184ca28c06863aa780b56/0_184_3500_2101/master/3500..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0909231d44d77c4e65b8c2505c474e0c","title":"we were trapped for too long coming back to life after lockdown in wuhan","story":"Guo Jing was confined to her home for 43 days. Here she tells the story of her first two hours of freedomOn 24 March, the Hubei coronavirus prevention and control department announced that starting from midnight on 8 April, people would be allowed to leave Wuhan and the surrounding Hubei province. Transport links to the outside will be restored and people with a green “health code” will be able to leave.Seeing this news, I was not very excited. First, my residential compound was still under lockdown. Secondly, the situation of the epidemic has improved but the aftermath and the disaster caused by this epidemic still continues.How do we remember the people who died? How do we help those damaged by the virus? How do we improve the situation for Hubei people who are now discriminated against? Many businesses have gone bankrupt, and people have lost jobs – how can we ensure their livelihoods? All these questions require the government and society to face the truth and take responsibility. But so far, we have not seen a comprehensive policy announced.On the evening of 30 March, a volunteer in my compound said they had spoken to the security guard and that residents with a green health code could now go out to buy supplies. I was so excited, I burst into tears. I quickly registered for the health code on Alipay and got ready to go out the next day. The last time I left my home was 26 February. It had already been 43 days.On 31 March at 11:35am, I walked out of my compound. (Each household can have one person leave, for a maximum of two hours.) Stepping out of my compound, I didn’t have any special plans, I was just so eager to see this city again with my own eyes.A lot of stores had not yet reopened but there were more than before: supermarkets, convenience stores, small noodle shops, electronics stores, shopping malls and so on.Because I could only stay out for two hours, I was a little flustered and had trouble taking clear photos. I passed by a store selling Wuhanese snacks and bought 10 fried meatballs for 21 yuan ($3).As part of the lockdown, a lot of places have been fenced off, including stores along the street and alleyway entrances, or gates to the riverbank. These shops are like urban villages – the residents don’t live in formal residential compounds with management services or a courtyard. Most of their homes are small – and they have had to stay in for more than 40 days, some of them even more than 60 days.Someone once asked me: “What is the first thing you will do after the lockdown?” I said: “Walk along the river and shout.” So on this day, I headed toward the river.I cycled to the entrance and then walked along the bank. There were more people now. There were parents with their kids, couples, people fishing. I found a seat, took off my face mask and in one breath ate five of the meatballs. They were juicy but not greasy. The flavour was just right.After I finished eating, I walked along the riverside. I hesitated a little and then facing the river I yelled: “Ahhhh!” Two other voices joined me. One of them even shouted three times. We have all been trapped for too long. We have been suffocated. I shouted a few more times. I felt energised.The two hours passed quickly. At 1pm I began walking back from the river. I bought a carton of yogurt from a small super market next to my compound. At 1:32pm, I went back home.Being able to leave our neighbourhood compound is one small step. Bringing the city back to life is still a long way away. Globalisation has shortened the distance between people and connected them – but it has also led to the explosion of this epidemic around the world.Many of the new cases in China now are imported infections, which could lead to a second outbreak. To face the epidemic, people must take protective measures and the government must treat those who are infected. All I want is to not go through another lockdown.Guo Jing, 29, is a women’s rights advocate in Wuhan and author of Wuhan Lockdown Diary.Translated by Wu Pei Lin and Lily Kuo"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d3cfbda2a7a0fcb476054adbb4d9c2af05872ec/0_5_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8e47c6f0eb4865ff1b3d69ff20dcaac","title":"how are you affected by coronavirus in the south west of the uk","story":"If you live in the south-west England or Wales, we’d like to find out about the impact of coronavirus on you and your community.

But a reluctance to go into lockdown might have been disastrousLombardy is one of the richest and most productive regions in Italy and Bergamo is its beating heart. It is also my home town: the city where I spent my childhood and adolescence. The province’s million inhabitants are characterised by a strong sense of belonging: to region and to family. They take pride too in a no-nonsense, practical approach to life and a powerful work ethic.Today, Bergamo holds the European record that no town wants: it is the place where the coronavirus pandemic has cast its darkest shadow. Bergamo is a lazaretto of pain, where the priority of hospital managers is to select only the patients they think will survive. Its undertakers are so overwhelmed they have to ask neighbouring communes to take their corpses for cremation.Italy’s death toll from this pandemic passed 15,000 on 4 April, although the number of actual deaths is probably higher. Bergamo, the most infected province in Italy, has had 9,712 confirmed cases and 2,245 deaths according to the official data. An investigation by the Eco di Bergamo newspaper estimates that in Bergamo province alone the virus killed 4,500 people in March.The rate of loss of life feels out of control to local people and defies all understanding. Forced confinement, physical distancing and care for the weakest seem futile. The virus seemed to defeat any effort, annihilate any commitment. Here, no one took to singing on balconies, to giving concerts online: the place is in perpetual mourning.But was the initial reluctance to shut down Bergamo’s factories and thriving economy a factor in spreading the infection?To grasp that first reaction it helps to understand just how efficient and solid the economic and industrial fabric here has been for generations. The province has Italy’s biggest concentration of the country’s best-performing small and medium-sized enterprises, clustered mostly in the lower Bergamo region. But it is also home to big international companies such as Brembo, which makes automotive braking systems, and Kiko, the international cosmetics brand founded by Antonio Percassi, also president of the local football team, Atalanta. Some Bergamo success stories such as the drinks company San Pellegrino, now owned by Nestlé, have been absorbed by multinationals.The three Alpine valleys of the province have more farms than businesses. The small towns that make up these valleys have strong rural communities that maintain their traditions at parish level, but can feel closed in on themselves. Everyone knows everyone else, many elderly people still speak the dialect, and even teenagers stick close to home.The city of Bergamo by contrast could hardly be more open: it is directly linked to the main European capitals by Orio al Serio airport (also known as MilanBergamo), which is a hub for Ryanair and had nearly 14 million passengers in 2019. These frequent connections are an important source of tourism for the city. In 1913, the German-Swiss writer and intellectual Hermann Hesse visited Bergamo and observed: “I was greeted by a modern railway station and a modern city … the evening stroll was crowded and the tramway crowded.” Then he took the funicular to reach the upper town, the historical part of the city surrounded by Venetian walls, “below me, the nightlife of the city was off … here I was in the middle of an ancient and dark city, swallowed up by a narrow and deserted alleyway, just as the shops were closing … it suddenly seemed to me that I was in southern Tuscany”.Hesse immediately grasped the duality of Bergamo: modern and ancient, economically open to the world but closed in on its traditions. On the one hand, a strong social and cultural life linked by voluntary work through the Catholic church. On the other, a remarkable focus on productivity, work, the family and above all the family business.It is clear looking back that this rich and dynamic city struggled to come to a halt when the virus arrived. For the Bergamaschi, work and self-reliance have always been fundamental values. But faced with a health emergency, was a strong business ethic a tragic disadvantage?By 23 February, the virus had already infected Val Seriana, the Bergamo valley where two villages, Alzano Lombardo and Nembro, quickly became the ground zero of the epidemic in the region.Four days earlier, on 19 February, an Atalanta-Valencia Champions League football match was attended by 45,000 fans in Milan, an event widely blamed for having accelerated the spread across the region.The contagion reached Codogno (a small town in Lodi province, 65km from Bergamo) two days after the game, and Codogno was immediately made a “red zone”, in other words quarantined with police checkpoints guarding entry and exit. By contrast, in Bergamo schools closed, but there was resistance to any sweeping stay-at-home measures until 8 March when all of Lombardy went into full lockdown.The Italian government had declared a nationwide health emergency on 31 January but Stefano Scaglia, the president of Confindustria Bergamo, which represents 1,200 businesses employing 80,000 people, offered reassurance. On 29 February, the organisation published a message in English aimed at the region’s international export partners, accompanied by the hashtag “#Bergamoisrunning”. Drawing on the Italian government’s advice it said “the risk of infection is low” and warned against “a distorted perception” created by the media. Confindustria could guarantee that “the government and responsible agencies have taken immediate protective measures to prevent further cases”. Scaglia’s message to global business: work goes on, we remain open.I was still in Bergamo when the body which represents local shops posted a promotional video accompanied by the hashtag #bergamononsiferma. A song by a local band accompanying images of Bergamo people peacefully ambling through the heart of the city seemed a bit too cheerful. The message was “let’s live without fear, let’s keep drinking coffee at the bar”. Bergamo’s mayor, Giorgio Gori, had earlier sent out optimistic messages, stressing that whatever strain the virus was putting on tourism, catering and commerce, the city would quickly put this “nightmare” behind it. Everyone’s desire was to continue working and consuming in spite of everything.Within weeks, army vehicles would be transporting corpses to other cities and hospital doctors were warning that the situation in Bergamo was “catastrophic” and out of control. Now in the mourning city and province, many people in Bergamo have abandoned their former quiet pragmatism.In the absence of work and the rational, efficient world they knew, blind anger is creeping in at what they see as official negligence. The most important failing, they believe, was not to impose a lockdown sooner, to shut the factories and businesses and keep people in their homes.I can see attitudes hardening too: people are looking for explanations and some are spreading baseless theories. In the many WhatsApp groups in which people share information and encouragement, conspiracy theories are cropping up more and more. “Why are so few immigrants getting sick?” “The Chinese grew the virus in a laboratory to weaken us!”In 2019 Bergamo had the second lowest unemployment rate in Italy. Now a major economic crisis, especially in the industrial and tourism sectors, seems inevitable.It’s not hard to see the far right taking advantage of the dark mood. Bergamo city is governed by the centre-left Democratic party. The province though is a stronghold for Matteo Salvini’s Lega.And people are looking for someone to blame. Facebook messages rant about Europe and “selfish” Germany. “Get out of the EU, get rid of the euro, reset the government and drive out immigrants,” reads one post. Another asks: “Germany is stealing our masks, France is spitting on us, what kind of shitty Europe is this?”Some will see this as a region lashing out and falling for populist slogans. I see my city distraught and destroyed by grief: people drawing on their last reserves of mental strength to make sense of the unimaginable. But I also see signs of hope in their resilience and solidarity: last week, volunteers, Alpini (elite Italian army troops), craftsmen and Atalanta fans completed work on a new field hospital in 10 days.As they worked they chanted: “People like us never give up.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/822473efc6d62333b2869a5e5498c36c9e8307b4/0_511_5005_3003/master/5005..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4dcf18be0274dd8b3ab472dff7055b29","title":"sunshine exercise social distancing uk in pictures","story":"As warm weekend weather arrived in the UK, Matt Hancock said people needed to follow the rules on coronavirus or the government would be forced to ban all exercise outside "},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

File photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsAlmost 40,000 employers have registered for the Covid-19 wage subsidy scheme since it was established two weeks ago, the Government has confirmed.Assistant secretary general in the Department of the Taoiseach Liz Canavan commended the “strong uptake” of the scheme established to encourage employers to keep workers on their books during the current crisis.It provides a subsidy of 70 per cent of take home pay, up to a weekly maximum tax free amount of €410 to allow firms to keep paying their staff. Almost €87 million has already been paid out under the scheme, Ms Canavan said.“39,000 employers are now registered with revenue for the scheme,” she said. “Today Revenue has generated further refunds under the scheme worth €14 million. These payments will be in the banks accounts of the majority of the respective employers tomorrow, the 7th of April. The cumulative value of payments made under the scheme is almost €87 million.”Separately the weekly €350 run of the Covid-19 unemployment payment issued over the weekend will also be available tomorrow.Following concerns about clusters of Coronavirus in nursing homes, additional measures were being put in place to reduce the risk of transmission, including twice daily “staff screening”, priority Covid-19 testing for staff and alternative accommodation and transport for staff if required. A financial support scheme for nursing home operators was also being put in place she said.The repatriation of Irish citizens was continuing, Ms Canavan said, with 2,700 people having received assistance to return home to date. The Department of Foreign Affairs was currently trying to help another 2,000 citizens to return, mostly from Australia, with around 100 in New Zealand. In recent days more than 70 Irish citizens were flown home from India she said.Ms Canavan said the Government appreciated the difficulties the request for older people to stay indoors or “cocoon” was causing, particularly for people who had previously lived independent lives.“The reason the chief medical officer has asked you to stay at home is to be confident that everybody over 70 and people with underlying conditions have the best chance of avoiding Covid-19,” she said. “It’s one less person to worry about contracting the disease. The best way to think about it is we need your help and staying at home is how you can help.”From today An Post is starting a same day newspaper delivery service, with free delivery for older and vulnerable people who cannot leave their homes. Those wishing to sign up to the service should contact anpost, or their national or local newspaper of choice, Ms Canavan said.It was vital everyone continued to abide by the social distancing and other restrictions on movement and the measures on hygiene and cough etiquette she said.“We heard the doctors telling us at the weekend that the next seven days are critical. So far so good, but we need to stick to the restrictions. Everyone has a part to play and you have been playing your part and that’s why it has been effective. We need to keep this going to flatten the curve more than we have.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4221960.1586170700!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"it s just stuff doctor leaves all possessions behind in australia to return to work in ireland","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDr Marianne Hennigan at Dublin Airport on Saturday. Photograph: Ireland’s CallThe world has changed completely since Dr Marianne Hennigan started a four-week holiday in New Zealand in mid-March. Then, governments were waking up to the reality of Covid-19, but it was still a disease mostly confined to China and Europe and not to Australia and New Zealand.Nobody expected the raft of restrictions which would shut down the world in the space of a few weeks. Within a week of her arrival in New Zealand, the bus tour was cancelled and she, along with others on the tour, was forced to self-isolate in Auckland. Dr Hennigan (31), originally from Deansgrange, Co Dublin, was working in Perth at the Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital as a locum doctor in emergency medicine. Like hundreds of other Irish newly-qualified doctors she found the opportunities and the climate in Perth agreeable and had spent three years there. Her flight back to Perth from Auckland was abruptly cancelled with no replacement available. In this hiatus, she made up her mind not to go back to Perth at all, but leave her car and her possessions there and return to Ireland to work. “In the end of the day it’s just stuff. I really enjoyed working in Perth,” she said. “It was lovely, the biggest thing that I regret is that I didn’t get to say goodbye to any of my friends when I left. I’m sure I will at some point. Unfortunately, none of us really expected what was going to happen.” Her marathon flight home, first to Doha in Qatar, and then to Ireland was facilitated by the Ireland’s Call Initiative which is not to be confused with On Call for Ireland, the HSE call for healthcare professionals, students and volunteers to help tackle coronavirus in Ireland. The Ireland’s Call Initiative was set up by businessman Neil Sands as a philanthropic enterprise to bring doctors and nurses home from abroad and to pay for their flights and accommodation in self-isolation for a fortnight. Ireland’s Call hopes to bring home 100 Irish medics from abroad in the coming months. She is the first to be repatriated under the initiative and one of more than 50,000 people who have offered their services to the HSE since last month. “We are not the real heroes,” she stressed. “The real heroes are the people who have been there from day one. We are the reinforcements. “I am delighted to be home. I was particularly happy to see my mum at the airport. It is just a relief to be coming home for the foreseeable future and that I won’t be stuck. “The main fear is that working in ICU, where it is high-risk, if I were to get sick, my family wouldn’t be able to come out to see me in Perth. At this time you want to be in proximity with your family and around Irish people.” She will need the next fortnight to register for and find work. Her experience in emergency respiratory medicine in Perth will be invaluable for her and for the HSE as it seeks to cope with the pandemic. There will be other business to attend to and making a will is something she feels is necessary given the risks involved. “I think everybody is fearful at this point in time when you see young healthcare workers getting sick and dying,” she said. “It is obvious that I didn’t intend to do it at this stage of my life. It is our profession and it is something that I want to help out. I would much rather be in the front line helping out than being stuck in another country in an Airbnb.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4221501.1586154006!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"fg ff set to agree principles to form new government","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThere is now a confidence in Fianna Fáil that Micheál Martin will become Taoiseach if a new government is formed, with the role reverting to Fine Gael in two years.  Photograph: Nick Bradshaw  The Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil expect to agree a statement of principles to underpin a future government and to circulate the document to other party leaders – except Sinn Féin – this week.In addition, senior officials have begun work on a programme for national recovery to plan for an economic upturn once the coronavirus crisis has passed.It is expected that the programme for recovery will seek to maintain investments in health and housing, though expenditure in other areas – including some capital spending – is likely to be curtailed.Sources in both parties say that the barriers to a coalition agreement between the two parties are falling away. There is now a confidence in Fianna Fáil that Micheál Martin will become Taoiseach if a new government is formed, with the role reverting to Fine Gael in two years.The two parties will speak on Monday with a view towards agreeing a more detailed framework document outlining the priorities for the new government. They will also seek to draft a statement of principles which they will ask the Green Party, the Social Democrats and the Labour Party to consider as a basis for renewed talks.The statement of principles is likely to commit to a “people-centred” economic recovery, as well as committing the future government to action on health, housing and climate change. However, it will not contain any policy detail or commitments, it is understood.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and the Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin are also likely to invite the leaders of the Greens, Labour and Social Democrats – but not Sinn Féin – to a meeting later this week or next week in a bid to kickstart new talks and break the logjam in government formation. However, there is little confidence in either Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael that any of the small parties can be brought on board.IndependentsConsequently, there are intensive contacts with independent TDs with a view to persuading as many as possible to back a FF-FG coalition. Between them, the two parties have 72 votes in the Dáil, but 80 are needed to form a bare majority, so the support of at least eight independents is needed. Both big parties would prefer to have the Greens, Labour or Social Democrats as part of the coalition, though sources admit this is unlikely at present.While the two parties are clearly moving towards a coalition deal, there is a great deal of uncertainty about when exactly such a government could be formed.The Dáil is adjourned until Thursday April 16th but neither side expects a deal to be concluded by then.

Photograph: Martin SylvestRitzau ScanpixAFP via Getty Images)Governments across Europe have begun preparations to ease the lockdowns imposed across much of the continent to contain the coronavirus pandemic, even if restrictions that have paralysed the economy are expected to remain in force for several more weeks.France, Spain, Belgium and Finland are among many countries that have set up expert committees to examine a gradual easing of stay-at-home orders for some businesses and schools while avoiding a second wave of infections that could overwhelm health services. Pedro Sánchez, the Spanish prime minister, on Saturday extended the shutdown of his country for another two weeks until April 26th but he said a ban imposed last month on all non-essential work, including manufacturing and construction, would be lifted after Easter.Angelo Borrelli, head of Italy’s Civil Protection Agency which is in charge of co-ordinating the national response to the outbreak, suggested a “phase two” of the country’s lockdown could begin next month. “I don’t want to give dates, but between now and May 16th we may have further positive data that suggests we can resume activities and then start phase two,” he said.French premier Édouard Philippe said last week that the process of “deconfinement” had no precedent and would be “fearsomely complex”, adding: “We are probably not heading for a deconfinement that would be absolute everywhere for everyone.”Loosening restrictionsDenmark, which was one of the first countries in Europe to shut down activity and close its borders, last week became the first to put a timetable on the loosening of restrictions.“If we Danes for the next two weeks – beyond Easter – continue to stand together, at a distance, and if the numbers remain stable and reasonable, then the government will begin a gradual, quiet and controlled opening of our society again,” prime minister Mette Frederiksen said on March 30th.Few other governments are willing to put a timescale on the loosening of restrictions not least because, according to most experts, it will require a massive increase in testing capacity. Many also worry about undermining the stay-at-home message with the onset of the Easter holidays and warmer weather and with populations already chafing at weeks of confinement and the loss of earnings.Germany, where the daily rate of confirmed coronavirus cases and deaths has risen in recent days, has also begun preparing what one official called a “phase-out” that would be “acceptable in terms of health policy”. “But we’ve been careful about what we say in public,” he added.However, some experts believe it is a big mistake for governments not to engage the public in a debate about loosening restrictions.“Although it is clear we cannot talk about when the opening up will take place, we can talk about how,” said Christiane Woopen, professor at the University of Cologne’s Centre for Ethics, Rights, Economics, and Social Sciences of Health and a scientific adviser to the government of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany’s most populous region.“The public deserve it. They are taking a lot of hardship. They have to trust what political leaders are doing in the next months.”‘Opening strategy’ Woopen is one of a dozen academics – epidemiologists, physicians, lawyers and economists – who published a report on Friday for the Munich-based Ifo economics institute. The report is an attempt to frame what Woopen calls an “opening strategy, not an exit strategy”, since there is unlikely to be any return to normality before a reliable vaccine against Covid-19 becomes widely available, which appears several months away.A separate Ifo study predicted the German economy could shrink by up to 20 per cent this year if the shutdown lasted three months and was followed by only a gradual recovery. Woopen and her fellow authors said social and psychological strain was as important to alleviate as the loss of output.The Ifo report argues for a “risk-adjusted” strategy whereby some age groups, regions and social and business functions can resume activity before others. Schools could begin lessons, given the lower risk of severe symptoms in children and the burden of closure on working parents, but older people and high-risk groups may remain cloistered for months. Highly automated factories could start up but nightclubs would be at the back of the queue.These changes will require huge shifts in organisation. Denmark and Belgium, for example, are considering splitting classes and the school week in two, to allow for better social distancing.Extensive testingAny loosening of restrictions would have to be accompanied by a ramping up of testing, said Martin Lohse, professor of pharmacology at the University of Würzburg, and another of the Ifo report’s authors.Even Germany’s extensive testing – it was conducting 50,000 a day last week – is insufficient given its population of 80 million, he said. Antibody testing would also be indispensable even if none of the tests being trialled around the world was so far deemed accurate enough. And governments needed to boost production of protective equipment as the wearing of face masks becomes more widespread. France for example is now considering making face masks mandatory in public. More rigorous contact tracing and tracking via mobile phone apps, would also be essential, Prof Lohse added.A differentiated loosening of restrictions would inevitably be more confusing for the public than the stay-at-home instruction, Lohse admitted. “Transparent communications helps. Telling people the truth about difficult choices but also the hopes makes a real difference.” – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4206213.1584564281!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eu sets out proposals for close uk ties after brexit talks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEuropean Union chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier and the British prime minister’s Europe adviser David Frost in Brussels on March 2nd. Photograph: Oliver HosletReutersThe European Union released a draft of its hoped-for future relationship deal with Britain on Wednesday, setting out ambitions for a tight relationship on trade and security.The 440-page document crosses several of Britain’s red lines, spelling out the bloc’s ambitions for Britain to agree “uniform implementation” of state subsidy rules, with the European Court of Justice remaining the adjudicating authority.It also makes reference to the so-called “level playing field”, provisions to ensure fair competition by keeping rules aligned, which London has already rejected.“The Parties recognise that the establishment of conditions that ensure a level playing field between the Parties is necessary for trade and investment between the Union and the United Kingdom, ” the draft reads.The EU’s draft envisages reciprocal access to waters for fishing rights, with negotiations held each year by December 10th on fishing opportunities for the following year, another contentious point.The UK negotiating team said it had also sent a draft to the EU. This includes a free trade agreement with annexes, as well as agreements on aviation safety and air transport, and a civil nuclear agreement.“We are sharing ours in confidence as a negotiating document, as part of the ongoing negotiating process,” a government spokesman said.“Teams will now analyse each other’s texts and we expect further conversations between the teams next week.“We will keep under review which documents it is appropriate to publish during the course of negotiations and whether it is useful to make them availablle more widely.”Though Britain has left the EU it is is currently in a transition period, continuing to adhere to prior norms pending the agreement of a deal on the future relationship. If none can be agreed, it will automatically begin trading on World Trade Organisation terms from January 1st, 2021, with potentially severe effects on the Irish economy.The government of prime minister Boris Johnson has until July to request an extension to the transition period, but has insisted it will not do so even as the Coronavirus pandemic delayed talks this week.Both sides said they were examining options such as using video conferencing in place of face-to face talks.“The negotiations can still proceed given all of the logistical arrangements that have been put in place,” British foreign secretary Dominic Raab said on Tuesday.“We’re confident that we can get this done and, actually, I don’t think delaying Brexit negotiations would give anyone the certainty on either side of the Channel that they need.”Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":null,"title":"lockdown countries","story":"Italians have now been quarantined for close to a month - and the pandemic\u0027s surge in the country finally appears to be slowing.Since Italy imposed a nationwide lockdown, dozens of other countries have also ordered their citizens indoors.Quarantines have now been imposed in the United Kingdom, Australia, France, Germany, Switzerland and Austria, among others.And more than two weeks after some of the worst-affected areas on Europe - Spain and Italy - imposed restrictions on movement, both countries are now managing to reduce the number of new cases and new deaths.China has announced it will finally be ending lockdown in Wuhan on April 8, a huge milestone for the country and a signal that the crisis - for them at least - is nearing its end.The city in Hubei province was the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak.Yet it took more than two months of extremely draconian restrictions, including travel bans and quarantine zones, to achieve the level of containment seen in Wuhan. China enforced lockdowns relatively early while they grappled with the virus. It was only on January 7 the new strain of coronavirus - Covid-19 - was identified.Less than three weeks later Hubei province was under lockdown and the government was busy shutting down neighbouring provinces.While many other countries employed a \u0027contain\u0027 strategy to keep the virus at bay, they did not enforce restrictions on travel or social distancing for more than a month.Spain and Belgium did not lock down for 43 days after their first case, while the UK, Germany and France did not impose quarantines for more than 53 days. Italy locked down faster than most in Europe- 39 days after the first case was identified.Almost a month later, there are now tentative signs of recovery.The number of new cases in Italy peaked a fortnight ago at around 6,500 a day. Since then the number has been falling, and new cases have numbered less than 5,000 a day for the last week.The numbers began to fall 12 days after the country went into national quarantine, with travel restricted to only essential journeys and people confined to their homes.Spain\u0027s lockdown came three days after Italy, on March 14. At the time the country had only seen 1,100 cases and 148 deaths.New cases in Spain peaked last week at more than 9,000 new cases a day, and the numbers have been falling since then.Countries which locked down earlier appear to have successfully \u0027flattened the curve\u0027 before they were overwhelmed by the virus. Switzerland and Austria imposed travel restrictions within a month of identifying their first cases.Neither country has seen up to 2,000 cases a day, and both are now seeing signs of reducing the outbreak.The death rates in Italy and Spain are also beginning to decline, but their trajectories surpassed that seen in China.10 days ago the daily death toll in Italy was nudging towards 1,000 a day. Now it has fallen to almost half that number, with 525 new deaths on Sunday, April 5.Spain is following a similar trajectory, although the country saw a more severe and rapid increase in the number of deaths early in the outbreak. Four days ago the number of new deaths was close to 1,000 a day - 961. That has now fallen to less than 700 a day.The death rate began to decline 20 days after the country went into lockdown - giving hope for those following in their wake.Modelling from the universities of Exeter, Bristol and Warwick suggested that without any measures at all, the epidemic would have peaked around 133 days after first person-to-person transmission in Britain, which happened around February 28. It is hoped, with current lockdown measures in place, the UK can begin to see the effects within two to three weeks - allowing time for the virus to incubate in those already infected.Prof Mark Woolhouse, Professor of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, University of Edinburgh, said: We now enter a phase of careful monitoring. We are looking for indicators first that the epidemic is slowing down and then for numbers of new cases to start to fall. After three weeks we will have to decide whether the restrictions need to be continued, can be relaxed, or can be relaxed temporarily with the expectation of imposing them again later. We must also monitor the damage being that the lockdown is doing damage to the economy, to education, to psychological well-being and to health and social care provision in the community.The impacts of this epidemic are too far reaching for policy decisions to be driven by epidemiology alone.The Department of Health has advised that the peak is likely in about three months when 95 per cent of the infections are expected to take place. It means that most people will contract the virus between late May and late June.The Prime Minister said last week that the most dangerous period is not now, but some weeks away, depending on how fast it spreads. Experts hope that the UK\u0027s response will push the peak beyond the normal end of the flu season in April and into the summer, when the NHS will be under less strain.Read more: How will the lockdown plans affect me?More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons april 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Politics latest news: Boris Johnson \u0026#39in good spirits\u0026#39 in hospital and continues to lead government Coronavirus latest news: Death toll in England rises by 403, as officer warns banning exercise would be \u0026#39really difficult\u0026#39 to policeWhich countries are under lockdown - and is it working?Hospitalising coronavirus patients can cause more deaths, Italy data suggestsLearn to make art in self-isolation – with tips from top artistsCoronavirus Q\u0026ampA: When will there be a vaccine and when will testing kits be available?

Iceland is doing both.Mr Gudnason\u0027s team of 60 police investigators and healthcare workers act as detectives on each confirmed case, tracking down those they have come in contact with.  Testing is carried out by The National Health Service on those showing symptoms. But on top of this, a biopharma company, deCODE Genetics, has been screening random samples of the population to build the world\u0027s most extensive study yet of how the virus behaves in a population.Early results show 50 per cent of carriers of the virus are asymptomatic. It has also revealed up to 40 \u0027mutations\u0027, or strains, of the disease. They claim to have traced strains back to Italy, Austria, the US, and seven cases in particular to one undisclosed football match in the UK.Crucially, all the testing has meant Iceland has been able to avoid a lockdown or quarantine as cases are tracked, traced and isolated before spreading rapidly - thus alleviating pressure on the hospitals.The data rolling in has meant authorities can more accurately design methods of controlling the virus, Mr Stefánsson says.So far there is a government ban on gatherings of more than 20 people and light guidelines on social distancing.The guidance is imposed not by force but by trust, Katrín Jakobsdottir, Iceland\u0027s prime minister, tells The  .Iceland has a history of socially liberal culture, she says. That means acceptance of differences and minorities, but in this case, it means to trust, not to force. We have no tradition of militarism or an army. We ask for cooperation, rather than force it.  She adds that the science approach allows her to leave the virus policy out of the battlefield of politics.The limited guidelines means business is slow for most shops, but with few exceptions the country is open for business.Icelanders can still get their morning coffee, sit down at local bookshops. Even stop at a local ice-cream parlour.At Reykjavík Roasters, a small but popular independent cafe in Reykjavík\u0027s centre, customers trickle in despite the pandemic. The city\u0027s centre is unusually calm.“Honestly, what I miss more than anything are the public pools” pensioner Auður Styrkásdóttir says apologetically, adding “this is a luxury.”One of the main benefits of Iceland\u0027s system is the school programme has been largely unaffected.Pre-schools, primary, and secondary schools have stayed open while higher education has moved online.Some people have taken to social media asking why children\u0027s safety is perhaps taken less seriously than those of adult students.Mr Gudnason points out that closing down institutions that serve children has a more significant social impact Our study suggests that children are less effective in spreading this virus than adults. We measure every decision with it\u0027s effectiveness and closing these institutions is unlikely to produce meaningful results at this time.Part of Iceland\u0027s success story is it\u0027s readiness.We realised at the end of 2019 that we should prepare for a pandemic, Mr Gudnason says.Our emergency system is clear, it is efficient and importantly frequently in use. Be it storms, avalanches, volcanic eruptions or a pandemic the system is the same. Health authorities step into a well-oiled machine, highly trained infrastructure and years of experience in building communication channels and trust.On Friday the head of Iceland\u0027s response, Víðir Reynisson, warned against drawing too much from the Iceland model, pointing out that the country\u0027s size, strong channels of communication and social cohesion helped.There are many factors that make things easier on us, he said.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"lucy worsley johnny depp stood","story":"Historian Lucy Worsley may be better acquainted with the demands of monarchs like Henry VIII than the whims of Hollywood royalty.But the presenter has revealed she was once stood up by film star Johnny Depp at Hampton Court Palace.Worlsey had even given up a date with her husband in order to meet the actor, who explained that he was “tired”.She also had to fend off the boredom of another Hollywood star, Tom Hiddleston, with invented ghost storiesThe BBC advocate of entertaining history said that her explanatory skills were requested by Depp’s agent, who asked for an after-hours tour of Henry VIII’s former residence at Hampton Court.Alongside her television work the Oxford-educated Worsley serves as chief curator at Historic Royal Palace, which oversees the sprawling site.Despite arrangements being made to meet the actor’s demands, the “wretched man” failed to show up at the appointed time.  His agent requested an after-hours tour of Hampton Court Palace because he was here filming,” Worlsey told Good Housekeeping magazine.But, I was meant to be meeting my husband Mark at a party that night.I waited until 8pm when I was told that Johnny was tired and had gone home.The wretched man stood me up.Even when curious celebrities have arrived for tours, things have not gone smoothly for the historian.On leading The Night Manager star Hiddleston around the lavish rooms in south west London, she had to resort to the supernatural to keep his interest, and invent resident ghosts.Worsley was alarmed by his lack of questions, remembering: The only thing he asked me was \u0027are there any ghosts?\u0027I could tell he wasn\u0027t really interested, so I just said \u0027yes\u0027.She added: “I don’t believe in ghosts because they don’t exist.  I’m much more afraid of serial killers.”Worlsey’s brushes with celebrity may have come as a surprise to her father, who the historian said was dismayed by her choice of subject, and had advised a scientific career.The presenter has now enjoyed a lengthy spell in high-level curation, and is a familiar face on TV screens.  She said:  “He said if I did a history degree I’d end up cleaning toilets for a living.  “He’s so fed up of being reminded of that because it’s become a sort of stick to beat him with.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"uk finally announces repatriation flights india philippines","story":"Brits stranded in India are absolutely livid after long-awaited charter flights back to the United Kingdom amid the coronavirus pandemic were priced at over £680.The Foreign \u0026amp Commonwealth Office will run seven planes to take British nationals home between April 8-12.

Whether it be screening and systematic population testing, triaging, isolating or quarantining, our attitude seems always to be at best sceptical or at worst half-hearted.Nowhere has this been more in evidence than in our policy towards the wearing of face masks by the public, a practice that is widespread in many parts of the world – notably in nations that have been more successful at suppressing Covid-19 – and which is now gaining support in previously sceptical countries. But not seemingly here in the UK, where the deputy Chief Medical Officer for England has again spoken out against any change in policy.To be fair to the Government, a systematic review of the English language literature on the prevention of the transmission of the influenza virus by Cambridge Core in 2009 did find that, while there was some evidence to support the wearing of masks during illness to reduce virus transmission, there was little data to support the use of masks or respirators to prevent becoming infected. The review argued that further studies were needed.But that was more than 10 years ago, and no evidence of effect is not evidence of no effect. In recent days, the Center for Disease Control in the United States has issued new guidance to the effect that everyone should wear a cloth face cover when they go out in public, a measure that is intended to protect other people in case you are infected. The World Health Organisation is currently reviewing its own position on the matter.The emerging knowledge that corona sufferers may be able to infect others in the preclinical stages of the disease makes such moves all the more logical. Furthermore, new research published in Nature Medicine last week concluded that surgical masks may help prevent infected people from making others sick with seasonal viruses, including coronaviruses. During the 191819 Spanish flu pandemic, meanwhile, Hobday and Casons in Boston demonstrated lower case fatality rates in open-air hospitals with natural ventilation and gauze masks and our own Dr Hood, the medical superintendent at the Marylebone hospital, showed a similar effect with lint masks.Why is the UK, then, so resistant? Sadly, a rigid and inflexible approach to science has seemed to dominate thinking and specialist advice, with constant rhetoric about us having the best science in the world when a bit of modesty might have served us better. Indeed, the narrow range of intervention options offered by Cobra, seemingly based on a narrowly drawn coterie of advisers, including the increasingly challenged group of Imperial College academics, is being questioned by front-line practitioners.But our failure to change tack on this issue could also have something to do with our lack of preparedness for pandemics in general. Given our well‑publicised problems with regard to other capacity issues, including testing kit, reagents and swabs, personal protective equipment and potentially oxygen, could it be the case that the Government is avoiding another embarrassing failure that would be brought about by large-scale public demand for face masks?It seems likely that in the days to come we will witness a U-turn on this issue, something which can’t come soon enough for those such as bus and taxi drivers, who may already have become victims of the coronavirus.As we hopefully move towards a more pragmatic package of measures, we must remind ourselves of the importance of a rigorous approach to even the humble face mask, which must be worn properly and changed or washed regularly. Perhaps when all this is over, standards of British personal hygiene will have been permanently improved – something that even the Roman occupation failed to achieve.Professor John Ashton was regional director of public health and regional medical officer for the North West of EnglandThe  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

An irrational response is to want to brick everyone up in their homes and shoot sunbathers on sight. The Health Secretary hasn’t quite gone that far, but when he threatened to ban outdoor exercise if more of us don’t stay at home, he came dangerously close to breaking the very social consensus that he’s trying to build.Matt Hancock is obsessed with the front line. Quite right, too. The Government is desperate to ensure that the health system isn’t overwhelmed as it was in Italy (with appalling human consequences), so it has focused on increasing NHS capacity, by laying on beds and equipment, and flattening the rate of infection, by shutting down the country. The toll on the Health Secretary is physically palpable – the poor man looks like he probably wakes up screaming “Stay indoors! Stay indoors!” – and I for one would offer to buy him a drink when this is all over.But if this really is the moral equivalent of war then history teaches us that wars can be won on the battlefield but lost on the home front, and just as nations have been defeated because they ran out of food or a revolution broke out, so the Government’s strategy could collapse because the millions of civilians stuck indoors lose patience.The Government seems to have no sensitivity for this. In one press conference after another, the need to stay home is impressed upon us as though we were recalcitrant simpletons, but there’s barely any recognition of the cost in jobs, income, crime or sanity. To repeat, most of us accept the lockdown because we want to help save lives, but the legitimacy of this incredible experiment in self‑restraint is undermined not only by those who flout the rules but also by those who enforce them.Obviously the chief medical officer of Scotland is a colossal hypocrite: after telling Scots to batten down the hatches, it was discovered that she had been visiting her second home in Fife to go on a nice walk with the family. This is probably the great ide of the pandemic, namely middle-class people with multiple homes or big gardens telling people in tiny flats to “STAY INDOORS”.The disgraced official deserves her five minutes of shame – but did it really necessitate a formal warning by the police? Is it really necessary to move on old ladies who sit down for a breather on a bench, or to threaten to arrest drivers, or to dye a blue lagoon black to stop people from taking photos of it? Where did all these coppers even come from? I’ve never seen so many in my life. I suppose that with the public now locked indoors, the police finally feel safe enough to walk the streets.What we’re living under right now is therapeutic authoritarianism, in which any amount of state intervention is justified because it’s all for our own good. But if it tightens controls too much, the Government could trigger civil disobedience, which would signal the death of a consensus and, in effect, a way of life.The Queen expressed the traditional British attitude perfectly when she referred in her broadcast to our “self-discipline” and “good-humoured resolve”. These are the ingredients of common sense, a constitution unlike any other because it isn’t invented or even written, but evolves down the centuries, shaped by experience and informed by national character. In this country, we govern by consent.I hope we don’t forget that. I hope we don’t become a nasty little island where neighbours snoop on each other and compete to be holier than thou, where the authorities are feared and dissent leads to social ostracism – and a surreptitious walk to the post box becomes a police matter.God is mocking us by sending such nice weather during a lockdown: or is the weather nice because we’re stuck indoors? Birdsong has replaced car noise the air seems fresher the water in the pond is crystal clear. Does everything have to go back to normal when the war is over?Warmer weather, however, is a pain in the neck for anyone with big hair quite literally. It sweats at night and itches in bed. I know this is a first world problem, but I can’t get a haircut because the barbers are shut and my barnet grows like billy-o: not down, but up, so that after six weeks it looks like a Russian hat. I said to a vicar: “By the end of this crisis, I’m going to be incredibly thin with massive hair.” He replied: “My dear, that’s every 40-year-old man’s dream come true!”How is this playing out across the country? Will husbands trust their wives to cut their hair? I’m sure no wife would do the opposite. A friend in France has self-sheared with a pair of clippers and now looks like a lunatic. I would do the same but one of the downsides of having a mop that everyone comments on (make-up girls find me fascinating) is that I’m terrified of losing it because, without it, I’m half the man I was.If I shave my hair, will it grow back? I can’t take that risk. My only hope is to lobby the Government to have Toni and Guy’s classed as an essential service.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Flybe said it cancelled 994 flights in the three months to 31 March, compared to 372 in the same period last year.People were asked about changes to their personal finances, the general economy and whether they feel now is the right time to make major purchases, during interviews between 16 and 27 March.The results produced an overall negative score in the “consumer confidence barometer” from GfK of minus 34, indicating a sharp decline in confidence of 25 points from a score of minus nine in mid-March.Debenhams had been in trouble before the current crisis, which has seen all but essential shops close their doors. A year ago, the chain went through a restructuring process known as a pre-pack administration, which saw lenders take control\u0026nbspand shareholders, including Mike Ashley’s Sports Direct, wiped out.The 242-year-old company is already in the process of closing around 50 stores as it seeks to slash costs and focus on profitable sites. Of those, 22 have shut so far.Debenhams said the new administration would be “light touch”, suggesting it would not involve further, large-scale store closures but some analysts remain sceptical.“This is the first example of a so-called ‘light touch’ administration which has been promoted by practitioners to protect the company from hostile actions during the current crisis,” said David Ereira, a restructuring partner and insolvency expert at international law firm Paul Hastings. “Debenhams has, however, been in financial difficulty for some time now, so how long any new measures can keep it afloat remain to be seen.”Sean Moran, an insolvency partner at law firm Shakespeare Martineau\u0026nbspwarned that other well-known names may be forced to call in the administrators.“The government has stated its intention to facilitate cash injections and other financial assistance to businesses, recognising the imminent threat of insolvencies in many sectors,” he said. “These measures include the temporary business rates relief set out in the Budget which will benefit many smaller retailers in the short term.“It remains to be seen how quickly the processes for accessing other funds and the payment mechanisms promised will actually materialise. Cash remains king at present and those businesses without cash or access to credit lines will have massive problems.”Stefaan Vansteenkiste, the chief executive of Debenhams, said on Monday: “These are unprecedented circumstances and we have taken this step to protect our business, our employees\u0026nbspand other important stakeholders so that we are in a position to resume trading from our stores when government restrictions are lifted.“We are working with a group of highly supportive owners and lenders and anticipate that additional funding will be made available to bridge us through the current crisis period.“With their support and working with other key stakeholders, including landlords, pension trustees and business partners, we are striving to protect jobs and reopen as many Debenhams stores for trading as we can, as soon as this is possible.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Of those, 22 have already shut.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesA further administration is now being considered with KPMG among the firms said to be in the running to handle it.Sky News reported that Debenhams could file a notice of intention to appoint administrators as next week but other options are being explored.Mike Ashley funding lawsuit to ‘eliminate Debenhams as a competitor’A spokesperson for the retailer\u0026nbspsaid: Like all retailers, Debenhams is making contingency plans reflecting the extraordinary current circumstances.Our owners and lenders remain highly supportive and whatever actions we may take will be with a view to protecting the business during the current situation.While our stores remain closed in line with government guidance, and the majority of our store-facing colleagues have been furloughed, our website continues to trade and we are accepting customer orders, gift cards and returns.”Debenhams put most of its workforce on furlough last week after closing all 140 of its UK stores as the country entered lockdown to slow the spread of Covid-19.The move means the government is covering up to 80 per cent of employees\u0027 salaries under the Coronavirus Job retention Scheme.The BBC reported this week that Debenhams was to launch a major restructuring after seeking an urgent deal with its landlords.

Debenhams said it was preparing for all of its stores to reopen once the coronavirus lockdown conditions are eased by the government.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe company said in a statement: “This move will protect Debenhams from the threat of legal action that could have the effect of pushing the business into liquidation while its 142 UK stores remain closed in line with the government’s current advice regarding the covid-19 pandemic.”It came as\u0026nbspdata showed the increasingly heavy economic toll caused by coronavirus, with construction slumping to its worst performance since the financial crisis, new car registrations plunging by more than 40 per cent and consumer confidence dropping at its fastest pace in more than four decades.When can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?Listen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastSome 203,000 fewer new cars were registered in March than during the same month in 2019, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. A separate report from Auto Analysis and Global Data forecast that manufacturers will lose out on $100bn (£82bn) in car sales as their factories lie dormant across Europe and North America.Meanwhile, the UK construction sector suffered its largest job cuts since 2010 after measures to stop the spread of coronavirus halted work and caused a slump in new orders.The closely watched IHS MarkitChartered Institute of Procurement and\u0026nbspSupply (CIPS)\u0026nbspconstruction purchasing managers’ index\u0026nbspdropped to 39.3 for March, from 52.6 in February. Analysts had forecast a reading of 44, with anything below 50 indicating a contraction in activity.Duncan Brock, the group director at the CIPS, said: “With no upturn in sight, and with the fastest level of lay-offs since September 2010, the sector is stuck in quicksand and sinking further.”There was more bad news for retailers too after a survey showed that consumer confidence plummeted in the last two weeks of March – a period in which some 950,000 people made new benefit claims.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Flybe said it cancelled 994 flights in the three months to 31 March, compared to 372 in the same period last year.People were asked about changes to their personal finances, the general economy and whether they feel now is the right time to make major purchases, during interviews between 16 and 27 March.The results produced an overall negative score in the “consumer confidence barometer” from GfK of minus 34, indicating a sharp decline in confidence of 25 points from a score of minus nine in mid-March.Debenhams had been in trouble before the current crisis, which has seen all but essential shops close their doors. A year ago, the chain went through a restructuring process known as a pre-pack administration, which saw lenders take control\u0026nbspand shareholders, including Mike Ashley’s Sports Direct, wiped out.The 242-year-old company is already in the process of closing around 50 stores as it seeks to slash costs and focus on profitable sites. Of those, 22 have shut so far.Debenhams said the new administration would be “light touch”, suggesting it would not involve further, large-scale store closures but some analysts remain sceptical.“This is the first example of a so-called ‘light touch’ administration which has been promoted by practitioners to protect the company from hostile actions during the current crisis,” said David Ereira, a restructuring partner and insolvency expert at international law firm Paul Hastings. “Debenhams has, however, been in financial difficulty for some time now, so how long any new measures can keep it afloat remain to be seen.”Sean Moran, an insolvency partner at law firm Shakespeare Martineau\u0026nbspwarned that other well-known names may be forced to call in the administrators.“The government has stated its intention to facilitate cash injections and other financial assistance to businesses, recognising the imminent threat of insolvencies in many sectors,” he said. “These measures include the temporary business rates relief set out in the Budget which will benefit many smaller retailers in the short term.“It remains to be seen how quickly the processes for accessing other funds and the payment mechanisms promised will actually materialise. Cash remains king at present and those businesses without cash or access to credit lines will have massive problems.”Stefaan Vansteenkiste, the chief executive of Debenhams, said on Monday: “These are unprecedented circumstances and we have taken this step to protect our business, our employees\u0026nbspand other important stakeholders so that we are in a position to resume trading from our stores when government restrictions are lifted.“We are working with a group of highly supportive owners and lenders and anticipate that additional funding will be made available to bridge us through the current crisis period.“With their support and working with other key stakeholders, including landlords, pension trustees and business partners, we are striving to protect jobs and reopen as many Debenhams stores for trading as we can, as soon as this is possible.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It occurs when the full moon is at its closest point to Earth in its monthly orbit.On 7-8 April, the moon will get as close as 356,907km (221,772\u0026nbspmiles) to Earth, making it appear bigger and brighter in the night\u0027s sky.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe time of year means this full moon is known in folklore as the \u0027Pink moon\u0027, as it usually coincides with spring flower blossoms.The best time and date to see April\u0027s\u0026nbspsupermoon\u0026nbspis at moonrise on Tuesday and at moonset on Wednesday, when it is close to the horizon.How to take the perfect picture of the supermoon this weekThis is due to an optical illusion that makes it appear even bigger due to its relative size to buildings and objects on the horizon.\u0026nbspThe supermoon\u0027s peak illumination will take place just after\u0026nbsp6pm\u0026nbspGMT on Tuesday, though it may not be visible until after sunset.The term was first coined by astrologer Richard Nolle\u0026nbspin 1979, who defined a supermoon\u0026nbspas any full moon that was within 90 per cent of its closest approach.The coinage and use of the term has been criticised by astronomers, however some welcome it as a way to encourage interest\u0026nbspin astronomy.“Some astronomers complain about the name supermoon. They like to call supermoons hype,” astronomer and EarthSky contributor Bruce McClure wrote recently.Created with Sketch.9 best images of the 2016 supermoon Show all 9Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The moon rises over the O2 Arena in south-east LondonA commerical jet flies in front of the moon on its approach to Heathrow airport in west London on November 13, 2016.A super moon rises over the Statue of Freedom on the Capitol dome in Washington, DC November 13, 2016.The supermoon, the closest the moon comes to Earth since 1948, rises over the Power and Light building in downtown Kansas City, Missouri, U.S., November 13, 2016A woman sits on the rooftop terrace of a house during the supermoon in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, November 13, 2016The moon rises behind the eagle sculpture high atop LeVeque Tower in Columbus, Ohio, Sunday, Nov. 13, 2016The moon rises beyond the Arch in St. Louis as seen from the Compton Hill Water Tower on Sunday, Nov. 13, 2016The moon rises behind Reunion Tower in downtown Dallas, Sunday evening, Nov. 13, 2016.The moon rises over the harbor of the costal town of Lambert\u0027s Bay, South Africa, Monday, Nov. 14, 2016The moon rises over the O2 Arena in south-east LondonA commerical jet flies in front of the moon on its approach to Heathrow airport in west London on November 13, 2016.A super moon rises over the Statue of Freedom on the Capitol dome in Washington, DC November 13, 2016.The supermoon, the closest the moon comes to Earth since 1948, rises over the Power and Light building in downtown Kansas City, Missouri, U.S., November 13, 2016A woman sits on the rooftop terrace of a house during the supermoon in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, November 13, 2016The moon rises behind the eagle sculpture high atop LeVeque Tower in Columbus, Ohio, Sunday, Nov. 13, 2016The moon rises beyond the Arch in St. Louis as seen from the Compton Hill Water Tower on Sunday, Nov. 13, 2016The moon rises behind Reunion Tower in downtown Dallas, Sunday evening, Nov. 13, 2016.The moon rises over the harbor of the costal town of Lambert\u0027s Bay, South Africa, Monday, Nov. 14, 2016“But supermoons aren’t hype. They’re special. Many people now know and use the word supermoon. We notice even some diehards are starting to use it now... No doubt about it. Supermoon is a catchier term than perigean\u0026nbspfull moon.The supermoon will also have an effect on the Earth’s ocean, Mr McClure notes, with the extra gravitational pull from the moon creating extra-high\u0026nbsptides.People living along the coast will notice them one or two days after the supermoon has passed, though any risk of flooding is unlikely unless the high tides are combined with severe weather.For most parts of the UK, Tuesday and Wednesday will see exceptionally good weather with highs of up to 24C\u0026nbspin the south and east.Clear skies and reduced air pollution due to the coronavirus lockdown means April’s supermoon could be one of the best ever times to view a supermoon.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Here’s how to take the perfect picture of it:Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesUse a landmark to get perspectiveEveryone will be taking pictures of the supermoon by itself, but some of the best pictures show the moon next to a land mark or trees and houses, which is what helps to give the picture “a sense of place”, says Nasa’s senior photographer, Bill Ingalls. “Think of how to be creative – that means tying it into some land-based object. It can be a local landmark or anything to give your photo a sense of place.”Created with Sketch.9 best images of the 2016 supermoon Show all 9Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The moon rises over the O2 Arena in south-east LondonA commerical jet flies in front of the moon on its approach to Heathrow airport in west London on November 13, 2016.A super moon rises over the Statue of Freedom on the Capitol dome in Washington, DC November 13, 2016.The supermoon, the closest the moon comes to Earth since 1948, rises over the Power and Light building in downtown Kansas City, Missouri, U.S., November 13, 2016A woman sits on the rooftop terrace of a house during the supermoon in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, November 13, 2016The moon rises behind the eagle sculpture high atop LeVeque Tower in Columbus, Ohio, Sunday, Nov. 13, 2016The moon rises beyond the Arch in St. Louis as seen from the Compton Hill Water Tower on Sunday, Nov. 13, 2016The moon rises behind Reunion Tower in downtown Dallas, Sunday evening, Nov. 13, 2016.The moon rises over the harbor of the costal town of Lambert\u0027s Bay, South Africa, Monday, Nov. 14, 2016The moon rises over the O2 Arena in south-east LondonA commerical jet flies in front of the moon on its approach to Heathrow airport in west London on November 13, 2016.A super moon rises over the Statue of Freedom on the Capitol dome in Washington, DC November 13, 2016.The supermoon, the closest the moon comes to Earth since 1948, rises over the Power and Light building in downtown Kansas City, Missouri, U.S., November 13, 2016A woman sits on the rooftop terrace of a house during the supermoon in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, November 13, 2016The moon rises behind the eagle sculpture high atop LeVeque Tower in Columbus, Ohio, Sunday, Nov. 13, 2016The moon rises beyond the Arch in St. Louis as seen from the Compton Hill Water Tower on Sunday, Nov. 13, 2016The moon rises behind Reunion Tower in downtown Dallas, Sunday evening, Nov. 13, 2016.The moon rises over the harbor of the costal town of Lambert\u0027s Bay, South Africa, Monday, Nov. 14, 2016Pick the best spotLocation isn’t everything, but it can definitely help with getting a perfect picture of the supermoon if you have time to plan it. You can look up the best monuments or statues in your area to photograph the image of the moon against, like Mr Ingalls does in Washington D.C., where he lives. “It means doing a lot of homework. I use Google Maps and other apps – even a compass – to plan where to get just the right angle at the right time,” he told Nasa.Get the right exposureIf you’re taking a picture on your camera, control the light balance by first tapping the screen where the moon appears to get the camera to focus on the object before dragging your finger up and down to play with the exposure. “You’ll usually want to drag it down for underexposure to be sure you have all the highlight detail,” National Geographic photographer Michael Christopher Brown said.Use a tripod for your camera or rest your phone on a solid surfaceDavid Reneke, an astronomer and writer for Australian science magazine told ABC.net that if you’re using an SLR or DSLR then it’s important to play with aperture settings on your camera to photograph the supermoon, but that using a tripod is essential.It’s worth using a tripod for taking pictures with a smartphone too, as any camera shake can compromise the quality of the pictures – but if you don’t have one to hand you can simply rest your phone on a window ledge.For older smartphones that use a digital zoom rather than an optical zoom, it’s generally best not to use the zoom as it could compromise the quality of the image. Instead, take the picture and then crop it.Newer phones like the Huawei P30 and P40 series feature incredible zoom capabilities that can take detailed pictures of far away objects. Other cameras come with special features to improve pictures of the night sky, such as the Google Pixel 4’s Astro mode.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Whatever her reasons for doing so, it was wrong and she knows that.“All of us, including me, will make mistakes in these unprecedented times we are living in.

It is vital that everyone adhere\u0026nbspto these requirements.“Police officers and staff are putting themselves in harm’s way day and night to explain these instructions to our communities, encourage co-operation and, where necessary, enforce them.”In a joint statement, Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie and Wendy Chamberlain, the MSP and MP respectively for the area where Dr Calderwood has her second home, said: “It is difficult to see how the chief medical officer will be able to carry the important messages about the virus and the lockdown if she has not even followed it herself.”They added: “If we are going to get through this pandemic we need medical leaders who everyone can follow. It is with great regret that we say that the chief medical officer will need to go.”Scotland’s constitution secretary Mike Russell said there was no doubt Dr Calderwood’s visit was “ill-advised”. The\u0026nbspScottish Government confirmed it was an overnight stay to “check on a family home”.Mr Russell said she would be “answerable” for her decision when she appears at the daily coronavirus briefing with Nicola Sturgeon later today.He added: “I’m saying to everybody... do not go out except in the very exceptional circumstances that are listed, think about these things and remember by breaking them you are risking lives.”Scottish Police Federation general secretary Calum Steele said policing the pandemic had been made more difficult and stressed checking on a second home is not one of the “reasonable excuses” providing an exception to emergency coronavirus legislation.He tweeted: “In defending the indefensible has the Scottish Government not just thrown the CMO under the bus? Checking on a 2nd home is not one of the prescribed reasonable excuses.”Monica Lennon,\u0026nbspMSP for central Scotland, said in a statement on Facebook: “As the chief medical officer for Scotland, Catherine Calderwood beams that message into our homes on behalf of the government every single day, however, she has failed to practice what she preaches. Not only is this hypocritical, it is irresponsible and the first minister cannot accept this conduct.“Hundreds of Scots have died and there is no sign of the spread of the virus slowing. The CMO has undermined Scotland’s pandemic response and if she doesn’t offer her resignation the first minister should sack her.”Reporting by PAShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

People who previously struggled with universal credit continue to do so. Rough sleepers and sofa surfers continue to live without shelter. Services that once offered support have shuttered to protect workers, while people are burning through their kitchen cupboards faster than usual because they are stuck inside.\u0026nbspIn short, many of those who have needed to use food banks in the past, those who are not among the government’s 1.5 million most at-risk people and will not be able to call on its swelling volunteer service for support, still need help.\u0026nbspThe Independent’s Help The Hungry campaign aims to help give these people the support they need. Click here for ways you can help.And here are five things you might not have considered to help you to support your community’s food bank.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesA common misconception is that food banks exist to offer the bare minimum – but to do so would be to completely undermine what food can give us in our day to day lives. We don’t only eat for sustenance – we do it for pleasure, to access our cultures, to engage in tradition. Food is central to the human experience, and for millennia has been key to how we experience love and affection.How to support our campaignSo ultimately think about what is going to taste good. Of course you can pick up staples that will be warmly received, but you can also donate things that get you excited, and share that excitement with someone else.Take, for example, Easter eggs. They may not be a matter of life or death, but by donating them you can give a parent the chance to treat their child, and a child the ability to engage in a communal tradition they might have been left out of. You are not just handing out subsistence, but a moment of dignity and joy for a family – and all it took was a bit of chocolate.It’s not just foodFood banks have never been just about food. Poverty is about choices – do you buy something to eat, or put money on the meter to keep the electricity running? Do you really need the heating on, or can you hold out? Will you be hungry now, or hungry later?\u0026nbspAt their most fundamental level, food banks are about a community pulling together and trying to resolve those conflicts – so when you think of donating, empathy is key. On one side of the spectrum, this means not just dredging mystery tins from the back of your cupboard – if you didn’t want to eat it over the last two years, chances are no one else will either. On the other, it’s about thinking of the groceries you couldn’t live without – be that food or something else.In the early days of the UK epidemic, among the first things to be stockpiled were hygiene products – sanitary towels, hand wash, toilet roll. If you didn’t have the ability to bulk buy, or the spare funds to travel from shop to shop by car or public transport, you were stuck. Donating bathroom products means people who use the service don’t have to choose between hunger and hygiene.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe range of reasons people visit food banks is vast, reflecting many of the social issues seen across the country, from universal credit delays to limited post-prison rehabilitation systems, rising rents and jobs that simply do not pay enough to allow for survival.\u0026nbspBut helping rough sleepers and sofa surfers out represents a unique challenge for food banks – particularly those who do not have access to kitchens and so are less likely to feel the benefit of, say, the bag of dry pasta many would receive. While volunteers will build a parcel that helps as much as possible, you can go a step further by putting together boxes of much-needed items that can be handed straight over as is.\u0026nbspAsk if your local service is interested, then get a few shoeboxes and add things that might prove useful – like socks and underwear, first aid kits, compact waterproofs, or toothbrushes and paste. Once again as much as you are donating a small box of odds and ends, you are also handing over dignity, and the tools people need to look after themselves.\u0026nbspBags of bagsFood banks across the country have had to make drastic changes to how they operate due to the virus – while volunteers may have a few contingency plans up their sleeves to keep services running, readying for a global pandemic was not among them.What has followed has been a herculean effort to organise outright change in a matter of days. Entire delivery systems have been dreamt up out of thin air, while the elderly and at risk who make up much of the volunteer base have been sent home.\u0026nbspFood banks strained as volunteers isolate and demand surgesFood banks have never been more needed, or closer to collapseFood banks in crisis as coronvirus panic buying leaves families hungryFood banks are under threat – the government has to step inUnited and City make joint food bank donation to fight coronavirusOperations have also been streamlined to feed as many people as possible, as hygienically as can be achieved. And as every service user’s food is bagged up and handed over, a small mountain of plastic bags are being deployed.So, bizarrely enough, in this time of national crisis, that bag of shopping bags that you and every other UK resident has been keeping in the corner of their kitchen or under their sink for years might finally serve a purpose. After all that time of being stored and neglected after trips to the supermarket, they could be put to use in ensuring social distancing.\u0026nbspAsk your local food bank if they could use them – but if you can go a step further and also feel a little apprehensive about contributing to the impact of plastic on the planet, consider handing over canvas bags instead. There are so many feelings wrapped into asking for help – and when you’ve been let down by the world around you time and time again, one that’s likely to come up is shame.\u0026nbspVolunteers work hard to try to mitigate that – and make the experience about support and community, but it’s easy to feel self-conscious walking away from a food bank and onto the high street with an array of clearly worn and mismatched carrier bags in your hands. A canvas bag, while sturdier, is also more discreet.Possibly the most useful thing you can do for your local food bank is among the easiest – ask what they need. While the Trussell Trust, the nation’s largest food bank charity, helps to set up and support sites, the inidual operation in your region sets its own rules and runs its own show. Others run via other charities or completely independently.\u0026nbspSo check out their tweets to see what they are appealing for, or send them an email to check what they are after, or give them a call and offer up a few hours a week to stack some tins (particularly if you are young, physically fit and don’t mind lugging around crates of produce).\u0026nbspReaching out, at every level, is fundamental to what food banks are. In reaching out you will get the satisfaction that comes from rallying around your community at a time where we’ve perhaps never been more isolated. What the person who comes to ask for food will get, from your contribution combined with others in your area coming together, is help when it’s possible no one else can.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Yet members of the public still able to help are signing up to serve a worthy cause.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMarina Nenadic, 30, is one of a several new recruits at\u0026nbspCity Harvest\u0026nbspin Acton, west London, after the food surplus charity called for more hands to sort through the produce rescued from restaurants, manufacturers and supermarket packing houses.“I’m working from home four days a week, so I had some extra time, and I really wanted to do something useful with it,” she explained. “It’s within walking distance of where I live, so I’m not taking any extra risks with journeys.”How to support our campaignMs\u0026nbspNenadic\u0026nbspis a marketing executive for\u0026nbspKew\u0026nbspGardens, but she now spends at least one day a week creating crates of food packages for the 300 smaller groups – including\u0026nbspfood banks, low-income family projects and homeless shelters – served by City Harvest.“It’s a really positive atmosphere, despite the fact it’s such difficult times. It’s actually quite exciting to see so much food come in, knowing it’s going out to people who need it. It’s been such a rewarding thing to do.”In the first two weeks of the coronavirus lockdown, City Harvest has rescued and redistributed over 130 tonnes of surplus food. Responding to the enormous scale of the crisis, the group has joined forces with even larger food surplus charities in the capital – our campaign partner The Felix Project and Fareshare – to create the\u0026nbspLondon Food Alliance.In a bid to make sure\u0026nbspfood gets out to those who need it\u0026nbspas efficiently as possible, the London Food Alliance is now co-ordinating with all 32 London boroughs to make sure the new, council-run community hubs are well-stocked with supplies.Liz Taylor, 61, signed up for volunteering work at The Felix Project last week, and is now packing and delivering food at\u0026nbspthe charity’s main Park\u0026nbspRoyale\u0026nbspwarehouse.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s actually a bit of relief to get outside and do something. It’s obviously worthwhile, but it’s good for my wellbeing too.”Mohamed Elmi, 34, volunteering with City Harvest for the past 18 months, said some of the Acton-based charity’s few dozen or so new volunteers have recently lost jobs in the hospitality industry.“It’s been a difficult time for them but this gives them a sense of purpose,”\u0026nbspsaid Mr Elmi, who also works full-time for a homeless healthcare charity. “It’s really helped us fill in for some of the volunteers who are having to stay at home. Yes, we’re putting ourselves at risk – but this work is really needed right now.”London mayor Sadiq Khan told The Independent: “The altruism of the British people in recent days has been a beacon of hope amid the darkness of the coronavirus.He added: “You can donate spare food at a series of hubs being set up across the city. If you can afford to, you can donate money directly to help keep the food banks open.

We have teamed up with The Felix Project – a start-up charity we helped launch in 2016 – to deliver produce to community hubs in London boroughs.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Independent is also asking food charities across Britain to contact helpthehungry@ to tell us about your project and help build a directory of ways that our readers can help the hungry in their area – through money, volunteering and food donations. Food banks, which were already struggling to meet the need for emergency food parcels, have seen a huge surge in demand in recent weeks, while at the same time coping with dwindling donations, supermarket rationing systems, and a loss of many volunteers to self-isolation – yet none of the government’s rescue money goes to them.British households have stored more than £1bn worth of goods in their homes in response to the pandemic, creating shortages for food banks as shoppers ignore assurances that supply chains are robust.How to support our campaignJess Phillips, the Labour MP who recently ran for party leader, has backed our campaign, saying: “Nobody should be in the position of not being able to get enough food. In my constituency, London and in places all around the UK the coronavirus pandemic is placing extra stress on a system that was already straining.“We should all do what we can to help food and other essentials get to those that need it. That is why I’m backing the Help the Hungry campaign – please give if you are able.”Pastor Obi Onyeabor, the manager at Barking Foodbank, part of The Trussell Trust’s national network, said his pool of around 50 volunteers has been reduced by a dozen or so people currently self-isolating at home. Yet he and his team have kept their two church hall food banks open, and are now making home deliveries on Tuesdays and Thursdays to make sure the most vulnerable get supplies.“We have been scrambling for the past couple of weeks, doing all that we can – but we’re appealing for more people to come and help,” he said. “Out of fear people have been buying for themselves and their families, but I’ve seen some real generosity too.“I hope that if we can get past the panic buying stage, more people will want to give money, food or some of their time too.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailIn London, charities like The Felix Project donate 10 tons of food – or 22,000 meals – to the needy every day. But funding has dropped since the outbreak of Covid-19, limiting their capacity to carry out vital work at a time when it is more important than ever. As part of the London Food Alliance, along with FareShare and City Harvest, The Felix Project will coordinate deliveries in London boroughs in order to distribute surplus food to the elderly, poor and vulnerable. The charities will deliver food to the hubs, where local volunteers will package up parcels and arrange “last-mile” deliveries to the homes of the vulnerable.Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, has backed our campaign to help in the capital in partnership with our sister title the Evening Standard. He said: “In a city as prosperous as London, everyone should have enough food to feed themselves and their families – but unfortunately the coronavirus outbreak means some Londoners are facing even greater difficulties. It’s commendable these organisations are joining forces to help ensure surplus food isn’t wasted and instead reaches those who need it most. I urge Londoners to support this crucial initiative.”Mark Curtin, CEO of The Felix Project, said: “Our role is to pick up large volumes of nutritious surplus food from the commercial sector and deliver it to community hubs to ensure there is enough food for vulnerable people for as long as this health crisis ensues. We will be working all hours doing our bit – and it would be wonderful if your readers can get behind us so we can do this job for London.”Emma Revie, chief executive of The Trussell Trust, which supports 1,200 food banks, appealed for help from the public to get vital food to people who cannot afford the basics, and to boost volunteer numbers in areas where they are needed.“Our main priority as coronavirus unfolds is ensuring the safety of everyone who comes to a food bank – whether it’s someone needing help, someone volunteering their time, or someone making a donation,” said Ms Revie. “Until we are confident that adequate government protection against poverty is in place, food banks provide an essential community service to people unable to afford food. But this should not fall to food banks.“Our benefits system could be the life raft people need now. That’s why it’s more important than ever that we end the five-week wait for universal credit. While incredible food bank volunteers continue to help people unable to afford the basics, we would ask our government to take this essential step and end the five-week wait now. It’s five weeks too long.”Sabine Goodwin, coordinator of the Independent Food Aid Network UK, which oversees 834 independent food banks, said the charitable services were “struggling to stay above water” in the current climate and accused the government of so far “failing to act” to prevent an ever-increasing number of people falling into poverty.“Food bank use was rising before the coronavirus outbreak and the impact of job losses can only make matters far worse. But this catastrophe in the making is avoidable,” she said. “We’re calling for an income-based solution to this crisis which would mean that the Herculean efforts by volunteers across the country wouldn’t be needed.“FareShare, the UK’s biggest food redistribution charity, is also calling for more volunteers to help with packing and making van deliveries. The organisation takes food from the food manufacturers that can’t be sold in shops, either because of packaging errors or overproduction, and gets it out to food banks, hospices, homeless hostels and other charities.Commercial director Alyson Walsh estimates around 1,200 people have got in touch over the past week. “We have quite a lot of older volunteers who have had to stay at home, but we are now seeing a wave of interest in new people willing to fill in.”Ms Walsh added: “We know we have the capacity to do more – we have the warehouse\u0026nbspspace and the chillers. But the government needs to help the food industry do more in terms of all the bagging and boxing and delivery of food that needs to be done.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

And we have to remember that every number is a family shaken to its foundation,” he said.He added: “Our willingness to come together like this as a nation has been lying dormant for too long. When millions of us stepped out onto our doorsteps to applaud the carers, visibly moved, there was hope of a better future. In times like this, we need good government, a government that saves lives and protects our country.“It’s a huge responsibility and whether we voted for this government or not, we all rely on it to get this right. That’s why in the national interest the Labour Party will play its full part.“Under my leadership we will engage constructively with the government, not opposition for opposition’s sake. Not scoring party political points or making impossible demands. But with the courage to support where that’s the right thing to do.“But we will test the arguments that are put forward. We will shine a torch on critical issues and where we see mistakes or faltering government or things not happening as quickly as they should we’ll challenge that and call that out.”Sir Keir also said he was “sorry” on behalf of the Labour Party for the “stain” that antisemitism had brought on the party in recent years after allegations that have plagued the party under Mr Corbyn’s leadership. “I will tear out this poison by its roots and judge success by the return of Jewish members and those who felt that they could no longer support us,” he added.Former leader Mr Corbyn, who had appeared with Ms Long-Bailey in her campaigning videos, also congratulated Sir Keir on his election victory. “Being Labour Party leader is a great honour and responsibility,” he said. “I look forward to working with Keir and Angela to elect the next Labour government and transform our country”.In a statement, defeated candidate Ms Long-Bailey said Sir Keir will be a “brilliant prime minister and I can’t wait to see him in No 10”, adding: “I will do all I can to make that a reality and to ensure the Labour Party gets into government with a transformative agenda at the next election.”Who will be in Starmer’s shadow cabinet?The left-wing group Momentum – set up to support Mr Corbyn’s radical, left-wing policy agenda in 2015 – said the organisation looks forward to working with him, but also pledged to hold him to account in the coming months and years.“His mandate is to build on Jeremy’s transformative vision, and this means appointing a broad shadow cabinet who believe in the policies and will work with members to make them a reality,” they added. “In this new era Momentum will play a new role. We’ll hold Keir to account and make sure he keeps his promises, champion big ideas like the Green New Deal, build the power of Labour members and do everything we can to get a Labour government elected.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

And that’s why we have been asking people to stay at home during this pandemic.From this evening I must give the British people a very simple instruction - you must stay at home.If you don’t follow the rules the police will have the powers to enforce them, including through fines and dispersing gatherings.MPs have revealed lockdown could end by June, with officials expected to stagger the dates for when workers, areas and the immune are able toto relative normality.Civil servants have been asked to draw up a list of options, but only once hospital admissions have dropped.It follows after Treasury officials warned the Government that they would not be able to stop normally successful businesses from going underthe lockdown went beyond June.Boris Johnson originally announced that these measures are in place for three weeks and they will be reviewed afterwards.The plan to reduce the spread of the highly contagious virus through social distancing like that seen in Europe since early March, will hopefully reduce cases and the pressure on our medical staff and NHS.Theof the lockdown will depend on how the UK responds to the measures and they will be reviewed around April , which is the Easter bank holiday Monday.But Deputy chief medical officer Dr Jenny Harries has told the nation that restrictions could remain for the next six months.If coronavirus cases and deaths drop, the lockdown could be lted when its next reviewed.While they will be reviewed in mid-April, the police currently have the power to enforce these measures for six months.Residents are only now allowed to leave their homes for one of four essential reasons:Johnson said: You should not be meeting friends. If your friends ask you to meet, you should say No.You should not be meeting family members who do not live in your home.You should not be going shopping except for essentials like food and medicine - and you should do this as little as you can. And use food delivery services where you can.If you don’t follow the rules the police will have the powers to enforce them, including through fines and dispersing gatherings.Home Secretary Priti Patel announced that for a first offence, the fine will be £and for a second offence it will be £ .These fines will double with each offence.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.The PM has ordered the closure of all non-essential shops, but he can ask businesses to do the same as well and stop people from going to work.Public transport also remains open to help key workers such as doctors and nurses but schedules have been cut back.Spain, Italy and France have been in national lockdown for a lot longer than the United Kingdom with those three countries badly affected by coronavirus.Italy has now banned all movement inside their country and closed non-essential businesses as the spread of coronavirus continues.This comes after  people died in the country on Saturday, March , and  more the following day in a frightening weekend.France went into lockdown on March  with police currently patrolling the streets to ensure people only leave their homes for essential reasons.Spain is in a state of emergency and has called for non-essential workers to stay at home for  days from Monday, March .There are tough restrictions in place in badly-effected areas such as Madrid with all educational institutions forced to close.Unlike in the UK, where people are allowed to exercise freely, this is not the case in these three Mediterranean countries.French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said: Going out to take the children for a walk or for physical exercise must be within a distance of one kilometre maximum of your home, for one hour, and obviously alone, once a day.In Spain, residents are only allowed outside for shopping or to walk dogs while in Italy all parks have been closed and people can only exercise around their homes.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He hasn’t thought it through no matter how many chins of mine he might think he can sht, it ain’t worth spilling perfectly good lager or ales.Nevertheless,that hyperactive chancer can unite the nation, then someone like me who doesn’t go at ramming-speed the whole time can surely help. He’s the hare, I’m the tortoise.But what this is all about is morale. Morale is important: it’s the key component of any battle and that’s what we are in the middle of right now.And as we near the end of our second week in national solitary confinement, I imagine tempers may be fraying, time might be hanging heavy, maybe the way you’re rubbing along has got you chafing a bit: I know I am, I gave up bathing last weekend, I’m on my own, who cares what I smell like.So, here’s a cut out and loose guide to how to keep your morale up and avoid those moments which lord knows you’ll regret, because it’s not like you can go down the pub and moan to your mates about what happened.Dishwasher stacking disputes. You think the knives should point up not down.The amount of times people can fall out over this sort of simple day-to-day admin in normal le is something I’ve heard from my regular drinkers time and time again, so no doubt in lockdown-land this one is raging all day, every day.You know what: forget it. It ain’t worth it. Simply rule yourself out of stacking or emptying the dishwasher – problem solved.Deciding what to watch on the TV. We live in an age of a billion channels and nothing to watch. And they’re not making any more TV either: even Eastenders could grind to a halt. Yes that’s how serious this whole thing is. So whoever has control of the TV rules the roost.The remote is the key to this problem. Seize control: seeing as you aren’t going anywhere or doing anything, superglue the remote to the hand you use the least and retain control of the TV.This may seem extreme but it’ll simply mean there’s one great big argument when you reveal what you’ve done, rather than the long slow drip drip drip of anger about your third week of watching Homes Under The Hammer.Ironing and or folding the laundry. Ironing, for some, is a % flash point. This is how the argument runs. You leave something out to dry, then some thoughtless Herbert chucks it all in a laundry basket in a heap and you have to iron it.Immediately a row ensues about why there’s no need to iron tracksuit bottoms anyway and remember the time you burned that nylon shirt because you had the iron on too hot you idiot.Compromise. Now here’s the thing. It’s not like you’ve got anywhere to be. It’s not like your glad rags are going to get any attention over the next few days.Maybe you’re a slave to fashion and were looking forward to moving from your spring to your summer wardrobe. Whatever that means. But there is no need to iron stuff right now. None. Zero.So put the iron down. Unless of course, it’s something you like doing to calm the nerves, pass the time, inject some sense of order into what is currently a formless existence. In other words, let the ironer iron. But onlytotally necessary. Remember, in the end would you rather be right or happy  And the answer to that is happy. Unless of course what makes you happy is being right. But you get my point.And remember, chins up Britain, all of them.Hats off to all the people who two weeks ago were panicking and spreading rumours about the army being deployed.During the fortnight these Scary Maries were crying into their soda waters about imminent martial law the army quietly got on with setting up a brand-new hospital. Give yourselves a round of applause, you s.Oh yeah you all bought bog roll, but judging by the towpath by the canal none of you bought poo bags for your dogs.SORT IT!Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And we have a National Health Service to look after those who need care.A mobilisation never before seen in peacetime is under way across our health service and beyond. In the NHS our dedicated staff are pulling out all the stops to treat the patients we have and prepare for the surge we know is coming.We are now looking after more than , patients in hospital with confirmed coronavirus — a staggering increase compared with just a few weeks ago.That is more coronavirus patients than the number of hospitalised heart attack, stroke and cancer patients combined.And in a matter of weeks hospitals have managed to free up a further , beds, a third of all those normally available, for future patients with coronavirus.Of course, most patients the health service is continuing to look after have some condition other than coronavirus.And it is important that other patients still come forward for the urgent and emergency care they need without delay.Increasing our critical care capacity for those who are sickest is a top priority.And we are setting up new hospitals at a rate never seen before.The new NHS Nightingale in London is the most visible example of the extraordinary effort that is under way to tackle coronavirus.The NHS has joined forces with the military to achieve in days what normally takes years.More such hospitals are in train across the country — in Bristol, in Yorkshire, in Birmingham and in Manchester. I hope they won’t be needed, but we’re building them in case they are.They are an insurance policy in case the surge plans at existing hospitals are not enough.But these new facilities and kit are nothing without the staff that make the NHS what it is today — the institution our nation rightly holds most dear.More than , former nurses, doctors and other NHS staff have heeded the call to re-enlist for the battle against coronavirus.And many thousands of student nurses and medical students will be putting their skills and education into practice early as part of the enormous effort that is under way to save more lives.But the NHS cannot win this war alone. Companies and the Government are now pulling together to get us the extra equipment and supplies the NHS needs. British manufacturers are retooling production lines to turn out protective kit for doctors, nurses and other staff, giving their all on the front line.Commercial rivalries are being put aside as firms co-operate to develop new ventilators and other vital supplies.Labs are expanding their testing capacity, so NHS staff knowthey can safely get back to work.The public are backing our staff at this time of enormous pressure.I know how much it means to the nurses, doctors, therapists, cleaners, pharmacists, paramedics and countless others giving their all to fight coronavirus that the whole nation is behind them in this battle.The support of Sun readers will help sustain them in the days and weeks ahead.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today here thesun whocareswinsappealSo on behalf of the NHS, a thank you too to The Sun, for throwing its weight behind the Clap for Carers campaign to give NHS heroes the recognition they deserve.But the practical actions that iniduals and families take in the weeks ahead will also make all the dference.As other countries have shown, no health service in the world could cope with the number of patients who would need treatmentbetween us we failed to slow the spread of coronavirus.That is why the Government’s measures to stop people meeting and passing on the virus are so important.Nobody is finding this easy — whether it is missing a drink with friends in the pub, Sunday lunch with the family or uncertainty over jobs and wages this epidemic has created for so many.There are early signs this is working but this is a marathon not a sprint. What we need to remember is that right now every single one of us can be a le-saver just by following the medical advice.Every time you wash your hands you could keep someone off of a ventilator. Over the coming weeks, by staying at home you save lives. It’s as simple and as profound as that.

Since Boris Johnson declared the lockdown restrictions on our lives, officers have been accused by some of being overzealous enforcing them.They have tried to stop some shops selling Easter eggs because they consider them non-essential.A cop was also filmed threatening to fine a bakery owner for putting chalk on the pavement outside her shop to maintain social-distancing.Meanwhile, the Derbyshire force dyed black the Blue Lagoon swim spot in a disused Buxton quarry to deter groups from gathering there — and sent out drones to spy on walkers in the middle of nowhere.Road blocks have been set up to check motorists and cyclists are on essential journeys.Last weekend officers were also breaking up groups of more than two people on park benches, and football matches in parks.All of which could seem a tad heavy-handed.So you can see why some people are indignant, especially given the absence of clearer official guidance.Perhaps it is this lack of clarity that is partly the issue.Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said in a recent daily press conference that police should use common sense in applying the rules and that the public should follow the guidance not just to the letter but also the spirit.The real issue, though, is some people’s inability to follow the very basic instruction to stay at home unless they really need to go out.If people were not disregarding this advice, police would not have to enforce it.Officers do need to be careful, though.We are willing to social-distance for the greater good but only as long as it is necessary — and will not tolerate it for a minute longer.We are not a police state and the police must be mindful of being too heavy-handed.So while shouting at someone for buying an Easter egg is ridiculous and using a drone to terrorise a lone dog walker does seem extreme, someone has to break up the cretins who are having barbecues or parties in high-density residential areas, right I do despair over the attitude of those mindless idiots who are still having parties and getting drunk together.Then there are the twits going to DIY shops to buy paint, which is hardly essential.People, this is not an extended Bank Holiday.

This is nowhere near good enough.As Boris Johnson croaked from his sick bed, mass testing among the general population is the ONLY way out of this national purgatory.But at the moment we do not even have widespread testing among our NHS workers.Right now we are letting down those selfless doctors, nurses and health carers.On Thursday night at pm, my street in North London resounded to the sound of grateful clapping for our carers.But as our frontline health workers start to die, they need more than a weekly standing ovation.They need us to understand that the lockdown rules apply to us all.Lucy Hutchings, , is a nurse caring for coronavirus patients in Southampton.In a Facebook post, shared , times, she wrote it is “devastating” to see so much suffering when there are still people not following simple rules about staying home, staying safe and protecting the NHS.“I’m scared, everybody I work with is scared,” wrote Lucy, her face etched with exhaustion after another gruelling -hour sht.“The quicker people stay indoors, the quicker it will be over.“I’d like to stay at home but I can’t, so for people to go against the rules is so stupid and irresponsible.“I keep myself away from my mum, dad and brother because I don’t want to pass the virus on. It’s a hard thing to do.”Lucy’s face should haunt us all.Remember it every time some thick-as-mince footballer wraps his expensive motor around a lamppost.Remember Lucy’s face every time you see people who think social isolation rules do not apply to them.Remember Lucy’s faceyou want to understand what a long way we have to go before we truly start supporting the NHS.Yes, it is hard for a people raised in freedom to obey these restrictive rules.But NOBODY has a harder job right now than those NHS workers who are risking their lives in under-equipped, overcrowded hospitals that are being pushed to breaking point and beyond.The health crisis is unprecedented in our letime but the Government cannot keep cocking it up.The NHS does not have the kit it needs, the testing it needs, the support it needs.Health Secretary Matt Hancock promises , coronavirus tests a day by the end of April.If Hancock does not deliver, get shot of him.Because right now, that “Protect the NHS” slogan is looking heartbreakingly empty.All foreign NHS workers who are out there now fighting on the frontline deserve British passports.If these foreign heroes are good enough to risk their lives to save our lives, then they have earned the right to stay in the UK for ever.CLAUDIA Schfer tells Elle magazine that at the height of her supermodel glory days she felt like a rock star.

Why the hell not As Iceland boss Richard Walker says: “We have spoken to the Government about this.“My hands are still tied with these archaic Sunday trading laws.“This is a moment of national crisis and we need our shops open.”When the current three weeks of lockdown ends next week, it will inevitably be extended.This will be a bitter pill for everyone in lockdown Britain.Scrapping the Sunday trading laws would make it easier to swallow.PRINCE William wants toto his air ambulance duties.Meanwhile, Prince Harry scuttles off to Los Angeles in the last private jet out of Canada before the borders closed.And the tragedy is that Harry would have been brilliant during our national emergency.Harry was born for mucking in, raising spirits and doing his bit.Can you imagine the reaction Harry would have got in an overstretched NHS hospital  What a waste.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

When we do we must be candid about it and learn from it.Last night one source accused the doctor — who took the Hippocratic Oath to protect patients — of “dangerous double standards”.Scotlands Chief Constable Iain Livingstone said today in a statement: Local officers visited Dr Catherine Calderwood and spoke to her about her actions, reiterated crucial advice and issued a warning about her future conduct, all of which she accepted.The legal instructions on not leaving your home without a reasonable excuse apply to everyone.Dr Calderwood yesterday said there were “reasons” for what she did but that they did not justy her weekend visit.She said: “I wish to apologise unreservedly for the issue reported in the media today.“While there are reasons for what I did, they do not justy it and they were not legitimate reasons to be out of my home.“While I and my family followed the guidance on social distancing at all times, I understand that I did not follow the advice I am giving to others, and I am truly sorry for that.“I know how important this advice is and I do not want my mistake to distract from that.Sturgeon added: Over the past few weeks, as we have been dealing with this crisis, her advice and expertise has been invaluable to me.It comes days after SNP bosses called for powers to stop second home owners travelling to rural areas.A source had slammed Calderwoods decision, saying: “Either we are in lockdown or not  I’m pretty sure government advice is to stay at home and not to travel to second holiday homes.“But Catherine Calderwood isn’t following the advice. She and her family are potentially bringing the virus to the area.”Wearing a turquoise jacket, Dr Calderwood looked like she didn’t have a care in the world as she walked with her family and dogs near her bolthole on Saturday.But locals in the quiet coastal town hit out over the seemingly unnecessary trip, which came after a working week in Edinburgh where she spoke at daily pandemic press briefings alongside First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.Residents accused her of failing to heed her own government’s advice that people with second properties should stay at home to protect rural communities during the outbreak.The source said Dr Calderwood was one of several other high-flyers from Edinburgh who had second properties in the area and were putting locals at risk.One onlooker told The Scottish Sun on Sunday: “They were going for a walk with the dogs. It’s weird.“I thought she lived in Edinburgh and that we were supposed to stay home — but this place is miles away.”On Thursday, Dr Calderwood shared a photo of her family outside her capital home taking part in the national Clap for Carers event.The image was posted as millions ventured on to their doorsteps to applaud our NHS heroes and care workers.But while they are helping save lives, who is there to help them The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealThe snap was taken in the driveway of her upmarket West End home — said to be worth around £.million.Under the hashtag ‘clap for NHS’, the health bigwig told her , followers: “My family clapping my NHS and care colleagues — and me! Thank you all.”The following day the Cambridge and Glasgow Universities graduate attended an official Scottish Government press call where she delivered crucial public health advice alongside Ms Sturgeon.But the mum of three has now angered locals after she was seen walking her dogs with her husband and children across the golf course and heading towards the beach in picturesque Earlsferry, where she has a cosy bungalow.Dr Calderwood has given regular press conferences on the Covid- pandemic at St Andrew’s House in Edinburgh where she has repeatedly urged the public to stay within their homes.This weekend’s trip comes just days after Nats chiefs called for emergency powers to stop second-home owners self-isolating in rural areas, including the Highlands.MP Ian Blackford said legislation should be used to protect areas with less health infrastructure from visitors trying to flee the coronavirus.He spoke out after a number of communities reacted angrily as tourists blocked lay-bys and swamped camping areas.Mr Blackford, the SNP’s leader at Westminster, said: “With Easter almost upon us it is worth reminding everyone of the emergency powers that restrict non-essential travel.“That means no tourists should be coming to the Highlands and Islands.“If anyone owns a second or holiday home they should not be using the Highlands to self-isolate and powers exist and must be used to stop this.”Similar warnings have also been issued in England and Wales.UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock said he did not consider people going to their holiday homes as an essential trip during the crisis.His plea followed concerns that rural health services could be overwhelmed by those leaving cities who then end up suffering from Covid-.Mr Hancock said: “We’ve said that people should not take unnecessary journeys, no unnecessary travel and I don’t regard going to your holiday home as a necessary journey.”Today it was revealed that a further  people have died from coronavirus in Scotland, bringing the total number of deaths to .The UK-wide total increased to almost ,.The latest deaths including a child aged just five — the youngest UK victim so far.The Scottish Government said , people had now tested positive for the virus, an increase of  from Friday.In total, , patients have been tested across the country.We told how people are now only permitted to leave their homesthey have “reasonable excuse”.This includes work that cannot be carried out at home, shopping for food and medical supplies and an hour of daily exercise.In the six days since new legislation was introduced, police officers have been forced to issue  fixed penalty notices to people who have chosen to ignore the measures.Belfast-born Dr Calderwood has pleaded with Scots to stay at home to protect the NHS and “help save lives” — including on TV and radio ads and at daily press briefings on the pandemic with Ms Sturgeon.The health chief is a trained consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist.She is also a member of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and is an honorary Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh.When asked to explain the official view on travelling to a second home tonight, a Scottish Government spokesman said: “We strongly advise against any travel to second homes.“It runs the risk of adding pressure to services in more remote and quieter areas, from food supply to health care.”The Scottish Sun on Sunday then asked why the Chief Medical Officer was ignoring official advice.An SNP Government spokesman replied: “Since this start of this epidemic, the CMO has been working seven days a week preparing Scotland’s response.“She took the opportunity this weekend to check on a family home in Fe as she knows she will not be back again until the crisis is over.“She stayed overnight before ing to Edinburgh. In line with guidance she stayed within her own household group and observed social distancing with anyone she was in passing in the village.oliver.norton@the-sun"},{"url":null,"title":"why is keir starmer sir knighthood","story":"Heres everything you need to know.The labour leaders official title is Sir Keir Starmer, but he prefers people not to use it.He told the Ham  High newspaper that he has never liked titles.He said: When I was DPP, everyone called me director and I said, Please dont call me director, call me Keir Starmer.

As a smoker,I get coronavirus, am I more likely to get seriously ill A. There is some evidence that smokers are more prone to severe consequences of the virus than others.You probably don’t feel like quitting right now, but on the other hand it has never been a better time.Q. I had a chest infection and a sore throat a month ago. I had antibiotics but I still have a sore throat and am coughing a bit. I don’t want to bother my GP. What can I do A. You have to ride this out.There is a slight chance you may have had coronavirus a month ago but since we cannot test at the current time you cannot know.Lots of dferent viruses and bugs can cause such continuing symptoms and the good news is you no longer need to self-isolate.Although you do need to stay at home as much as possible and practice physical distancing.Q. How can you tell the dference between coronavirus and a regular virus A. One of the problems is that you can’t.In the early stages it can mimic other respiratory infections.Until we have more widespread testing we don’t know how prevalent the virus is, which is one of the issues which makes treating this virus such a challenge.Q. Is it correct that a substance has been found that blocks the entry of coronavirus to cells A. Sadly, no.We are striving to develop an effective vaccine as fast as possible.Q. Will warmer weather kill off coronavirus A. While humidity and temperature is known to affect the normal seasonal flu viruses, corona-virus behaves dferently.Its consequences can be seen around the world in both warm and colder countries.Q. My -year-old daughter feels a bit breathless and says her chest is tight, but there is no cough or fever. Should we worry A. Is she anxious Has she had these symptoms before Anxiety can often affect breathing.If she really is finding it hard to breathe, is breathing rapidly and cannot hold her breath for more than a few seconds or so, she should call or go to NHS  online for further guidance.Q. My partner has a duodenal ulcer, a hiatus hernia and Barrett’s oesophagus. Is he vulnerable A. These conditions are not thought to make people more vulnerable to coronavirus and he is not classed in the “vulnerable” group.They might make him cough but it is only a new dry, persistent cough that might suggest that he could’ve picked up the virus.So that is what he ought to look out for.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

and Covid- attacks the respiratory system, health officials say.They also point to a small but highly impactful survey from China which finds that smokers with Covid- are  times more likely to develop severe disease.The study looked at the factors which led to the progression of Covid- pneumonia in patients at three hospitals in Wuhan, China -

show an advert was put out on December .WIV is the most advanced laboratory of its kind in mainland China, and is the first to have biosafety level four - the highest warning level in the research of diseases.The job ad posted on December  calls for scientists to join their team researching new viruses in bats and the infectiousness of coronaviruses.China notied the World Health Organisation they were dealing with a mystery new coronavirus seven days later on December .It comes as British security sources confirmed they were “no longer discounting” the theory the new coronavirus may have accidentally leaked from one of the two labs in Wuhan.Meanwhile another ad, posted on November  looks for a researcher to help analyse the viral outbreaks to “reduce the harm caused by infectious diseases in humans”.And a third on November , looks for a scientist to join the team to analyse how bats can carry coronaviruses without developing a disease.The earliest known cases of the new coronavirus are known to have emerged in December, but one report claims patient zero may have been a -year-old man on November .The lab is known to have been active in research into coronaviruses, and previously led research into Sars - which killed  people in an outbreak in .WIV’s job intriguing adverts were first pointed out by documentary filmmaker Matthew Tye in a YouTube video with .million views as of April .Mr Tye, who has lived in China for over  years, has almost , subscribers and has been regularly uploading videos about living in the country for seven years.The video is titled “I Found The Source of Coronavirus” - but the scientic community have still expressed doubt over the leak theory.The recruitment notices to probe coronaviruses in bats however are veried and are still listed on WIV’s Chinese language website, which is currently active and posting updates about their work as recently as April .WIV is known for its research into coronavirus and bats, so it is possible the adverts may be coincidental.Consensus is currently that coronavirus originated in animals and then jumped to humans - most likely at a wet market in Wuhan.But questions are being asked about the virus, and the lab, amid accusations of a lack of transparency from China’s ruling Communist Party.China has dismissed speculation about the origin of the virus as baseless, and WIV has also hit back at any allegation linking them to the coronavirus.WIV is a £million institute which opened its current high security lab in  after ten years of construction.It is a member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, which is controlled by the government in Beijing.The state-run People’s Daily newspaper also boasted in  that the lab was capable of conducting experiments with “highly pathogenic microorganisms”.Unveried local claims have suggested workers at the lab became infected by coronavirus after being sprayed with blood, and then carried in infection into the local population.The December  advert informs applicants they will be reporting to Shi Zhengli, who is known as Bat Woman, and is considered an authority on coronaviruses.She has angrily rebuffed claims her lab may have played a role in the outbreak, but did admit she “lost sleep” over the consideration.Ms Zhengli swore on her le that the virus did not come from WIV.She blamed the viruss spread on “nature punishing the human race for keeping uncivilized living habits”.The researcher has told those claiming the virus came from her lab to “shut their stinking mouths”.WIV has since the outbreak been part of the fight against the coronavirus, and were the first to publicly link the virus to bats.Coronavirus has spread around the world, infecting almost .million people and killing more than ,.It is known to have originated in China, and politicians around the world have accused the Communist Party of attempting to cover-up the early stage of the virus.A doctor who first warned about the virus was threatened by police, and then last month Chinese officials suggested the US military may have been responsible for coronavirus.China now claims it has weathered the virus storm, and on Saturday mourned victims with a three minute silence as it positions itself as a world leader amid the pandemic.British government sources however yesterday revealed security services are now considering a leak from a Wuhan lab as a potential source for the outbreak, reported The Mail on Sunday.A source on the Cobra committee said: “Perhaps it is no coincidence that there is that laboratory in Wuhan. It is not discounted.”The source added however they did not dispute the virus was “zoonotic” - meaning it originated in animals.Downing Street has said it “does not recognise” the claims made by the source.Pressure is now ratcheting up on China to come clean, and clary what -any - part the Wuhan labs played during the outbreak.Despite denying any leak, China has issued new laws that call for facilities to ensure “biological safety” and improve management of viruses.A leak from a Chinese lab led to an outbreak of Sars that killed one person and infected nine others in .The Chinese government confirmed it was an accident due to negligence and added that five officials were punished.Scientists agree that conspiracy theories suggesting coronavirus is a bio-weapon created in an experiment are nonsense - but a lab accident with an existing disease has not yet been ruled out.Biosecurity researcher Richard Ebright, a professor at the Waksman Institute of Microbiology, said the coronavirus behind the pandemic was . per cent similar to a bat virus discovered by the Wuhan Institute of Virology in  and studied at the nearby Wuhan Centre for Disease Control .The WCDC is another lab in the city, which is even just a stone’s throw from the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market - which has been linked as a possible origin for the coronavirus pandemic.Professor Ebright said: “Bat coronaviruses are collected and studied by laboratories in multiple parts of China — including Wuhan Municipal CDC and Wuhan Institute of Virology.Therefore, the first human infection also could have occurred as a laboratory accident.The expert claims coronaviruses were not studied at the top biosafety level at the Wuhan lab.And when talking about WIV back in , he questioned how safe the lab will be while speaking to the publication Nature - citing the previous leaks of Sars where in China.He raised the question of a lab worker being infected with a virus by a live specimen in the same article, but cited monkeys rather than bats.The Chinese embassy in London has previously hit back at speculation about the origin of the virus - saying it “disregards the tremendous efforts and huge sacrice of China and its people”.In a statement yesterday, a spokesman said: ““There has been no scientic or medical conclusion yet on the origin of Covid-, as relevant tracing work is still underway.“The WHO has made repeated statements that what the world is experiencing now is a global phenomenon, the source is undetermined, the focus should be on containment and any stigmatizing language referring to certain places must be avoided.”WIV has also directly responded to reports about its links to Covid-, and the Chinese government cracked down on “rumor mongering”.Lab officials said the reports had “received close attention from all walks of le” and “caused great harm to our research staff on the front line of scientic research” back in FebruaryThey added staff had been working around the clock since the end of  to trace the source of the coronavirus and improve detection rates - adding the theories seriously interfered with their efforts.But while they are helping save lives, who is there to help them The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealA senior US State Department official said questions need to be answered about WIV, reports the Washington Times.The official said it is “valid” to ask whether or not coronavirus may have leaked from the lab.Dr Robert G.

But already people are beginning to think about what the world might look like once the crisis has passed. The Mirror spoke with experts on what they think the future will look look like once the lockdown has lted.  Retail Retail Champion Clare Bailey Smaller businesses in our high streets have been required to close for the immediate future. It is a worrying time for business owners but government support should help. People are already planning for recovery, and a post-crisis surge, when people flood back to pubs, restaurants and shops. Businesses need to start maximising the opportunity to turn footfall into sales. The enforced digital transformation will help smaller businesses in the longer term. Perhaps a positive outcome will be people falling back in love with their high street – hopefully leading to a greater sense of community and a focus on shopping locally. Our shopping habits will likely have changed fundamentally.We will still enjoy the social element of visiting shops but people will feel more comfortable shopping online, so retailers will almost be forced to offer a seamless online-physical experience. The proportion of sales transacted online is predicted to grow as a result of Covid-. Politics Professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London Tim Bale The Tories are currently riding high in the polls – but it’s more a reflection of our desire to pull together as a nation than anything . Once new Labour leader Keir Starmer is in place and we eventually begin to wonder whether the Government might have handled the coronavirus crisis better than it did, then things could change surprisingly rapidly – especiallyit turns out that a decade of unnecessary and counter- productive austerity made us more vulnerable to Covid- than other countries. It’s also going to be trickier than many Tories imagine to roll back the more supportive and higher spending state they have suddenly created.Indeed, trying too hard to do that could well cost them the next general election. Work GMB Union National Secretary Rehana Azam The people who have stepped up to keep us safe, fed and watered have been our nation’s unsung heroes. I don’t think any of us will look at supermarket workers and couriers the same way again.  We won’t take for granted how food gets to our shelves. And I can’t fathom a world where we’dto treating care workers as unskilled, minimum wage labour. Our carers are looking after the most vulnerable and putting themselves and their families at risk for less than a tenner an hour and £ a weekthey get sick. The flaws in our welfare system and in the lack of money in our public services have been laid bare. You can’t put that genie back in the bottle. Health Royal College of Nursing Chief Executive Donna Kinnair People who give their working lives to the health of others are often shown great appreciation but the public support in recent weeks has been something . Politicians and decision-makers have been fulsome with their praise for nurses too and it’s my job to hold them to it for years to come. England’s NHS had , unfilled jobs and beds being cut before this pandemic began. The staff who keep the lights on deserve a better deal on the other side of this. That goes for their pay, education and training and the tools to do the job.One part of this pandemic’s legacy must be for politicians never again to run services on a shoestring.  International Affairs Director of the British Foreign Policy Group Sophia Gaston Since the EU Referendum, Britain has been struggling to define its role in an increasingly volatile world – with a rising China and the Western alliance under strain, Covid- has only deepened these challenges. China’s mishandling of the early stages of the pandemic has seen its relations with the United States fall to a new low.The European Union also failed to encourage its member states to work together, hoarding its own supplies as Italy fell into crisis. Across the West, nations have turned inwards rather than looking for ways to cooperate.The big challenge will be to once again make the case for openness and connectivity.If the UK is to achieve its vision for “a truly Global Britain”, we will need to lead from the front. Education Education expert Dr Stephen Curran  I don’t think things will be the same ever again in education. On one hand, parents will have learnt how dficult teaching really is and appreciate the role of the teacher, who acts “in loco parentis”, and how teachers make a huge contribution to a child’s development. But because they have home-schooled their own children for a whole term, from now on parents will also scrutinise what teachers are doing more than ever.

For Universal Credit, charities welcomed the rise but said the benefit should be extended to people with savings. Currently you canapost claimyou have £, in the bank.

Marc Francis of the Zacchaeus  Trust said: “If £ a week is what newly-unemployed UC claimants need to live on, then it’s surely what existing claimants need to live on as well.

The newly minted Labour leader has already made some new appointments to his top team. And while some high profile figures from Jeremy Corbyn ’s team will be leaving the front bench, others will be staying put or being moved to dferent jobs. Announcing the first appointments to his Shadow Cabinet, Mr Starmer said: “We are living through a national emergency. Under my leadership, the Labour Party will always act in the country’s interest to save lives and protect livelihoods. That will be the number one priority of my Shadow Cabinet. “We will be a responsible opposition that supports the Government where we believe they are right and challenge them when we believe mistakes are being made.” Here’s the new look Shadow Cabinet in full. Keir Starmer - Leader of the Opposition  The new Labour leader has taken quite decisive action to update Labouraposs top team. Many of Corbynaposs former top lieutenants - including those who were most closely involved in Rebecca Long-Baileyaposs campaign briefing against him - have been shown the door.  Angela Rayner - Deputy Leader and Chair of the Labour Party  Labouraposs new Deputy leader also takes on the role of Chair of the party - combining two roles that have traditionally been seen as key to making Labour a fighting force again. In or a big-promotion: Anneliese Dodds - Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer  Oxford East MP Anneliese Dodds served as Shadow Financial Secretary to the Treasury for nearly three years in Jeremy Corbyn’s team. Before being elected as an MP in , Ms Dodds had been an MEP since . She served on the European Parliamentaposs Committee on Economic and Monetary affairs. Before that she was a lecturer in Public Policy at Kingaposs College London and Senior Lecturer in Public Policy at Aston University, Birmingham. Sheaposs the first woman to be either Chancellor or Shadow Chancellor. Lisa Nandy - Shadow Foreign Secretary  Keir Starmer ’s leadership rival will replace Emily Thornberry as Shadow Foreign Secretary. She was first elected to Parliament in  having worked for homelessness charity Centrepoint and then as senior policy adviser at The Children’s Society. She has been credited as one of the Labour MPs who “gets it” over Brexit, understanding why many Labour supporters in her Greater Manchester seat backed Leave. The half-Indian politician is a member of the Centre for Towns think tank. She quit the frontbench in the aftermath of the Brexit referendum and her attempts to try to break the Brexit deadlock won her plaudits on all sides of the Commons. Nick Thomas-Symonds - Shadow Home Secretary  Another MP promoted from within the frontbench team, Nick Thomas-Symonds has been a Shadow Home Office Minister for security since . Before being elected in , Mr Thomas-Symonds was a commercial barrister. He’s previously served on the Justice Select Committee before joining the Labour frontbench in  as Shadow Pensions Minister. He was later promoted to Shadow Employment Minister before resigning in  to back Owen Smith’s leadership challenge. He’s written books about Clement Attlee and Aneurin Bevan. Rachel Reeves - Shadow Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster  Leeds West MP Rachel Reeves served as Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary for two years under Ed Miliband’s leadership. But she did notfrom maternity leave to the Shadow Cabinet after Jeremy Corbyn was elected leader in . Before being elected in , she was an economist in London and Washington DC. She studied at Oxford and holds a Masters in Economics from the London School of Economics. She joined the Labour Party at the age of . Ms Reeves wrote a biograpghy of Labour politician Alice Bacon, published in . Her younger sister is Lewisham West and Penge MP Ellie Reeves. Jonathan Ashworth - Shadow Secretary of State for Health and Social Care  Jon Ashworth is among the longest-serving members of the Shadow Cabinet, serving as Shadow Health Secretary since October . Before being elected as Leicester South MP at a  by-election, Mr Ashworth worked as an advisor for Gordon Brown. In , Mr Ashworth told of his “shame” and “embarrassment” at being brought up by an alcoholic father. He spoke in Parliament of the trauma of having to care for his dad who was too drunk to buy food or walk him home from school. In the run up to the the  election, a recording of Mr Ashworth was published, in which he criticised Jeremy Corbyn, said he did not believe Labour would win the election and described the situation for colleagues campaigning in the north of England as dire. David Lammy - Shadow Justice Secretary  A key ally of Mr Starmer from the start of his campaign, David Lammy has been an outspoken critic of Jeremy Corbyn and Labour’s stance on Brexit. Mr Lammy is an experienced lawyer, and was called to the Bar after studying Law at the School of Oriental and African Studies and Hard. An accomplished media performer and campaigner, he is a regular on TV screens. The MP for Tottenham, Mr Lammy said Mr Starmer’s win “good news for the country”. The Labour MP also said Angela Rayner would make a “fantastic deputy leader”. John Healey - Shadow Defence Secretary  After years spent as working on Labouraposs Housing policy, Mr Healey gets a big promotion to cover Defence. It is a isive role inside Labour- often having to defend policies like trident renewal which are unpopular inside the party. Mr Healey has been MP for Wentworth and Dearne since . A member of the partyaposs centre-left he was believed to have profound dferences with Jeremy Corbyn on defence and foreign affairs - but focused on his Housing brief and stayed out of public scuffles. Ed Miliband - Shadow Business, Energy and Industrial Secretary  Former leader Ed Miliband s to shadow the role he once held in Government. A passionate advocate for more action on climate change, the ex-Labour leaderapossto the Shadow Cabinet sees himafter a brief stint helping Mr Corbyn before ing to the back benches. A recognisable name, with bags of experience - but isive inside and outside the party after his time at the helm. Former Energy Secretary Mr Miliband, , said: We must all focus on playing our part in the countryaposs response to coronavirus, working with government to help the many businesses and workers who have been so badly hit and need their voice heard. As Keir has said, we cannot go back to business as usual after this crisis. “We will need to reshape our economy, addressing the insecurity many millions of workers face. We must alsoto climate change as the unavoidable long-term issue of our time, including with a recovery based on providing economic justice through a Green New Deal. Jonathan Reynolds - Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary  The former Shadow Economic Secretary gets a big promotion to take on the governmentaposs handling on Welfare. A detailed and wide ranging brief it is somewhere that detailed scrutiny can make a dference between a policy change that can mean le or death for those most in need. Jo Stevens - Shadow Digital, Culture, Media and Sport  Jo Stevens was made Shadow Culture Secretary after former Coronation Street actress Tracy Brabin was sacked. Tipped for a promotion, the Cardf MP now takes on the so called aposMinistry of Funapos. But fights are looming over the future of funding for the BBC and access to free TV licenses for the over s. Bridget Philipson - Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury Steve Reed - Shadow Communities and Local Government Secretary Thangam Debbonaire - Shadow Housing Secretary Jim McMahon - Shadow Transport Secretary Preet Kaur Gill - Shadow International Development Secretary Louise Haigh - Shadow Northern Ireland Secretary Ian Murray - Shadow Scotland Secretary Marsha de Cordova - Shadow Women and Equalities Secretary Andy McDonald - Shadow Employment Rights and Protections Secretary Rosena Allin-Khan - Shadow Minister for Mental Health  The former Sports Minster gets a promotion - but perhaps not as big allies expected. The AE doctor has ed to the frontlines to help in the fight against Covid-. But after finishing second in the Deputy Leadership contest it was perhaps expected that the Tooting MP might get a bigger role.

Labour changed all political calculations by picking a substantial champion just as the coronavirus exposes the dangerous faults of lightweight liar Boris Johnson. Every crisis is an opportunity, and public confidence in the Government’s handling of the cataclysm is fading now that fatalities are mounting and the economy is plummeting. So all political bets are off. As Starmer starts asking questions about slothful Johnson’s “serious mistakes” on tests, masks and ventilators, Labour MP Jo Stevens tells me: “Compared to Boris Johnson, it’s clear Keir Starmer has the Prime Ministerial qualities we are so desperately lacking right now.” Laser-brain Starmer has put Labour back in the game and will forensically scrutinise Conservative incompetence with a focus beyond Jeremy Corbyn. Spending the past fortnight interrogating coronavirus experts and devouring every scrap of information available with the insatiable appetite of a barrister swotting for a high-profile cross-examination, Starmer knows what he’s talking about. ,],totalVotes:,votesToShow:,mentometerId:,publicationId:,callbackUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  status,voteActionUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  vote,closed:,closedMessage:This poll has been closed!,hideResults:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true\" Johnson won’t know what’s hit him when he finally climbs out of his sick bed.

Scotlandaposs chief medical officer, Dr Catherine Calderwood, resigned last night just hours after the First Minister claimed she would stay in post. In a humiliating press conference Dr Calderwood admitted she made a mistake and let people down and cannot justy her visit with her family. She finally resigned late last night saying the scandal had distracted from advice to the public - of which she was the public face. Ms Sturgeon this morning said: I didn’t try to defend what she’d done and I’m not trying to defend what she’d done. But in a clash on ITVaposs Good Morning Britain, the First Minister insisted it had been right to attempt to keep Dr Calderwood in post. She said she had needed continuity of advice in a fast-changing situation. Ms Sturgeon said the medic gave good high quality advice and I also know how hard she’s worked. But GMB host Piers Morgan fumed: I don’t wanna hear it.  Youaposre continuing to tell me what a great hard worker she is - the damage she’s done is potentially incalculable. The ITV host said the press conference was “one of the most embarrassing things I’ve ever had to witness” and the Chief Medical Officer was guilty of appalling hypocrisy.

A team has been tasked with drafting options where restrictions would be lted only when the number of new hospital admissions begins to drop, it is reported. When Boris Johnson announced the lockdown two weeks ago, he said the unprecedented measures would be in place until April  and then reviewed, but no change is expected next week. The death toll has soared amid signs that the infection rate is starting to slow, although the peak of Britainaposs epidemic wonapost come for another two to three weeks. Have you been affected by coronavirus  Email webnews@mirror. The Prime Minister was undergoing tests in hospital as he continues to suffer from Covid- symptoms  days after contracting the new strain of coronavirus. It comes as ministers discuss how and when to ease the lockdown when the number of new hospital admissions begin to fall, the Times reported. Treasury officials had warned thatthe lockdown went beyond June the Government would not be able to prevent profitable industries from going bust. The Treasury has asked health and business civil servants to come up with scenarios for lting the restrictions in stages.  It could be done by region, industrial sector or by expanding the list of key workers, the report added. The exit strategy is expected to include an dramatic increase in community testing. The Government has already pledged to carry out , tests a day by the end of April and it is still committed to its goal of , tests a day. A spokeswoman for No toldthe Government will review the measures after three weeks and it has not set out any further timeline of when the lockdown could end. Downing Street said there is a huge amount of work going on to develop an exit strategy to ease the lockdown. Thereaposs a huge amount of work ongoing on this but itaposs vital that we remain focused on stopping the spread of this disease, the Prime Ministeraposs official spokesman said. And that we donapost lose sight of that now or somehow think we can stop following the guidance. Weaposre at a critical point and itaposs vital that we keep going. In the meantime, Health Secretary Matt Hancock is urging Britons to continue to follow the lockdown and social distancing rules in a bid to curb the spread of the virus. After police broke up picnics and forced sunbathers to move on at parks and beaches during a warm and sunny weekend, Mr Hancock warned that tougher restrictions on outdoor exercise would be imposedpeople continue to flout lockdown rules. The Health Secretary also denied a rt with Chancellor Rishi Sunak amid claims that there have been clashes at the top of Government over the exit strategy. The Chancellor is reportedly pushing for a path to be mapped out towards lting the restrictions to help limit damage to the economy.  New Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has called on the Government to publish its exit strategy so that Britons know what it is, when the restrictions might be lted and what the plan is for economic recovery. Neil Ferguson, a professor at Imperial College in London, said the epidemic was expected to plateau in the next seven to  days. He said cases had to come down to a low point before measures such as increased testing and contact tracing could replace some of the lockdown restrictions. What is the UKaposs exit strategy  Thoughts are turning to how the UK will end its period of lockdown and start the transition back to normal le. No precise exit strategy has yet been formed, though Professor Neil Ferguson, from Imperial College, who is advising the Government, said experts are looking at it in detail this week. Ending the lockdown will rely on a substantial slowdown in the epidemic of Covid- - the so-called flattening the curve - and a downward trend, which has not yet happened in the UK. The number of deaths is also still rising as the UK moves towards the peak of its epidemic, which is expected within the next week to  days.

Will the virus come back  The virus is still out there. Just letting people resume their normal lives all at once will undoubtedly lead to a second wave of coronavirus cases and the re-introduction of severe restrictions. So, the aim is to gradually lt the lid on controls while watching what happens with the spread of Covid- in the community. If cases can be kept to a lower level - and the NHS can cope with them - then restrictions may slowly be lted. This could include a series of short releases, such as lting controls by region or by asking vulnerable people and those most at risk to continue staying at home. It could involve schools reopening or some businesses being allowed to open their doors. What about testing  Experts agree that much more testing is needed to get the UK out of lockdown. At present, the UK has no real grip on how many people are currently infected and what proportion may already be immune to the disease.

It follows reports of arsonists setting fire to masts and theories blaming the virus on mobile phone signals. The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: “The Secretary of State is due to speak with some of the big social media firms later on this week to be very clear about the need to stop the spread of what is a crazed conspiracy theory. “You have seen reports of criminal vandalism against G masts. “People need to understand that by destroying these masts, they’re actually putting lives at risk because these are masts which emergency responders rely upon.” Julian Knight, chair of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport committee said: “To hear that crackpot theories are leading to people attacking phone masts or threatening telecom workers is sickening and it’s clearly time to act. “We’ve called on the Government to work with social media companies to stamp out deliberate attempts to spread fear about COVID- and it is right that they are being called to account for allowing disinformation on their s. “We’re also calling on Ofcom to investigate whether international news organisations are using social media to disseminate state-backed disinformation on COVID- in order to get around UK broadcasting regulation.” Mobile phone masts have in recent days been vandalised and telecoms staff abused in Birmingham in central England and Merseyside in northern England, damaging connectivity at a time when people are relying on it more than ever. An arson attack at a tower in Birmingham owned by BT, Britainaposs biggest telecoms company, caused signicant damage. It provided G, G and G services to thousands of people, but did not have G capability, the company said.

The closure of a majority of tips due to the coronavirus lockdown and social distancing guidelines has resulted in a spate of fly-tipping incidents in recent weeks. In Lancashire alone  waste and recycling centres have shut down, including a number within a short distance of the fly-tipping hotspot shown here on the A. Household items such as furniture and rubbish can be seen alongside hundreds of black bin bags, cardboard boxes and even a tyre. Have you got a coronavirus story  Email webnews@mirror One bag appears to have got stuck on a tree branch as it was lobbed down the sloped bank by one culprit. A large banner reading aposlets scrap fly tippingapos has been hung from a railing on the edge of the lay by to ward potential offenders away. Sarah Lee of the Countryside Alliance said: The images of fly tipping, though horrendous, are an all too familiar sight. It shouldn’t need saying that driving to dump rubbish is not essential travel.  Not only are you committing an offence by littering, but you are also ignoring guidance that has been introduced to stop the spread of this dangerous virus. Fly tipping is defined as the illegal dumping of items. Anyone found guilty of doing it could face a £ fixed penalty notice or an unlimited fine. However, according to the Countryside Alliance, only one in  incidents lead to a prosecution. Between  and  there were more than one million instances of fly tipping in England, with clean-ups costing between £million and £million.  A Burnley Council spokesman said the authority is working with Lancashire County Council and other partners to find a safe and effective way of removing this waste. They added: Itaposs beyond belief that someone could destroy our beautul countryside without a thought or a care for the devastating impact this kind of mindless behaviour has. This is flytipping on an industrial scale and must have taken several trips to complete. There is no excuse for this selfish, criminal act. If anyone has any information on who is responsible for this outrageous act we want to hear from you so we can catch and prosecute them.  Sarah Lee of the Countryside Alliance added: To make serious headway, we need to understand the business of illegal waste disposal and the culture that abets it. Fly-tipping, as most know it, has developed over the years.

It was just the fth time in her -year reign that she has addressed the nation in this way, and a huge amount of planning went into the historical speech. It was filmed at Windsor Castle, where the Queen has been self-isolating with her husband Prince Philip, and a mammoth undertaking was needed to facilitate the unprecedented statement. Before the recording the Queen sought her personal doctorsapos advice, which was strictly followed to mitigate any risk to the monarch or others at the castle. Sources with knowledge of the recording suggested the logistics and planning had been made “particularly dficult” due to the nationwide lockdown and fears over the risks to the Queen’s health after she entered isolation on government advice. The video message was recorded by a lone cameraman, who was dressed from head to toe in the same personal protective equipment worn by doctors and nurses treating infected patients.  The White Drawing Room was specically chosen as it allowed appropriate distance between those involved at all times. The Queen wrote the speech with the help of her private secretary Sir Edward Young, who is one of her most trusted aides. A source said: Her Majesty wanted to make particular reference to her very first broadcast in , when she was just a young girl who had been evacuated from Buckingham Palace as Nazi bombs rained down on London. The Queen must have felt it quite pertinant that the coronavirus crisis, which has kept so many away from their family and friends, had drawn parallels with her own experience of living through the war as an evacuee.She worked closely with Number  on her speech, and care was taken to ensure the timing of her important message was right.

Taken together, the grieving process, long hours and the fear of dying has left medical staff in Italy struggling to continue. Professor Francesco Castelli, director of the Infectious Diseases Unit at one hospital in Brescia, Lombardy, described the psychological impact the work was having. Have you got a coronavirus story  Email webnews@mirror  We were asking each other: aposwho will be the next apos and that of course is psychologically demanding because apart from colleagues, we are friends, he told Sky News. The mayor of Bresica, where  medical staff have been infected in one hospital, called for support from health care professionals. Many intensive care beds there now lie empty due to a lack of staff able to care for patients. The mental toll on doctors and nurses working in Bresica and where in Italy is made worse by the enforced social isolation. We live for one month isolated at home because we also fear to transfer the contagion to our beloved ones, Professor Castelli continued. If you put all that together... the workload, the fatigue, the tiredness... that is fairly psychologically demanding.  Italy was one of the first countries to be badly affected by the coronavirus. Like many others, its health care workers were unaware that the virus spreads particularly well in medical settings, where dozens of infected patients can transmit the virus through the air. While PPE for hospital staff is now a top priority, thereaposs still a shortage of face masks for GPs in Italy.

Many people expected the couple to jump straight into their new charity venture, which they have been speaking about excitedly since announcing their plans to quit royal le. But instead of sharing details of their new organisation, Meghan and Harry have decided to take some time to themselves, with a royal expert claiming itaposs because they need a break. Since revealing their intention to quit, the couple have been working out the logistics with the Queen and other senior members of the Royal Family, including a number of crisis meetings with aides. Megxit has also fallen in the middle of the coronavirus Covid- pandemic, which would have had a huge impact on any work they had hoped to do. They have also moved to Canada and then packed up again and set up home in LA.  Speaking on the podcast On Heir, Omid Scobie said: It is interesting because we had such a build-up since January to the departure of Meghan and Harry stepping back as senior working royals. Suddenly on March  it sort of crept up on us really quickly, we had the couple announcing the beginning of their transition period over the next year on Instagram.At the same time, they were announcing that they are closing down their social media and their website and taking a break for the next few months. Itaposs sort of taken everyone by surprise, I think.  There was so much talk in the press about the couple preparing projects and ready to launch initiatives. When actually it was two people that were like, We need a break too. CTVaposs Laney Lui believes itaposs the right thing to do, and says it would have been insensitive for the couple to launch something new at the moment. She said: I think that is, both on a personal and a professional level, a smart move. No one is moving forward with plans right now, andyou do have plans to move forward with itaposs not really a good look to be flaunting that in peopleaposs faces. Other people are permanently in a no-go zone right now. Nobody is getting any momentum with anything, so for them to be like aposwoohoo, look at us, we have all these things on the agenda, it would have been insensntive. Meghan and Harry shared a goodbye message on the eve of aposMegxitapos, ensuring fans they would still be working hard behind the scenes.

Harperaposs reaction was aposyou donapost have to shout at me just talk normally, I am only stood hereapos. I reckon she managed to cause all the mess in less than  minutes. She had sneaked into my bedroom while I was still sleeping and nicked the lipstick from my dressing table. She had taken it back it into her room and began rubbing it all over the walls and banister.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor more information on how we use your data and your data protection rights.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailThe Royal Mail has announced strict new rules to its service which will start today. Royal Mail has previously revealed changes about handling and delivering mail during the crisis. These included only one person being allowed in a Royal Mail delivery vehicle at any one time and an extra emphasis on postal workers washing their hands when entering and leaving Royal Mail buildings. Acting on public health authority advice, Royal Mail says it has adopted enhanced disinfectant cleaning of communal areas in all Royal Mail sites on a daily basis and to minimise contact, customer signatures are no longer required, and any parcel too big to fit through a letterbox will be placed outside their door.  However from today stricter guidelines will be put into place - though Post Offices are unaffected by the announcement. Here are all the changes as stated on the Royal Mail website. Changes to opening hours and closures To protect the health and safety of our people and the general public, from Monday  April, we are changing the opening times of our Customer Services Points in our local delivery offices. Our largest locations will be open between .-.am. All other Customer Service Points will be open between .-:am. All will be closed on Wednesday and Sunday. To support the Government’s advice to stay at home and avoid non-essential journeys, we urge customers to only visit Customer Service Points where absolutely necessary. As a reminder, we can also redeliver your item for free.  Schedule your redelivery here. Longer retention period for parcels To give you longer to collect or have your item redelivered, we are temporarily extending the retention period to   calendar days from Monday  April before items are ed to sender. This applies to the following:Items we’ve left a ‘Something for You’ card Items that have a ‘Surcharge to Pay’ Items that have a ‘Customs Charge to Pay’ Local Collect items where the parcel is addressed to the Customer Service PointSpecial Delivery Due to increased absence levels, we’ve reviewed our timed guarantees for Special Delivery Guaranteed by am and pm services and will make the following changes:For items posted from Tuesday  March  onwards, our guaranteed delivery for Special Delivery Guaranteed by .am the next working day will change to by .pm the next working day*. Our guaranteed delivery for Special Delivery Guaranteed by .pm will change to by .pm the next working day*.*existing postcode exceptions apply Signing for and receiving items In order to protect both our people and customers as much as possible, we are minimising contact during delivery. We will not be handing over our hand-held devices to customers to capture signatures but instead log the name of the person accepting the item. Additionally, for all customers where we need to deliver any item that won’t fit through your letterbox, we will place your item at your door. Having knocked on your door, we will then step aside to a safe distance while you retrieve your item. This will ensure your item is delivered securely rather than being left outside. Delivering to care homes The Government has introduced measures to protect our most vulnerable groups, including those in residential care. These include limiting all but essential access to care homes for external contractors. We recognise that post is important to the elderly, particularly those away from their friends and families in care homes. Therefore, to support the effort to keep the mail moving but prevent the spread of Coronavirus, we are making arrangements to deliver to a central pointrather than inidual addresses within care homes from th March. These changes will help to ensure the health, safety and wellbeing of our people and the vulnerable in society. Leaflets and unaddressed mail We will deliver unaddressed door to door advertising mailings to customers who are receiving addressed letters or parcels at the same time, wherever practically possible. Door to door mailings provide a very valuable service to small businesses and companies of all kinds as they seek to provide their goods and services. Many small businesses need that support now more than ever. They want to send it, many consumers want to receive it. Door to door mailings also include important communications from local government. The most common symptoms of the coronavirus are: a dry, persistent cougha feverIf you experience these symptoms, you should immediately self-isolate yourself for seven days. It is not necessary to call NHS  unless your symptoms get more severe. Some patients have reported fatigue, headaches, shortness of breath and aches and pains. Sneezing is not a symptom of the coronavirus."},{"url":null,"title":"sparkly school worker who just","story":"NewsSparkly’ school worker who just became gran for first time dies of coronavirusLearning mentor Carole Flynn was described as the “heart and soul” of Corpus Christi Catholic Primary School in Coventry.

I was free to talk to clubs.“I spoke to Mark McGhee at Motherwell and Gus MacPherson at St Mirren.“The chance to go to England and play for that club [Coventry] came up and it was a no-brainer really.“My agent and I sat down…we didn’t need to think about it.“There were other reasons why it was more beneficial for me – you’re trying to make a living in your career.“I had three top-flight teams up here who I had the chance to go to.“Lee Wilkie was at Dundee United at the time. I remember Craig saying that he would be one of the people I’d be coming in to try and play beside.“That was the three teams interested but thankfully I chose Coventry.“I really enjoyed the experience of playing and living in England.

I was desperate to just get in and experience it.“But it got to the point that Michael O’Neill heard I could play with Northern Ireland [through a Coleraine-born grandparent].“He called Allan Preston [football agent] and Alan called me.“I said, ‘Can you ask Craig what the chances with Scotland would be ’ To be fair to Craig, he said, ‘I’d never say it’s a definite no buthe’s got the chance to play international football then I’d take it’.“Without saying ‘definitely no’, he definitely did say no!“I’ve still got mixed emotions about it. My dad wasn’t too sure, he didn’t want me to do it.“Other people advised me to do it and I had some great trips. I got one cap but I was in the squad seven or eight times.“Getting to train with people like Jonny Evans, Steven Davis…I loved the training and I loved the trips.“I would’ve liked to get more game time but it was causing a problem to my back and ultimately that’s why I stopped.”He made his Northern Ireland debut in a - hammering at the hands of the Netherlands on June , , just weeks after his Hibs side were beaten - by Hearts in the Scottish Cup Final.McPake – who came up against Dutch stars Arjen Robben, Wesley Sneijder and Robin van Persie – said: “It wasn’t like a normal friendly, it was mayhem.“The Amsterdam Arena was packed. I’m looking at it and going, ‘Wow’.“I think in that two weeks, with the Scottish Cup Final and then that game, I got beat - on aggregate.“I had a week in Dubai between that so I suppose that makes up for it.”McPake is approaching six years at Dens Park, after initially joining as a player in May , and he didn’t envisage such a long spell at the club.He said: “If I did, I’d be living in Dundee or somewhere around about there. I often say that to Dawn [we]. I love it up there.“In terms of players, Cammy [Kerr] was there – he was only a young boy.

It would be our intention,the season is brought to an early conclusion, where practical, to reimburse those season ticket holders for the remainder of the season that was not played.  This will be further assessed for timelines, etc., as we make our way through the claims process. We have often said that the club is a family and that remains true throughout this situation.In addition to our insurance coverage, we have also sought to access ious sources of support offered by the League, the Association, Government agencies and our associates.  All that have been involved have been extremely helpful in our solidication of the club as a business.  I would like to personally thank John Bennett for his very generous and selfless gesture of suspending rent on the stadium. His call, on day one of this crisis helped to set the tone for all that followed throughout this shutdown and is the epitome of showing how we are all in this together.The UK Government and its agencies have also been extremely helpful in the offering of grants loans and providing relief through the Job Retention Scheme.  That includes HMRC. It is our experience, thus far, that this country’s handling of the crisis exceeds others in the mitigation of losses for businesses as well as iniduals.  In the coming days we will be implementing elements of the job retention scheme in respect of our staff and it is our intention that all are looked after fully throughout this crisis. This includes our football players, football staff and administrative staff receiving full pay while they are on furlough for the foreseeable future.We also think it is right to give credit to the dedicated workers at the SPFL and SFA. They have been working in an ever-changing landscape throughout this unprecedented event. They have continued to keep us informed and provide us advice on how to best navigate this predicament.

We continue to take advice and express our opinions on what football should look like when football resumes. Although none of us know yet what will transpire with this season, it is clear that football will be back.We’ve been inundated with requests on how people can help the club.  It’s truly been heart-warming. The one way to helpyou can – and onlyyou can # is to purchase season tickets and merchandise online.  We still have limited availability of this year’s Third Strip, which may become a collector’s item as it may never be worn.This supports the club as well as SSAFA and The Black Watch Association charities.  We will soon be launching our - kit in the upcoming days and we know it’s not enough to completely fill your appetite for football, but keep an eye on the social media sites for Dundee FC and DFC in the Community, which will provide some entertainment while we all do our part to save lives by staying home.We wish we had something more definitive to say, but we hope this brief update will provide some reassurance that we are still here and will remain here when this crisis is over.

Riverside was a shock for them on a December morning and certainly not what a guy like Caniggia was used to!“Caniggia, Ravanelli, Ketsbaia, all the top names that came into the club were brand new. They were great lads, they really were.“It was a bit surreal training against these boys. I was a bit stand-offish because I had a reputation of being a little rash and I wasn’t going to smash Caniggia in training!“He was just left to do his thing and you gave him the respect he deserves.“He basically got to do whatever he wanted around the club. Nobody was going to tell Caniggia he couldn’t do something!“We’d be at training and his five-year-old son would be up with us. We’d be doing a shooting exercise and running out of balls because Caniggia’s son had six at the side kicking them about!”Wilkie also revealed Caniggia’s free reign didn’t stop there and the Argentine was known to enjoy a pre-match cigarette in the Dens Park dressing room.He said: “We had the one cubicle in the changing-room and I used to like my pre-match toilet to just chill out and read the programme to get my mind ready for the game.“I’d always have to wait on Caniggia coming out the toilet because he’d be in there smoking a rolly-up.“He used to just come out with a wee smile on his face, shrug his shoulders and walk past you but that was just the kind of guy he was.“The Italians and the Argentines were horried the British boys would drink beer but they would smoke asit was the healthiest thing going.“They were really fit, though. Caniggia was probably the fittest guy I played with and fans could see that when he scored his first goal against Aberdeen and took his top off.“He was so strong for his age and looked after himself really well.“He was one of the biggest players in the world and it was amazing he was at Dundee.”It was a crucial time in Wilkie’s career but bust-ups with the Bonettis led to him going on loan to Plymouth Argyle, Notts County and Falkirk.But he found his way back to Dens, impressing then-Scotland manager Berti Vogts enough to get a call-up to the national team.“It was dficult for me because I was young and fiery and they were exactly the same,” Wilkie said of clashing with the Bonettis.“I had a couple of fall-outs with them that really came from nothing. It’s disappointing how it ended up because I really quite liked them.“Dario really knew his stuff as a coach and, as an ex-defender, he used to take us away to do bits and pieces in training.“I really enjoyed that. The two times I fell out with them were from silly little things in training that shouldn’t have happened.“My loan moves then came from the fall-outs but I got called back from Falkirk because they’d fallen out with Marco De Marchi and Fan Zhiyi.“When I was on loan at Notts County I’d pretty much given up. I was close to deciding I was done with football because I was fed up.“I was in a bad place. I got injured down there in my first or second game, sat stuck in a hotel and I thought that was me done.“I was only  so I was just a bit naive and immature I guess. Getting back to enjoying the game was about  per cent luck.“I was playing for Falkirk, doing OK and enjoying it in a young team in the First Division with boys like Mark Kerr and Lee Miller.“My head was still pretty much gone from the previous couple of months. But with the Bonnetis falling out with almost all the centre-halves at Dundee bar one, I was back in.“I got on well with [former Dundee owner] Peter Marr and he liked me as a player so persuaded Ivano to bring me back.“I went back and played about six games towards the end of that season and Berti showed up to watch me put in two man-of-the-match displays.“Next minute I’m called up for Scotland.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.51279850-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.51279850-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.51279850-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.51279850-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"lee wilkie neil doncaster ian maxwell","story":"It’s been a long week of rumour and speculation since the last update we had from the SFA and the SPFL.What that radio silence hammers home most to me is a lack of leadership and decisiveness.Don’t get me wrong, I have sympathy for Ian Maxwell, Neil Doncaster  Co.This is a very complicated situation where you are unlikely to please everyone because so many doors could open up in dferent directions for clubs in terms of the current season and ongoing league structure.It melts your mind a bit when you start thinking about all the possibilities and how it could affect people but there needs to be a decision made soon.Uefa won’t do it for them, nor will Fa or English football, they need to grab the bull by the horns and show a bit of leadership.The resolution for all of this starts with them so it’s important they’re clear with their message.There’s no way they could possibly keep everybody happy but they must do something decisively and quite quickly to protect clubs and their incomes.I think most football people, myself included, would like to see the season played to a finish – eventhat is behind closed-doors.However, it’s beginning to look like we won’t see that happening at all given the current health guidelines from the UK and Scottish Governments pointing towards a longer lockdown being put in place across the country.August has been touted as the date for ato domestic football and, like I have said before, although it will be a long four months, it could be a good opportunity to restructure our gamedone correctly.It’s definitely an option and, depending on how it looks, I might even prefer that to closed-doors games.Reshuffling the leagues and increasing the number of teams will be refreshing and I think most fans would back that.Most of the clubs would be fairly happy, too, with no relegations across all four isions and promotion for the top two sides in the lower leagues.There may be some disputes about the tighter leagues and promotion play-offs but you’d like to think most would understand the extraordinary nature of the situation.Dundee would probably have been able to push Inverness right to the end and might feel a bit hard done by but it’s a really dficult one.I don’t envy the high heidyins but they’re paid to make these calls.The biggest thing that needs to be cleared up as soon as possible, for me, is the financial aspect of the shutdown.Clubs have been left in limbo by the powers that be for too long already.Many don’t have any income at all while there are still so many question marks about how they will access adequate monies from the SPFL and the SFA.It’s really important they decide what’s happening as soon as they can because clubs need to move on and plan for, what looks like, months ahead without any football.There’s so much work to do, it’s a bit of a head spinner.At this stage we’re not even taking into account the transfer window where, Dundee United in particular may be able to raise cash.I’m sure there will already have been plenty of enquiries about Lawrence Shankland.It’s probably a huge worry for a club like United. Of course, all clubs have dferent worries financially because they’re all in dferent situations.The least they deserve is clarity.Even in the summer it doesn’t take long for players to be itching to get back to football.The current situation with the coronavirus shutdown is a dferent kettle of fish entirely, though, and poses heightened mental health risks.For that reason, I was delighted to hear Tony Asghar say Dundee United are using a sport psychologist to help players stay positive.Clubs are far more equipped to deal with these things than when I started  years ago.My son Jack and I have been out on our bikes to try to break the boredom of lockdown this week.He’s been doing a lot of running as part of his training programme from Dundee but somehow I think I’ll stick to the pedals!"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.51279850-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.51279850-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.51279850-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.51279850-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"on this day the victorian trio who became dundees first scotland stars","story":"Today could have been the day where  years of hurt ended and Scotland finally secured its place at a major tournament again.Had they, as hoped, navigated a semi-final clash with Israel at Hampden last week, Scotland would have been in Norway or Serbia to play for a place in Euro .As it stands, none of that will happen tonight.Partly because it’s a hypothetical scenario but mainly because the coronavirus pandemic and shutdown of football has put paid to it.Those play-off clashes will now be played in June, at the earliest, with the finals themselves pushed back until next summer.Fortunately, today#s date also holds signicance historically for one of our city clubs.On March , , Dundee saw its first players earn Scots caps – three no less, in fact.Only an established club for less than a year, the Dark Blues had goalkeeper Francis Barrett, captain William Longair and winger Sandy Keillor all start for the national team against Ireland.Taking place at Cltonville’s Solitude ground in Belfast, nearly , spectators packed in as Scotland ran out - winners in a British International Championship match thanks to a Samuel Torrans own goal and John Taylor strike.Barret would go on to win just the one more cap for his country but wore the dark blue of Dundee with distinction  times.Born in Dundee on August ,  to Irish parents, he began his career at Dundee Harp – a club formed to try to emulate Celtic and Hibernian in providing a sporting focus for the catholic community in Scotland’s major cities.They had harboured ambitions to be the city’s top side before East End and Our Boys formed Dundee Football Club as we know it today in .In December of its first season, looking to bolster their back line, the Dee swooped for Harp keeper, Barrett.Their problems were clear for all to see as he became the fth goalkeeper the ‘Ten-bobbers’ used that season when he made his debut against Hearts on December .Barret remained at the club until the summer of  before signing for Newton Heath, now Manchester United, and went on to play against Dundee in a friendly – one of his  appearances for the Red Devils.Spells at New Brighton Tower, Manchester City and Aberdeen followed, before Barrett began to suffer from ill health, eventually passing away aged just  in .Hall of Fame inductee Longair, known as “Plum”, was a terric servant to Dundee – stretching back to the days of East End, for whom he signed in .The match against Ireland was Plum’s only cap in a career which also stopped in at Newton Heath as well as Sunderland, Burnley and Brighton United.Born in Dundee in , the centre-half would make  appearances for the Dee, scoring four goals and captaining the club in its first-ever fixture against Rangers in  – a - draw at West Craigie Park.Skippering the side is something Longair would do multiple times in his four spells until his retirement from playing in .He would go on to be the club’s trainer for their  Scottish Cup success and later become groundsman before his sad death aged just  in .It is estimated , people lined the streets for his funeral, showing the high regard in which the Dundonian public held him.Keillor was not only one of the first Dundee players to play for Scotland but also the first to score.Picking up four caps in total, the attacking talent also made  appearances for the Dark Blues, scoring  goals.Born in Dundee on October , , Keillor was brought up in Montrose and began his career with the Links Park side in .He joined the newly-formed Dundee FC in  with two Scotland caps already under his belt and, like Longair, played in the club’s first-ever match against Rangers.The outside-left was seen as a complete footballer with The Courier writing at the time that “he had a knack of rising to the big occasion”.And he did just that when Scotland hosted Wales at Dundee’s Carolina Port in , with Keillor getting his goal in a - win for the Scots.Keillor was awarded a testimonial against Celtic in , with , supporters turning up.He remained with the club until , playing at the new Dens Park alongside Longair, before ing to Montrose and hanging up his boots in .

Seventy-two people are now in intensive care after testing positive for the disease.Speaking at a briefing at St Andrew’s House in Edinburgh, Dr Calderwood said most of the people who have contracted the virus in Scotland are either unaware they have it or have been self-isolating after suffering symptoms.“There will come a time that I will be able to talk to you about the numbers being infected and that rate slowing, but that time is not yet and that time will not be for some weeks to come”, she said.“I was quoted yesterday in some of the press as estimating there were somewhere between , and , people in Scotland with coronavirus.“While it is dangerous to go day-by-day I want to really emphasis that I would now be estimating that there are more than , people in Scotland infected.“The importance there is that only a  have been confirmed.

A dedicated mental health page has also been added to NHS Inform.”Talking about the weekend ahead Ms Sturgeon said: “We are about to go into our first weekend since lockdown measures were announced.“I know many will be struggling with being cooked up in the house as you are just now.“It is vital that all of us stick with this. The most important thing all of us can do is to follow the advice and stay at home wherever possible.”Dr Calderwood also said Thursday night’s Clap for Carers, which she took part in, was the first time she had cracked a smile “for quite some time”, adding: “I am very proud to be part of the NHS.“My NHS colleagues really appreciate it.

Netzer had just won the European Championships with West Germany and would win the World Cup in .Netzer was described as “the best passer of a football there has been” by none other than Dutch great Johan Cruyff.He ran the show as the visitors, - up by half-time of the first leg, looked set to run away with things. Fortunately, he picked up a thigh injury and was replaced for the second half, allowing Harper and Drew Jarvie to make it - before Monchengladbach scored a third.Harper, who says it was like Netzer was playing a dferent sport to the other  players on the Pittodrie pitch, said: #The best non-British footballer I came up against was without question Borussia Monchengladbach’s Gunter Netzer when we lost to them in the first round of the Uefa Cup in .##It was like he was playing a violin and everyone  a ukelele.#It#s not the first time Harper has spoken about his admiration for Netzer, who won the league with Monchengladbach, as well as La Liga with Real Madrid, before going on to lead Hamburg to the European Cup as general manager, with the Reds most potent hitman of all time previously saying: “His reputation as one of the best players in the world was deserved.“Netzer was a huge man but had amazing finesse when he was on the ball.“He ran us ragged in the first half at Pittodrie and the pass he played to help them go - up was among the best I’ve ever seen.“We almost broke out the champagne when we heard he had suffered a thigh strain and would be unable to come out for the second half.“But it was a delight to have seen such a great player performing at his peak.”Although he may not have realised it at the time, on reflection, Harper says the other greatest player he saw perform in the flesh visited with Manchester United for a friendly on October , . The player was George Best.Aberdeen, without defender Martin Buchan # who was by then in the Red Devils# ranks, won - with Harper scoring twice. However, despite a quiet first period from Northern Irishman Best, the Dons legend knows he was lucky to see the mercurial, troubled Best perform before his personal struggles really took hold.Harper said: #I never realised just how good Best was when I played against him in a friendly at Pittodrie in .#My old captain Martin Buchan had of course moved to Manchester United by that point. We beat United - and I scored twice.#Looking back – you saw Best’s skill, but you didn’t appreciate it as much because you were focused on your own game.#I shared a pitch with a lot of great British players – Arthur Graham, Kenny Dalglish, Billy Bremner and Bobby Moore, but Best was not only a fantastic player, he was also an exciting player.#What made Best so special Harper added: #Best’s directness was sensational. He’d go straight forward and take players on. He’d sometimes turn back on himself, but not to play a pass backwards, to beat the man for a second time.#He had a great knack of dipping the left shoulder and going right, dipping the right shoulder and going left, feinting crosses.#"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column january 31 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsEver since it was #temporarily# closed to new admissions around two years ago, there has been the suspicion that plans were afoot to close Knapdale Ward completely.The HSCP claims to have consulted widely on the future of the ward, yet patients# relatives, front-line nurses and medical professionals say they were never asked for their views.

As we stood about on deck while the dishes were being washed a boy from one of the motor boats passed in his dinghy. He was wearing blue shorts and red stockings which brought from the Pilot the remark: #In Brodickyou don’t wear red stockings you might just as well be in Lamlash.#All but the Skipper and Mate went ashore on Centre Island for a stroll. The Major was still completely paralysed in his hind quarters but he was full of spirit and when the Bosun held up his hind legshe galloped along. It was a quiet peaceful evening with a very light northerly breeze but it was distinctly chilly and there was a magnicentsomewhat lurid sunset. The shore party back aboard the Bosun took the Tar off in the dinghy and they landed on Eilean na Beithe and while the former explored the island the latter played on a shingly shore – it was long after dark when they ed.At half past ten we began to turn in and, as always on the first evening, this was a longer business then usual as pillows and blankets had to be allocated and pillowslips put on but by a quarter past eleven we were all in bed and shortly after that a light shower pattered on the deck. The problem of what to do with the Doctor’s mattress was solved by the Pilot double banking his bunk. We were all very glad to have had such a good day for the start.It was noticed that voices were still coming from the ladies’ cabin when the last of us in the main cabin fell asleep.The Tanky brought an innovation to the Fulmar # #Quickies# # a patent washing gadget that saved precious water.We had a dead quiet night with, as far as any of us knew, no rain but the forecast was not good, promising north to north-east winds, force  to  with frequent heavy showers. The glass had continued its steady drop. When we turned out, a light but cold north wind was blowing from a well broken up sky.We had a breakfast of bacon and eggs then the Bosun took the Major ashore for his walk. The latter was possibly a little better and was able to take a few steps on the deck, but ashore on the rough ground could do nothing. While they were ashore the big motor boat with the red-stockinged boy left after very nearly going ashore on Seil Island while getting his anchor aboard.At twenty past ten we were away under engine, but as soon as we were outside the sails went up to the north-easterly breeze and we set off for the Sound of Mull. There was no sign of the swell that is usually met south of Kerrera and we got along quite well, but we could not point any higher than a mile or so south of Loch Don. The Pilot went below and brewed a welcome cup of tea which warmed us up, then we took a tack right up to the south coast of Kerrera and had a close up view of Gylen Castle and the Skipper waxed historical.Putting about again we passed close south of the Potlid Island, but when we were about halfway across to Loch Don the wind died and the strong ebb began to force us south and about the same time the rain came on.The engine was started and we headed up for Duart, but our progress was pitully slow, and indeed at one period we but barely held our ground. The Lady Rock and Lismore Lighthouse seemed never to get any nearer closing. When the engine had run an hour we waited for the first sign of the old familiar falter but none came and we began to hope a cure for its stopping had been effected by replacing the HT coil.This change was a despairing effort made because it was the only thing we had not tried, though all the pundits declare it could not possibly be the cause. The engine would either go or not go, they said, and it would never startthe coil was defective. We got one scare when it staggered for a moment, but the Bosun, who was at the tiller at the time, said we had just passed though a big mass of floating seaweed and may have got some round our propeller.As we were to prove later the cure had been found and the engine ran impeccably all the cruise and the Skipper had a lot of unkind thoughts about all the many professional motor experts who had caused him a great deal of trouble, not a little acute anxiety and more than considerable expense through their failure to diagnose a not very obscure disease.As we came up to the Black Memorial Tower Leonora crossed our bows making for Oban and another yachtpassed close by south bound under engine though by this time quite a reasonable and, for then, favourable breeze was blowing from the north-east and our sails were drawing.We learnt later that the owner’s we would not allow a sail to be set under any conditions as long as she was aboard – a pity, we thought, as she certainly was a lovely job and we felt it would have been betterthe we had decided to stay ashore.At Duart we stopped the engine and were able to make good progress, but the rain got heavier and heavier and our sandwich lunch was taken below in relays. Then at about three with the turn of the tide the wind died completely and the engine was started again. Near the Grey Rocks we saw St Roma coming south under power so we altered course to intercept her then at slow speed turned back the way we had come for a few hundred yards while we exchanged news.We heard a thoroughly bad forecast at mid-day, the wind had gone, the rain was stotting in the glassy sea, and, though the glass had come back only a fraction, we decided to call it a day so, with the Bosun the only dissentient, made for Loch Aline. As we turned inshore at Ardtornish we saw Seewolf to the north of us, becalmed but heading south, and guessed she would be joining us later. Coming in, when between Morven Pier and the Ferry Pier, the Skipper held too close to the west shore and the bottom showed up suddenly far too clearly for our peace of mind and a quick sheer out was necessary.Through the narrows we turned to starboard and anchored at half past four in Kyle Bay in a flat calm and the rain coming down heavier than ever. Gratefully we realised that it was not quite as bitterly cold as it had been out in the Sound.Seewolf came in shortly after going very slowly and Hamish Lawrence called over that he had run a big end and was on his way to Oban for repairs and to hand over to brother Alec and his family. Soon after that we were joined by a small motor boat, Saguenay, flying a blue ensign which, in view of her size, the Skipper was sure she was not entitled to do and then a little later, while we were warming up with some coffee, Lindisfarne arrived and anchored close beside us with Guy Clephane in his usual tremendousform – he’s a proper marvel is Guy.Hamish Lawrence came across in his dinghy and came aboard for a gin and while he was there Guy called over inviting Tanky and the Pilot across to Lindisfarne then sent the Pilot back to Fulmar to fetch the Bosun. Hamish gone, the Skipper began to put nine inch tacklines into our line of flags as we had discovered at Rothesay at the Royal Clyde Centenary Regatta that without them our line was about fteen feet too short and we wanted them to be right for the Queen’s visit to Tobermory.When the Pilot came back he and the Bosun got the tents up as the rain was by then torrential.We had a supper of sausages and beans and while the dishes were being done the Bosun took the Major ashore. He was walking a little bettervery slowly, but there was, unfortunately, no concrete results from his exercise.At nine o’clock we went in two loads across to Seewolf and were offered drinks OR tea, but the Skipper insisted on both. We were, however, not allowed any biscuits with our tea as to have them would have meant opening a new box and broaching Alec Lawrence’s stores. The Tanky had not wanted anything but tea, but Hamish had given her a good strong gin which she tried to hide on a shelf behind her and it was only got rid of when the Pilot took it off her hands and quickly put it to its proper use. The Bosun was drinking beer and when he opened up the tin a goodly portion of it bubbled onto the fitted carpet in the cabin.On board Seewolf were, besides the two paid hands, Hamish’s mother and his two sisters. The old lady, well over eighty, was in grand form and waxed eloquent on #The old days# and the greatness of #Belshaft#. Also on board was a great big collie who was obviously petted and spoilt beyond measure and he behaved more like a lap dog than the great big clumsy creature he was.It was half past eleven before we went back to Fulmar all in one load with little enough freeboard for the dinghy considering the conditions. There was a nasty little lop on the water, the northerly wind was bitterly cold, and the rain was as heavy as ever. As quickly as possible we got below and into our warm bunks, not even the Bosun wasting any time about it, though he did read for some time after all the rest were sound asleep."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast podcast episode 10 nessie and the lost golf balls","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWelcome to Episode  of the Oban Time#s BOBcast.Charting Bob#s progress  and discussing lots of things golfare  presenters Stephen Day, George Graham, Martin Laing and Keith McIntyre.

As part of this project the fund provided MACPool with seven aqua cycles and training from Hydrorider.Arriving early to take photogaphs of the others giving these bikes a go, any sense of nervousness was set aside as I watched healthcare professionals and fitness and well-being enthusiasts laugh and chat through their shot.After some quick adjustments to the bikes June, from our advertising department, and I were raring to go.Partially submerged, the feeling of being weightless combined with the resistance of the water as we began peddling was initially a bit odd. As we got used to the feeling, we started to speed things up, pretending we were racing the rest of our group to The Cairnbaan for a gin and tonic.Finding our rhythm, instructor Kathryn Craig began to lead us through arm exercises. Our co-ordination was put to the test as we carried on cycling while doing simple arm movements that felt more impactive due to the water resistance. Then for the real challenge # floating off the back of the bike while continuing to pedal – not an easy taskyou are short-legged but a workout that feels like it is doing you the power of good.For me aqua cycling is everything I hoped it would be – a fun, impactiveand enjoyable way of exercising. And I could still walk after it!With no aches and pains the next day and still smiling, I signed up for some of the classes.Classes y in intensity and are currently running on Tuesdays from .-.pm, Wednesday evenings from .-.pm and Saturdays from  .-.am.

Included in this is the Isle of Jura.This is as shockingly reckless as it is offensive.The Isle of Jura is not a #bolthole# as the Daily Mail has chosen to state but a very beautul island steeped in culture and rich history.On both Jura and Islay we, like so many rural areas, are struggling to deal with all of the challenges related to the Corona virus out break. Our local health services have very limited resources as it is, along side a population that has many elderly residents who are more at risk to the virus.We have seen a local uptick in people traveling to Islay in camper vans and this is happening at a time when the UK government is advising against non essential travel.Those who are choosing to travel to our islands of Islay, Jura and the many other islands in Argyll and Bute in order to avoid the coronavirus may end up inadvertently spreading it to islands who arenot as much affected in the same way as so many built up urban areas are. Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management. The Welsh Assembly has totally lost its way with its mindless policy of devastating Welsh forests with thousands and thousands # an understatement # of trees being felled for wind farms, and compounding the felony by covering acres of land with very limited electricity generating solar parks # Wales is not the Sahara and the sun disappears at night! Solar  will generate about  per cent of their maximum capacity in the UK.Returning to farming perhaps some kind person should tell Dr Tim Leunig that the answer lies in the soil and then lead him to a darkened and quiet room so he can lie down and contemplate the truth # wise men recognise that truth is the daughter of time, not of authority.Dave Haskell, Cardigan."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part 10","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat a night! All of us were agreed that never had we experienced anywhere a worse one and we were glad we had been in Loch Aline on Sunday night not in Tobermory as intended as, from what we heard, that night had been similar but twice as bad.It was a wild night lashing with rain and a big swell was rolling in from the north-east causing us to pitch and roll horribly. Everything banged and rattled and the ropes, despite their lashings, slapped on the mast, the chain rugged continuously on the bobstay, and there was one most annoying thump that kept everyone awake .We could not trace its origin until in desperation the Pilot donned oilskins, sou’wester and seaboots, and went on deck and found it was the tiller end bumping on the bulwarks. The Pilot had a very justiable grouse about this as he had suggested lashing the tiller, but the Skipper had said that he did not think it necessary and that we would lie easierit was allowed to go free.About six we heard Murdoch in Venture hailing us and the Skipper and Pilot hurried on deck. The yachts in the harbour were all lying higgledy-piggledy owing to the swell, to there being little or not wind, to the strong surface current from the swollen river, and to it being about the turn of the tide.Venture and Fulmar were lying stern to stern and what had aroused Murdoch was that the Venture had got her mizzen boom over our main boom and as we pitched we had lted it up crutch and all – how nothing was broken was a miracle. She had then swung round and her now free boom had knocked the cap off our jackstay. As the Skipper came on deck Venture again surged towards us and started pitching and her counter came down with a terric slam not six inches from our bulwarks. We put our helm over and swung clear.Murdoch and Barclay were both in their dog-house and the Pilot and Skipper stayed in ours until the new tide took charge and the boats began to swing in normal fashion and all were able to retire once more to their bunks. Luckily the rain had cleared off shortly before this episode took place.At a quarter to eight we heard the usual poor forecast but for the first time since the cruise began there was not a gale warning for any area. The glass had risen well during the night. What wind there was was from the north-west.The Skipper went ashore for the milk and rolls. The dinghy had a lot of water in it and owing to the rolling it was impossible to get into it and balance on the thwarts till it was baled so the Skipper got his feet thoroughly soaked – the simple remedy of wearing seaboots had never occurred to him. Again the rolls were sold out and again he had to take porter biscuits.On board the Pilot lit the fire then started in to get our breakfast of bacon and egg. After our meal the sky cleared and it became a beautul sunny day, and everything we had was up on deck drying off or airing. The owner of Rose came alongside and for a good time tried to get us to persuade him to go north against his better judgement, but when we heard he had the lady member of his crew of three sick in her bunk our advice was that he go south and that immediately and reluctantly he was forced to agree and half an hour later he sailed. Hervor also went out about the same time and she turned north and we were to meet her later in Iona."},{"url":null,"title":"a83 slip recovery work ongoing","story":"Susan WindramUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsEssential work to make safe the area of hillside that slipped and blocked the A earlier this yearis forging ahead.Taking care to maintain social distancing and to observe all current NHS and government health advice, a team of experts has been carrying out extensive operations to stabilise the slope and construct a back-up catch-pit.Led by Forestry and Land Scotland, the team includes the geotechnical engineers and consultants involved in resilience works where on the Rest and Be Thankful, and partners Transport Scotland and BEAR.FLS Planning Manager, John Hair, said: #We’re channelling a lot of resources into this and are working on it seven days a week to make this area safe.#Over , tonnes of debris landed on the road back in January. It took a lot of clearing up but that loss of material from the hillside presented other problems as well. We’re currently underpinning a -metre stretch of the forest road to strengthen it and prevent any further major collapse.#The landslip channel has been stabilised but, in the event of future extreme weather events potentially affecting this part of the slope, we are constructing a catch pit that aims to prevent debris from reaching the road surface.#Traffic management will be in place for approximately a further two weeks to allow us to complete the catch pit. We will be working on stabilising the forest road for another four weeks after that but will not require any more traffic management.#Currently only one lane of the carriageway is in use.The area of hillside affected is land that FLS looks after but is well away both from those areas that have slipped in the past and from areas where previous mitigation work has been carried out.Engineering assessments indicate that the incident was the result of exceptionally heavy rain causing a section of hillside above the forest road to slump and block a drainage culvert. This resulted in water damming up, overflowing the forest road and reaching the downhill slope, carrying surface material downhill and also creating a channel for more water to travel down at a faster rate.John, added: #This event arose from a very particular set of circumstances that are unlikely to apply to other sites and situations. However, aware as we are of the increasing occurrence of prolonged spells of heavy rain, we have already reviewed and adapted our inspection process to include checks on other forest roads set in similar landscapes.#We are also developing climate change adaptation actions to make the forests and land more resilient and mitigate such risks.#"},{"url":null,"title":"ferry services cant stay afloat forever msp","story":"Ellis ButcherUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsFerry operators are facing #signicant losses,# but cannot stay afloat forever without help, the country#s transport secretary has warned.Michael Matheson MSP has added his signature today to a letter from the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish governments warning that some routes could sink unless there is intervention.It has been sent to UK Secretary of State for Transport Grant Shapps to sound the alarm bell over the future of services in places like the Western Isles.Ferry companies have faced signicant losses since the outbreak of COVID- and the crackdown on travel, restrictions on movements and some freight.Politicians are warning that ferry companies will need to make #decisions# on #loss-making routes# in coming days as carrying on with reduced passengers and staffing numbers may not be sustainable longer term.It comes as CalMac, which offers  vessels serving  routes, has revealed its passenger numbers have dropped by  per cent since new rules on essential ferry travel were put in place.The company has carried just , passengers compared to , for the same period last year, although company MD Robbie Drummond welcomed the fact the public is paying attention to government advice not to travel.The company, he said, remained committed to running #leline services# to the islands.Some of the asks of the UK government include an #immediate and temporary# relaxation of the competition regulations and a confirmation that seafaring companies will qualy for the employee support scheme.Mr Matheson said: #My officials and I have kept in touch with ports and ferry operators over the past few weeks and they have expressed substantial concerns with their operations over this dficult period.#I believe that without further intervention operators will need to take dficult commercial decisions which could be avoided, and that it will be extremely dficult to recover from that after we make it through this crisis.#Current reductions in freight traffic are also a serious issue in their own right.#There is a strong case for the UK Government to do more to support this vital sector during these unprecedented times and I look forward to their response on this important matter.#"},{"url":null,"title":"worldwide ceilidh community sign up for tunes in the hoose","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCapercaillie founder Martin MacLeod, originally from Oban, and his son, also Martin, have came up with an innovative way to connect musicians from all over the world and allow them to play together for the enjoyment of others.#Tunes in the Hoose# was inspired by Scottish musician, and family friend of the MacLeods, Peter Wood, who was posting videos of himself playing tunes in his home during self-isolation.Having saw the footage Martin senior, called his filmmaker son to askhe had the technology and know-how to put a video together of him playing along to Peter’s video.#I run my own production company based out of Glasgow, so it’s relatively straight forward work for me ,# said Martin Junior.#From that first successful attempt, our new idea was to create an online community for all Scottish musicians to help them connect and continue to play together during these uncertain times.#Housed in Facebook, Tunes in the Hoose amassed over  followers last week with ,+ views worldwide.

It was so strange not being able to give each other a hug, as we have always done over the past  years of our friendship.I chose a walk in which I hoped we would meet nobody , and we walked two metres apart. Despite our plan not to talk about the virus, we inevitably ended up doing just that, although not all the time.The walk took us to the site of the old Byres Kirk, just beyond Ormiston. As hoped, it was deserted, and so we entered.The eeriness of current events affected my behaviour. I walked around with my friend, carefully ensuring I touched nothing. The original kirk built here in  is long gone. It replaced an even older kirk, the remains of which are hidden in private woodland next to nearby Ormiston Hall not far from this site.The first kirk at Byres was eventually demolished and replaced by a neo-gothic building in the s. But after the opening of a new church in Ormiston in the s, Byres Kirk was finally abandoned and eventually demolished in the s.But the graves remain, including war graves, and there is also a headstone erected by Isabella Burns, sister of the famous poet, to the memory of her children.It was this headstone I had come to see. Isabella was the youngest sister of Robert Burns and she lived in Ormiston and Tranent for a while. In  she was widowed, with nine children, three girls and six boys. She set up a village school to help make ends meet.Itrsquos dficult to imagine what her le must have been like, but I think the fact she was part of Robert Burnsrsquo immediate family may have given her a status and a degree of respect most women were denied.I found the stone and was intrigued by it. Two of Isabellarsquos children are mentioned one of them, Edward, died at the age of  in China.ldquoChina  I said out loud to myself, wondering what he was doing there. I saw the date of his death: November , .Then it dawned on me: the Opium Wars! He must have been a soldier. I quickly Googled it on my phone and sure enough he was serving in a regiment there.I stood for a moment, thinking about the story behind this scant piece of information. The Opium Wars are not usually a prominent part of our history curriculum, although they should be. The British state went to war with China to safeguard the ability of British traders to sell opium to the Chinese, which resulted in  million addicts there. Itrsquos a dark part of our imperial history, and the fact that a nephew of Robert Burns ended up dead in China defending state-sponsored drug smuggling by Britain seemed horribly ironic and sad. But it also gave me a sense of the connectedness we all have. The decisions people make, especially those in power, affect the lives of others in ways we will never know or predict.The memorial headstone also had a later inscription which recorded the death of Isabella herself. She lived until she was  and died in . She isnrsquot buried in this graveyard, however, as she spent the last years of her le in Ayrshire and was laid to rest in Alloway Kirkyard.Such a web of le and connection, now mostly long forgotten, revealed by this one memorial stone.As I left, I noticed the trees: oak, sycamore, beech and yew. They seemed to grow out of lost human memory, asthey were now s of forgotten stories.On ourjourney to the car, we passed another memorial stone, this time to the Polish soldiers who had been based in Ormiston Hall in the s during the war. This too is now a time of memory fading, but not forgotten, as the flowers someone left revealed.We had succeeded in a walk seeing almost nobody, except a passing cyclist at the end. Next time we go on such a walk, spring will have arrived undisturbed by human footprints. Keeping people safe must be the priority.Although it was an unusually sombre walk, we found time to laugh and see the funny side of things too. We have to live le, make the best of our time, and the times, we have.And when we can once again regularly venture into naturersquos wonders, what an extra special gt it will seem."},{"url":null,"title":"sleep-boost-prestonpans-youngster-charity-dad-supported-lends-hand","story":"Murray Scott, , liveswith broadcaster dad Mark,  mum Laura, , a supply classroom assistant at The Hub at Sandersonrsquos Wynd Primary School and sister Sophie, seven, a pupil at Prestonpans Primary School.Murray, who attends The Hub in Tranent, has a partially deleted chromosome which affects his development and brain.The condition also affects Murrayrsquos spine and hips he is unable to walk or talk, is doubly incontinent and is tube fed.Murray also has epilepsy and reduced vision, and for the first eight years of his le was unable to sleep through the night.Mark said: ldquoHe was born with it ndash itrsquos a chromosome disorder which neither of us [mum and dad] carries.ldquoHe would have been  months when we got the diagnosis ndash at that point he was one of  [sufferers] in the world.Murray is described by his family as a ldquoreally happy, content wee boy, and ldquoreally good natured.

support developers are already seeing applications for public meetings lodged without a date or venue for exhibiting future proposals.And Tony Thomas, director of APT Planning  Development in East Linton, says ensuring the building industry is ready to resume as soon as possible may mean future consultations have to be carried out on websites.Mr Thomas revealed that one consultation had already begun online as Queensberry Properties launched a website inviting feedback on its proposals for Finance House in Edinburgh.The website was launched after a planned second public consultation this month had to be cancelled and gives people a chance to view the plans to turn the former office building into residential accommodation with associated commercial and leisure facilities.And it could be the way people are consulted in the future as more companies look at ways to engage with the public without face-to-face gatherings.The first public stage of planning applications for large developments is lodging a pre-application noticewith a council informing them that public consultation meetings are being held.The meetings, which usually take place in town halls or community centres, give local residents a chance to see the proposals for the first time, talk to developers and give their views.However, that crucial stage is on hold for some developments after the lockdown, which prohibits gatherings of more than two people.At Millerhill, Midlothian, a pre-application notice for housing at Wellington Farm on land known as Dukersquos Field has been lodged with no date or venue for the public exhibition.In a note to the council, the developers have said: ldquoIn light of Governmentadvice which seeks to minimise the spread of coronavirus, non-essential contact is

hard to continue lsquoas normalrsquo whilst working remotely and this is hugely appreciated.ldquoIt will be important that as and when restrictions are lted the development industry is ready to respond quickly.ldquoFrom a workload perspective, most clients are looking to progress with projects that are already in the pipeline and to be fair the alternative would be catastrophic for a sector that feels peaks and troughs very quickly.ldquoWhere public consultation is still proposed programmed, the only way to achieve this will be to set up a dedicated website with the ability to post

Almost nobody has been untouched by it, although for some it has been more cataclysmic than others. But we are in this together, and it will be together that we pull through it.One of the real heartbreaking consequences of the lockdown has been the separation of families. Many grandparents now cannot see their grandchildren, or even their own children. Family of people who are ill cannot visit their loved ones. Each story has its own set of circumstances and sadly more is to come before it gets better.While we do need light-heartedness at this time, itrsquos also really important to acknowledge peoplersquos struggles. It was with gut-wrenching despair I realised a number of weeks ago that the arrival of Covid- in Europe was going to seriously affect so many families, my own included.I have five children, but my middle child, who is now  years old, has for the last eight years shared time between Scotland and Sweden.She went to school here until she was seven, when she began to attend school in Sweden. It was then that I had to adjust to the painful reality of less time with her, although I was still able to maintain regular time with her in Scotland and of course keep in daily touch.Itrsquos been an emotional rollercoaster, in which I have stories of me sleeping at airports, travelling through Scandinavian landscape at ungodly hours, and along the way meeting people who have helped and made a real dference. But itrsquos been worth it as it meant our blended family remained connected and my daughter hasnrsquot felt ided between two families but rather a full part of both.We were due to travel to Sweden this Friday andlater, but of course the flights were cancelled a couple of weeks ago. Explaining this to my daughter, and then not being able to say when we would be together was heartbreaking. I felt so helpless, unable to comfort her. Wersquod all counted down the days and now it seems it may be weeks, even months, before any reunion will be possible.I know that there will be families in similar or worse situations. My heart goes out to them all. My initial response to my situation was to close down with despair. The idea of not being with my child, for whom I was the equal main carer until recently, feels unbearable. Some friends have said, with good intentions: ldquoAt least shersquos safe.Yes she is, and I give thanks for that. But any loving parent facing long-term enforced separation from their child will understand the grief that such separation creates. It seeps into your being and makes it dficult to get through the day without having really dark moments. I tried to hide my emotions, but my loving and understanding we knows me too well yet she too felt helpless.There are moments in our lives when we are just overwhelmed by the impossibility of a situation and we just want to curl up and close down. I recently reached that point.Then my daughter asked me while we were talking online: ldquoI wish we could get a magic flying carpet or something dad, or ask the faeries to make a portal. She understood this wasnrsquot possible, but it was the wake-up call I needed. It made me realise I needed to get out of the pit of despair and, for her sake as well as mine, use my creativity to make that magic carpet, and that portal, to help us stay closely connected during this awful time.And the magic ingredient is stories. My daughter has always loved stories, and we have made many up together some of them have even been printed on this page. Now these stories help keep us connected and ease the pain of separation for us both.And so, with the help of technology, and, crucially, a good relationship with her mother, stories have begun to create a vital space for my daughter to be with her Scottish family, even when separated. We can all be together, even my grown-up daughters, who I miss even though they are isolating close by.We storytell to each other, make stories up and even share them in short films. Wee sister Skye, who is six and misses her sister like crazy, holds the tablet which she uses to speak to her, so they can be together while I tell stories and share riddles. We draw and add to the stories together, make fun dramas in which we film ourselves on phones acting out stories like Cinderella, and I have learnt to put wee films together which we can then watch together.Sharing stories like this has given extra meaning to our online communication. It takes us away from just asking ldquohow was your day  or ldquowhat did you do today  questions that often just seem to emphasise our current disconnection. Later, after this crisis is over, the wee films, the artwork and written stories will be memorabilia of this time our evidence that we remained close, even when forced apart.I write about this because I know there are parents and children out there in similarly dficult situations to say you are not alone in this and letrsquos be kind to each other and share the ways we keep ourselves connected. I also know others will have discovered better solutions, as Irsquom no technical wizard.Children are resilient, often more than their grown-ups are, but we need to help them manage this time emotionally, and when we canrsquot give them a hug or be physically with them in hard times, an inheritance of stories they can access can be a real support.I have often been less than enthusiastic about social media in the past, but right now people are discovering in this crisis it has become a leline in many ways.If you, or someone you know, are in a similar situation, please do get in touch. Letrsquos share our experiences, and understand that while we may be isolating, we are not alone."},{"url":null,"title":"european-stone-stacking-championships-dunbar-postponed","story":"The European Stone Stacking Championships were due to take place between April  and , with a place at the World Rock Stacking Championships in Texas next year up for grabs.However, James Craig Page, creator and director of the festival, broke the news that the event, like dozens of others across the county, had to be postponed amid concerns surrounding coronavirus.Mr Page said: ldquoIt has been postponed but we are very hopeful that we will find another venue or be able to go ahead at a dferent time.ldquoHowever, for the time being we have to postpone.This year would have marked the fth year a stone stacking event had taken place in Dunbar event.Each year, it attracts thousands of people to the area, as well as competitors from throughout Europe.Mr Page spoke to the Courier upon ing from the World Rock Stacking Championships in the USA last month.Initially, he was keen to see the European event, which takes place at Eye Cave Beach, off Bayswell Road, take place.However, upon ing to British shores, he became aware of the state of the global issue.Speaking to the Courier, he said: ldquoWe were just waiting for word and advice but it became apparent when I got back how bad things were and that we needed to put it on hold.ldquoWe donrsquot want to be taking any risks with anybodyrsquos health and wellbeing.

New data shows their numbers are plummeting.The curlew, famous for its haunting and evocative call, has been particularly hard hit. Its population has dropped  per cent since .There are an estimated % fewer lapwings, while oystercatcher numbers have slumped by % over the past  years.Experts said the declines, recorded in the Working for Waders annual report, were partly due to the impact of modern agriculture and predators.And they have warned some species could disappear entirelyswt action isnrsquot taken. Now farmers, crofters and other land managers are being urged to team up and make their territory as welcoming as possible for the birds.Creating wader habitats by not draining wet areas in fields, introducing seasonal grazing to prevent damage to eggs or chicks, and controlling predators such as foxes are all steps that could help reverse the trend, said researchers at Scotlandrsquos Rural Collegeand Scottish Natural Heritage .And they have stressed changes can be brought in without removing productive land from use.Professor Davy McCracken, head of the SRUCrsquos hill and mountain research centre, said: ldquoSome actions can be win-wins for farmers, as they benefit both agricultural productivity and the waders.ldquoFor example, applying lime to improve soil pH can increase the abundance of invertebrates the birds prey upon.ldquoAnd, outwith the breeding season, cutting rushes provides the birds with access to those invertebrates across a greater area in any one field.He added: ldquoThe scale of loss has occurred over around  years so, on that basis,you take lapwings, wersquove lost around half of them over that period.ldquoIf we see the same scale of loss over the next  years, we would lose them completely.ldquoAnd the smaller the population gets, the quicker thatrsquos likely to happen.ldquo[It means] there are fewer birds to keep an eye out for predators coming in.Noting that waders are, historically, ldquoas much birds of farmland as of moorland,Mr MrCracken said the impact of modern agricultural methods had been signicant.ldquoThe habitat might have been intensively managed so therersquos more chance of machinery [disturbing a nest], or of livestock accidentally stepping in a nest, he added.Some land managers have already taken steps to boost bird populations.Bruce Cooper, estate manager at Glen Prosen near Kirriemuir in Angus, said he was shocked to see wading numbers ldquofalling through the floor.ldquoWersquore proud to have good numbers of curlews, lapwings and oystercatchers at Glen Prosen, but itrsquos not a matter of luck, he told the authors of the Working for Waders report.ldquoWe work very hard on predator control and habitat management to make sure we keep hold of these birds, and Irsquove no doubt that we would soon lose them altogetherwe stopped doing what wersquore doing.ldquoPredators can wipe out broods of young lapwings, and curlews can be very vulnerable when theyrsquore young.ldquoSo therersquos still time to reverse this and therersquos a lot that inidual farmers and crofters could do on their own land.But Mr McCracken stressed that working together would be vital to protecting Scotlandrsquos birds.ldquoItrsquos becoming clear that in order to be effective, wader conservation has to be rolled out across large areas, with collaborative projects involving multiple farms, estates and landholdings, he said.Working for Waders, which is co-chaired by the SRUC and SNH, has also created dedicated maps to show what activity is currently being undertaken to reverse the declining numbers, and where resources need to be targeted.Robbie Kernahan, Acting Director of Sustainable Growth at SNH, said: ldquoWaders are an integral part of Scotlandrsquos nature, and by working together, we have the best possible opportunity to help them thrive."},{"url":null,"title":"record-745m-wind-power-exported-scotland","story":"New official statistics show more than , gigawatt-hours was transmitted to England and Wales in , more than ever before.The net exports are so high they would have powered every home in the country for  months, the Scottish Government said.Scotland produces far more power than it needs - though forecasts suggest demand for electricity will soar as heating and cars switch away from fossil fuels.The new figures also showed that there were just  hours last year when Scotlandrsquos own energy supply did not meet demand - and it had to import from England or Ireland.This is despite the closure of the giant Longannet coal power station in .Imports during the less than six days when domestic output - including remaining nuclear generation - during those demand are up to but net exports are, nevertheless, also at an all-time high, of nearly , gigawatt-hours.The Scottish Government, in a statistical review, said: ldquoThe fact that Scotlandrsquos own supply is secure, and its abundant generation of electricity via wind means that Scotland has long been a net exporter of electricity.:Why it is feared Scotlands wind power economic boom is all hot airldquoIn recent years, imports have increased as well, rising from approximately  GWh in  to more than , GWh for every year since . This is possibly a consequence of the closure of the coal-fired power station at Longannet in , which has meant that there has been a potential need for Scotland to have non-intermittent electricity generation available.Power generators are currently looking at developing mass superbatteries to store wind and other renewable energy and overcome intermittent supplies.But even without them, low-carbon energy - including nuclear - was able to meet all Scottish demand three-quarters of the time in . That is up from just nine per cent of the time as recently as .Renewables alone met demand %time last year, up from nearly % of the time a year earlier and as little as % in .Scotland has a target of producing the equivalent of % of its electricity consumption from renewables by this year.

However the countrys addiction to primitive gas boilers for inidual homes means it has the continent s worst performance on green heating.Cara Dalzeil, policy officer at Scottish Renewables, suggested growth had slowed down because of decisions made in London.She said: \"The % target is still within reach, but policy uncertainty in recent years has meant our industry has not been able to deploy as much renewable electricity generation capacity as predicted.: Scotland loses again in poundbn wind farm boom after ministers pledge action\"The growth of offshore wind has happened more slowly in Scotland than in the rest of the UK and onshore wind, which makes up the majority of our green power generation capacity, was locked out of the energy market by the UK Government for four years, meaning very few new projects were built.\"We are however now starting to catch up offshore, and onshore wind is once again allowed to access auctions to sell the power it generates. We remain confident that with the growth in generation this will bring, alongside contributions from other technologies like solar, tidal power and hydro, the % remains within reach.\"Scotland has another target: to get half of all energy - for transport and heating as well as current electricity needs - from renewables. The most recent figures, for , put that number at %.Electricity has a long way to catch up with fossil fuels in Scotland.

When we first trawled the area in search of a home, the number of towers and turrets dotted among the hills or peeking from treetops was immediately apparent. They werenrsquot clustered, as in San Gimignano, but inch for inch they matched those on Tuscanyrsquos peaks.Itrsquos a reminder, were it needed, that murderous feuds were once a universal problem, not something dreamt up by Mediterranean dynasties or Scottish thugs. But the Borders saw more than its fair share of violence, and few parts of the country were as heavily fortied in the Middle Ages. While many of these strongholds now lie in ruins, their presence injects an undercurrent of menace to an otherwise idyllic scene.These past few days I have been thirled to my desk, writing about Mary Queen of Scots, who was frequently in these parts. Sometimes she was going about royal business ndash presiding over law courts in Jedburgh for instance ndash but often she was socialising, as when she was one of a hunting party at Traquair. Whatever their purpose, few of her visits passed without drama of some sort. On one particularly memorable occasion she was seeking refuge. In such times, the castles and keeps for which the region is famous, came into their own.The room where I work looks out on to the village green, where no car has passed this last hour, nor anybody walked by the window. The silence is thick. Even wildle seems to be on tiptoe. It is days since wersquove heard a plane, and the initial stream of brightly clad walkers and cyclists from nearby towns escaping the lockdown has long since dried up.With little  to do but get on with the next chapter in Maryrsquos story, I am struck by the irony that in bygone centuries people often went into self-isolation not just willingly but eagerly. Keeping people at a distance was sometimes essential to save your skin. No government edict was required to make these escapees haul up the portcullis or bar the gate. In fact, especially around here, it could be the governors of the day from whom they were retreating.When pestilence swept through communities, those who could afford to flee towns and cities for the countryside did so, for as many weeks as it took. No doubt the fortied dwellings around here came in useful in those circumstances, but itrsquos not what they were built for. Disease could pass through a portcullis or a keyhole, butthe place was well enough constructed, mortal enemies intent on tearing you limb from limb could not.The lordrsquos tower where villagers from Hoolet could run for safety leaves only a trace today. Even when it was a landmark, it was so far off thatdanger had been at the door not even Usain Bolt would have reached it in time. No doubt when danger loomed lookouts would have been posted on the hills, beacons and torches spreading warnings fast. But while living in fear of sudden deadly attack sounds scary, was it any more alarming than the microscopic foe we currently face  Will far-distant historians look back at  and wonder how we coped  For that matter, will we Long before the present emergency, when isolation is an inflexible order rather than a whimsical choice, Irsquove always secretly wanted to live in a fortied keep. Smailholm Tower is my ideal. The thought of looking down from upstairs to see who is knocking on the studded door greatly appeals. A friend who lives in a th-century house in Italy always unlatches the kitchen window, on the first floor, and calls out ldquoFriend or foe  when we arrive. There are no windows at ground level.Borders keeps donrsquot have the space or allure of castles ndash I canrsquot see a series called Escape to the Peel Tower ndash but they are brilliantly designed for splendid isolation. Admittedly those with mobility problems or serious underlying health issues might have trouble reaching the bathroom under the rafters. Nor are they for the very tall, who risk concussionthey sit up suddenly in bed.Generally therersquos one room on each level, and the stairs from cellar to rooftop are a vigorous workout. Just bringing lunch from kitchen to dining table burns calories. The turnpike stair between floors is wide enough for one person only, presumably so you could single-handedly fight off anyone who got inside, skewering them inidually as they appeared. The walls are thick enough to withstand fires intended to smoke you out, the windows too small for any but a sniperrsquos aim, and the parapets heaven-sent for tipping boiling water or tar on to those below. Cannon balls could do fearful damage and eventually bring the household out waving white flags, but that would take time. The most pressing worry for anyone besieged in a keep was lack of ale and hunger. In that respect things arenrsquot so dferent for us.Fleeing from her rebellious lords in June,  Mary Stuart escaped to Borthwick Castle with her disreputable Borderer husband the Earl of Bothwell. Shortly after, the army of those who wanted to depose her set up camp outside. Bothwell managed to nip out the back door, leaving the queen to rail at her besiegers from the battlements. Apparently her language was so foul the ambassador who reported the scene quickly redacted it.Borthwick is built to withstand siege for months on end, but one night Mary was lowered out of a window on to a horse, and rode through the dark to Dunbar. The castle there was all but impregnable. Arguably the biggest mistake she ever made, some days later, was to leave this safe haven.

That meant asking dficult questions, he explained, but only for the purpose of pointing out mistakes so they could be put right. Among those errors was being too slow on testing and not having equipment where and when it was needed.Time will tell how much this constructive engagement dfers from the norm, or whether it is just politics as usual but without the shouting. In a parting question to Sir K, Marr said his predecessor Jeremy Corbyn felt vindicated by the crisis. Did he agree ldquoI donrsquot think that this is about vindicating Labour Party policies. The country wants to see politicians and political parties pulling together to face coronavirus, not claiming victory over arguments or otherwise. That sounded like a good old fashioned telling off.Like Sir K, Scottish Labourrsquos new deputy leader, Jackie Baillie, appeared keen on constructive engagement when she appeared on Sunday Politics Scotland. In her case this included bringing up the row over Scotlandrsquos Chief Medical Officer, Dr Catherine Calderwood, visiting her second home in Earlsferry.ldquoI have enormous respect for her and the job that she does, said the MSP, ldquobut clearly what she did by travelling to her second home was ill-judged.

Since those had to be cancelled due to the virus, Ms Rayner learned of her victory while sitting on her sofa, self-isolating. It was a strange and surreal experience she said, like being in a movie.Earlier in the show, Ridge had asked the Health Secretary how the Prime Minister, who has the virus, was getting on. Hersquos okay, said Mr Hancock, but he still has a temperature so will be staying at home. Later that evening the PM was hospitalised for tests.When Boris Johnson will be out of isolation is unclear.

The lockdown has also spared us some of the less subtle attempts to publicly celebrate the declarationrsquos anniversary. There are some Scottish nationalists who love to quote its famous phrase about oppression, or lordship, by the English asthat is still somehow relevant today. It isnrsquot.So what relevance does the Declaration of Arbroath actually have then  Over the last couple of weeks, Irsquove been trying to answer that question by speaking to historians, writers and commentatorsand a few things have struck me. First, some people still arenrsquot able to put the talk of oppression by the English in its proper context ndash ie the th century. Second, there is a lot of disagreement about what it says, what it means and where it leads. And third, and most important, there are some ways in which the document is still revealing and relevant in  ndash specically, it can show us how to make the UK better. In the age of the lockdown, it also suggests that Scots need a new kind of freedom.To be clear, I do not mean freedom in the traditional Mel Gibson sense, I mean freedom in the very specic way it applies in the United Kingdom. One of the commentators I spoke to about the declaration was Kevin Hague, whose organisation These Islands encourages positive debate about the constitution, and he put it best when he said this: Scotlandrsquos part in the UK works not because of a -year-old declaration, but because of the lack of a declaration that tries to tie the British constitution or identity down.What Mr Hague meant was very specic: the Scots ndash and the English and everyone  in the UK ndash enjoy the protections and security of a union while also enjoying the freedom, without limit, to express and implement a broad range of identities. ldquoThatrsquos an advert for why the UK works, he told me. ldquoScots havenrsquot been oppressed and subjugated to England itrsquos a union which allowed the separate national identities not just to be maintained but to flourish. Who thinks the Scots arenrsquot Scottish as a result of  years of union Seven hundred years on from the Declaration of Arbroath, this is a critical point. The freedom that the declaration was talking about was freedom from military domination by the English, but the freedom thatrsquos relevant now is the freedom to express ourselves while co-operating in a union of nations. It is not a freedom that the nobles who put their name to the declaration would recognise, but thatrsquos the point. It is a modern freedom that cedes sovereignty rather than takes up arms to protect it. Itrsquos freedom as shield, not sword. Itrsquos pluralism. Itrsquos multi-nationalism.It does raise an obvious question though, which is whether we have enough of this kind of freedom in modern Scotland. Nationalists would obviously say \"no, we want total freedom\" whatever that means, but a lot of unionists would also say we need more freedom within the UK. What they mean by that is a properly federal system based on proportional representation which would give everyone in the UK the freedom to express their views but, more importantly, produce governments that accurately reflect those views.The hope for unionists in this is that by promoting and encouraging such freedoms under a federal system, the desire for a more aggressive nationalistic freedom a la  can be contained. Irsquom not saying this would be the case ndash the theory of many of those who supported devolution in the s was that it would burst the bubble of nationalism and we know what happened to that. But maybe we should listen to the words of former Liberal leader Jeremy Thorpe when he tried to introduce a federal system in . ldquoTime and again in our constitutional history, he said, ldquowe have conceded in bitterness what should and could have been granted in logic.Hopefully,  years on, logic can still be an answer to bitterness, although we canrsquot avoid the fact that the history of  years ago is still emotionally and politically powerful. But take a look, logically, at the story of those seven centuries. The Scots confidently asserted their identity in  and have done so ever since, within and without the union.

There have been concerns around jobs and safety.The organisers of the petition are seeking to halt the plans and are asking for an independent assessment of the decisions and decision-making process around the project to be carried out.A number of MSP#s have stood in opposition to the plans, including Orkney#s Liam McArthur and Shetland#s Beatrice Wishart.Mr McArthur said: “I have been raising concerns about HIAL’s plans to centralise air traffic services for some time now. No-one disputes the need to modernise the way in which these services are delivered, but even HIAL’s own consultants identied the ‘remote tower’ option as the most risky and costly.“The estimated costs of the project appear to fall far short of what will realistically be neededit is to have any chance of being delivered successfully. At the same time, staff have made clear the lack of proper consultation and the intention of many to leave the organisation. If that happens, our leline air services will be at risk of serious disruption.“After the members debate earlier this year, led by my Shetland colleague, Beatrice Wishart, the petition will give parliament a further opportunity to consider this issue. These proposals will have a profound effect on our island communities, so it is right that MSPs, particularly those representing the Highlands and Islands, have the chance to hold HIAL and Scottish Ministers robustly to account”.The petition can be found here.

Youngsters like Somhairle Macdonald, Ewen MacSween, John MacLean and Allan MacLeod had established themselves along with several survivors of the  team – Cowie, Willie MacRae, Peter Gordon, John ‘Bodach’ Mackenzie, Ally MacDonald and Ewen MacKinnon.With  minutes played the islanders doubled their advantage.McCormack takes up the action: “John MacLean delivered a corner into the danger area, and with keeper Kenny MacDonald under pressure Cowie took two attempts before slipping the ball over the line as he tumbled face-forward onto the pitch”.Skye’s fans were in dreamland but, as the reporter had noted: “Kyles are famous for their battling qualities”.By half time the match was level.From a powerful hit in from the right the ball broke to veteran Dan MacRae “who had time and space to place the shot beyond the reach of keeper MacKenzie.”Then, calamity struck Skye in the closing moments of the half.“Another massive hit in by Tom White caused panic in the Skye defence, and as MacKenzie lashed out in an attempted clearance the ball appeared to come back past him off team captain MacSween”.Seconds later it took an outstanding save from MacKenzie to deny Dallas Turner and prevent Kyles from turning around in the lead.Murchison’s men regrouped.“The second half had been underway less than  seconds before Skye retook the initiative thanks to a corner which was turned in by Cowie, with Peter Gordon hovering to pick up on any mistake.”For much of the second half Kyles were kept well away from the Skye danger area, but a fourth goal proved elusive – thanks in large part to legendary goalkeeper Kenny MacDonald.And with Skye just eight minutes away from sealing a place in the final the men in blue hauled themselves back from the brink.Our reporter said that Dallas Turner “had looked the likeliest threat” and it was the youngster who “saw a glimmer of an opening and fired in a shot which took a deflection and flew past Bodach MacKenzie and into the net”.“That was the signal for the islanders to lay siege to the Kyles goal and for the Tighnabruaich keeper to dig dep with a string of exceptional saves.”MacLean, Somhairle MacDonald , Gordon and Cowie were all denied before the whistle sounded to herald extra time.In “energy-sapping heat” it was hardly surprising that the added half hour was more low-key, but five minutes into the second period came a “glorious chance” for Skye.Referee Donne Fraser spotted an infringement in the area, and the islanders were awarded a penalty.Rankin stepped up, but was unable to make clean contact and the “scuffed spot hit was easily turned away by MacDonald”.And so to a penalty shoot-out. Both goalkeepers excelled themselves, MacDonald saving two, and MacKenzie doing likewise. With Kyles - ahead, Rankin had to score to force sudden death, but his shot sailed wide and it was Kyles who went through to the final.Ian McCormack concluded: “Rankin was hero as well as villain. Once he got the measure of Ronnie MacVicar he dictated play from the centre, giving a hundred per cent in effort and running himself into the ground in the process. Up front Willie Cowie was immense – especially for a player just back from injury.“And while the defence as a whole were tight, Willie MacRae at buckshee back gave another award-winning performance.“If there was a man of the match award it would undoubtedly have gone to Kyles keeper Kenny MacDonald, who had excellent cover from full back Fraser MacDonald.“Their most dangerous forward was Dallas Turner, while that veteran Dan MacRae showed he still has a few seasons left in him at the top level.”In the final Kingussie, in the middle of a run of seven-successive Camanachd Cup triumphs, proved too strong, though Kyles gave a good account of themselves and had taken the lead before succumbing to a - defeat.The redoubtable Kenny MacDonald was the final’s man of the match, but his remarkable career had still some way to run. Both he and namesake Fraser # the full back in the epic tussle of  – would again pick up winners’ medals in , by which time Kenny’s son Roddy had also emerged as a star of the sport.For Skye the wait for another shot at the big one goes on – with the club also missing out in semi finals in  and .Allan MacLeod, the current Skye co-manager, reflected on that game at Ballachulish – recalling that he played much of the first half without a contact lens.“I remember marking Dan MacRae – a fantastic player. But it was great chance for us.“We were the better side for much of it, but not for the first time Kenny MacDonald was the saviour for Kyles.“At the time Kingussie were virtually unstoppable and we’d have met them in their prime. Our chance of winning the cup may have been slim, but it would have been nice to have made the final.“A lot of that Skye team would have deserved a shot on that stage.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3059734.jpg--.jpg?1585738355000\n","title":"northern regional college makes local ppe donations","story":"NORTHERN Regional College has donated a consignment of personal protection equipmentto hospitals, nursing and care homes across the local area as a sign of solidarity and support for frontline NHS workers at this dficult time.

His move comes after the repeated failure of the Health Department to commit to provide PPE in sufficient quantity to frontline healthcare workers.Over recent weeks, workers in hospitals and care homes as well as other frontline workers in pharmacies and GP practices have been crying out for additional PPE supplies to protect them from contracting the coronavirus. However, despite repeated calls — the most recent being yesterdayby Royal College of Nursing director Pat Cullen in a meeting with the First and deputy First Minister — frontline workers speaking to the Andersonstown News say there is still a widespread shortage of equipment.A full-face visor is a vital —but scarce —defence for NHS workers in face of coronavirusAmong the most valued but hardest-to-get items is the full-face shield now being manufactured by Shnuggle of Newtownards, a company which previously focused on baby products.

The shields are being produced following open source blueprints which means they can be replicated by any other company across the globe without paying a royalty to Shnuggle.On hearing of the new source for the highly-prized face shields, several care homes across Belfast made immediate bids for supplies. One care home alone said it could take  shields immediately.Pete Boyle has taken steps to share the open source manufacturing detail with groups in America where there is a similarly deadly shortage. #We should stop trying to source this equipment from China and start manufacturing it now.

Shops and suppliers donating donuts, pot noodles and washing up liquid in trailer loads. Community workers on phones checking in, breaking isolation. Neighbours collecting prescriptions and putting them on garden walls. Grandchildren mowing grass and waving in at grandparents through the window while leaving dinner on the doorstep.From decisive and coordinated community actions to the gentle noticing and caring of neighbours who were once strangers, we see something incredible awakening from this silent, invisible virus.

We are blessed enough that we have a big back garden and their dad is actually their coach, so he has been able to set up some skills and training drills for them.They have been doing that daily, so we might actually have some good hurlers by the end of all this.Though home schooling such a range of her children is dficult, Danielle said it is a team effort, with the older children helping the younger ones.

There will be guidance given that you leave the parcel at the front door, that it#s wiped down and you don#t go into the house and stay the two-metre distance away, she said.She said the initiative will complement existing measures, such as the Department of Education making direct payments for free school meals.In recent weeks community groups have been enlisting volunteers to help vulnerable people isolating from the coronavirus pandemic. On Saturday Belfast Multi Cultural Association worked with St Patrick#s soup kitchen to donate  dinners to homeless and vulnerable people in the city centre.

Pregnancy itself alters the body’s immune system and response to viral infections in general, which can occasionally be related to more severe symptoms and this will be the same for Covid-.Can a pregnant woman pass coronavirus on to her baby Transmission from mother to baby during the pregnancy or delivery is probable, although the proportion of pregnancies affected and the signicance to the baby has yet to be determined. Amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swabs, placenta swabs, genital fluid and breastmilk samples from Covid- infected mothers have so far tested negative for the virus. However, a new report describes a case in which the baby born to a Covid- positive mother was found to have antibodies in their blood at birth. This is thought to represent a baby’s response to infection within the womb.Is there a greater chance of miscarriageyou test positive for Covid- There is currently no evidence of an increased risk of miscarriage or early pregnancy loss in relation to Covid-.Moreover, there is no evidence that the virus damages the baby. Despite recent evidence that the virus can be passed from mother to baby, the proportion of pregnancies affected and the signicance to the baby has yet to be determined.What symptoms should pregnant women be aware of, and what should they dothey are experiencing any of them If you are infected with Covid- you are still most likely to have no symptoms or a mild illness from which you will make a full recovery. Most women will experience only mild or moderate cold flu like symptoms. Cough, fever, shortness of breath, lack of smell taste and even gastrointestinal symptoms are other relevant presentations.For women who have had symptoms, antenatal appointments can be deferred until  days after the start of symptoms, unless symptomspersevere.For women who are self-isolating because someone in their household has possible symptoms of Covid-, appointments should be deferred for  days.If women develop more severe symptoms or her recovery is delayed, this may be a sign that they are developing a more signicant chest infection that requires enhanced care. In this situation you should contact your maternity care team.Are all antenatal appointments going ahead as normal in Northern Ireland If you are well at the moment and have had no complications in your previous pregnancies arrangements for your care may be altered but they are still important to attend.If you have a routine scan or visit due in the coming days, you will still need to attend but the appointment may change due to staffing requirements. Maternity care is essential to reduce complications in mothers and babies. Even in the context of coronavirus, it is important that pregnant women continue to attend their scheduled routine care when they are well.Pregnant women will be asked to keep the number of people with you to a minimum. This will include being asked to attend maternity appointments alone.There may also be a need to reduce the number of routine antenatal visits.If women have an urgent problem related to the pregnancy but not related to coronavirus, they should get in touch using the same emergency contact details they already have. They should not contact that number unless they have an urgent problem.If women have symptoms of coronavirus, they should contact their maternity service and they will arrange the right place and time for the visits. They should not attend a routine clinic.What risks are there of an expectant mother contracting Covid- on a trip to hospital for an antenatal appointment Maternity care is essential and has been developed over many years with improving success to reduce complications in mothers and babies. The risks of not attending care include harm to mother, her baby or both.Many provisions have been put in place to reduce risk to mothers. These include reducing the number of visits to the hospital to a minimum, advice to mothers on reducing the number of people travelling with mothers to the hospital, attending the appointments alone, keeping numbers reduced in waiting rooms, spacing patients in waiting areas, staff taking additional protective efforts to reduce transmission in clinics with hand washing, cleaning equipment etc.How prepared are hospitals to deal with pregnant women with the virus Very signicant changes have been occurring in hospitals over the past weeks to deal with pregnant women with Covid-. Signicant changes have been made in all areas of the hospital, from clinics to wards and including delivery suites. Practice drills are being run frequently to train staff, additional resources have been brought in to help and a huge effort has been made by all levels of non-clinical, clinical, administrative and management staff.If the mother of a baby has symptoms or tests positive for Covid-, should she isolate herself from the baby Given the current limited evidence, we advise that women and healthy infants, not otherwise requiring neonatal care, are kept together in the immediate post-partum period.A risks benefits discussion with neonatologists and families to inidualise care in babies who may be more susceptible is recommended.Can a new mother with the virus breastfeed The main risk of breastfeeding for infants is the close contact with the mother, who is likely to share infective droplets. In the light of the current evidence, it is advised that the benefits of breastfeeding outweigh any potential risks of transmission of the virus through breastmilk. Precautions should be taken to reduce spread to the baby such as, hand washing before touching the baby, avoiding coughing or sneezing on the baby while feeding, and considering wearing a face mask,available, while feeding or caring for the baby.Can a pregnant person be accompanied by a partner or have visitors A person in labour can be accompanied by one birthing partner, according to the new guidelines. No visitors are permitted in ante-natal or post-natal ward areas.Will babies continue to be delivered in all Northern Ireland hospitals No, not at Causeway Hospital in Coleraine. Antenatal services will continue but it is not possible to deliver babies in the hospital during this surge period.This is due to a lack skilled paediatricians available to provide emergency care to a baby born in distress throughout the  hour period. To protect the wellbeing of mothers and babies, women booked to deliver in Causeway will be contacted and have their delivery transferred to Antrim or Altnagelvin Hospital.Should parents introduce their newborn to friends and family Current government guidance is that you should not meet with people outside your household, so no family celebrations are permitted at present.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Dr Calderwood attended Methodist College in Belfast. In a statement released on Sunday morning, she said: I wish to apologise unreservedly for the issue reported in the media today.While there are reasons for what I did, they do not justy it and they were not legitimate reasons to be out of my home.While I and my family follow the guidance on social distancing at all times, I understand that I did not follow the advice I am giving others, and I am truly sorry for that. I know how important this advice is and I do want my mistake to distract from that. I have a job to do as chief medical officer to provide advice to Ministers on the path of this virus and to support the medical profession as they work night and day to save lives, and having spoken with the First Minister this morning I will continue to focus entirely on that job.Dr Calderwood said she was also at her second home last weekend with her husband.It has since emerged that police have visited Dr Calderwood and issued her with a warning.Scotland#s Chief Constable Iain Livingstone said in a statement: Earlier today, local officers visited Dr Catherine Calderwood and spoke to her about her actions, reiterated crucial advice and issued a warning about her future conduct, all of which she accepted. The legal instructions on not leaving your home without a reasonable excuse apply to everyone.Just days earlier, the -year-old doctor tweeted a photo of her family from their main residence in Edinburgh as they clapped for the frontline NHS staff working to stop the spread of Covid-. The paper says the home in the capital is just two-and-a-half miles from the Scottish Government building where Dr Calderwood delivers daily briefings on the virus with First Minister Nicola Sturgeon. Earlsferry is a drive of more than an hour from Edinburgh. The images emerged amid continuing advice from the CMO and other leading medical professionals and politicians to stay at home in order to save lives and protect the NHS. Last month, the Scottish Government issued a travel warning criticising the irresponsible behaviour of people with second homes and campervans travelling to the Highlands in a bid to isolate. On Friday, the Scottish First Minister said the upcoming Easter break would be a holiday period unlike any we#ve had in our letimes. Dr Calderwood also stressed people should adhere to the restrictions, and said it was looking less likely summer holidays will take place this year as they have done previously. Dr Calderwood#s colleague, Scotland#s National Clinical Director Jason Leitch said nobody knows the social distancing guidelines better than her and she would not have put people in the area of her holiday home at risk. Speaking on BBC Breakfast, he said: My understanding is that she has worked like the rest of us   on this for weeks now and that family do have a home a little bit away from Edinburgh and they went to check on it. They observed social distancing throughout, so they were very safe. Nobody knows those guidelines better than Catherine and the rest of us. So I#m confident that she was safe during that, her family were safe and those around them were safe. A Scottish Government spokesman said on Saturday: Since this start of this epidemic, the CMO has been working seven days a week preparing Scotland#s response. She took the opportunity this weekend to check on a family home in Fe as she knows she will not be back again until the crisis is over. She stayed overnight before ing to Edinburgh. In line with guidance, she stayed within her own household group and observed social distancing with anyone she was in passing in the village.Nicola Sturgeon said: The chief medical officer made a mistake in travelling away from her home. Whatever her reasons for doing so it was wrong and she knows that. She added: All of us, including me, will make mistakes in these unprecedented times we are living in. When we do we must be candid about it and learn from it. She said the CMO is learning from her error, and added: Over the past few weeks, as we have been dealing with this crisis, her advice and expertise has been invaluable to me. She added that not withstanding her mistake on this, she is doing extremely well. Ms Sturgeon said Dr Calderwood had offered to do whatever is in the best interest of the country. The First Minister added: In my view, that would not be her resignation.Belfast Most ReadBelfast born chief medical officer apologises after being pictured visiting second home during coronavirus lockdownQUB professor steps aside from top architectural role over affair claimArdoyne murder: Police believe single gunman shot notorious gangster Robbie Lawlor deadPolice probingLimerick gangsters set up Ardoyne murder of brutal killer Robbie Lawlor Former Belfastjournalist Betty McCaw passes away after contracting Covid-,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Like a B-rated sci-fi movie, our world is being ravaged by a killer virus which will affect tens of thousands, maybe millions. No-one knows. The experts disagree. Politicians do too, though that’s less of a concern. Worst, there is no certainty of a happy ending, with a superhero with special powers and a shiny suit to sort it all out. In a world where for almost all illnesses, we have effective diagnosis and treatment, and international experience and research to guide management, this Covid  lark is beyond our comprehension.We people who are accustomed to a pill for every ill must readjust to a new set of paradigms. googletag.cmd.push The prospect of arbitrary illness and possible death, without the presence of loved ones at the bedside, and for those of faith, the comfort of the sacraments, is terrying. For families, being unable to have the beautul and peculiarly Irish ritual of farewell, a wake and funeral to grieve and offer thanks, compounds the dread. We know that the young and healthy are likely to come through this, and that it is our elderly who are likely to succumb. Many of the sacrices we make are to protect the vulnerable and those who care for them. But there are no guarantees that any of us is safe. googletag.cmd.push Prince and pauper are vulnerable-tho it’s fair to assume that the prince isn’t coping from a homeless shelter or wracked with worry about how the bills will be paid. As with all human endeavour, there is goodness in abundance. People are delivering hot meals from their own resources to the isolated and vulnerable. Supermarket staff are stocking shelves, scanning tins and packets and smiling through the fear. Council staff empty bins, clean the streets and work from home to keep the wheels of this city turning. Bus drivers, mechanics, what we used to call lorry drivers but are now logistics operatives, all are at their posts, so that we can eat and stay healthy. Mammies and daddies, facing their own worries are reassuring their children that all will be well, putting them over their lessons and trying their best to keep them occupied and safe.So many people who have left work are offering their skills and experience to help in whatever way they can. Machinists skilled from years in Derry’s factories are working at home making masks to protect their neighbours. An incredible , people have volunteered to help the beleaguered NHS. A friend confided regarding her own health worries that she wasn’t concerned so much about herself, but about what might happen her mother with dementia, for whom she cares at home. This is love in action. Our postman came this morning, our usual chat done at two metres distance. We still managed to cover our usual repertoire of politics, weather, health and families, while keeping two metres part. My washing machine packed in. Well I think it’s a vital service, so I rang the man, fully expecting him to tell me to get lost. He told me he would look at it, but wanted to work alone, as his son is immunosuppressed. He came in the back door, I left the money in an envelope, and my clothesline now flutters with clean sheets. I feel especially for our young people, the unique, primal, mad impulsive joy of teenage springtime pulsing in their veins with the first sunny days. They are staying indoors, chatting online, putting in the days, making mad memes for the craic and to keep sane. My niece, doing her Leaving, and with no prospect of exams, is still doing a bit of study, and helping her daddy plant spuds.Her school days ended without the rituals of parties and goodbyes. Even our wee Fionnuala, my four year old grandchild, who lives with us and is the light of our lives in these dark days, knows that school is now at the kitchen table, because of the bad germs which and might make people sick. She washes her hands hourly - and the floor and walls - with enthusiasm and great care. Everywhere, people are doing what they must, often at great personal cost, while struggling with their own worries about work, bills and what the future will bring. They do these things cheerfully and in the best way they can. Superheroes don’t always wear fancy costumes, they are all around us. In these surreal times, we see our old certainties and values exposed as worthless. They seem to have been replaced by an older and more tried and tested value system, less about rights, and more about what is right. Let’s hope that these lessons stick when Covid  is a distant memory.

Slaughtneil, Ballinderry and Craigbane have emerged since , before going on to take provincial honours. There has been a new breed coming knocking at the door in recent years in the form of Glen, Lavey and reigning champions Magherafelt. Over the coming weeks, the County Derry Post will select a series of Derry club teams from the last decade. Up first is Michael McMullan, who delved through the ious players on the club scene to select his team of the decade, from  to .  – Antoacutein McMullan  googletag.cmd.push Began his knock-out championship career with a man of the match performance in the  quarter-final against Glenullin. McMullan was forced to successfully change his kick-out strategy when Mickey Moran introduced a more fluid central spine. Was immense in  against Kilcoo and Kilcar as Slaughtneil won a third Ulster title.  – Oisin Duffy  Despite failing to break into the Derry minor team in his final year, Duffy went on to play at senior level for the county. He was the driving force at the heart of Foreglens drive to two intermediate championship titles and their stint in senior football. At home as a marker or initiating attacks from his role at centre back. googletag.cmd.push  – Dermot McBride  McBride was one of the best man markers in the red and white of Derry during the early part of the decade. In his club colours, he carried on this level of consistency and has played anywhere in the back six – helping them to the  county final. He has defied a series of injuries to extend his playing career to this season.  – Karl McKaigue  The Emmets defender has been one of the main reasons behind Slaughtneils watertight unit. In , he held his direct opponent scoreless in all eight games on their way to the Ulster title. He is not just a maker, he is comfortable on the ball and has often been a receiver of short kick-outs to help his side build from the back.  – Brendan Rogers  Made his name as a full-back, but has excelled anytime he gets let loose on the wing. Ballinascreen tried to pull him out in a county final and he went on the rampage – building attacks. He attacked Ballinderrys Ryan Bell last season and when the Emmets were defeated by Glen, Rogers almost reeled them back in.  – Connor Nevin  Won a championship medal in this first season in  and went on to pick up another three, including an Ulster title as captain five years later. Has played everywhere from full-back to midfield. In recent years, when Ballinderry have been away from the top table, he still puts his shoulder to the wheel. A tough, yet quiet, character.  – Chrissy McKaigue  Made his debut while still in the minor grade, McKaigue spent a brief spell with Sydney Swans at the start of the decade, but ed to be spiritual leader of Slaughtneils golden era. He has played at full-back, but is more at home in the centre where he can dictate the terms of the game. Will regularly get forward to chip in with a score.  – Patsy Bradley  Was his debut as a high-fielding wing-back  years ago, but it was only a matter of time before he became Slaughtneils midfield general. Patsy may lack the height of many other midfielders but certainly made up for it with his salmon-like jump and hang time. It was inspirational and he often popped up when Slaughtneil needed him most.  – Niall Holly  Had he not picked up a nasty shoulder injury at the vital conjuncture against Scotstown, two years ago, Coleraine may well have pushed on an picked up an Ulster title. Can play at full-back but a colossus at midfield and his absence from the county team has been a huge void. Tall, mobile and tough. The perfect midfielder.  – Sean Leo McGoldrick  The number on the jersey is irrelevant for Sean Leo, giving his possession game from wing back to wing forward. He has to be every managers dream. Busy, comfortable on the ball and always takes the right option. When Lavey threatened to stage their late comeback in the  final, it was Sean Leo at the heart of their insurance point.  – Enda Muldoon  Made his senior debut as a goalkeeper in the  McGlinchey Cup. The following season, he spearheaded Ballinderrys attack on their way to his first championship. It was the start of a stellar career of arguably the best club player of his generation. A chief scorer, a target for kick-outs and can pass the ball with effortless accuracy.  – Enda Lynn  Some county players fade away in club football. Enda Lynn is not one of them. Despite being kicked from pillar to post, as Greenloughs talisman, he led the Wee Reds from intermediate football to being seconds away from a senior county final. Handles the ball more than most and is potent as an inside forward.  - Raymond Wilkinson  Crook has played in a number of roles for Ballinderry. His two goals sank Kilrea in the  final and he found the net the following year to break Banaghers resolve in the semi-final. He has played both as busy link man in the half-forward line and inside for Shamrocks. He also made a comeback to play in recent years.  – Mark Lynch  Came to prominence as a  year old, in Derrys last All-Ireland minor win. Was always destined for greatness. Played up front for Banagher and led the line to perfection and his six points almost shot them into the county final. Switched to midfield when they won the intermediate title and last season, they were touching distance from the senior decider.  – Conleith Gilligan  Was Derry minors penalty scoring goalkeeper in . Three years later he led Ballinderry to All-Ireland sevens success as the fly keeper, but came to the fore as the playmaker for their All-Ireland club win. In his later years, he reinvented himself as an inside forward, where he carried their scoring mantle until he eventually retired.

The new system will be operational from Monday next, April , to assist in dealing with increasing requests from the public regarding excess refuse that has been accumulated as a result of the current emergency situation. Karen Phillips, Director for Environment and Regeneration with Derry City and Strabane District Council, told councillors yesterday that the new service would include a dedicated helpline that would be manned, Monday to Friday from am to pm, with a team of staff to process and categorise all calls. googletag.cmd.push The calls would be fed into a central system, that in turn will co-ordinate each request for collection by district ward, with each area being served on specic allocated days of the week. It was outlined to members that only excess residual, green and garden waste would be collected, with no provision being made for bulky waste collections, which unfortunately cannot be collected during this emergency situation. Collections would be carried out by area and on specic days of the week and only directly from domestic premises that have made pre-arranged collections with Council, with no kerbside waste being permitted. It was reiterated to members that this service is an emergency response to assist in resolving the increased pressure on waste services and the public will be strongly advised that they must continue to fully utilise the existing refuse collection services that continue to operate as normal. googletag.cmd.push The council said they will continue to put a strong emphasis on the recycling message, re-enforcing the need for the public to continue to maximise the use of their blue and brown bins. It is hoped that this additional service will assist in providing support to vulnerable members of the community and those with specic issues with medical or additional residual waste, such as larger families and will prevent fly-tipping. She reassured members that refuse collection staff providing this service would be adhering to strict social distancing guidelines and health and safety measures. She said checks to identy members of the public who are self-isolating would be done by staff prior to the collection being arranged. Members were informed that messaging and advice on double bagging also be communicated to those availing of the service, adding that the council would review the service on a daily basis and had the capacity to put additional resources in place according to demand. It was also outlined to members that the new service, while being operational from next week, would take a number of days to roll out and the public would be encouraged to be patient and co-operate with council during this process.

He said: ““We have been getting an increased number of calls from the public who have additional waste and following the Government directive to close our household recycling centres, have nowhere to take additional waste. We appreciate that many are spending more time at home and accumulating more waste however, we would encourage people to do all they can to reduce waste by reducing, recycling and reusing where possible. “Our refuse collection services are operating as normal and we feel that most people have adequate provision through this service. For those with larger families, or specic medical needs, we understand this is a dficult time and are keen to help. We hope that this new helpline will assist us in doing that and reach out to the people in our communities who need additional help and support.” He added: ““It is important that people note that we are dealing with a pandemic emergency situation therefore this is not the time to do a major spring clean and expect the Council to come pick up large pieces of furniture, mattresses or white goods. We do not have the capacity to do this during this time and would encourage the public to refrain from this type of work or to store it within their garages or sheds until our bulky waste service is operational again.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Behind his boyish grin, he is consuming the fading remnants of county final Sunday. Its all about savouring the scene where unforgettable memories were made. Every last second. In his interview with the County Derry Post, the Rossa forward confesses to not having attended many county finals. They were a dficult watch, like running your eyes over the dream you may never have. Now its real and over the hours and days which follow, Magherafelt would deservedly celebrate like never before. The clubs senior famine was over. googletag.cmd.push Three days later, McElhone would be back in the inner sanctum of a dressing room on final day, this time as a part of Enda Quinns U management team. In the midst of Monday nights celebrations, he had one eye on Lavey. They were going to be a tough assignment, he admitted. Any team with Matthew and Callum Downey on board was going to be a serious proposition. But, theyd give it a lash. When game day arrived, conditions were dficult, but it was Magherafelt who prevailed, adding to their senior, reserve, U , U and U championships. Their U, U and minor leagues were also added, on the back of being the current U champions – before withdrawing to concentrate on preparations for an Ulster clash with Kilcoo. googletag.cmd.push “The negative was, theydidnt get their proper nights sleep the few days before a vital championship game,” states Enda Quinn, who doubles up as the clubs current Youth Officer. They were amidst the celebrations, looking on as their heroes brought home the John McLaughlin Cup. “At the same time, you cant tell them to go home, because you may never see this in your letime again,” said Quinn, who had a son on the U squad. “The positive was that it gives you the ammunition to go again, after seeing what success had done. The show of senior players at thefinal...to a man they were all there. “They were coming down onto the field and they were making heroes out of our Us for winning a championship, it was unbelievable.” Eoin McEvoy and Aaron Murray picked up the Downey cousins. Earlier in the season McEvoy would anchor Ciaran Higgins minor defence from number six. He has a huge future ahead of him. Magherafelt went into the final without the services of Luke McCann who sustained a serious concussion in their drawn semi-final with Dungiven. “He was our full-back, he is a serious player and, last year, was playing on Derry Us,” Quinn added, tipping him for this years Derry minor team. Before a ball was kicked, Magherafelts chief rivals were Bellaghy and Lavey. However, Dungiven turned out to be the secret assassin after making progress during the season. WATERSHED MOMENT “When you saw the quality in the forward line, I wasnt overly surprised at it,” Quinn admits. “The highlight of our season was the replay against Dungiven. We were six points down, a man down, we were without Luke McCann and went on to beat them by six points in extra-time. To me, that was the watershed moment.” At minor level, Magherafelt won the league and pushed eventual Ulster champions Lavey every step of the way in the championship. From that squad, Eoghan Hawe and Johnny McErlain, along with players like Aidan McCluskey and Shea McGuckin - who are still eligible for club minors in  - will stepinto senior football next season. “We had a wide with the last kick and theygot a goal with a minute or two to go and us two points up. It couldve went either way and they went on to win Ulster, so at least you know you are there or thereabouts.”  Derry U champions Above the minor grade, Quinn hailed their U crop that would add to Adrian Cushs senior plans. Some of them had won Ulster minor medals with Derry and helped bring the MacRory Cup to St Marys Magherafelt for the first time. Below, at U level, Magherafelt lost to Dungiven in the Feacuteile final, but ed to clinch the league and championship double. “That was a big achievement there,” said Quinn, who spent countless years with Magherafelt youth teams. After chatting to a handful of Dungiven Gaels, they came to an agreement. Magherafelt were unlucky in the Feacuteile and lucky in the championship. It balanced itself out. Though they had to win the championship without one of the best U players in the county, Cahir Spiers, who was dismissed in their convincing semi-final win over Bellaghy. This seasons Feacuteile has since been cancelled, but Magherafelt wouldve be front runners again after winning the U championship at the tail end of last season and sharing the U AB competition, one for clubs who can field a second team.  Magherafelt won the U ladies championship It was also a year to remember for the clubs U ladies. In , they joined the boys in bringing home All-Ireland Feacuteile. “The girls came through after a really tight ding-duster with Ballinascreen. They have put in savage work and the year before had won the All-Ireland Feacuteile as well as the boys.” LEGACY Their season had a positive impact on all ages of club activity, but it was the manner of their senior football win that will leave the greatest legacy and a winning culture. Enda Quinns thoughts rush back to the start of the story. The championship draw was made on a Thursday night and for the second year in a row, they were pulled out to face the county champions, this time it was Coleraine. “On the Friday night we lost our best player, Michael McEvoy, to a cruciate injury,” Quinn adds. “I dont care what anybody says, your championship draw is everything. When you draw Slaughtneil or Coleraine, it is a downer.” He doesnt buy into needing to beat the best in the first round, it is all about getting a favourable draw. Aside from a comfortable win over Ballinascreen, the Rossa won their other three games by a point “The Coleraine game, they were reasonably in control of it until Emmettscored the goal. The Banagher game,it had went on a another five minutes, they couldve won it.  Magherafelt reserves also won the championship “We were playing champagne football for the first  minutes and going six or seven points up, we looked like we couldve won convincingly. At that stage, I thought wed win this game and really be in a position to compete with whoever came through the other semi-final. “Until we beat a Slaughtneil, Coleraine or Ballinderry, somebody like that, in the championship we werent serious contenders. “We dominated the final and we will be a better team for that. Plus, the fact you have Michael McEvoy back, as well as Peter Quinn and Ryan Ferris coming in.” During his own playing career, Quinn played at corner back up through the ranks before getting to senior. By that point, the spine of his team had drted away. Now, breaking onto the senior team is a dferent proposition. “Our retention of players is excellent at the minute, but it is now a case of how we get them all football that we need to look at.” Every year their senior squad has grown, bit by bit. Quinn looks back to their  All-Ireland Feacuteile winning team. Fergal Duffin, Antone McElhone and Shane Heavron have graduated to senior level, while another - were on the this year’s reserve winning team. “In  a good chunk of that team won a minor championship and were beat in the final at St Pauls. We have won four out of the last six Feacuteile titles.” Quinn still ranks Slaughtneil as the bestteam in Derry and refers to them doing so without a plethora of underage A titles. Beating Coleraine last season should be the beginning of a regular Magherafelt assault on the senior championship and something like  players at the first senior meeting of the season radiates the enthusiasm. Some will drt, but most will stay. “Nearly every one of our senior team has won something at underage, be it a Feacuteile, an U or a minor championship. When you are producing player after player, it gives you a better chance. “Like a lot of clubs, we have put a huge effort into our underage structures over the years and this is now starting to pay off.” Away from the pitch, coronavirus – like in all clubs – has put a stop to all activity. “I know the word is overused, but the buzz around the club was unbelievable . We just hope when the whole thing is back up and running again, that the buzz is still there. It was a fantastic opportunity for us to really push on from there.” Magherafelt had  tickets sold for last Saturdays Champions Dinner, which had to be postponed. It was ignited as a night of celebration for the senior and reserve team. It wasnt like the average gala with tables being sold for outsiders to wine and dine a table of strangers, in a fundraising capacity. It was a Magherafelt night for their own. “This was going to be the biggest ever gathering of Magherafelt people,” Quinn said. Getting a new date is the clubs plan. Its not that easy. When the current pandemic ends, fixtures will take priority, though the club are really determined to hold theat some point during . The recent upgrade of the clubs gym shows the commitment placed in the senior team. There is a thirst for more success. For the underage talent to have their glory days at a packed Celtic Park. “We are in a good place,” Quinn begins to conclude. “ was a fairytale. At the start of the year, you wouldnt dared to dream as high as that, in my opinion. “You have to lap it up and you have to enjoy it. In  you could win nothing and you may not win a senior championship for another  years. Who knows...but youd sincerely hope not. “We are in a good place, from a footballing point of view and from a club point of view this has been a huge gelling experience. You are a town club and it is hard to have the same level of camaraderie because it is so spread and there are so many things going on, but  has done an awful lot for us as a club.” The year was capped off when the Gerry Crossan Memorial Trophy was awarded, as Derry club of the year, at the annual Derry GAA presentationin Tullyglass. Not a single soul in theroom could disagree. It was the icing on the cake. RELATED - The year that changed a club. Click here...

Magherafelt went into the final without the services of Luke McCann who sustained a serious concussion in their drawn semi-final with Dungiven. “He was our full-back, he is a serious player and, last year, was playing on Derry Us,” Quinn added, tipping him for this years Derry minor team. Before a ball was kicked, Magherafelts chief rivals were Bellaghy and Lavey. However, Dungiven turned out to be the secret assassin after making progress during the season. WATERSHED MOMENT “When you saw the quality in the forward line, I wasnt overly surprised at it,” Quinn admits. “The highlight of our season was the replay against Dungiven. We were six points down, a man down, we were without Luke McCann and went on to beat them by six points in extra-time. To me, that was the watershed moment.” At minor level, Magherafelt won the league and pushed eventual Ulster champions Lavey every step of the way in the championship. From that squad, Eoghan Hawe and Johnny McErlain, along with players like Aidan McCluskey and Shea McGuckin - who are still eligible for club minors in  - will stepinto senior football next season. “We had a wide with the last kick and theygot a goal with a minute or two to go and us two points up. It couldve went either way and they went on to win Ulster, so at least you know you are there or thereabouts.”  Derry U champions Above the minor grade, Quinn hailed their U crop that would add to Adrian Cushs senior plans. Some of them had won Ulster minor medals with Derry and helped bring the MacRory Cup to St Marys Magherafelt for the first time. Below, at U level, Magherafelt lost to Dungiven in the Feacuteile final, but ed to clinch the league and championship double. “That was a big achievement there,” said Quinn, who spent countless years with Magherafelt youth teams. After chatting to a handful of Dungiven Gaels, they came to an agreement. Magherafelt were unlucky in the Feacuteile and lucky in the championship. It balanced itself out. Though they had to win the championship without one of the best U players in the county, Cahir Spiers, who was dismissed in their convincing semi-final win over Bellaghy. This seasons Feacuteile has since been cancelled, but Magherafelt wouldve be front runners again after winning the U championship at the tail end of last season and sharing the U AB competition, one for clubs who can field a second team.  Magherafelt won the U ladies championship It was also a year to remember for the clubs U ladies. In , they joined the boys in bringing home All-Ireland Feacuteile. “The girls came through after a really tight ding-duster with Ballinascreen. They have put in savage work and the year before had won the All-Ireland Feacuteile as well as the boys.” LEGACY Their season had a positive impact on all ages of club activity, but it was the manner of their senior football win that will leave the greatest legacy and a winning culture. Enda Quinns thoughts rush back to the start of the story. The championship draw was made on a Thursday night and for the second year in a row, they were pulled out to face the county champions, this time it was Coleraine. “On the Friday night we lost our best player, Michael McEvoy, to a cruciate injury,” Quinn adds. “I dont care what anybody says, your championship draw is everything. When you draw Slaughtneil or Coleraine, it is a downer.” He doesnt buy into needing to beat the best in the first round, it is all about getting a favourable draw. Aside from a comfortable win over Ballinascreen, the Rossa won their other three games by a point “The Coleraine game, they were reasonably in control of it until Emmettscored the goal. The Banagher game,it had went on a another five minutes, they couldve won it.  Magherafelt reserves also won the championship “We were playing champagne football for the first  minutes and going six or seven points up, we looked like we couldve won convincingly. At that stage, I thought wed win this game and really be in a position to compete with whoever came through the other semi-final. “Until we beat a Slaughtneil, Coleraine or Ballinderry, somebody like that, in the championship we werent serious contenders. “We dominated the final and we will be a better team for that. Plus, the fact you have Michael McEvoy back, as well as Peter Quinn and Ryan Ferris coming in.” During his own playing career, Quinn played at corner back up through the ranks before getting to senior. By that point, the spine of his team had drted away. Now, breaking onto the senior team is a dferent proposition. “Our retention of players is excellent at the minute, but it is now a case of how we get them all football that we need to look at.” Every year their senior squad has grown, bit by bit. Quinn looks back to their  All-Ireland Feacuteile winning team. Fergal Duffin, Antone McElhone and Shane Heavron have graduated to senior level, while another - were on the this year’s reserve winning team. “In  a good chunk of that team won a minor championship and were beat in the final at St Pauls. We have won four out of the last six Feacuteile titles.” Quinn still ranks Slaughtneil as the bestteam in Derry and refers to them doing so without a plethora of underage A titles. Beating Coleraine last season should be the beginning of a regular Magherafelt assault on the senior championship and something like  players at the first senior meeting of the season radiates the enthusiasm. Some will drt, but most will stay. “Nearly every one of our senior team has won something at underage, be it a Feacuteile, an U or a minor championship. When you are producing player after player, it gives you a better chance. “Like a lot of clubs, we have put a huge effort into our underage structures over the years and this is now starting to pay off.” Away from the pitch, coronavirus – like in all clubs – has put a stop to all activity. “I know the word is overused, but the buzz around the club was unbelievable . We just hope when the whole thing is back up and running again, that the buzz is still there. It was a fantastic opportunity for us to really push on from there.” Magherafelt had  tickets sold for last Saturdays Champions Dinner, which had to be postponed. It was ignited as a night of celebration for the senior and reserve team. It wasnt like the average gala with tables being sold for outsiders to wine and dine a table of strangers, in a fundraising capacity. It was a Magherafelt night for their own. “This was going to be the biggest ever gathering of Magherafelt people,” Quinn said. Getting a new date is the clubs plan. Its not that easy. When the current pandemic ends, fixtures will take priority, though the club are really determined to hold theat some point during . The recent upgrade of the clubs gym shows the commitment placed in the senior team. There is a thirst for more success. For the underage talent to have their glory days at a packed Celtic Park. “We are in a good place,” Quinn begins to conclude. “ was a fairytale. At the start of the year, you wouldnt dared to dream as high as that, in my opinion. “You have to lap it up and you have to enjoy it. In  you could win nothing and you may not win a senior championship for another  years. Who knows...but youd sincerely hope not. “We are in a good place, from a footballing point of view and from a club point of view this has been a huge gelling experience. You are a town club and it is hard to have the same level of camaraderie because it is so spread and there are so many things going on, but  has done an awful lot for us as a club.” The year was capped off when the Gerry Crossan Memorial Trophy was awarded, as Derry club of the year, at the annual Derry GAA presentationin Tullyglass. Not a single soul in theroom could disagree. It was the icing on the cake. RELATED - The year that changed a club. Click here...

The health trust is also enhancing care at home packages for the vulnerable and elderly in the community.Mr Hazzard said the local community will be understandably concerned about the ldquodramatic changes to the hospital and that some may even be angry.ldquoDuring this global health emergency, we must put our faith and support in the expert health practitioners who are best placed to take these decisions, he continued.ldquoI welcome the public commitment from the South Eastern Trust that these are strictly temporary measures to meet the unprecedented challenges represented by the coronavirus pandemic and will not become a permanent reality.Mr Hazzard said that in the days ahead, many queries and issues will arise from the health trustrsquos decision, both from the public and those who work in the health and social care system.He declared: ldquoSinn Feacutein will continue to engage with the health trust and other agencies to ensure there is public confidence in this radical approach.ldquoWith this in mind we have written to the Ambulance Service to ask that they urgently reassess their capacity to meet the subsequent needs of our local community on the back of this announcement.Mr Hazzard also appealed to the community to do all in its power to help and assist health and social care workers who find themselves at the frontline in the battle against COVID-.He added: ldquoThey are doing an incredible job in the most challenging of circumstances to keep us all safe. We must demonstrate real social solidarity in order to help and support them in the unprecedented crisis ahead..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/1st April 2020 A\u0026E.jpg","title":"A%26E shut in Downe  ","story":"THE Downe Hospitalrsquos emergency department has been temporarily closed as part of sweeping changes implemented by health chiefs preparing for the expected surge in coronavirus cases.The department closed on Monday morning with critical care staff and some equipment relocated to the Ulster Hospital in Dundonald as part of a radical overhaul of services to cope with the global pandemic.The day procedure unit, outpatients department and minor injuries service at the Downpatrick hospital have also been closed, but the critically important GP out-of-hours service remains operational.Inpatient wards and acute mental heath and psychiatry services for the elderly remain open, as does the hospitalrsquos midwery-led unit, but no births are being allowed to take place for the time being.The South Eastern Trust said that as the organisation prepares ldquofor the biggest challenge it has ever faced it needs to reshape its hospitals and other services on a temporary basis to maximise its ability to ldquomanage the surge in demand for services due to COVID-.While local politicians have reluctantly accepted the closure of several key services at the Downe as part of a reconfiguration plan, they say public and private assurances from senior health trust officials that the changes are temporary must be honoured and all services fully restored when the crisis is over.News of the closure of the Downersquos emergency department and other services came ahead of confirmation that the Downpatrick hospital is one of  locations across the Province which has been designated as a primary care COVID- assessment centre which is expected to open before the end of the week.The new centre mdash designed to help manage the expected increase in coronavirus cases in the community mdash will allow patients who are showing symptoms of the virus to be separated from those with non COVID- conditions.Health chiefs insist that the new service is ldquoessential to ensure that vital GP services can be maintained over the coming weeks and months with minimum disruption.The new centre is not a testing facility and is only there for patients who are unwell and suspected of having the virus and require medical attention. Patients will not be able to report directly to the centre without being referred by their own GP or the Downersquos out-of-hours service.In addition, patients attending the centre will receive appropriate treatment, assessment and,necessary, onward referral to hospital.The new centre is designed to allow GPs and health and social care staff to work together in a suitable clinical environment and to plan what is best for the inidual in terms of treatment and any additional care they need.Defending the decision to close a number of services at the Downe Hospital, the South Eastern Trust says that each of its hospitals and services has a vital role to play in the fight against COVID-.ldquoWe must now make changes to some services in all of our hospitals to prepare for the additional critical care services needed and to achieve the best possible outcomes for our patients, it said in a statement.ldquoWe must deploy our staff and resources to best position us to provide the critical care which will be required for our local populations and to give our staff the essential training they need in order to equip them as much as possible for the challenge ahead.The health trust says that it needs to ensure that its staff can be as prepared as possible to help fight the impact of COVID-.The statement continued: ldquoRetraction of the most acute services from some sites, in a planned manner, is the best way to support our entire patient population and gives our staff the best chance to prepare for and manage the challenges and pressures upon us.ldquoThe Downe Hospital will play a vital role as part of the hospital network in responding to this crisis, particularly through the provision of inpatient services and through working alongside primary care to enable as many patients as possible to be cared for at home.Health chiefs say they believe it is imperative to respond now to provide the local community with the best possible outcomes and also to support staff as best it can.The health trust says it recognises the importance and value of all its sites and services within its communities.The statement adds: ldquoThe Trust would like to assure the community that changes made over the coming weeks and months are solely part of the effort to meet and manage the challenges presented by COVID-, the scale of which we have never faced before.ldquoAll service changes will continue to be reviewed and monitored, with the intention to fully restore services to normal as soon as possible. Every one of us has a role to play in the fight against coronavirus. We urge the public to help us protect themselves and others by staying at home and following all advice.Health chiefs say that with the situation rapidly changing plans must continue to be flexible and have asked for everyonersquos commitment and support ldquoduring these most dficult times..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/1st April 2020 Call.jpg","title":"Call on public to tidy up dog mess  ","story":"A LOCAL politician has called on dog owners across the district to clean up after their pets.Rowallane politician Kathryn Owen expressed particular concern about the issue in Saintfield, describing the area between the townrsquos health centre and pharmacy as ldquodisgustingrsquo.Dog dirt poses a major health risk, particularly to children, as the faeces includes roundworm eggs which become infectious after about three weeks and can remain so for up to two years.Just one pile of dog dirt can contain a million roundworm eggs and can lead to stomach upsets, throat infections, asthma and, in some cases, blindness in humans.Given the ongoing battle to contain the deadly coronavirus, Cllr Owen said the last thing needed is a battle against another disease.She said that with many more people at home and likely to remain so for the next few weeks, the number of dog owners taking their pets for a walk will increase.ldquoWe donrsquot have the same level of street cleansing being done at the moment as Newry, Mourne and Down Council is operating with skeleton staff, explained Cllr Owen.ldquoI am appealing to dog owners to take waste bags with them and please clean up after their pets. We are trying to fight onedisease, we donrsquot need to fight another one.Pointing to the disgusting state of the footpath which links the health centre at the Ballynahinch Road in Saintfield with a pharmacy in nearby Main Street, Cllr Owen appealed to dog owners to be more considerate ldquoso everyone can enjoy thewelcome breath of fresh air with the pets.Her concern comes two weeks after another Rowallane councillor, Billy Walker, urged the local authority to press ahead with a plan to arm enforcement staff with body cameras in a bid to help address the districtrsquos dog fouling and fly-tipping issues.The move mdash along with using CCTV cameras to help identy offenders mdash is currently being examined by local authority officials.Last year, an enforcement action plan to tackle the dog dirt problem was agreed by the local authority which is also working with the Dogs Trust to promote responsible pet ownership across the district to reduce dog fouling.Cllr Walker said elected representatives have been ldquoinundated with complaints from ratepayers about the dog fouling issue and reaffirmed that he is keen for existing legislation to be strengthened to deal with offenders.He also cautioned against painting all ratepayers with the same brush as there are many who clean up after their pets.ldquoWe clearly need an action plan to deal with issues which are a blight on our district, he declared.ldquoI have consistently called for law breakers to be lsquonamed and shamedrsquo and council officials are seeking legal advice on such a move and any implication doing this would have on data protection legislation, said the Rowallane councillor.He added: ldquoEveryone has a responsibility and a duty of care to make sure they clean up after their pets. Dog dirt is not only unsightly but poses a health risk to young children in particular.ldquoIf people break the law they should be heavily fined and named and shamed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/1st April 2020 Singer.jpg","title":"Castlewellan singer becomes online sensation  ","story":"A CASTLEWELLAN grandfather has penned a song in praise of the selfless effort made by NHS workers during the COVID- pandemic.Terry Cowan has become a Facebook sensation during the lockdown with his performances of popular Irish songs.The traditional musician and singer wrote the song, Our Teamrsquos Thatrsquos Dressed in Blue, with one of his daughters very much in mind as shersquos a nurse.So far the ballad has racked up more than , views on social media.Terryrsquos Facebook fame began when he performed several songs on St Patrickrsquos Day ndash and itrsquos been growing ever since.The -year-old businessman says therersquos a growing demand for emigration songs from people who are apart from their sons and daughters.Terry, who runs Financial Directions and Property Directions in his home town, said his new found fame came about due to feeling bored on St Patrickrsquos Day when he was self-isolating at home with his we Patricia.ldquoThis has blown out of all proportion, to be honest, I did not understand the power of social media, said Terry.ldquoI was bored out of my brains on St Patrickrsquos Day and my we, Patricia, suggested that I record a couple of songs on Facebook and thatrsquos what I did. I chose Three Leafed Shamrock and If We Only Had Old Ireland Over Here because they mentioned shamrocks and I got , views in  hours. Irsquove got comments from America, Netherlands, Europe, Australia.ldquoNormally our St Patrickrsquos Day consists of going to mass in Castlewellan, then heading to the Lodge and entertaining the community until lunchtime where everybody comes in for a bit of craic. Then we take the grandkids around ious venues where they all play and then itrsquos back home at about pm.Terry is the father of three daughters, the eldest being Slieve Croob councillor Roisin Howell, whose son Ruaacuteiriacute is currently the youngest ever over- All-Ireland Uilleann piper.

He plans to perform songs with an emigration flavour such as Song For Ireland, My Fatherrsquos House, Boston Rose and a medley of Rambles of Spring The Old Dungarvan Oak.ldquoThe songs are touching a chord with people who are far away from family at home so Irsquom getting a lot of requests, nearly too many to do all of them. I have people who are telling me that they are in tears at forwarding on a song to their son or daughter whorsquos where, added Terry.ldquoIrsquom getting - comments a time, I feel humbled. A lot of people are thanking me for lting their spirits and taking their minds of the situation now. The reason Irsquom keeping it going is for the health and wellbeing of the people in the community. The response Irsquove got from people in Downpatrick has been amazing.ldquoSadly, Irsquom very conscious that I hope that the people who are listening to me now will still be listening to me in six monthsrsquo time.Like many other people who are in self-isolation now, Terry is thinking of better days ahead.ldquoWouldnrsquot it be great to go on to a football field and host a massive concert after this is all over to say thank you to all those NHS and key workers who are looking after us all, he said.ldquoWe donrsquot know how long this is going to last, so in the meantime Irsquom going try and continue to sing an odd old song.

All of the centres are monitored by CCTV.While all council meetings have been cancelled, it is understood that the permanent closure decision was taken after talks between council officials and the leaders of the local authorityrsquos main parties.In February, the Recorder revealed that the local authority was considering closing sites in Downpatrick, Castlewellan and Ballynahinch on a Sunday, traditionally one of their busiest days of the week, with staff trade union representatives consulted on the issue.It is understood that a number of reasons were cited by local authority officials considering a Sunday closure, including the fact that the other civic amenity sites in Camlough, Crossmaglen, Kilkeel, Newry, Newtownhamilton Warrenpoint and Hilltown already close on Sunday.They were previously under the management of the former Newry and Mourne Council, while civic amenity sites in Down District have always been open on a Sunday.Council officials also revealed recently that they discovered that ratepayers in other parts of the district whose local amenity site is closed on a Sunday were using the sites in Down District.There are also reports of ratepayers in the Ards and North Down Council area using the Downpatrick and Ballynahinch sites on Sundays.The temporary closure of all civic amenity sites comes after it was announced recently that the district is recycling just over  per cent of its waste, passing the Northern Ireland average for the first time. The total amount of waste being recycled locally has increased by five percent.In relation to the recycling centre in Downpatrick, local council officials are working to have mains power connected to the Flying Horse Road.They were forced to hire a generator at a weekly cost to ratepayers of pound to power lights, staff accommodation and some specialised skips and containers which are capable of compacting materials.Council officials are asking ratepayers who have any queries to visit recycling@nmandd.org and they will endeavour to respond to you as quickly as they can..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/1st April 2020 Crossgar.jpg","title":"Crossgar child wants people to have Faith as she offers advice  ","story":"A LITTLE Crossgar girl has become an internet sensation with her public safety plea urging people to fight the coronavirus outbreak.Four year-old Faith McGreevy was captured on video by her mother, Lisa, last week repeating the public health warning to combat COVID-.ldquoYou have to stay in the house for two weeks or maybe  weeks, says Faith in her message. ldquoAnd when you stay in your house and stop going everywhere, like SuperValu, then the bug will go away.Faith, who attends the nursery at Cedar Integrated Primary School, adds thateveryone does what they are told ldquothe bug would go away soon and then we could go everywhere again.Faith says that when she grows up she wants to be a doctor because she likes to make people well again, or maybe a cleaner because she loves helping her mum tidying the house ndash she canrsquot decide yet.Her mum says she has a ldquoterric grasp of current affairs and is never short of an answer.Describing her daughter as being ldquono mug, she said: ldquoWhen me and her dad Robbie wanted to wean her off the dummy we told her she should give it to Santa.ldquoShe agreed saying it was a great idea, but could she have the other dummy that was in the kitchen drawer.Faith seems to be coping well with not being at school over the past few weeks due to the lockdown.Lisa said: ldquoSometimes Faith would ask me why canrsquot she canrsquot play with her friends, but in general she is coping very well with the nursery closure.ldquoIt is a great opportunity to bond more with her little brother, one year-old Eoin.

Some have even been threatened with detainmentthey remain here without a visa.ldquoThe embassies understandably have never faced such demand for aid here, and yesterday [March ] were unable to advise on shelter or food water, which meant people were left with no lelines or hope.

They say anyone who needs assistance of this kind should contact other agencies.Downpatrick foodbank co-ordinator Shirley Lennon said the organisation regretted the changes it has had to make.When referrals are made, the name of the person, size of their family and address will be logged, alongside other helpful information including locations, post codes and details including the colour of their front door and what local landmarks they may be close to.Mrs Lennon said that the food parcels will be left outside the clientrsquos door and volunteers will not be entering peoplersquos homes.In addition, she confirmed that deliveries will be made every Wednesday and that as food supplies may be limited, the volunteers can only distribute what they have.Under the new guidelines, food donations can only be made at dedicated collection points at the Asda and Supervalu stores in Downpatrick at the Ballydugan retail park and Ballymote shopping centres respectively.Mrs Lennon said donations could no longer be left at Downpatrick Presbyterian Church.She said volunteers continue to be grateful for the support of many people to help needy families at what are challenging times for everyone.Two weeks ago, the foodbank launched a new drive through facility in response to the coronavirus epidemic but has had to abort this to comply with Public Health Agency advice.Volunteers will still be relying on peoplersquos generosity to help them cope with demand in what are unprecedented times and have been pleased with the publicrsquos response to help them continue helping families in need.The foodbank hopes that shoppers will continue to think about the charity when they are shopping and leave items at the dedicated collection points in local stores as they are expecting increasing demand on the service.The Fountain Foodbank contact details are  , email fountainfoodbank@gmail or visit www.downpatrickpresbyterianchurch.org.The Pantry Foodbank in Newcastle has also implemented a home delivery service to ensure the health and safety of volunteers, with all deliveries taking place on Thursday.Further information about Newcastle deliveries is available at   or via the foodbank Facebook page.

Dr McBride is not only CMO, he has directly relevant experience of infections, having become a consultant specialist in one of the worst pandemics, HIV, almost  years ago. \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Other experts include Dr Alan Stout, chair of the British Medical Association GP committee in NI, who has for weeks calmly stated that the UK has some of the world’s best scientists, that the advice is good and should be followed.When I tweeted recently about the UK’s outstanding scientic leaders, some people wonderedit was a sleight on the Irish experts. Yet I assume that the Republic has similar numbers pro rata of brilliant medical and scientic people to the UK, but the latter has almost  times more people and  times more experts.Republicans haveaccused unionists of slavishly following British advice, when almost the opposite has happened: all the key figures in Northern Ireland’s response to the crisis support close co-operation with the Republic, as makes sense on an island, while republicans have obsessively promoted all-island responses, and trashed the overall UK approach.The party wants a severe lockdown, closing manufacturers such as Ulster Carpets who say they are practising safe social distancing for employees, yet it delayed on granting powers to the PSNI . NI was the last place in the UK to clary what police could do.Ms O’Neill is implying that the WHO and UK have an utterly erging approach, when in fact they have largely the same approach with some dferences.It is not unreasonable for the deputy first minister, without expertise, to think that one group of scientists is right and another wrong. Lord Sumption, the ex Supreme Court judgewho said the UK Covid- response was hysterical , pointed out that we are not ruled by scientists. We apply our own critical faculties to advice he said.But what a coincidence that in applying such critical thinking, Sinn Fein cannot find a UK gesture that it likes, such as soldiers rapidly helping increase hospital beds for the patients for whom republicans profess such concern or the Treasury using its firepower to offer big support to business and citizens.If Ms O’Neill and her party are so damning of the UK, it is strange that they never issued a critique of the records ofearly deliberations of Britain’sScientic Advisory Group for Emergencies . The war historian Sir Lawrence Freedman analysed them for the long respected, left leaning New Statesman journal. It showed how experts were agreed on some responses, but uncertain or ided on others. The UK is now behind on tests but few nations have found it easy: the Republic set up community tests before retreatingwhen it was swamped. Testing has been a problem for all but the most prepared places like South Korea .The UK is badly behind on Personal Protection Equipment and ventilators, as are most nations.But the WHO is not beyond criticism. Its response to the situation in China in January was at first confused and perhaps complacent and I suspect it is too trusting of the recent Chinese data of miniscule infection rates and death numbers. WHO also seemed unable to answer easily this newspaper’s elementary query on whether global data distinguished between deaths of people who had the virusand deaths caused by it . Such a distinction is crucial to understanding the lethality of coronavirus.The validity of some early UK concerns are becoming apparent, such as damage to mental health of starting lockdown too early .It is not surprising, or even wrong, that republicans saw first Brexit then Covid- as opportunity for a cherished, centuries old goal of a single independent Ireland.What is wrong is that they have bought into an abnormal system of mandatory coalition , which can only work on the basis of collective responsibility . After Brexit, Sinn Fein cited RHI to collapse devolution but then made other demands for its . Now they openly undermine cabinet colleagues, as Ms O’Neill did to the Health Minister Robin Swann on Thursday’s BBC The View.When other parties challenge this and a row ensues some people blame ‘both sides’. But most people are not fooled as to what is going on.No Irish government will ever call the party out. The question is whether the UK sovereign government one day might, and then move to make such abuse impossible.• Ben Lowryis News Letter deputy editorWHO accepts dficulties teasing out true Covid- death rates—— ——A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Performance of the Oberammergau Passion Play : Freelance“The nd Oberammergau Passion Play will be postponed due to the current situation caused by the corona pandemic.”In the Baian district of Germany, beside the Ammer River and framed by the Ammergau Alps, Oberammergau is a small town known for its woodcarvings, its NATO School and its internationally renowned -yearly Passion Play.The organisers of the Passion Play summarised the historical signicance of the postponement, explaining that the event “goes back to a vow made in . At that time, the people of Oberammergau vowed to perform the suffering, death and resurrection of Christ,no one died of the plague anymore.Engraving depicting the Passion Play in  : Freelance \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Therefore the plans to perform the Passion Play in  are currently beginning.”Held in the ‘decimal year’I attended a performance in , one of the most vivid and moving experiences of my letime, and indeed, I had toyed with the thought of ing this year.There would have been  performancesstarting in mid-May with an expected , visitors from around the globe paying between € to € for a ticket.The enormous production has been running since  except for two cancellations and a postponement.Crucixion scene in the Passion Play in  : FreelanceNearly half of the , residents of today’s Oberammergau are involved with the show - actors, musicians, front of house, backstage and looking after the horses, sheep, goats, cows and doves that add to the often intensely dramatic scenes.The other half of the townsfolk run the restaurants, shops, hotels, BBs and farmsteads where many of the visitors stay,they’re lucky.The nearest accommodation I could get in  was St. Anton am Arlberg in the Austrian Tirol.Participants in the production must have been born in Oberammergau or have lived there for  years.Oberammergau on the River Ammer in  : FreelanceIt’s not unusual for up to four generations of the same family to be taking part in the same run of plays, which can involve around  children on stage at the same time.In the th century, passion plays were held in many parts of Europe, often performed on carts in the street.They re-enacted Christ’s last days, from his entry into Jerusalem to his trial, crucixion, resurrection and ascension.In the bigger and more elaborate productions, when scene one ended the cart trundled off to another part of the town or city and scene two arrived, and so on!They were the ‘poor man’s Bible’ enabling even the most illiterate become familiar with Bible stories.But Oberammergau’s is the only play with its origins in a collective vow to God which has run, almost without a break, for approaching four centuries. This unique double-accolade brought the town a UNESCO World Heritage award.It’s quite likely that passion plays were already common events but a document in Oberammergau’s archives records “the first decades of the th century went by in peaceful calm…but then followed the Thirty Years’ War with all its hardships from  until . As early as , infectious diseases spread in Baia. This village was spared by dutul vigilance until the church festival in , when a man brought the plague into the village.”More than  local folk died and almost every family lost loved ones.“Faced with the great distress that the terrible illness inflicted upon the population,” the archive continues, “the leaders of the community came together and pledged to hold a passion tragedy once every ten years. From this day forward, not a single person perished, even though a great number of them still showed signs of the plague”.They made the pledge in  and the Passion Play was first performed at Pentecost in , on a wooden stage that some say was built on plague-victims’ graves near the church.Surviving documentation from the  production shows that the play ran ‘completed smoothly’ with seating provided ‘for spectators standing close by.’From  the date of the performance was changed to the beginning of each decade, by which time folk were coming from all over Germany to see substantial productions.Paint and painters for the  show’s scenery cost  guilders, ‘the gentlemen trumpeters’ got two guilders and  guilders went ‘to the actors for drink’!There was no performance in  when Maximilian III’s Clerical Council banned all passion plays and when another threat loomed in the s the so-called ‘mad’ King Ludwig II of Baia protected it from those who wanted to close down the ‘harmful’ passion plays. Following WWI the play was postponed until , and there was a special th anniversary show in  attended by Adolf Hitler.There were no performances in  during WWII, just the second cancellation…until now.Plans to perform the Passion Play in  are already under way, for over  five-hour shows, several thousand participants, a -strong orchestra and a -strong choir.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

The aim is that these virtues help to form them.With such a vast space at its disposal, the school ensures that children are given a rich and versatile experience.In the orchard, pupils pick fruit from pear, apple, plum, and damson trees which they use in cooking lessons during the autumn.They also grow  dferent kinds of fruit, salad, and vegetables in a polytunnel.Earlier this year, St Josephrsquos Primary was awarded a gold award in the UNICEF Rights Respecting School programme.The award is granted to schools which show a commitment to promoting childrenrsquos rights and raising awareness of these amongst young people.It recognises efforts to place the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child at the heart of a schoolrsquos policies and practice.ldquoAlongside our work on rights is the fact that we want our children to be aware of their responsibilities, said Mr Rein.ldquoYes, they have rights to be heard, but they also have a responsibility to listen to others.St Josephrsquos was the first school in Wales to develop a pupil parliament.Every child is a member of the parliament, and elected representatives from eight student groups form a cabinet which has decision-making powers.ldquoThe school parliament is a vehicle for the pupils to have a voice, so they can decide how the school can be a better place, how the local community can improve, and how we can help the UN to achieve their global goals, continued Mr Rein.ldquoSo the children are looking inward ndash at themselves and how the school environment can improve ndash and looking outward at how we can develop better links with the parishes and the areas of Penarth and Dinas Powys.ldquoOur Eco Ministry has been involved in a project to tidy beaches and pick up plastic, and our Healthy Schools and School Mission team have given food to local foodbanks.St Josephrsquos Primary is one of  innovation schools which have been chosen to contribute to the Welsh Governmentrsquos new curriculum framework, which will be rolled out to every school in Wales by . As part of the new framework, schools are required to design their own curriculum based upon the needs of specic learners, rather than adhering to a national learning program.St Josephrsquos curriculum is lsquoresearch-ledrsquo, meaning it is based on findings in child development and cognitive science.Teachers have undertaken training on how childrenrsquos bodies and minds develop, and lessons have been designed to enhance pupilsrsquo personal, social, and physical development.Mr Rein said: ldquoWe want our children to develop physically in terms of their gross motor skills, their fine motor skills, and their locomotion skills.ldquoWe have apparatus on which they can hang, climb, and swing, to build up their core strength.Mr Rein called the schoolrsquos curriculum lsquoreally ambitions.rsquoldquoWe are one of sixteen innovation schools in Wales helping to implement the new curriculum and develop special projects to do with the curriculum, he said.ldquoWe have taken that on by focusing on a knowledge-rich curriculum, so that we develop childrenrsquos knowledge, skills, and give them fantastic experiences.ldquoWe have taken good, rich materials from lots of dferent places, and developed some of our own, which we have implemented to a high standard.ldquoBehaviour in the school is exemplary partly because we have spent a long time asking what good teachers do.ldquoWe practice together as staff, so our teachers are working at a high level using a very well-researched curriculum.In last yearrsquos maths reasoning test,  per cent of pupils at St Josephrsquos scored higher than the national average, and  per cent of pupils scored above average in the National Reading TestldquoWersquore extremely proud of our achievements at St Josephrsquos, said Mr Rein.ldquoEverything we do is based on the best available research and is designed to help each inidual child thrive.The schoolrsquos curriculum has recently been praised by cabinet member for education and regeneration, Councillor Lis Burnett, who said St Josephrsquos had done a lsquobrilliant job.rsquoShe said: ldquoThe new Curriculum for Wales is inspiring schools to take a more holistic approach toward learning.ldquoIt encourages them to focus more on how and why the curriculum is being delivered, rather than delivering specic content and academic results.ldquoSt Josephrsquos have done a brilliant job in helping craft this approach, and in turn have seen their own curriculum and learning practices blossom. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Youre doing this to a tight timescale, and what you offer children on Monday may be dferent to what you offer next Wednesday.\"Mr Barton said that initially, schools will be doing all they can so that pupils who need to can still turn up to their own school after the weekend.In the longer term, there will be more strategic planning of school provision, he added.Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers , said: \"The Government has made clear that every child who can be safely cared for at home should be. And their advice makes clear too that this applies to children of key workers.\"For the vast majority of children and young people, school buildings will close tonight and not reopen for the foreseeable future.\"Taking up a place at school during this time of wider closure is the offer of last resort, for the minority of key workers, who have no alternative.\"School leaders have many questions that remain unanswered about how this will work in practice. We will continue to work with the Government throughout the day to provide greater clarity to schools to enable this reduced offer to be up and running as soon as possible.\"Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, added her voice to calls from school leaders urging parents to only send their children in as a last resort.She said: \"This is a very long list and could result in some schools having the majority of pupils attending. This will not achieve the goal of slowing the spread of the virus.\"So it is vitally important that parents follow government advice to keep their children at home, wherever possible. Schools can only accommodate a limited number of children and the fewer children making the journey to school, and the fewer children in educational settings, the lower the risk that the virus can spread.\"The competition watchdog has launched a taskforce to tackle businesses looking to exploit the coronavirus outbreak to take advantage of customers.The Competition and Markets Authoritysaid the outbreak has prompted concerns that people could be exploited by companies \"charging excessive prices or making misleading claims about their products\".It said it has already contacted traders and s over excessive pricing of hand sanitiser as part of its efforts.Andrea Coscelli, the CMAs chief executive, said: \"This is obviously a time when we all have to behave responsibly to protect our fellow citizens, and particularly those who are most vulnerable.\"We urge retailers to behave responsibly in the exceptional circumstances of the Covid- outbreak.\"Butthey do not, our taskforce is monitoring market developments to enable us to intervene as quickly as possible.\"We have a range of options at our disposal, from warnings to enforcement action to seeking emergency powers.\"The ceremonial of the Changing of the Guard at Buckingham Palace, St Jamess Palace and Windsor Castle is being postponed until further notice \"in line with Government advice to avoid mass gatherings\", Buckingham Palace has announced.The palace said in a statement that the situation would be \"reviewed on an ongoing basis, with a view to restarting when appropriate\". article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Irsquove grown up on the beach.ldquoI normally take landscape pictures because I love the water and some of the sunsets here are incredible, especially in the winter.Rochelle wrote her Instagram handle on the parcels, so that people who found them could send her a message.ldquoIt was just to make someone smile, and Irsquove had some lovely comments from people who got back to me on Instagram, she said.ldquoThey said they were going to put it up in their room and frame it.ldquoSome people were feeling a bit down and didnrsquot expect to find anything, so it cheered them up.ldquoMy job was done ndash the main purpose was to make people smile and it did - it made me smile too.ldquoI think itrsquos very important to say hello, especiallypeople are living by themselves orthey havenrsquot got their family around.ldquoWhen Irsquom normally walking the dog I say hello and have a chat, but itrsquos quite hard to do that now because everyone is quite wary.ldquoI donrsquot have to have that physical contact with someone to brighten up their day.ldquoArt is just a dferent  to communicate with. You knowsomeonersquos a bit shy and they donrsquot want to speak using words, they may want to draw a picture and open up that way instead.ldquoI think art can show feelings that words canrsquot quite express, so itrsquos a great idea to share that with the community.At a time of uncertainty and doubt, Rochelle ended with a message of hope and solidarity:ldquoI think as a community we could do so much more at this time, she saidldquoEveryone is concerned about how long it is going to last, but I am hopeful we can get past it, andwe all work together and remain positive we may come out of this in an even better situation than we was before.Rochelle would like to make clear that all parcels were fully sanitised.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Everyone should seek to behave responsibly. https:t.co fzEFunUXmdash Matt Warman MPApril , ldquoTo hear that crackpot theories are leading to people attacking phone masts or threatening telecom workers is sickening and itrsquos clearly time to act, Mr Knight said.ldquoWersquove called on the Government to work with social media companies to stamp out deliberate attempts to spread fear about Covid- and it is right that they are being called to account for allowing disinformation on their s.A number of posts showing phone masts on fire, as well as others encouraging such behaviour, have been removed from s such as Facebook.Numerous scientists have repeatedly stated that there is zero evidence to link G and Covid-.Brendan Wren, professor of microbial pathogenesis at the London School of Hygiene  Tropical Medicine, said: ldquoThere is no scientically credible evidence to link the introduction of G masts with the Covid- outbreak.ldquoThis would be both a physical and biological impossibility.Adam Finn, professor of paediatrics at the University of Bristol, said targeting the internet connections and phone masts which were playing a vital part in the global response to the virus was akin to ldquoknocking holes in your leboats while your ship sinks.We have received several reports of criminal damage to phone masts and abuse of telecoms engineers apparently inspired by crackpot conspiracy theories circulating online. Those responsible for criminal acts will face the full force of the law.The facts ##https:t.co QWYccbOEgmdash DCMSApril , Downing Street has also hit out at Russian ldquodisinformation after a state-run news agency claimed Boris Johnson would soon be put on a ventilator as he struggles with coronavirus.Russiarsquos RIA-Novosti had claimed the Prime Minister would be put on a ventilator, citing a ldquosource close to the leadership of the NHS.The PMrsquos spokesman said: ldquoThat is disinformation. Our specialist government units have seen a rise in  and misleading narratives since the coronavirus pandemic started. Itrsquos vital that any disinformation is knocked down quickly.Social media s have each publicly committed to combating disinformation, with the likes of Facebook, Twitter and Google all placing official coronavirus advice at the top of search results and news feeds.However, some posts suggesting a link between the rollout of the mobile technology and the virus are still visible online.A spokesman for Facebook said: ldquoWe are taking aggressive steps to stop misinformation and harmful content from spreading on our s and connect people to accurate information about coronavirus.ldquoUnder our existing policies against harmful misinformation, we are starting to remove  claims which link Covid- to G technology and could lead to physical harm.ldquoWe will continue to work closely with governments and other tech companies to remove harmful misinformation and have partnered with health authorities like the WHO and NHS to connect people to the latest official guidance.In a joint letter, the UKrsquos four largest mobile operators ndash EE, O, Three and Vodafone ndash said the attacks on phone masts were harming people and businesses who depended on connectivity.ldquoSadly, we have experienced cases of vandals setting fire to mobile masts, disrupting critical infrastructure and spreading  information suggesting a connection between G and the Covid- pandemic, the letter said.ldquoThere is no scientic evidence of any link between G and coronavirus. Fact.ldquoStopping this is critical to keeping your communities connected. Not only are these claims baseless, they are harmful for the people and businesses that rely on the continuity of our services. They have also led to the abuse of engineers and, in some cases, prevented essential network maintenance taking place.O revealed last week it was issuing engineers working on essential projects with a sign to explain they are a key worker, after reports of telecoms staff being verbally abused by members of the public.The DCMS Committee is also asking the public to submit examples of disinformation to its inquiry into information on Covid-, which will look to call in social media companies to face questions on the issue.The committee has also called on new Ofcom chief executive Dame Melanie Dawes to investigate concerns that state-backed international news organisations ndash particularly in China ndash were spreading ldquo narratives about the virus through social media to circumvent UK broadcasting regulation..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: MPs call for social media to be held accountable over G conspiracy theories article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Its no secret that MOT centres and the SSE Arena are among the options being pursued by the HSC system as staff testing sites.Staff testing numbers are expanding and will continue to do so as rapidly as possible. I fully understand the frustration that we have not been able to scale up testing numbers more quickly.This is not down to a lack of will or action. There are signicant challenges including laboratory and staffing capacity and the unprecedented levels of global demand for testing reagents and swabs.I want to make clear that we have been in contact with local company Randox over the past number of days regarding its testing product. We have been informed by Randox that its production line is fully geared towards the NHS as a whole and NI will receive a share of that.However, we will also continue to explore procuring testing products separately from NHS wide arrangements. We do not want to be dependent on one source for these products.Mr Swann stressed: I am confident we will make signicant progress on staff testing in the days ahead. But I want to be totally frank about the pressures that exist. If there were quick fixes available, I would certainly have used them.  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n n n n n bannerbox_fdeabdbaebabebca   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n n n n n bannerbox_fdfdaeaaabdbacc   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
