She’s one of my best friends in the world,’ he pronounced to the room.But recently the pair’s relationship has deteriorated and in a new interview with Vogue, Rihanna has addressed the VMAs moment.‘The VMAs is such a fan-focused awards show, so having that energy around me, and knowing the people who had received the award in the past, made it feel like a big deal,’ she said.‘Waiting through that speech was probably the most uncomfortable part. I don’t like too many compliments I don’t like to be put on blast. We don’t have a friendship now, but we’re not enemies either. It is what it is.’Now it seems Drake has taken offence because, as eagle-eyed fans noticed, his Instagram account no longer lists the Umbrella hitmaker under ‘following’. Bit petty, right?The news comes after Drake was hit with a fierce warning over his foul-mouthed trolling at an NBA Playoffs match between his beloved Toronto Raptors and the Cleveland Cavaliers.According to reports, the 31-year-old branded Cavs star Kendrick Perkins a ‘fucking pussy’ and lashed out at the star.Apparently, things got so heated that the pair had to be held back from fighting each other in the players’ tunnel.If you\u0027ve got a story, video or pictures get in touch with the  Entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page - we\u0027d love to hear from you.MORE: Chris Brown ‘hurt’ after Rihanna admits the star wasn’t ‘worth it’MORE: Forget a Rihanna and Drake relationship – they’re not even friends"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/sec_11247720.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"jay z believes streaming rivals get beyonce went tidal stories pushed people feel slighted","story":"Jay Z is blaming Tidal’s bad press on ‘slighted’ rivals in the music business (Picture: Lemonade – Getty)Tidal hasn’t had the best of press since it launched to a huge pop star backed fanfare in 2015, but it now seems as though its owner, rapper and music mogul Jay Z, believes a raft of negative stories is down to the company’s rivals.Following reports that allege Tidal has falsified data, inflating stream numbers for both Beyonce’s Lemonade and Kanye West’s Life Of Pablo, the 48-year-old Roc Nation owner has blamed ‘slighted’ competitors for a ‘wave of bad press’.What’s more, he’s said to be citing his wife as the catalyst for the supposed ‘hits’ on Tidal’s reputation.‘Jay believes the wave of bad press his company, Tidal, gets in the press is being pushed by rivals in the streaming arena who are angry with him over the loss of a potential Beyonce deal,’ an insider told .An insider told us the Roc Nation mogul thinks rivals are pushing bad press after losing out on a Bey deal for her 2016 juggernaut album, Lemonade (Picture: Getty Images for NARAS)‘Beyonce was offered a large deal by Apple Music in 2013 which would have given them ownership of her music and exclusive rights to its streams. She turned it down and re-signed with Sony but went on to give Tidal exclusive rights to her latest album, Lemonade, which can only be streamed on Tidal.’Directly addressing the recent allegations surrounding Tidal supposedly manipulating streaming figures, including that of Beyonce’s hit album, our source added:‘Jay has now been accused of falsifying data to make it seem as if it was played more times than it was. He’s appalled by the claim and believes the story is being pushed by people who feel slighted by Bey’s decision to choose his business over theirs.’It comes just after the Norwegian newspaper Dagens Næringsliv reported that the streaming service falsified and inflated streaming numbers for Kanye’s The Life of Pablo and Beyoncé’s Lemonade albums in 2016.It comes just after a Norwegian newspaper, Dagens Næringsliv, published a report in which it claims a study has found evidence Tidal figures were ‘manipulate’  (Picture: SONYLemonade)The disputed numbers in question were that The Life of Pablo achieved 250 million streams in 10 days, and that Lemonade clocked-up 306 million streams within 15 days.What make this interesting is the fact that Tidal’s service is believed to have had three million subscribers in total across its user base in March of 2016 (which was touted in a press release that year), however, the newspaper published an article in January of this year claiming that it had evidence showing internal figures were well-below this.The publication instead states that an internal report reveals the streaming service only made payments to record labels for around 850,000 users.Now, after enlisting the help of the Norwegian University of Science and Technology’s Centre for Cyber and Information Security to investigate data that the paper said it got from a hard drive handed in to them, an investigation has supposedly found a manipulation must have occurred.Responding to the allegations made by the paper using the study, Tidal released the following statement to Music Business Worldwide:Apple\u0027s iOS 11.3 is causing nasty problems with some people\u0027s iPhonesApple is apparently planning to bring back a feature missing from latest iPhonesApple has a secret base in the UK that\u0027s working on futuristic confidential technology‘This is a smear campaign from a publication that once referred to our employee as an “Israeli Intelligence officer” and our owner as a “crack dealer.” We expect nothing less from them than this ridiculous story, lies and falsehoods.

Since then they have been to watch a Toronto Blue Jays baseball match together, holidayed in Italy and Meghan has taught Jessica\u0027s daughter to dance.\u0027Jessica helped Meghan with her wardrobe and introduced her to the right people,\u0027 one of their circle said. \u0027Meghan adores Jessica, not just as a friend but also as someone whose taste and style are impeccable. Meghan looks up to Jessica and has, to a certain degree, modelled herself on her.\u0027     Jessica is Meghan\u0027s best friend and will be there when she marries Harry at Windsor Castle on May 19. Meghan is known to lean on her best friend for style and fashion advice          Jessica\u0027s pictures give a revealing insight into the fun nature of their friendship including the time when Meghan invited her backstage on Suits where she looks through wedding dresses          Meghan Markle is reportedly set to wear a Ralph and Russo gown (not pictured)  when she walks down the aisle at St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor on May 19Unlike Meghan, the former Jessica Brownstein, came from a privileged background as a member of Canada\u0027s Browns shoes dynasty, which is worth a reported £50 million.She attended an exclusive all-girls\u0027 school, before going to McGill University, where she studied industrial relations and economics. She then launched her own business importing luxury lingerie.After a successful career as a stylist – with her own TV slot – and wedding planner, she was propelled to the A list in 2008 after marrying the eldest son of Brian Mulroney.The couple has three children: twins Brian and John, now seven, and daughter Ivy now four, who are rumoured to be page boys and flower girl at the Royal wedding.Jessica and Meghan bonded over their shared passion for yoga, Pilates, dogs and philanthropy.

She wore a coat by Canadian designer Sentaler and people went crazy for it. We had created this media frenzy, like you see with anything Kate wears.\u0027But it was only after Meghan began dating Prince Harry in 2016 that Mulroney became a global name. It was in her house that the couple sought refuge when news of their relationship broke.Then, last September, as speculation of an engagement reached fever pitch, Mulroney was in a box with Meghan, her mother Doria, and Markus Anderson, for the closing ceremony of the Invictus Games.Harry joined them for the final 20 minutes of the show, standing arm in arm with Meghan and planting a kiss on her check as they watched Bryan Adams sing love songs.And, when Harry and Meghan got engaged last November, Mulroney was credited with orchestrating the outfit – a white wrap coat by The Line, PAROSH green dress and Aquazzura nude pumps.She is also believed to be the brains behind Meghan\u0027s outfits for many of her official engagements and is instrumental in helping her choose her wedding dress.    The relaxed snaps are a far cry from Meghan\u0027s polished appearances with Harry, such as the Anzac Day Service of Commemoration and Thanksgiving at Westminster Abbey last month  The candid photos show just how close the women are as Jessica and Meghan spend time away from the spotlight on holiday  A source close to Maghan has revealed how the friendship has blossomed since their time together in Toronto.  \u0027Jessica helped Meghan with her wardrobe and introduced her to the right people,\u0027 one of their circle saidThe couple had a dress rehearsal on Suits when Jessica helped her choose the Anne Barge Versailles dress from Jessica\u0027s Kleinfeld Canada bridal boutique when her Suits character Rachel Zane was supposed to marry Mike Ross - only for him to leave her at the altar.She flew to London in January to attend the first fitting and was in London in April when Meghan had her final fitting. Mulroney jetted into Heathrow for a \u0027mini hen party\u0027 and was given a sneak preview of the dress and the wedding venue.She has been so successful in helping Meghan create her \u0027effortless chic\u0027 style that Vogue, editor Edward Enninful believes she could eclipse the Duchess of Cambridge. \u0027Ms Markle is an astonishing fashion sales force, who is setting the industry alight,\u0027 he said recently.A royal source said: \u0027Jessica is Meghan\u0027s BFF (best friend forever) and has been a huge influence. Meghan\u0027s turned to her for advice on everything from the dress, the flowers, decorations in church, the wedding lunch — and even the seating plan. \u0027Although Jess lives in Toronto, the two are on the phone all the time. Meg wanted Jess at the final fitting as it\u0027ll be the most famous dress of the year and she\u0027s quite nervous about it. It all went really well and they were delighted with the result.\u0027 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/09/01/4BE4CDC200000578-0-image-m-13_1525824778289.jpg","title":"Sir Cliff Richard hopes win 600 000 BBC","story":"    Sir Cliff Richard, 77, has sued the BBC over coverage of a South Yorkshire Police raid on his home in August 2014Sir Cliff Richard is seeking to extract at least £560,000 from the BBC if his landmark privacy action over a child sex crime investigation succeeds, a court heard yesterday.The 77-year-old superstar has sued the BBC over coverage of a South Yorkshire Police raid on his home in August 2014 and wants damages at the ‘top end’ of the scale.The singer has told Mr Justice Mann that coverage, which involved the use of a helicopter, was a ‘very serious invasion’ of his privacy.The BBC disputes his claims.

The Foreign Secretary and I will be continuing to work on those with our European and other allies.\u0027 Britain had joined fellow European counties including Germany and France in urging the United States to stick to the agreement.Mr Johnson travelled to the US at the weekend as part of a charm offensive to try to convince Mr Trump to stick with it - appearing on the President\u0027s favourite TV show, Fox and Friends, in an effort to appeal to him.And he suggested that the US President should be awarded the Nobel peace prize if he made progress towards peace with Iran and North Korea.But his overtures fell flat and Mr Trump followed through on his election promise to pull out of the deal.Making a statement to MPs after PMQs, Mr Johnson also hammered home Britain\u0027s commitment to the deal - despite America\u0027s withdrawal.  The Foreign Secretary said a watchdog had reported nine times that Iran had complied with the terms of the agreement.          Former defence secretary Sir Michael Fallon said the \u0027rather flimsy agreement\u0027 should never have been considered comprehensive, adding Iranian interference has increased          Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry attacked the \u0027recklessness and idiocy\u0027 of Mr Trump\u0027s decision          Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has said his country will remain in the deal, and will instead trade with the other countries which signed it  Mrs May joined French president Emmanuel Macron (left) and Angela Merkel of Germany (right) last night in voicing regret over Mr Trump\u0027s decision on the Iran nuclear dealAs long as it continues to comply, the UK will \u0027remain a party\u0027 to the accord, he said.Mr Johnson said the world should now hold Mr Trump to his stated aim of finding a new solution to the Iran nuclear issue.Sir Michael, who quit as defence secretary last year, said the \u0027rather flimsy agreement\u0027 should never have been considered comprehensive, adding Iranian interference has increased.\u0027Isn\u0027t the president right in his analysis of this rather flimsy agreement that should never have been called comprehensive and it does not include missiles?\u0027 he said. \u0027Far from constraining Iranian behaviour, it has enabled the Iranian regime to use its new financial freedom to interfere in Syria, in Iraq, above all in Yemen and to sponsor Houthi attacks on our friends in Saudi Arabia.\u0027 Mr Johnson replied: \u0027I don\u0027t recall him making those points when he served so well as secretary of state for defence when the deal was done. \u0027But I disagree with him because I think that the advantage of the JCPOA (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action), of course it has limitations as I readily conceded, is at the heart of it is this idea to stop the Iranians from acquiring a nuclear weapon in exchange for limited economic benefits. Sir Michael was joined by Tory former minister Robert Halfon, who urged the government to support the UK\u0027s oldest ally rather than \u0027appeasing\u0027 Iran.          MPs considered the Iran nuclear deal row in response to a statement from Mr Johnson todayAndrew Percy, another Tory former minister, also urged the Government to back the US after condemning Iran\u0027s \u0027increasingly malign and dangerous influence\u0027. But shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry attacked the \u0027recklessness and idiocy\u0027 of Mr Trump\u0027s decision, telling the Commons that he had taken it without the \u0027slightest justification and without the simplest rational thought\u0027 about what would happen next. Conservative former minister Sir Nicholas Soames criticised Iranian interference although he labelled Mr Trump\u0027s decision \u0027very poor\u0027. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable also said ministers had now discovered the \u0027limits of sycophancy\u0027 in dealing with Mr Trump as he sought assurances to protect British industry and motorists from a potential \u0027oil shock\u0027In a joint statement last night, Mrs May, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French president Emmanuel Macron voiced regret at the US move.\u0027Together, we emphasise our continuing commitment to the JCPoA. This agreement remains important for our shared security,\u0027 they said.\u0027We recall that the JCPoA was unanimously endorsed by the UN Security Council in resolution 2231.

Meghan and Harry have invited hundreds of school children to the wedding of the yearWhen the couple went to Leonora\u0027s school in December, Ms Markle made a promise to return for a private visit.Ms Markle honoured her promise and returned to the school for a private visit earlier this year and spent some time with Leonora giving her acting tips.Palace officials then contacted Leonora and the school\u0027s deputy principal that they have two tickets and will be attending the wedding last month. Leonora says she already has her dress ready for the wedding and will be going along with deputy principal Helen Foulger. Leonora said: \u0027When I found out that I was invited to the wedding, I was speechless. I am so excited. \u0027When my mum was told I was invited she screamed for five minutes.\u0027Meghan is such an inspiration to me - the first time I met her I asked her if she had any advice for me as I want to be an actress like her.¿It¿ll be a special day for everybody¿: Prince Charles and...The royals as you¿ve never seen them before: Amateur snaps...Share this article\u0027She said I should always be prepared to face rejection but to keep following my dreams.

In the old days it was all amputees, people like me, and wheelchair users. I am now trying to push people\u0027s mental boundaries.\u0027  The deaf teenage campaigner          Fourteen-year-old Reuben Litherland\u0027s school support worker in Derby did not believe him at first when he informed her he would be among the congregation at the wedding, his mother said.The Saint Benedict Catholic Academy pupil (right), who is deaf and has set up a lunchtime sign language club at school, is still coming to terms with the news, she said.Jacinta Litherland, who will attend the wedding with her son, said: \u0027He is very excited, and probably a bit bewildered. It\u0027s just not quite sunk in.\u0027She said she was \u0027very proud\u0027 of her son\u0027s achievements, which include campaigning for deaf friendly cinema screenings, at such a young age.\u0027He is raising awareness of the difficulties and struggles that deaf children face, and he\u0027s doing it very well,\u0027 she said. The charitable entrepreneur          \u0027Miss Macaroon\u0027 Rosie Ginday, 34, (right) earned her invitation after Harry and Meghan were blown away by her Birmingham social enterprise and baking business on a visit to the city earlier this year.Set up in 2011, her sweet treats organisation reinvests profits into developing disadvantaged young people\u0027s potential, training them as chefs, and offering them real world experience.And the royal couple got the chance to sample some of her trainees\u0027 macaroons during their visit in March.The qualified pastry chef and former English teacher said: \u0027Harry and Meghan came to Millennium Point (Birmingham), and got to taste our macaroons which was really fun.\u0027They were both so passionate about meeting all the young girls there and took a real interest.\u0027They\u0027re accessible as well, and it\u0027s great to have a younger generation of royals showing they do care and they are invested in what young people can do.\u0027Ms Ginday\u0027s organisation has worked with care-leavers, the homeless, lone single parents and those with mental health problems, introducing them to working life, at the firm\u0027s shop and bakery, and even giving some the chance to work at Michelin star restaurant Purnell\u0027s.The inspiring primary school teacher          David Gregory (right) will be will be celebrating his first wedding anniversary on the same weekend as the royal wedding.Fortunately, though, the 28-year-old from Blyth, Northumberland, is taking wife Hannah to enjoy the festivities in the grounds of Windsor Castle on May 19.The pair married on May 20 last year and Mr Gregory described the invitation as the \u0027perfect\u0027 way to mark their own milestone.Mr Gregory, who teaches Year 4 at Newsham Primary School in Blyth, said : \u0027My mam wanted to go, the headteacher wanted to go, but the only thing that was ever going to happen was for me and my wife to head down.\u0027He will be wearing his own wedding suit for the occasion, but joked that his 26-year-old wife is stopping short of turning up in her wedding gown.\u0027We\u0027d always planned on celebrating our one-year anniversary as you\u0027d expect, but I don\u0027t think it could have been any more perfect,\u0027 he said.\u0027I\u0027m planning on going in very formal attire. I felt very comfortable and happy in my wedding suit so I think that\u0027s the right way to go.\u0027Obviously we thought about Hannah wearing her wedding dress as well but we\u0027re not going to try and steal any limelight.\u0027Mr Gregory, who was put forward for an invitation by the Lord Lieutenant of Northumberland, was singled out for his work strengthening and celebrating his local community in Blyth.His recycling initiative with pupils won a Love Northumberland award, and he is a driving force behind the Port of Blyth\u0027s STEM hub, designed to encourage pupils\u0027 engagement with STEM subjects, and inspire their future careers.The youngsters in his school have yet to find out about his invite because they are on holiday.\u0027I can\u0027t wait to tell them. We\u0027re looking at how we can make this really relevant and real to the children,\u0027 Mr Gregory said.He is, however, planning to record a video diary of his experience on the day for them.   The Welsh charity worker          Zoe Ardunell (above) will be lucky enough to see the couple for a second time, having met them during a recent visit to Cardiff Castle.The 20-year-old from Penygraig in Wales described that as \u0027a very happy day\u0027 and said Harry told her she was \u0027definitely a role model\u0027 for her work with the Valley Kids charity which helps disadvantaged children and families.She will take as her guest her 62-year-old grandmother Pat Churches, who she said \u0027loves the royals\u0027.Ms Arundell said she was relieved to see she had no plans that weekend, but quickly added: \u0027I think if I did have any plans they would be changed straight away!\u0027 Schoolgirl born with one leg          A schoolgirl born with one leg who became a charity ambassador and mental health champion is now looking forward to buying a new dress.Jorja Furze, 12, (right) says she will go shopping with her mother, Gabrielle, 39, who will also accompany her on the day, for something to wear for the event.Describing her delight at receiving an email invitation last week, the schoolgirl said: \u0027I was really excited and shocked because I didn\u0027t think I would get an invite.\u0027I had been told my name had been mentioned to some people about the wedding, but I didn\u0027t think I\u0027d get close to it.\u0027The youngster, who was born with only a right leg, is an ambassador for the Steel Bones charity which supports civilian amputees, added: \u0027They thought I would be a good candidate.\u0027I\u0027ve grown up without a leg and they thought having someone that younger children could relate to would be good.\u0027Jorja, from the village of Isleham near Ely, Cambridgeshire, has also set up a quiet space at her high school where children with mental health issues can relax.She said: \u0027Me and my friend both suffer from anxiety and mental health, we decided we should do something because we knew a lot of people had similar problems and we convinced the teacher to let us start this up.\u0027 The community lunchers          Tessa Hince (right), who lives near Banbury, Oxfordshire, and Hayley Ash, of Shipston-on-Stour, both 32, have been running the successful Shipston Christmas Community Lunch, since 2016.The community event brings together people who might otherwise be isolated at Christmas, drawing its funds and produce from public donations.Both had already got invitations to the Queen\u0027s garden party on May 15, and joked they now needed to find different outfits for the wedding.Miss Hince, who is taking along her best friend, said she was \u0027absolutely speechless\u0027 and \u0027so excited\u0027.\u0027It\u0027s giving some coverage to this great cause,\u0027 she added.Miss Ash, who is taking her mother as a guest, said: \u0027It\u0027s crazy - it all feels like a bit of a whirlwind.\u0027 The amputee campaigner          Ex-Royal Irish Regiment soldier Phillip Gillespie (right) says it is \u0027a wee bit surreal\u0027 to think he will be there next month with his girlfriend, Kirsty Crawford.The 30-year-old, who lost his right leg in Afghanistan in 2011, is also eagerly awaiting news as to whether he has made the rowing and archery teams for the next Invictus Games - a brainchild of Harry.Mr Gillespie, who is involved with ABF The Soldiers\u0027 Charity, said he was looking forward to a busy few months with the Invictus trial results, the wedding and then a royal garden party following his BEM award last year.He said he had not told many people yet but expected his friends\u0027 reaction to be muted, compared to the feedback his girlfriend was getting.\u0027I think Kirsty has got more of a reaction, I think it (a wedding) is more of a girl thing,\u0027 he laughed.He added: \u0027It\u0027s a massive privilege, it will be a huge spectacle.\u0027                                                      Revealed: The full schedule and timings of Harry and Meghan\u0027s wedding from their arrival at Windsor Castle to a glitzy evening bashRoyal fans across the country have been waiting with bated breath for the full details of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0027s wedding day.And finally Kensington Palace have released the full schedule and timings for the big day.Here we look at what we can expect on May 19, from when the first guests arrive at Windsor Castle to the evening celebrations at Frogmore House.The couple will spend, as according to tradition, the night before their wedding apart.There will be no American-style maid of honour and all of the couple\u0027s page boys and bridesmaids – who are expected to include Prince George and Princess Charlotte – will be children.The couple will not go on honeymoon straight away – and will, remarkably, undertake their first public engagement as man and wife just days after the ceremony.

They want to be more visible and accessible, but on their terms, not ours.The Princes have spoken far more frankly about their struggles with depression following the death of their mother than anyone in their position has done before.

He’s better dressed, has started meditating, drinking healthy smoothies, and shunning junk food.          Harry and William both distrust the press, who they see as being partly responsible for their mother Diana’s tragic death. The trio are pictured together in London in 1995Her background, with orced parents and some embarrassing relatives, gives her a far wider experience of the world than her husband. Harry spent ten years in the army, a highly regimented existence, miles away from the UK. He has never had a regular job, but promotes his charities like the Invictus Games and has just been given the courtesy job of Commonwealth Youth Ambassador by his grandmother.Over the years, Meghan will have gone to humiliating casting sessions, she will have been rejected many times, and will have developed a thick skin and ruthless ambition to land a job in a long-running soap.If she accepts the title of Duchess now, she will be letting working women down in a big way, women who have also struggled to rise up through the corporate and business world, to get recognition for their achievements through pay or powerful jobs.A few of these women get awarded honorary degrees and titles, if they are lucky enough to be spotted - I have a CBE (given to me by the Queen) and an MA in the Creative Arts - and I am not embarrassed about that, I worked my a*** off in the media and broadcasting for over 40 years and helped dozens of other women along the way.          Meghan Markle took some dreary jobs as she struggled to kick start her acting careerOn the other hand, the Royal women get titles for doing absolutely nothing - Catherine (or Kate) took the title Duchess of Cambridge when she married Prince William, before which she did few jobs of any note, working for a fashion retailer.Her real job is prolonging the royal lineage, having given birth to two Princes and a Princess in relatively quick succession. Harry has now slipped down the succession to number six - making it highly unlikely that Meghan will ever become a Princess.In the eyes of the British aristocracy, though, Meghan will never be ‘posh’, she is an outsider and will remain so - but that’s no bad thing.When Camilla married Prince Charles, she became the Duchess of Cornwall, and could have accepted the title of Princess. Out of deference to the memory of Diana, she declined. When Charles becomes King, Camilla’s official title will be Princess Consort.          Kate took the title Duchess of Cambridge when she married Prince William, before which she did few jobs of any note. The couple are pictured with their newborn son Louis on April 23All these titles are no guarantee that the recipient will be accepted by the narrow minded blue bloods of the English aristocracy and the landed gentry. The example of Sarah Ferguson should act as a warning to Meghan. Sarah became the Duchess of York on her marriage to Andrew, a title which she has held onto since their orce (which seems ridiculous). Andrew remains next in line to the throne after Harry and then their daughters, the party Princesses Eugenie and Beatrice - both of whom are said to get on well with Meghan.Sarah’s antics have caused maximim embarrasment to the Royals, along with her endless quest for an income - she’s appeared on TV reality shows and even endorsed weight loss programmes. Sarah has been invited to the wedding ceremony, but is said to be furious she has been denied an invitation to the party in the evening for just 250 guests. Being a Duchess cuts no ice in that company.If Harry and Meghan want to show they’re in touch with their subjects, they should decline this chance to pick up an unearned title and stick to Mr and Mrs Wales."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/09/18/4C05F02100000578-5710151-The_Game_of_Thrones_star_was_pictured_in_a_North_Wales_pub_on_th-a-8_1525887309185.jpg","title":"Game Thrones star Kit Harington enjoys secret stag weekend Wales","story":"Kit Harington was pictured on his stag do in North Wales on the early May Bank Holiday weekend. The 31-year-old, who plays Jon Snow in the hit HBO series, opted for the \u0027Down n\u0027 Dirty\u0027 package during a two night stay at the luxurious Eriviat Hall near Denbigh, North Wales          The 31-year-old was pictured in the Llindir Inn beer garden in North Wales over the weekend.

Mr Belhaj - a leading member of the Islamist opposition to Colonel Gaddafi - and his wife have offered to settle for a token £1 from each defendant and an apology for what they sufferedThe couple claim the UK was involved in \u0027arranging, assisting and encouraging their unlawful rendition\u0027.International human rights group Reprieve and the Belhaj family say their abduction was a direct result of a joint MI6-CIA operation following the \u0027deal in the desert\u0027 in which Tony Blair\u0027s government re-opened diplomatic links with Gaddafi.According to Reprieve, part of the deal involved the illegal kidnapping and flying of Libyan dissidents to Tripoli.They say cases came to light in 2011, when faxes written by Sir Mark, which described the rendition flights, were found in Libya\u0027s intelligence headquarters. Giving his judgment at the Supreme Court, Lord Mance said: \u0027They allege that they suffered mistreatment amounting to torture at the hands of US agents in Bangkok and in the airplane and at the hands of Libyan officials in Libya.\u0027The judge said the couple were relying on the letter supposedly written by Sir Mark to Mr Moussa Koussa, head of the Libyan External Security Organisation.\u0027The letter congratulated Mr Moussa Koussa on the safe arrival of (Mr Belhaj),\u0027 said the judge.\u0027It said that This was the least we could do for you and for Libya to demonstrate the remarkable relationship we have built over recent years.\u0027It indicated that British intelligence had led to Mr Belhaj\u0027s transfer to Libya, although the British services did not pay for the air cargo.\u0027 Government lawyers had argued that the Belhaj claims should be barred under state immunity.They said the foreign \u0027act of state\u0027 doctrine prohibits the courts of one country sitting in judgment on the acts of the government of another within its own territory.The High Court agreed with the Government\u0027s stance and ruled that the claims should be struck out.          Belhaj was allegedly transported to Libya and was tortured by forces of former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi But Reprieve argued that the Government had already settled a related claim out of court by paying compensation to another family who were rendered to Libya in the same \u0027deal in the desert\u0027 conspiracy.The Court of Appeal then reversed the High Court ruling.It said the doctrine relied upon by the government might not apply to alleged breaches of international law or human rights obligations, even in cases involving the conduct of a foreign state.The appeal judges said there was a \u0027compelling public interest\u0027 in allegations of unlawful rendition and \u0027particularly grave violations of international law and human rights\u0027 being investigated by the English courts.UK Government lawyers then argued that the compensation claim could not be heard in a British court because it would damage relations with the US.But the argument was dismissed by the seven justices - court president Lord Neuberger, sitting with Lady Hale and Lords Mance, Clarke, Wilson, Sumption and Hughes. Lord Mance said that \u0027state immunity is no bar to the claims\u0027, and the defendants had not \u0027on the assumed facts shown any entitlement to rely on the doctrine of foreign act of state\u0027.He said: \u0027The appeals are dismissed and the cases may proceed to trial.\u0027 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/21/15/4B5E85C500000578-0-image-m-53_1524322087001.jpg","title":"Customer confronts Subway worker makes confess BACON vegetarian

Serenity and good humour radiated from the Chair. There were no tantrums. There was no sucking up to any lobby or any VIP in the galleries. The occupant of the Chair did not, after each question, scratch furiously on his order paper with his ballpoint pen, as though expunging an imagined evil spot.The names of those MPs who were called to speak were barked out crisply and without mocking over-emphasis or mimicry of their accents. Everything felt blissfully unaffected and effortlessly objective. The Chair was the Chair and that was an end to the matter. All the ghastly self-esteem of Bercow had evaporated.The moment he leaves Speaker’s House for good, all his balefulness and bias will disperse like eggy gas on a breeze.By the end of PMQs, some MPs were cheering Sir Lindsay and calling for an encore. ‘More, more, more,’ they cried. Sir Lindsay looked mortified by this acclaim. He blushed.The Prime Minister bade Sir Lindsay a brief and apparently friendly adieu as she left the Chamber. Jeremy Corbyn went up to him a few minutes later and appeared to say well done to him, shaking his hand. The clerks looked happier. Harriet Harman, who is said to be plotting Bercow’s downfall, was soon to be found at Sir Lindsay’s right elbow, cooing pleasantries.Farewell to Gorbals Mick: Friends, family and colleagues pay...John Bercow faces fresh pressure as former minister condemns...Share this articleAll of which will no doubt put Bercow in a frightful bate when he returns to his hornet’s nest. Hold on to your mobile telephones, team.It helped that Sir Lindsay (a foghorning son of Chorley, Lancs, and MP for that seat since 1997) got matters off to a prompt start instead of letting the preceding passage of play go over time.People say Bercow does that simply to spite Andrew Neil, whose BBC TV show broadcasts the proceedings live.Furthermore, Sir Lindsay gave a pointed reminder to the frontbenchers to be pithy. There was no sitting back and letting the two main party leaders hog the time. Theresa May finds pithiness a challenge, to put it mildly. She’d be ace at Radio 4’s waffle contest ‘Just A Minute’ (though she might find the avoidance of repetition and deviation tricky).Some of her replies yesterday could have been at least half as long and would have benefited greatly from that, making her sound more decisive. But she was a little less long-winded than normal.          John Bercow (centre) leaves St Aloysius in Glasgow following the funeral of Michael MartinMr Corbyn seemed markedly brisker than when Mr Bercow is in the Chair. Sometimes his exchanges with Mrs May go on for more than 15 minutes. Yesterday they were completed in about ten. Much better.Not once did Sir Lindsay do that Bercow thing of upbraiding an MP by name, or making a foul gargling noise to indicate his displeasure. Not once did he try to tick off errant backbenchers by saying ‘go and lie down in a darkened room and take some soothing medicament, man’ (what weary tropes his interventions have become). Not once did he pour gloop on some MP whose birthday it happened to be, or someone who happened to have been an acquaintance of his since their days together in student politics. All these we were spared.When Rachel Maclean (Con, Redditch) was asking Mrs May a sycophantic question about the local elections, Sir Lindsay briefly muttered ‘let’s get on with it’. He also signalled to Mrs May’s pit-mechanics that she should stop being quite so windy. The rest of the time he maintained good order by little more than a raised hand (to quell some Tory heckling) and a disbelieving frown (to let Labour MPs know they were pushing their misbehaviour too far).A class act. He could help the Commons retrieve some of its public standing."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/08/13/4BF8747000000578-0-image-m-38_1525781319453.jpg","title":"Meghan Markles waxwork unveiled Madame Tussauds display ahead royal wedding","story":"Go green like Meghan in a pencil dress by P.A.R.O.S.HP.A.R.O.S.H. bow detail dress at FarfetchBuy a lighter green version at FarfetchAfter much speculation, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle finally confirmed their engagement back in November, and the photographs quickly became iconic.

The Foreign Secretary and I will be continuing to work on those with our European and other allies.\u0027 Britain had joined fellow European counties including Germany and France in urging the United States to stick to the agreement.Mr Johnson travelled to the US at the weekend as part of a charm offensive to try to convince Mr Trump to stick with it - appearing on the President\u0027s favourite TV show, Fox and Friends, in an effort to appeal to him.And he suggested that the US President should be awarded the Nobel peace prize if he made progress towards peace with Iran and North Korea.But his overtures fell flat and Mr Trump followed through on his election promise to pull out of the deal.Making a statement to MPs after PMQs, Mr Johnson also hammered home Britain\u0027s commitment to the deal - despite America\u0027s withdrawal.  The Foreign Secretary said a watchdog had reported nine times that Iran had complied with the terms of the agreement.

Meghan and Harry have invited hundreds of school children to the wedding of the yearWhen the couple went to Leonora\u0027s school in December, Ms Markle made a promise to return for a private visit.Ms Markle honoured her promise and returned to the school for a private visit earlier this year and spent some time with Leonora giving her acting tips.Palace officials then contacted Leonora and the school\u0027s deputy principal that they have two tickets and will be attending the wedding last month. Leonora says she already has her dress ready for the wedding and will be going along with deputy principal Helen Foulger. Leonora said: \u0027When I found out that I was invited to the wedding, I was speechless. I am so excited. \u0027When my mum was told I was invited she screamed for five minutes.\u0027Meghan is such an inspiration to me - the first time I met her I asked her if she had any advice for me as I want to be an actress like her.¿It¿ll be a special day for everybody¿: Prince Charles and...The royals as you¿ve never seen them before: Amateur snaps...Share this article\u0027She said I should always be prepared to face rejection but to keep following my dreams.

This is her highest ever achievement. \u0027She is desperate to be an actress and so she was so thrilled to meet Meghan. \u0027But we\u0027ve had to keep our lips sealed on the details as it is so highly classified.\u0027     Leonora, left, is pictured on the day of the royal visit alongside her fellow pupils and former Apprentice candidate Elizabeth McKenna          Meghan spoke to Leonora and promised her a private visit to the academy, which she honoured earlier this year          A Household Cavalry troop of Life Guards leaves the barracks as they prepare for the royal wedding          The Manchester survivorSchoolgirl Amelia Thompson (right with her mother Lisa) , who was caught up in the Manchester Arena suicide bombing last year, has found herself on the guest list.And in a touching gesture, the 12-year-old is planning to take a grandmother who lost a loved one in last year\u0027s terrorist attack.The youngster, from Dronfield Woodhouse, near Sheffield, has spent a year recovering from the trauma she suffered after she witnessed the aftermath of the bombing.But the invitation has helped to lift her spirits - indeed, Amelia said she was \u0027speechless\u0027 when she saw the message saying she was going to the wedding.She said she was \u0027so excited\u0027 she could not respond, and is already planning to buy a dress for the occasion.Movingly, she has decided to give her other ticket to grandmother Sharon Goodman, whose 15-year-old granddaughter Olivia Campbell-Hardy died in the attack.The homeless teenager          Kai Fletcher (right) had a difficult childhood growing up in a household troubled by alcohol and domestic violence, and found himself homeless at the age of just 15.After turning to Bath-based charity Southside for help, the 18-year-old now works for the organisation as a young advocate team leader having turned his life around.\u0027It was a bit surprising. I am looking forward to going, really excited,\u0027 he said of his invitation.Mr Fletcher, who lives in Bath, said he would be taking his sister Louise with him to the wedding at Windsor Castle next month.He said he said: \u0027I am giving back to Southside what they have given to me, which was a new opportunity.\u0027The rallying Royal Marine          A former Royal Marine\u0027s love of rally cars led to him leading a charity helping ex-service personnel and has now seen him invited to the royal wedding.Grant White, 52, (right) spent 23 years as a commando, leaving in 2008 as a warrant officer after being medically discharged, and is now head of operations for the Race2Recovery charity.The charity, which runs an off-road team that has competed in the Dakar Rally, provides opportunities in motorsport for people who have suffered life-changing injuries.Mr White, who lost his right leg below the knee in a hit-and-run road accident, said: \u0027It was a very pleasant surprise and it caught me slightly off-guard, I must admit.\u0027It is a fantastic opportunity and a great occasion.\u0027 He has not met Prince Harry personally but has met other royals during his long military career.Mr White, who lives in Dorset but is originally from Leicester, started out as a beneficiary of Race2Recovery because of a keen interest in motorsport before working for the charity.\u0027The priority will always be wounded, injured and sick service personnel,\u0027 he said.\u0027The big area we are hitting on now is mental health and we are getting a lot of PTSD. In the old days it was all amputees, people like me, and wheelchair users. I am now trying to push people\u0027s mental boundaries.\u0027  The deaf teenage campaigner          Fourteen-year-old Reuben Litherland\u0027s school support worker in Derby did not believe him at first when he informed her he would be among the congregation at the wedding, his mother said.The Saint Benedict Catholic Academy pupil (right), who is deaf and has set up a lunchtime sign language club at school, is still coming to terms with the news, she said.Jacinta Litherland, who will attend the wedding with her son, said: \u0027He is very excited, and probably a bit bewildered. It\u0027s just not quite sunk in.\u0027She said she was \u0027very proud\u0027 of her son\u0027s achievements, which include campaigning for deaf friendly cinema screenings, at such a young age.\u0027He is raising awareness of the difficulties and struggles that deaf children face, and he\u0027s doing it very well,\u0027 she said. The charitable entrepreneur          \u0027Miss Macaroon\u0027 Rosie Ginday, 34, (right) earned her invitation after Harry and Meghan were blown away by her Birmingham social enterprise and baking business on a visit to the city earlier this year.Set up in 2011, her sweet treats organisation reinvests profits into developing disadvantaged young people\u0027s potential, training them as chefs, and offering them real world experience.And the royal couple got the chance to sample some of her trainees\u0027 macaroons during their visit in March.The qualified pastry chef and former English teacher said: \u0027Harry and Meghan came to Millennium Point (Birmingham), and got to taste our macaroons which was really fun.\u0027They were both so passionate about meeting all the young girls there and took a real interest.\u0027They\u0027re accessible as well, and it\u0027s great to have a younger generation of royals showing they do care and they are invested in what young people can do.\u0027Ms Ginday\u0027s organisation has worked with care-leavers, the homeless, lone single parents and those with mental health problems, introducing them to working life, at the firm\u0027s shop and bakery, and even giving some the chance to work at Michelin star restaurant Purnell\u0027s.The inspiring primary school teacher          David Gregory (right) will be will be celebrating his first wedding anniversary on the same weekend as the royal wedding.Fortunately, though, the 28-year-old from Blyth, Northumberland, is taking wife Hannah to enjoy the festivities in the grounds of Windsor Castle on May 19.The pair married on May 20 last year and Mr Gregory described the invitation as the \u0027perfect\u0027 way to mark their own milestone.Mr Gregory, who teaches Year 4 at Newsham Primary School in Blyth, said : \u0027My mam wanted to go, the headteacher wanted to go, but the only thing that was ever going to happen was for me and my wife to head down.\u0027He will be wearing his own wedding suit for the occasion, but joked that his 26-year-old wife is stopping short of turning up in her wedding gown.\u0027We\u0027d always planned on celebrating our one-year anniversary as you\u0027d expect, but I don\u0027t think it could have been any more perfect,\u0027 he said.\u0027I\u0027m planning on going in very formal attire. I felt very comfortable and happy in my wedding suit so I think that\u0027s the right way to go.\u0027Obviously we thought about Hannah wearing her wedding dress as well but we\u0027re not going to try and steal any limelight.\u0027Mr Gregory, who was put forward for an invitation by the Lord Lieutenant of Northumberland, was singled out for his work strengthening and celebrating his local community in Blyth.His recycling initiative with pupils won a Love Northumberland award, and he is a driving force behind the Port of Blyth\u0027s STEM hub, designed to encourage pupils\u0027 engagement with STEM subjects, and inspire their future careers.The youngsters in his school have yet to find out about his invite because they are on holiday.\u0027I can\u0027t wait to tell them. We\u0027re looking at how we can make this really relevant and real to the children,\u0027 Mr Gregory said.He is, however, planning to record a video diary of his experience on the day for them.   The Welsh charity worker          Zoe Ardunell (above) will be lucky enough to see the couple for a second time, having met them during a recent visit to Cardiff Castle.The 20-year-old from Penygraig in Wales described that as \u0027a very happy day\u0027 and said Harry told her she was \u0027definitely a role model\u0027 for her work with the Valley Kids charity which helps disadvantaged children and families.She will take as her guest her 62-year-old grandmother Pat Churches, who she said \u0027loves the royals\u0027.Ms Arundell said she was relieved to see she had no plans that weekend, but quickly added: \u0027I think if I did have any plans they would be changed straight away!\u0027 Schoolgirl born with one leg          A schoolgirl born with one leg who became a charity ambassador and mental health champion is now looking forward to buying a new dress.Jorja Furze, 12, (right) says she will go shopping with her mother, Gabrielle, 39, who will also accompany her on the day, for something to wear for the event.Describing her delight at receiving an email invitation last week, the schoolgirl said: \u0027I was really excited and shocked because I didn\u0027t think I would get an invite.\u0027I had been told my name had been mentioned to some people about the wedding, but I didn\u0027t think I\u0027d get close to it.\u0027The youngster, who was born with only a right leg, is an ambassador for the Steel Bones charity which supports civilian amputees, added: \u0027They thought I would be a good candidate.\u0027I\u0027ve grown up without a leg and they thought having someone that younger children could relate to would be good.\u0027Jorja, from the village of Isleham near Ely, Cambridgeshire, has also set up a quiet space at her high school where children with mental health issues can relax.She said: \u0027Me and my friend both suffer from anxiety and mental health, we decided we should do something because we knew a lot of people had similar problems and we convinced the teacher to let us start this up.\u0027 The community lunchers          Tessa Hince (right), who lives near Banbury, Oxfordshire, and Hayley Ash, of Shipston-on-Stour, both 32, have been running the successful Shipston Christmas Community Lunch, since 2016.The community event brings together people who might otherwise be isolated at Christmas, drawing its funds and produce from public donations.Both had already got invitations to the Queen\u0027s garden party on May 15, and joked they now needed to find different outfits for the wedding.Miss Hince, who is taking along her best friend, said she was \u0027absolutely speechless\u0027 and \u0027so excited\u0027.\u0027It\u0027s giving some coverage to this great cause,\u0027 she added.Miss Ash, who is taking her mother as a guest, said: \u0027It\u0027s crazy - it all feels like a bit of a whirlwind.\u0027 The amputee campaigner          Ex-Royal Irish Regiment soldier Phillip Gillespie (right) says it is \u0027a wee bit surreal\u0027 to think he will be there next month with his girlfriend, Kirsty Crawford.The 30-year-old, who lost his right leg in Afghanistan in 2011, is also eagerly awaiting news as to whether he has made the rowing and archery teams for the next Invictus Games - a brainchild of Harry.Mr Gillespie, who is involved with ABF The Soldiers\u0027 Charity, said he was looking forward to a busy few months with the Invictus trial results, the wedding and then a royal garden party following his BEM award last year.He said he had not told many people yet but expected his friends\u0027 reaction to be muted, compared to the feedback his girlfriend was getting.\u0027I think Kirsty has got more of a reaction, I think it (a wedding) is more of a girl thing,\u0027 he laughed.He added: \u0027It\u0027s a massive privilege, it will be a huge spectacle.\u0027                                                      Revealed: The full schedule and timings of Harry and Meghan\u0027s wedding from their arrival at Windsor Castle to a glitzy evening bashRoyal fans across the country have been waiting with bated breath for the full details of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0027s wedding day.And finally Kensington Palace have released the full schedule and timings for the big day.Here we look at what we can expect on May 19, from when the first guests arrive at Windsor Castle to the evening celebrations at Frogmore House.The couple will spend, as according to tradition, the night before their wedding apart.There will be no American-style maid of honour and all of the couple\u0027s page boys and bridesmaids – who are expected to include Prince George and Princess Charlotte – will be children.The couple will not go on honeymoon straight away – and will, remarkably, undertake their first public engagement as man and wife just days after the ceremony.

Visitors to Azzedine Alaïa: The Couturier, which opens on Thursday, are met by a phalanx of seven such Amazons, each dressed in the late designer’s signature leopard print and black.The exaggerated height of the mannequins amplifies what Alaïa’s clothes have always done, which is to make women look extraordinary. “No other dress can make a woman look and feel as good as an Alaïa dress because it cinches the body perfectly,” as Naomi Campbell put it.

Because it was not intended to be viewed posthumously, the show has a lightness of touch, without the pomp of a retrospective. Alaïa was a cult figure in the fashion industry but, obsessed with the very highest quality of fit and production, he never sold dresses widely or inexpensively enough to become a household name. The outpouring of emotion on his death, and the recent opening of a London store, has given his name a higher profile than it ever had when he was alive, so this show is perfectly timed to fill in the backstory.The dresses are gathered by aesthetic theme, rather than chronology. There is a clique of tiny dresses in supple stretch leather, a forbidding trio of dramatic hooded draped gowns including the look worn by Grace Jones in A View To A Kill, and a dancefloor’s worth of grand gowns with the volume Alaïa spun from air in honeycomb knits and miniature plissé pleats that his many imitators could never quite recreate. The space is ided by metalwork screens, commissioned by Alaïa from designer friends including Marc Newson and Kris Ruhs, which bring to the exhibition space a hint of the 19th-century ironwork which frames the courtyard of Alaïa’s Paris home and headquarters in the Marais, venue for fashion week catwalk shows and impromptu dinners.Richard Wentworth’s intimate portraits of life in this Rue de la Verrerie space, blown up on the back wall, show a life of chic simplicity and laser-focussed craftsmanship. A dinner table is laid for a generous number of friends and family, but with simple settings of white napkins and tumblers, no flowers or placecards Alaïa is bent over the setting of a sleeve, a mille-feuille of tape measures and tracing paper and fabric piled all around. A timeline on the opposite wall includes images of his most beloved clients, including Tina Turner and Jessye Norman as well as Jones and Campbell – a reminder that the Tunisian-born designer championed ersity decades before the rest of the fashion industry.A reportage film made by Ellen von Unwerth during the preparation, staging and aftermath of an Alaïa show in 1990 is a joyful time capsule of pre-Instagram joie de vivre, featuring a baby-faced Campbell sashaying on the catwalk, Helena Christensen reading a book with her hair in rollers, and a cigarette-smoking Christy Turlington drinking beer standing on a zinc-topped Paris bar.Alice Black, the director of the Design Museum highlights a dress of black broderie anglaise, every millimetre overstitched with shimmering black beads, as her personal standout garment in the show. One of the earliest pieces, from 1981, is singled out by Carla Sozzani, a close collaborator of Alaïa, as her “absolute favourite”. Spliced from black leather and sharply pleated fabric, with bodycon curves set against sharp geometric lines, it is “just perfection”, she said at the launch. “I could look at this dress forever.”Azzedine Alaïa: The Couturier at the Design Museum, London, 10 May to 7 October"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cfe27f48040c3f426885596a9ac622981ec87d2b/0_25_3648_2188/master/3648.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c76642836ecac12f95a232b51823e849","title":"jojo moyes steps in to save quick reads after literacy project loses funding","story":"‘Sometimes you just have to put your money where your mouth is,’ says the Me Before You author, who will fund the charity for three yearsMe Before You author Jojo Moyes has stepped in to save Quick Reads, just two weeks after the popular adult literacy scheme announced it was on the brink of closure due to a lack of funding.Moyes’s donation was not disclosed, but charity the Reading Agency, which runs the scheme, had previously said it would need £120,000 a year for at least three years to keep Quick Reads going. Moyes said her funds would cover that time frame, and that she would help the organisation find future funding thereafter.“There’s a political side of me that feels dismayed that it’s down to an inidual to keep a scheme that is basically for the public good going. In an ideal world it wouldn’t be me … but we are where we are,” she said. “We live in really difficult times and I felt sometimes you just have to put your money where your mouth is, and this is a cause I believe in.”Aimed at the one in six adults in the UK with reading difficulties, Quick Reads publishes entertaining, simply written books by well-known writers from Andy McNab to Malala Yousafzai. Launched in 2006, it announced in April that it was preparing to close. Its funding from Mars Galaxy ended in 2016, and from Arts Council England in 2017, and the quest to find money elsewhere had failed.The funding from Moyes, whose novel Me Before You has sold 8m copies around the world and was adapted for film in 2016, means that Quick Reads will be able to continue commissioning books, with the next new title to be released in 2020.The Reading Agency’s chief executive Sue Wilkinson said the charity “couldn’t be more thankful to Jojo for recognising the importance of the scheme and so generously providing the funding to enable it to continue”.“It was with a heavy heart that we announced the end of Quick Reads last month, after seeking ongoing support for the initiative for 18 months,” said Wilkinson. “The moving testimonies from the public, authors and all of our partners last month demonstrated how much they value these wonderful books and how Quick Reads have touched so many people’s lives. As a charity, we are continually working to secure enough funding to keep our high-quality programmes running and support the 1.4 million people who rely on our work each year, so this is an extraordinary gift.”Moyes said she would also be more involved with the scheme. “My aim is to give them a three-year window, so hopefully I can encourage other people to support them. My intention is to make publishers take a bigger role as well, because if we don’t feed the seedbed of reading then frankly we’re not going to have readers. It’s in their interest to have this scheme not just survive, but flourish,” she said.

In the book, Wilkie Collins keeps Marian Halcombe at the home, moving in with her sister Laura and brother-in-law Walter to become a surrogate parent to their children (and, according to some literary critics, throwing a semi-incestuous sapphic ner in to the works). The BBC adaptation instead whisked Marian away to go travelling around the world – possible, although not easy for a single woman in the 19th century.But that wasn’t the first break with the source material that the BBC’s take gave us. Because while Jessie Buckley is spirited and delightful in the role, she’s far too pretty to be Marian . One of the greatest heroines of Victorian literature, Marian is introduced in Collin’s novel through Walter Hartright’s rather voyeuristic eyes. Walter drools over his future sister-in-law from afar, particularly her figure – “visibly and delightfully undeformed by stays” – at least until he gets close enough to see her face: “Never was the old conventional maxim, that Nature cannot err, more flatly contradicted – never was the fair promise of a lovely figure more strangely and startlingly belied by the head that crowned it. The lady’s complexion was almost swarthy, and the dark down on her lip was almost a moustache.” As Cher Horowitz from Clueless might put it, she’s a total Monet (great from a distance, but a mess up close).Buckley is the latest in a long line of striking women actors trying to “plain up” – Sally Hawkins as Anne Elliot (“her bloom had vanished early and as even in its height, her father had found little to admire in her”), Talulah Riley as Mary Bennet (“the only plain one in the family”), Mia Wasikowska as Jane Eyre (“Don’t address me as if I were a beauty, I am your plain Quakerish Governess”) – and just the latest attractive woman to play Marian: there was Diana Quick in the 1982 TV adaptation, Tara Fitzgerald in the 1997 film, then Maria Friedman in the oddly compelling musical by Andrew Lloyd Webber in 2004.But what is “ugly” in literature can only go as far as “unconventionally beautiful” on telly, it seems. The latest Woman in White is yet another example of sexed up adaptations even the creepy Count Fosco, described in the novel as approaching 60 and “corpulent”, is played by Riccardo Scamarcio, who is visibly neither. With Fosco, Collins was manipulating a prevailing Victorian idea that all fat people were jolly and inoffensive, unsettling readers by introducing a villain in the guise of comic relief. On a practical level, these changes make sense: Marian is such a scene-stealer that Walter needs a reason to prefer with Laura over her, while the complicated nature of Marian and Fosco’s interactions boils over into sexual tension, as opposed to stomach-churning sleaze.But perhaps there is another reason why we’re meant to find Marian unattractive, why the reader is supposed to take Walter’s preference for blonde-haired Laura for granted. Marian is “swarthy”, Walter says, and Laura describes her sister’s “dear Gypsy face”. That, plus the “thick, coal-black hair, growing unusually low down on her forehead”, seems a a clear indication Collins didn’t envisage his heroine as being white. Although much has been written about Heathcliff’s skin tone in Wuthering Heights, Marian’s race seems to have flown under the radar. It’s a minor point of scholarly debate, but when it comes to an adaptation it becomes flagrant whitewashing – a lead role in a primetime period drama going to an actress of colour could be a career game-changer, not to mention reminding viewers that the Victorian period was nowhere near as white as we’ve been led to believe.The latest Woman in White played fast and loose with its source material, but if the producers had wanted to break with convention, there was a far more faithful – and radical – way they could have done it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5e4f16d079155d01d10527fb00c85b01ec8d4e0/0_210_3812_2287/master/3812.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e44293e22be87ebdf7b97ca80fbcbe5f","title":"soft brexit lords tory moderates","story":"The assault on the Brexit bill – inspired by the Duke of Wellington – has emboldened Tory moderates. This could be their momentNext week the EU withdrawal bill finally emerges from the House of Lords. The bill is now a very different piece of legislation to the one launched in the Commons by David Davis last September. It was significantly amended in the Commons just before Christmas. Now the Lords have fundamentally transformed it. MPs must therefore decide what to do with the many changes that the Lords have made. It will be the most important few months of parliamentary activity in a generation, perhaps more.It was not always clear, when the withdrawal bill was launched, that such a great moment of decision would ever be reached. If the government and Labour leadership had had their way, the soft Brexit opportunities that now face MPs this summer would probably not have existed at all, or in very constrained ways. Both parties had their own reasons for wanting the bill to go through. But a combination of doggedness, craftiness and, above all, the size of the opposition in both houses to a hard Brexit has changed the political agenda through a series of hugely important amendments, often opposed by both the government and the Labour leadership.The most wide-ranging, however, was the amendment tabled by Labour’s Lord Alli to keep the UK in the European Economic Area, which was passed on Tuesday by a majority of 29, against the advice of both major parties. This would put Britain in a relationship with the EU that is comparable to that of Norway. Norway has twice voted not to join the EU, but it remains in the European single market through the EEA. Now Britain’s MPs will have to vote again, not just on the EEA, but on almost all the pivotal issues that would make the difference between a hard Brexit and a soft one.When the bill went through the Commons last autumn, relatively few of these issues raised large tussles. The one big defeat for Theresa May in the Commons was Dominic Grieve’s amendment that, in effect, requires parliament to vote to approve the final withdrawal agreement with the EU, on which work still continues. This remains a crunch issue, but it is now joined by the 13 or so Lords amendments on a wide range of other issues. These include continued membership of the customs union in some form, the adoption of the EU charter of fundamental rights into domestic UK law, and Chris Patten’s amendment ensuring that the UK and Ireland must agree any new Irish border rules before they come into force.For parliament these are all very big questions, on which there could be Commons majorities if MPs were not forced to follow party lines. Coalitions similar to the one that passed the Grieve amendment could be assembled again. Don’t forget, also, that the withdrawal bill is not the only Brexit-related legislation currently under consideration in parliament (the trade bill is particularly significant). And there is the hugely significant possibility that any new bill on the withdrawal terms could be defeated or amended (including by a demand for a fresh referendum).May’s Brexit strategy is to hold the Tory party together by withdrawing entirely from the EU, while making serious practical compromises to maintain as “frictionless” a relationship as possible with the EU, its institutions, agencies and member states – Ireland above all. Government defeats on crucial questions such as the single market, the customs union or the Irish border would overturn the entire strategy. Yet this is becoming more likely now. May’s strategy worked for her first months as prime minister. But the “lost election” of 2017 and the fundamental differences among Conservative MPs and ministers over Brexit issues that cannot be permanently postponed mean its lifetime is now almost spent. Labour’s caution on Brexit shows little sign of changing, but there are enormous temptations for Jeremy Corbyn to overcome his anti-EU instincts in order to humiliate the government on at least some of the Lords amendments.This explains why, even as she runs out of road on Brexit, May still acts as if she is hoping that something unexpected will turn up. There is now talk at Westminster of the Brexit bill votes being delayed to the autumn, partly to avoid embarrassing Commons defeats affecting the June EU summit at which the future relationship will be discussed – and partly because Conservative rebels on both sides of the argument might be more disciplined if the talks appear to be nearing a successful conclusion.It is hard to imagine that the Tory party’s Commons discipline is about to collapse on every single issue that the Lords have put on the table. Nevertheless, the Tory soft Brexiters seem a bit bolder now. That is partly because their numbers are gently creeping up – and also because, in the end, these moderate Tories feel they have to fight harder now if they are to prevent their party collapsing even further to the Ukip right.That is why every disloyal provocation by Boris\u0026nbspJohnson or other ministers – such as the foreign secretary’s “crazy” jibe this week – acts as a recruiting sergeant for the soft Brexiters. The coming weeks and months may be their moment. A hung parliament gives them the means. The slide to the right gives them the motive. And now the Lords have given them their opportunity. It will be a hot political summer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dbef697e34dedc54462e330acf86d5a59184a703/0_173_4288_2573/master/4288.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f08e6df0c704d747db83e5816e76c69","title":"poutine and beyond 10 local eats you have to try when youre in canada","story":" The revered combo of chips, gravy and cheese curd is arguably Canada’s national food – even McDonald’s serves it. But there are dozens of other regional delicacies to be found across the country. From sweet treats to edible ferns, here are 10 to get your teeth stuck intoFrom Vancouver’s deserved reputation for incredible Asian fare to the hearty variation on French peasant food found in Quebec, Canada’s cuisine reflects its enviable confluence of cultures. Diversity here is not just an abstract concept – it is something you can taste, from unlikely imported favourites like Ukrainian pierogi dumplings and Jewish deli-style smoked-meat sandwiches to home-grown poutine.Nanaimo barsThese decadent sweet treats consist of a chocolate crumb base covered in custard-flavoured butter icing and topped with a layer of chocolate. Different places do different versions, and often deviate from the original recipe (known as the classic), with everything from nuts to coconut to peanut butter thrown in. You’ll see Nanaimo bars in bakeries across Canada but, as the name suggests, they originated in Nanaimo, a small city on Vancouver Island. Visit there and you’ll find multitudinous interpretations of this much-loved treat. There’s even a 39-stop Nanaimo bar trail where you can sample Nanaimo bar martinis, cupcakes, waffles and spring rolls, and get a themed pedicure at a local spa. Halifax donairWhen you see your first Halifax donair you may wonder why this is considered special – after all, it looks like the same late-night doner kebab that is served in cities the world over – but there’s a delicious twist that makes it unique. A Halifax donair comes served with a sweet garlic sauce that resembles runny icing, and is unbelievably delicious. The sauce is made up of evaporated milk, garlic powder, vinegar, and sugar, and is what gives these kebabs their cult following. In recent years they’ve gone a bit gourmet, and you’ll find them served in other major Canadian cities – but always listed as a Halifax donair. You should absolutely try one, even if sober.FiddleheadsEvery spring you’ll see fiddleheads on the menus of high-end restaurants and at farmers’ markets across Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. Fiddleheads, the curly, edible shoots of the ostrich fern, are usually foraged along marshy riverbanks and woodlands. Like so many regional delicacies, they are an acquired taste, but their flavour varies greatly depending on how they are prepared.BeavertailsThese massive flat doughnuts originated in Ottawa back in 1978, and are found sold at Beavertails stands and stores across Canada. Served regular, Beavertails come sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar, but there’s a whole range of toppings from chocolate banana or apple cinnamon to hazelnut, maple and more. All are, of course, delicious, and are especially tasty when eaten on a cold day with a cup of hot chocolate. PoutineThis combination of fries and cheese curd smothered in gravy is a Québec classic that you’ll find served throughout the country – it’s even on the menu at McDonald’s outlets across Canada. So it won’t be hard for you to try some version of this very Canadian street food. And once you’ve navigated the classic, explore the variations: many restaurants in Nova Scotia serve lobster poutine (which is amazing), and there are plenty of places in Québec – such as La Banquise in Montreal – that have entire poutine menus, where the toppings include everything from roast chicken, peas and stuffing to smoked beef brisket.Cod tongueAs unappetising as they sound, cod tongues – served pan-fried with scrunchions (bite-sized fresh pork scratchings) – are delicious and tender. Like lobster, cod tongues used to be considered a poor man’s food, but now you’ll find them on menus at fancy restaurants up and down Canada’s east coast, often listed as a starter.Butter tartThe ridiculously rich butter tart is a Canadian staple. The consistency and taste is somewhat similar to a treacle tart, but not quite, and the topic of whether or not butter tarts should contain raisins is rather controversial. You’ll find butter tarts everywhere, from the fanciest bakeries to gas stations in middle of nowhere, but if you want to experience the best of the best, head to Ontario’s Best Butter Tart Festival, held every June in Midland, Ontario.PierogiThere’s a huge Ukranian population in the prairie provinces of Manitoba and Saskatchewan, so it’s no surprise that pierogis are a big thing there. These tasty little dumplings traditionally come stuffed with meat or cheese and potato, but now you’ll find them stuffed with everything from blueberries to caramelised onions, because pierogi have gone upmarket. You’ll find pierogi food trucks and high-end restaurants doing them in interesting ways across Canada. If you’d prefer to go old school, look for homely pierogi joints when visiting Winnipeg or Saskatoon (which even has a pierogi drive-through, Baba’s).BannockThis flash-fried bread resembles a doughnut, and has long been a staple in the diet of some of Canada’s indiginous communities, who produced their own variation by baking a wild plant called camas, before European settlers introduced wheat flour in the 17th century. You’ll see it served at traditional restaurants – or if you visit a reservation while in Canada – but also on the menus of fine-dining restaurants (sometimes served as a starter or in place of bread, and often with a ramekin some delicious thing to slather it with). Extremely moreish.Montreal smoked-meat sandwichesThe meat in one of these epic sandwiches is brined, spiced and smoked brisket. This comes piled high in sliced rye bread and spread with mustard, and is a carnivore’s dream. Schwartz’s Deli in Montreal is one of the best places to find an authentic sandwich (which comes with fries and a pickle) and the real Jewish deli experience – it has been using the same recipe since 1928 and the interior doesn’t look like it’s changed much in decades. If the queues at Schwartz’s look daunting, then cross the street and join the locals at the Main Deli Steak House. It’s where Montreal-born Leonard Cohen would get his fix whenever he returned home.For more information and inspiration, see explore-canada"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a288f90ccb4daa2ee36fa7ec39f20dd806cd1cf/0_0_4974_3184/master/4974.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=f55165ff18ce9b99501db49ba6acafc7 1400w","title":"running wild five of the best national park runs","story":"Boost your stamina by hitting a national park trail, where natural wonders will push you to new heightsLength: 4 milesTime: 50 minutesStartfinish: Loch Morlich Beach car park (OS Explorer OL57)Grade: EasyAscent: 164 feet (50 metres)Terrain: Wide gravel paths and forest trailsRefuel: Glenmore Visitor Centre cafe (PH22 1QU)Home to the highest mountains in the UK, the Cairngorms national park is known for its snowy plateaux and abundant Munros (hills over 3,000ft914 metres). But don’t let the extreme landscape put you off lacing up your trainers, as among the lofty peaks are swathes of ancient native forests and hidden lochs to explore on foot – and you won’t need to pack an ice-axe or crampons. This gentle route takes you on a clockwise circuit of Loch Morlich, a tranquil stretch of water surrounded by woodland and fringed by sandy beaches at the foot of the northern Cairngorms. For most of the waymarked route you’ll be running through open pine forest, glimpsing views of Loch Morlich and the stunning backdrop of rounded, often snow-covered mountains mirrored in its still water. The area is a haven for wildlife – it’s worth pausing to catch your breath at one of the many burns (streams) that feed the loch, for a chance to spot dippers, wagtails and herons. As you continue around the loch keep an eye out for red squirrels darting up trees and golden eagles soaring overhead. Once you’ve completed the four-mile loop, there’s always the option to finish with a bracing dip in the water at Loch Morlich beach, famous for being one of the highest in Britain.Length: 3.8 milesTime: 1 hourStartfinish: Whitesands car park (OS Explorer OL35)Grade: ModerateAscent: 392ft (119 metres)Terrain: Coastal path and heathlandRefuel: Whitesands beach cafe (SA62 6PS)Following a section of the long-distance Pembrokeshire Coast Path, this 3.8-mile circular route around St David’s Head packs plenty into its short length. And what it lacks in mileage it more than makes up for with a magnificent seascape dominated by Ramsey Island and an archipelago of rocky islands known as the Bishops and Clerks. As you follow the undulating coast path towards the rugged peninsula of St David’s Head, it’s worth looking back at the curving mile-long sandy beach of Whitesands Bay with its rolling surf breaks. Along with breathtaking coastal views and plenty of wildlife-spotting opportunities, the route passes two prehistoric monuments: Coetan Arthur, a 5,000-year-old burial chamber, and an iron age coastal fort perched at the end of the peninsula. The inland return leg takes you through wildlife-rich heathland that skirts the lower flanks of the jagged outcrop of Carn Llidi, before rejoining the coast path back to Whitesands Bay. If you’re keen to try a spot of off-road running then this is a very accessible circuit with enough punch to give your legs a bit of a test.Length: 11 milesTime: 3 hoursStartfinish: Market Cross, OsmotherleyClay Bank car park (OS Explorer OL26)Grade: ChallengingAscent: 2,460ft (750 metres)Terrain: Stone-paved moorland paths and woodland tracksRefuel: Lordstones cafe at Carlton Bank (TS9 7JH)Following a segment of the 109-mile Cleveland Way national trail across the northern escarpment of the North York Moors national park, this is a strenuous route with some thigh-burning ascents and descents. But at the top of each steep climb you will be rewarded with outstanding views across the national park and beyond: north to the distant conurbation of Teesside and south and east across an expanse of moors and dales. The waymarked route heads north out of the pretty village of Osmotherley before entering a rollercoaster landscape that crosses five undulating moors: Scarth Wood Moor, Live Moor, Cringle Moor, Cold Moor and Hasty Bank. Along the way, signs of the area’s industrial past are visible in the remains of alum, jet and ironstone mining the raw materials that were transported to Teesside during the Industrial Revolution. After a well-deserved break at Lordstones cafe, the route gets serious as it crosses the Three Sisters, a series of steep, rocky climbs with technical downhill sections including the impressive jagged sandstone crags known as the Wainstones, before a final steep descent brings you to Clay Bank. It’s not a route for the faint-hearted, but it certainly delivers when it comes to stunning moorland scenery. And the sense of achievement you feel at the end is most definitely worth it.Length: 7.3 milesTime: 2 hoursStartfinish: Heddon valley National Trust car park (OS Explorer OL9)Grade: ChallengingAscent: 1,270ft (387 metres)Terrain: Woodland track, exposed coast path and quiet roadRefuel: Hunters Inn, Heddon valley (EX31 4PY)The deep, wooded Heddon valley on the western flanks of Exmoor national park is a hidden gem for trail running, with its appealing mix of terrain, from gentle riverside paths and peaceful woodland tracks to rugged high sea cliffs and exposed moorland. And this circular route includes a healthy blend of them all. It begins in a tranquil woodland setting following an old smugglers’ path towards Heddon’s Mouth Cleave. But don’t be lulled into a false sense of “easiness” – the sting isn’t in the tail of this route, but a mere mile into the run when it climbs a steep zig-zag path to reach high sea cliffs with spectacular views across the Bristol channel to the south Wales coastline. You will need to keep your wits about you at this point as the route follows a narrow, exposed path that runs perilously close to the edge of the sheer cliffs rising more than 650ft (200 metres) above the sea below. It’s worth pausing along this coastal stretch to take in the rugged coastline, both ahead and behind you – if you’re lucky you may spot a kestrel hovering above the path or a peregrine falcon nesting in the cliff face. Veering off the coast path the route takes you across open moorland to reach its highest point at Holdstone Hill (1,145ft349 metres) before gently descending into dense oak woodland to follow Ladies’ Mile back to Hunters Inn, where you can reward yourself with a pint of local ale.Length: 10 milesTime: 3 hoursStartfinish: Cutthroat Bridge lay-by on the A57 (OS Explorer OL1)Grade: ChallengingAscent: 1,689ft (515 metres)Terrain: Moorland paths and woodland tracksRefuel: Ladybower Inn (S33 0AX)The Peak District national park can certainly deliver the goods when it comes to a bracing off-road course with stupendous views. On this 10-mile circular route, prepare yourself for some hefty climbing during the first half as you ascend to Derwent Moor and journey along the ridge of Derwent Edge, but once past the trig point at Back Tor (1,765ft538 metres) the remainder of the route is much less demanding. Your first glimpse of Ladybower reservoir, a vast Y-shaped man-made reservoir, appears as you approach Whinstone Lee Tor, and as you continue northwards along Derwent Edge, passing a number of surreal eroded granite outcrops, the views of the Peak District landscape continue to impress: east across a vast stretch of exposed moorland and west along the lush Derwent valley towards the distinctive ridge of Mam Tor, Hollins Cross and Lose Hill in the distance. The final segment is a gentle leg-stretcher along the eastern edge of the reservoir through Ladybower wood, passing through the lost village of Ashopton, which was flooded during the construction of the reservoir in 1940s. This isn’t a route for putting your head down and gunning for a personal best in fact, it’s worth easing off your pace so that you can fully enjoy the spectacular scenery.Unisex Colorado running packThis pack is ideal for long trail runs, with adjustable hip belt and chest straps.

Even when it looks absurd to outsiders – remember the omelette dress of 2015? – the fashion seen on the Met Gala red carpet has been considered and planned with the solemnity of a papal conclave. In their Manhattan hotel rooms, celebrities dress for this event with a level of meticulous ceremony which would befit a Sunday at St Peters.This year’s dress code was a challenge. To succeed on this red carpet required honouring the theme of Catholicism in fashion without being seen to make fun of it. What is special about the Met red carpet – by comparison, for instance, with Cannes – is that you can’t win it just by looking good. A supermodel can wear a tight dress and high heels and sail through almost every other public occasion with flying colours, but that look is a fast track to being completely ignored at the Met. You have to dig deep for this night, because Met Gala triumph requires not just beauty but bravery and a leap of faith. The Vatican would surely approve.The obvious link between the world presided over by Pope Francis and the one ruled by Queen Anna Wintour is that clothing delineates status. Rihanna attacked this theme with her signature fearlessness and blew everyone else out of the water. In the season of the first Millicent Fawcett statue and of a Christian Dior slogan T-shirt namechecking Linda Nochlin’s feminist essay “Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists”, RiRi gave us a female pope. She wore a heavily embellished mini dress under a matching cloak, accessorised with a pointed mitre, stiletto heels and pearls strung around one ankle – because, after all, there’s not always room for a rosary in a clutch bag – all created for her by John Galliano for the house of Maison Margiela. The look was a version of an ensemble designed by Galliano during his time at Christian Dior that appeared on the catwalk in 2000 worn by a man, and is included in the Met exhibition.But clothes are never only about power, either in fashion or in the church. Beauty as a metaphor for human goodness runs through the history of art, through religious iconography and through the way fashion worships at the altar of beauty and glamour. Katy Perry was a triumph in Versace. In a gold dress and boots, and with a 6ft white feathered wing, she was arguably the most breathtaking representation of the archangel Gabriel since Fra Angelico painted the Annunciation fresco in the Convent of San Marco. (And yes, I do realise how sacrilegious that is, in artistic terms.)Sienna Miller in gold and white Louis Vuitton was also ine as another Renaissance angel on the red carpet.The transactional business of fashion is a multimillion-pound industry precisely because it taps into powerful emotions and desires. Fashion deliberately blurs the boundaries between things that you have the power to change and the things you don’t. (You can buy the perfect party dress, but you can’t actually buy romance or joy or fun.) Religious imagery has long employed the same porous boundaries, conjuring the invisible into life. The word halo – an accessory seen last night on Solange Knowles in Iris Van Herpen and Lily Collins in Givenchy, among others – means glory. And the aesthetic of papal garments has roots in worldly power, as well as spiritual. When the Emperor Constantine moved his capital east to Constantinople and allowed the pontiffs to assume control the old capital, Rome, they incorporated some of the clothing and accessories worn by the Roman emperors who had ruled before them, the better to legitimise their power in the eyes of the people of Rome.Like all the best dress codes, the Met Gala invitation allowed for lots of iniduality. Frances McDormand consolidated her role as 2018’s designated maverick by coming as “a pagan”, she said on the red carpet, in her butterfly headdress by Philip Treacy for Valentino. Those actors who have pledged vows to fashion houses (or at least, signed contracts with them) showed their constancy with looks that mined clerical robes for the most this-season silhouette. A clear winner on this is the mozzetta, a short shoulder-covering robe worn by the pope and cardinals and, last night, by a very chic Alicia Vikander in Louis Vuitton. Kate Moss wore a black dress with a feathered black neckline that nodded to the dress code with a fallen-angel vibe – this was her first appearance in the US since 2009, and there was speculation that the prolonged absence was due to difficulty procuring a visa after the drug scandal of 2005 – but mainly referenced herself. Moss in a black feather trim dress, with Johnny Depp at Cannes, and a messy bun, is a late-1990s fashion reference the fashion faithful will immediately recognise.Best red-carpet quote of the night, though, goes to the actor Lena Waithe, who wore a rainbow flag cape to spotlight the Catholic church’s complicated relationship with the LGBTQ community. “The theme to me is, like, be yourself,” she told the New York Times on the red carpet. “You were made in God’s image, right?”• This article was amended on 9 May 2018 to clarify a credit.

What message am I supposed to draw from it?Daisy, by emailGlad you asked, Daisy, because there are many lessons to take from I Feel Pretty, but not one of them is the message that the movie itself is promoting. Let’s look at this film, briefly. Schumer plays a woman, Renee, who feels ugly and is treated like an absolute troll by everyone around her, because that is how Hollywood thinks people who look like Schumer should be treated. She then whacks her head on a giant piece of Convenient Plot Device and is so brain-damaged that when she wakes up she thinks she looks beautiful because, Christ, you’d basically have to knock out all your grey matter to think Schumer, an A-list actress, is attractive, right? The film proceeds to laugh at her for the next two or whatever hours as she goes around town acting deranged because she thinks she’s gorgeous, which is definitely how grown women behave. She also ditches her friends because she feels too beautiful for them, which is also how women behave, and all of this is a searing exploration of the beauty standards for women or something something blah blah blah feminist lite word salad feminist lite word salad. Anyway, the film ends with Renee realising she’s not pretty, but is, like, on the inside, and she then makes a super-inspirational speech about the importance of inner beauty while selling makeup to other women the film considers equally trollish. Because inner beauty is great but, let’s be honest, gals, it has its limits.Schumer has spent much of the past few months insisting this film is all about helping women’s self-esteem, which suggests she hasn’t actually seen it. Because what it is actually saying is that women who don’t look like Emily Ratajkowski, who also appears in the film, are public laughing stocks who, at best, might learn to style it out. Well, I\u0026nbspcan’t really blame Schumer for giving it a miss because it’s absolute garbage and I’d rather eat my hands than have to sit through it again.What I am interested in is not what beauty does or doesn’t do to women, but what Hollywood has done to Schumer. There is a\u0026nbspfascinating disjunct between the stuff Schumer made for TV and the stuff she is making for the movies. Her sketch show, Inside Amy Schumer, was uneven, like all sketch shows, but when it was good it was excellent, skewering standards for female beauty and the expectations society puts on women and women put on themselves. Yet her films, namely Trainwreck and I Feel Pretty, do precisely the opposite. In Trainwreck, which Schumer wrote, her character had to prove she was worth some tedious sports doctor, and to do this she had to quit her job, become a cheerleader and be physically humiliated. I Feel Pretty is one long sneer at Schumer and anyone who doesn’t look like Ratajkowski, a\u0026nbspwoman whose real-life career, as far as I can tell, is Instagramming her cleavage. Now, we can argue all day about whether photographing your boobs is a feminist pursuit or not (spoiler: it’s not), but any film that posits someone who does this as the physical ideal is not a film that can seriously claim it is fighting against the narrowness of beauty standards for women.Schumer is not the first woman whose brilliance on TV has been bleached out of her in the movies – Tina Fey has been here before her, as was Gilda Radner before that. But there is something extra dismaying about seeing Schumer make – and defend! – this egregious woman-hating garbage, when she used to be smarter than this. So the conclusion to draw, Daisy, is that Hollywood is the Sunken Place for smart women, where their souls and brains are cut out of them as they find themselves serving, zombie-like, the oppressors they once abhorred. It’s too late to save Schumer, but can we all just promise not to let Mindy Kaling, Jessica Williams and Kristen Schaal go the same way, too? Because, honestly, I don’t think my heart could take it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d23f86d5268d4b7b4a5ae9a2e59f63661f7fa63/0_95_3048_1829/master/3048.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=478009058d08c355d0a8b93414ca7d7b","title":"chelsea huddersfield premier league match report","story":"Huddersfield Town’s sojourn back in the top flight was supposed to be fleeting, a one-season dalliance with the elite, but David Wagner and his side are not done with life at this level just yet. A point squeezed despite incessant Chelsea pressure will prolong their stay into a second year, effectively at Swansea’s expense. The joyous visiting players swiftly persuaded the management to cancel the team’s flight home in favour of a coach journey back to west Yorkshire. Beery celebrations were no doubt maintained up the M1 through the small hours.Theirs has been a staggering achievement, one perhaps lost amid the plaudits strewn over sides overseen by Pep Guardiola and Sean Dyche, or others steered to safety by Roy Hodgson, Chris Hughton or Rafael Benítez. Wagner deserves similar accolades. “People said we had no chance and they were right,” he offered, his trousers hoisted back to his waist after an unfortunate and inadvertent flash as he was subjected to the bumps in front of the away support.“We were anything but a Premier League club last summer, but we have given it a go. If you have the passion, desire and spirit you can compete with top, top quality.”They have done just that, at Manchester City and Chelsea in successive games, to claim the unlikely draws to edge them to safety and effectively condemn Swansea – three points adrift of Southampton and 10 goals worse off – in the process. It was fitting Town should achieve a campaign’s objective with such a scrap of a performance, a frenzy of blocks and challenges to blunt Chelsea’s Champions League aspirations, with their resolve utterly unbreakable as the home side poured at them through the chaotic latter stages.One madcap pinball in the visitors’ penalty area seven minutes from time summed up their refusal to wilt, players flinging themselves into a succession of blocks as the ball ricocheted off the mass of bodies. When it eventually broke free to loop up invitingly to Andreas Christensen, the Dane’s header back towards the far corner was tipped thrillingly on to a post and behind for a corner by the ing Jonas Lössl. They simply would not allow Chelsea in for the victory that would have thrust them level with Liverpool. Huddersfield were not to be denied.They had briefly even enjoyed a lead here, plucked from one of their three shots. Willian lost out to Chris Lowe and with home players committed upfield, Aaron Mooy, a midfielder whose industry sets the tone, lofted a simple pass down the middle into space beyond Christensen.On to the loose ball lumbered Laurent Depoitre, a striker previously without a goal this year and noted more for his brawn than any searing pace, to attempt to lift a shot over the onrushing Willy Caballero as the pair collided on the edge of the penalty area. As the Argentinian goalkeeper lay prone on the turf Depoitre retained his composure to lift a follow-up beyond a stumbling Antonio Rüdiger and into the gaping net.The majority inside this arena blanched at the concession. Antonio Conte had rested six players here with one eye on the FA\u0026nbspCup final and while his team’s endeavour could not be doubted, it took the introduction of the cavalry – Olivier Giroud and Eden Hazard – to force parity. César Azpilicueta’s low centre fizzed across the six-yard box and Mathias Jørgensen, in attempting to hack it clear, succeeded only in belting the ball on to Marcos Alonso’s forehead. In it flew beyond a startled Lössl, the Spaniard just as shocked to have been rewarded in such bizarre fashion.Yet, for all that Rüdiger would miss two appealing opportunities from close range, that was the extent of the damage the home side would inflict. Christopher Schindler was vocal and inspirational organising his back-line, Lössl excellent in goal and the Mooy and Jonathan Hogg combination in midfield snapped into challenges to disrupt the home side’s rhythm. Chelsea could find no way through and, trailing Liverpool by two points on the final afternoon, have surely now given up any lingering hopes of qualifying for the Champions League.The vast majority of the home support had ambled away as the players went through the motions of a post-match lap of appreciation, their body language almost apologetic. This may have been Conte’s last home game in charge. “It is for the club to judge the situation and then to take the best decision,” he offered through numbed disappointment. “We have another game to play, and the FA Cup final, and then the club – for sure – will do the best to improve the situation.”The Italian is unlikely to be in the Premier League next season. Huddersfield most definitely will be."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c427be05a7744064a63f17e5c81f9a88d3209d00/74_0_3352_2012/master/3352.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=86ebbdcc1d72065f4b95523d3061712f","title":"tottenham hotspur newcastle united premier league match report","story":"It was a long way from being the most fluent performance of the Mauricio Pochettino era and there were times, particularly during a fraught first half, when the Tottenham support could imagine the worst-case scenario that their team would contrive to lose their grip on Champions League qualification.But the mood and the match turned on one swish of Harry Kane’s boot early in the second half and with Chelsea failing to beat Huddersfield Town at Stamford Bridge, it turned into a night of celebration. For the third season in succession Pochettino has led Spurs into Europe’s elite competition and, given the budgets he has had to work with, nobody can say it is not an outstanding achievement.Happily for all concerned, the club’s new stadium, into which they will move next season, will begin life as a Champions League venue. Spurs will finish as the top team in London for the first time since 1994-95 and they will wrap up third place if they beat Leicester City at Wembley on Sunday.Pochettino had declared this match to be about the mentality of his players and they found a way to chisel out the result. Newcastle were proactive and they created plenty of opportunities and Rafael Benítez complained about the non-award of two penalties for his team – the biggest shout coming when Hugo Lloris caught Matt Ritchie in the 58th minute.Kane has still to rediscover the red-hot form he showed before his ankle injury in March and his air-kick for an attempted volley when gloriously placed in the 40th minute summed up both his and the team’s travails before the interval. But he dug deep and found a way to make the difference.It was an excellent finish, swept high inside Martin Dubravka’s near post after Son Heung-min had drawn three Newcastle defenders to him and popped the ball back to Kane. The England striker now has 28 Premier League goals – three short of Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah. The Golden Boot race could yet go to the wire.Pochettino was elated and he made the point of thanking his backroom staff for their work. But he also highlighted how Tottenham had made light of their temporary move to Wembley. “People did not realise how tough it was for the players and for the fans too,” he said. “To achieve the top four under this condition – it is a massive achievement.”Spurs were loose, anxious and too lateral in the first half and there were groans of frustration from the home crowd at the end of it, which sounded a lot like boos. With so much at stake, it was also surprising to see so many empty seats. The attendance of 54,923 was the club’s third lowest of the league season.Newcastle called the tune before the interval and they ought to have led. Jonjo Shelvey banged a free-kick from the edge of the area against the outside of a post while Lloris sprang to his right to keep out Jamaal Lascelles’s header. It was a wonderful save. Dwight Gayle headed too high from close-range and the visitors had further flickers.Pochettino’s team and the home fans refocused during the interval. There was bellowed encouragement upon the restart and, shortly afterwards, Kane fashioned the breakthrough.Spurs had other moments in front of goal through Jan Vertonghen, Dele Alli and Danny Rose but they could not relax. Ayoze Pérez miskicked after a Newcastle counter and when Lloris left his line to deal with the follow-up, there was contact with Ritchie. The referee, Neil Swarbrick, was unmoved. Benítez also felt Pérez ought to have had a penalty for a pull, although that was harder to see.Murphy’s chance came after he outstripped the unconvincing Davinson Sánchez only to blaze high and it seemed it would not be Newcastle’s night.The blot for Tottenham – and England – was the kick from Mohamed Diamé that forced Kieran Trippier off, although the home fans gave his replacement, Toby Alderweireld, a hero’s welcome. Trippier twisted awkwardly and Pochettino declared himself “a little bit concerned”. Otherwise he radiated satisfaction."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0acc1def72745b27d3a1b4b7589344b5c2c097b0/0_180_3191_1914/master/3191.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4bce144e7486a2da465120ff31a91784","title":"chelsea v huddersfield spurs v newcastle and more premier league clockwatch live","story":"Huddersfield are safe after earning a precious point at Chelsea, while Spurs are now guaranteed Champions League football next season.And finally, Dominic Fifield was at Stamford Bridge to see Huddersfield rather magnificently retain their Premier League status ... and deliver a serious blow to Chelsea’s hopes of a top-four finish.Thanks for staying with us on a dramatic evening in the Premier League, if not in Scotland. That’s your lot! Nighty night, and sweet dreams wherever you are!Leicester City saw off Arsenal at home ... but then again who doesn’t these days? Stuart James saw the Gunners lose their seventh straight match on the road, a record that stretches back to the miserable mid-60s days of Billy Wright.Harry Kane secured Champions League football for Spurs next season ... and kept on Mo Salah’s tail in the race to be the top Premier League scorer of this campaign. David Hytner witnessed that one.And here come the reports! Jamie Jackson was at the Etihand to see Manchester City rewrite the record books ...And now it’s the turn of the astonishing David Wagner. “To be honest I don’t think my English is good enough to find the words to describe what the players have done over the whole season. Tonight we have seen everything that counts for us: effort, attitude and togetherness. If you have the passion, desire and spirit you can compete. We had luck today, there is no doubt. But if a group of players deserved it, it’s this group. We have had some big dips, but we’ve always been able to come back. We have done it ourselves. It is so important for me that we were not relying on others. I have not enough English vocabulary to describe how I feel.” Oh I think you do. As eloquent a tribute as his players could wish for.Huddersfield keeper Jonas Lossl has been named man of the match at Stamford Bridge. And no wonder: his fingertip save from Andreas Christensen during the closing stages was one of the stops of the season. It’s kept his team in the ision. “The feeling is overwhelming right now. It’s what we’ve fought for. To finish here like this, against these teams, City and Chelsea, is unbelievable. Mentally, it was tough. Chelsea need it, but we fought, we fought like we never did before.”A bit more on Hibs. Their defeat in the Edinburgh derby means they’ll almost certainly finish fourth ... unless they can beat third-placed Rangers by six goals at Easter Road on Sunday. Well, there’s always hope. A perhaps more realistic route into the Europa League is offered by Celtic, who will open the door for Hibs if they beat Motherwell in the Scottish Cup final. Aberdeen’s place in the competition next season has been confirmed. Harry Kane’s goal has ensured Spurs will play in next season’s Champions League! They’re not guaranteed third spot yet ... they’ll need to beat Leicester on Sunday to make sure of that ... but they’re very much unlikely to care right now. Another European adventure awaits a club on the up!So that was already the most goals in a Premier League season (105) ... and now City have registered the most wins (31) and points (97) too. A lot of records nabbed off Chelsea, there.Leicester are guaranteed to finish ninth, unless Newcastle do something very strange at Wembley in the next few minutes. Arsenal are going to end Arsene Wenger’s final season in sixth. They ended Bruce Rioch’s only season in fifth, so it’s come full circle, almost, kind of.Hearts take the spoils in the Edinburgh derby, and Hibs will almost certainly end the season in fourth place.... but anyway, that point for Huddersfield at Stamford Bridge means Chelsea are really up against it now if they want to play Champions League football next season. They’ll need to win at Newcastle on Sunday, and hope Liverpool lose for the first time at Anfield in the league all season, to Brighton \u0026amp Hove Albion. None of it’s beyond the realms, but Liverpool now have the draw in their back pocket. Still, the jig isn’t yet up ... even though a few Chelsea faces, such as Giroud and Azpilicueta, suggest they think it might be.Town make it to the line! Survival! Another magnificent point on the road, and they’ll be staying in the Premier League! They cavort in glee, and no wonder: the pre-season favourites for relegation have survived with a game to spare! And at the home of the deposed champions, to boot!Oh Arsenal! One last chance for an away point at Huddersfield on Sunday, then.Hogg goes down with cramp, eating up a few seconds before springing up again. Giroud nearly makes himself some space in the Huddersfield box, but Jorgensen stands firm. There are two minutes of stoppage time between Town and Premier League survival!Fernandinho scores number 105 of City’s remarkable season!More pinball in the Huddersfield box. Giroud tries to sidefoot the ball acrobatically home from eight yards, but sends it bouncing harmlessly wide right. There will be six minutes of added time! Which is about right, given all the subs, plus goals, plus faffing about. But that’s going to seem like an age for Huddersfield. Chelsea have a new spring in their step!Morata, just inside the box on the left, unleashes a whistling shot goalwards. Lossl parries it clear with strong hands. Then Willian has a go. It pinballs around, then dribbles through to the keeper. One minute left, plus stoppages of course.Huddersfield can almost touch safety. But they’re beginning to shank and scuff clearances they were earlier putting their foot through. Hazard releases a little pressure on the visitors by dragging a shot wide from distance. Lossl is booked for faffing around to an absurd degree when taking the goal kick that restarts the game. There are now three minutes to go. There are five minutes to go. Huddersfield hook Smith, who takes an age to leave the field of play. Willian comes across and tries to shove him off. Predictably, there’s a brief but frank exchange of views. There are now four minutes to go ... though you can surely expect plenty of stoppages, especially after that brouhaha.Huddersfield might have been pressed back for most of this game. But they’ve rarely looked ragged. Until now, that is. Hazard very nearly sashays his way through the middle towards goal. But he’s crowded out at the last. Then a corner, from which there’s a ludicrous cartoon scramble just in front of the Huddersfield goal. Rudiger and Hazard whiff shots from close range. Then the ball rears up, allowing Christensen to guide a clever header towards the top left from the middle of the melee. But Lossl somehow fingertips it onto the post, and his team-mates hack clear! That was absurd!Huddersfield are now playing with all 11 men camped in their final third. Most of the Chelsea lads are in there too. There’s no release valve. The home side are utterly dominant in terms of possession and territory ... though they’re not doing a whole lot to force Lossl into emergency action. Quite a few balls being pumped towards Giroud. Will the tactic force a crack in the Huddersfield wall?The ball is coming back at Huddersfield with monotonous regularity now. During the last ten minutes, nearly half of the game has been played in Town’s final third! The final quarter of an hour will seem like a year to the visiting fans. Can their heroes hold on for the point that will guarantee their Premier League survival?That goal of Harry Kane’s is his 28th of the season, by the way. He’s just three behind Mo Salah (31) in the race to end the campaign as 2017-18’s leading scorer.The game at Stamford Bridge has that ludicrous, delightful, zany end-of-season feel. It’s a triumph of chaos over order, as Chelsea throw the kitchen sink at Town. Chelsea are press, press, pressing Huddersfield back, as the visitors desperately try to hold onto the point that will preserve their Premier League status. They’re vulnerable on the break, though, and once again Billing nearly releases Pritchard into acres ... and once again, Kante’s the man who snuffs out some serious danger!Hearts regain the lead in the Embra rammy, and Hibs’ hopes of a second or third-place finish look to be seriously receding.It’s that man again ... and it’s a significant goal, because as things stand, Spurs will be guaranteed Champions League football next season!Ten-man Arsenal equalise at the King Power, and the chance of a first away point for the Gunners in the calendar year of 2018 is a live one!Scrub all that! Chelsea equalise, and in the most farcical way possible! Jorgensen hoicks clear from his own six-yard line ... and blooters the ball straight into Alonso’s startled face. The ball rebounds into the bottom right, Lossl with no hope of reacting to the dreadful stroke of luck! That is beyond bizarre - and it could have huge implications at both the top and bottom of the table!Hazard is on now, too, at the expense of Pedro. As things stand, Huddersfield are safe Swansea City are as good as down, unless they beat Stoke at the weekend, Southampton lose to Manchester City, and there’s a ten-goal swing in the goal difference and Chelsea will find it almost impossible to catch Liverpool or Spurs in the top four.Chelsea have to go for it now. Accordingly, they’ve brought on Giroud in place of Zappacosta. The rest of this match could well be a case of attack versus defence. Not that Huddersfield are sitting deep at all costs: Billing nearly releases the Huddersfield sub Pritchard with a long pass, but is denied by the indefatigable Kante."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40d8a3db25b5f56e3cd95d954f8458b92c104507/0_238_5605_3363/master/5605.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0bc308cf453af998c15ed319407c382c","title":"young ethiopians poverty yemen the gulf","story":"Persecution and hardship in the Oromia region drives tens of thousands of migrants each year to cross the Red Sea from Djibouti, in a bid to reach the Gulf“We met in the desert,” says Badru Mohammed, gesturing at his three companions. The four Ethiopian boys pause for breath and refreshment beside the road, grasping their plastic water bottles tightly as they sip, careful not to waste a drop. The Djiboutian sun is still low in the sky but the road is already hot. They have more than 200km left to walk and their plastic sandals are disintegrating.Badru and friends are from Jimma, a poor farming district in Ethiopia’s Oromia region. Over the past fortnight they have travelled more than 1,000km from their homes, first on buses and then later on foot, jumping the border into neighbouring Djibouti under the cover of darkness. When the group gathered in Dire Dawa, a town in the arid drylands of eastern Ethiopia a couple of hundred kilometres from the border, there were 20 of them. “Most are left in the desert,” says Badru wearily. “They are very tired. I don’t think they can follow us.”Many do not make it. The numbers that die in the Djiboutian desert are unknown but there are enough unburied dead to contaminate the water supply. Ethiopians walking along the road north to Obock told the  that friends had perished en route. Another group of three, also from Jimma, say they had no food for the duration of the six-day walk from Dire Dawa. Seven of their companions were left in the desert some got lost, they say, but one they watched die. “We’ve had no help from anyone,” says the youngest, a 10-year-old orphan.The journey across the Bab el-Mandeb strait to Yemen is also perilous. One recent estimate put the numbers who have died making the crossing over the past decade at close to 3,000. The boats organised by smugglers are old, rickety and often overcrowded. Few Ethiopians can swim but the vessels, which depart at night in order to avoid detection, usually hover 20m or so away from the shore, which can be fatal for those clambering aboard.The anarchy in Yemen brings a welter of dangers. In January at least 30 people drowned when their migrant boat capsized, with reports of gunfire being used against those on board. In March 2017, a helicopter opened fire on a vessel carrying more than 140 migrants, killing 42 Somalis. Those who make it to shore then face multiple threats. UNHCR has catalogued reports of physical and sexual abuse, abduction, extortion, torture and forced labour by smugglers and criminal networks. “Only a very small minority make it to Saudi Arabia without facing at least one incident of abuse,” says Danielle Botti of the regional mixed migration secretariat (RMMS), which monitors movements between the Horn of Africa and Yemen.Those who survive remain vulnerable. Some are deported straight back to Yemen rather than home, in violation of international law. Some have their passports taken away by their employers, which is against international labour conventions. Francesco Martialis, head of Caritas, which works with street children in Djibouti, recounts the story of a 15-year-old who had fled life as a slave in Saudi Arabia. He had been beaten, his skull cracked, leaving him with amnesia. Unable to remember his family or his home, he had walked hundreds of kilometres alone along the road from Obock to Djibouti City, in the country’s south, before being picked up by police.Young Ethiopians in Obock are either unaware or unfazed by the dangers awaiting across the sea. Around 250 have set up makeshift homes under acacia trees and in caves beneath the cliffs near the rubbish-strewn village of Fantahero. “So what?” asks Hassen, a 20-year-old teacher from Wollo region. “That’s the life of the Ethiopian people.” His companion, Murad, 18, agrees: “We fear Ethiopia more than the war in Yemen.”Many cite persecution and violence as reasons for fleeing. Oromos, the country’s largest ethnic group, complain of marginalisation for more than three years anti-government protests and deadly confrontations with security forces have plagued the region. “I quit my schooling and came here,” says Mohammed, a 17-year-old from Arsi in southern Oromia. “I was a ninth-grade student. But when I saw youths like myself being arrested and thrown in jail I decided to leave. I was afraid of being arrested too.”But for most, poverty is the biggest grievance. “I’m going to Yemen because I need work,” says Hassen. “There’s nothing in Ethiopia. I have a job but it is too expensive there – 2,000 birr (£53) a month? That is not enough! In Saudi Arabia I will get 10,000 birr a month.”Three days earlier, police had arrived in Fantahero and loaded many of the boys into trucks to deposit at the Ethiopian border. But on the whole the migrants are tolerated. Obock locals have done well out of smuggling and a journey that costs somewhere between $300 and $500 (£221-£368) per person. “Nobody will control it,” says Momina Ahmed, a French-Djiboutian who grew up in the town. “All the locals, including the authorities, are profiting.”An IOM transit centre in Obock, across the road from a UNHCR camp for Yemeni refugees fleeing in other direction, is one of the few institutions available for people who want to return to Ethiopia. It assists with voluntary returns, but it can take in only around 250 at any one time. Mohammed, the schoolboy from Arsi, says he is one of the few in Fantahero to get cold feet, but that the centre was full when he visited earlier in the day.Elsewhere in Djibouti, facilities are even more scarce. Mobile health patrols started work only late last year. There are plans to build a humanitarian shelter at Lake Assal, near where the desert hits the coast. There is only one shelter in Djibouti City for migrant children, Caritas, and it is prohibited from providing beds at night.Few will return home without something to show for their efforts. “If it is the will of Allah to improve my life, then maybe one day I will return to Ethiopia,” Badru says fatalistically. Just as he speaks a police truck pulls round the corner. Within moments, the four boys have been ushered into the back by armed police officers, their long, hard journey cut suddenly short."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8fbee5d18106b39065dfb8cbef90f441237d4980/0_602_1659_995/master/1659.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bb63b73c129f2129fcb77ca8d696f06f","title":"custardo replacement for affogato custard and espresso works","story":"Affogato means “drowned” in Italian and, by no coincidence, an affogato is an ice-cream drowned in coffee. A dessert (or drink, depending on your appetite), it usually involves one scoop of vanilla ice-cream and one shot of espresso. Technically speaking, the ice-cream is burned by the espresso, but “scotta” is a little harder to pronounce. Either way, the ice-cream dies a quick but painful death. Bitter irony, then, that the affogato is one of multiple casualties of the so-called Great Vanilla Shortage currently sweeping the nation.It’s no laughing matter – fuelled by a rise in global demand and a squeeze on Madagascan production, vanilla is no longer affordable. Pods can now cost up to £515 a kilo, making them more expensive than silver. The crisis is in its early stages – there’s still vanilla ice-cream in shops – but, by God, go now. The bigger ice-cream companies, such as Jude’s, have absorbed the cost. But many artisanal gelaterias have already scratched vanilla off their chalkboards.This is excellent news for the custardo, a confectionary confection that swaps ice-cream for custard. Custardo was supposedly created by a cafe in London’s coffee belt, Peckham, called Forza Win (where they use creme anglaise) and the result is not dissimilar to Vietnamese hot egg coffee, which mixes egg yolks with sugar, condensed milk and coffee. It is also, arguably, from the same wheelhouse as bicerin, Turin’s highly prized morning drink, which mixes espresso with chocolate and whole milk, a potent combination that stimulates bodily fear and calorific anguish among churchgoers who drink it after mass.Michele Vollaro, general manager at London’s Cafe Murano St James, has heard of it but not tried it. “In Naples, we only drink very traditional coffee,” he says. “I’m a big fan of something like an espresso martini in the evening, but for a pick-me-up in the morning it has to be straight down the line – either an espresso or a cappuccino.” Custardo is a stupid word, and may not take off in Italy, but it is pretty easy to make.Technically (again), custard is usually made with vanilla but – and here’s the key – it’s not a must. When I made custardo, there was nothing decent left in the shop, so I used cheap own-brand custard, which tasted as though it had once been in the vicinity of vanilla, but not made actual contact. Rather than drowning, the custard sort of belly flops into the coffee with a special sort of gracelessness. But I had it for breakfast, and it works. What should have been egregious as a pairing was, in fact, as rich and thick as Theresa May’s cabinet, the custard cutting through the espresso’s bitterness. I’m sure the real stuff – proper vanilla custard and coffee – is better. But if the vanilla shortage continues, we may have to opt for second best."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/73fa60819029d7c237cba0e0dbc0147cb0e21244/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0d25cd7970df732651b63085569313f5","title":"ice cream parlours booming instagram teetotalism","story":"Offering everything from liquid nitrogen-frozen creations to vegan sundaes, a new breed of dessert bars are changing the way people socialise – and dateBuilt in the Victorian era and now a sedate enclave of independent cafes and shops, Cardiff’s Castle Arcade does not look like a crucible of radical innovation. Enter Science Cream, however, and you step into a world of Heston Blumenthal-style theatre. Stood behind a Perspex screen, dressed in white lab coats and protective goggles, this ice-cream parlour’s “laboratrists” use great billowing flasks of liquid nitrogen to instantly freeze what is – thanks to LN2 creating such tiny ice-crystals – some of the smoothest, most thickly luxurious ice-cream you will ever taste.It is a spectacle at which, not just children, but even the most cynical adults cannot help but marvel. “Today, it’s all about doing what Amazon can’t and giving customers an experience,” says the owner, Carly Karran, who is hunting for a second site in Bristol. “We’re already nostalgic about ice-cream, it brings people joy, but throw in the liquid nitrogen vapour and it’s a double-whammy, a very Instagrammable one. It ticks all the boxes.”With its freshly blowtorched marshmallows, homemade honeycomb and use of all-natural ingredients (to ensure clear, intense flavours), Science Cream is a high-end parlour. Two scoops of its sea salt and burned caramel or black charcoal coconut ice-cream will cost you up to £5. But this hip store is also an example of a wider surge in the popularity of ice-cream parlours and dessert bars. A surge that, powered by fast-expanding national chains such as Kaspa’s and Creams, is bucking high street trends.If you are over 25, you may well never have heard of Creams, but this urban dessert bar chain (which serves hot pudding and waffles too, making it a go-to even in winter), has opened 70 sites in the past seven years and is aiming for 300 by 2022. A franchise operation, it is big enough that, until recently, it had former Nando’s regional director Handley Amos as its CEO, yet is relatively circumspect in its marketing. Aside from select associations with, for instance, Thorpe Park amusement park, it has grown (140,000 Facebook and 15,000 Instagram followers), largely via social media chatter.Last year, Creams made a subtle cameo (it’s “where you see a lot of dates take place,” explained Vice music site, Noisey), in the video for Big Shaq’s viral grime spoof, Man’s Not Hot. Evidence, says Creams co-founder Adam Mani, of its “cult following” among young people, particularly in London.From mainstream Creams to Ginger’s Comfort Emporium, a “grown-up” parlour in Manchester’s alternative Affleck’s Palace, social media is now a key driver in people’s ice-cream habits. Forget three-course meals, people want experiential moments in food. They want to eat colourful, out-there dishes that look great shared online. Ice-cream parlours, says PwC consumer expert Lisa Hooker, are perfect for “experience-seeking millennials” who crave innovative, affordable treats: “They have lots of products. It’s fun. There’s a lot going on.”“We’re plugged into that,” says Ginger’s owner, Claire Kelsey, whose £3.30-a-scoop flavours run from her legendary Chorlton Crack (salted caramel and peanut butter), to apple, mint and wheatgrass. Kelsey also makes several vegan ice-creams using oat milk and coconut oil. “We get loads of people coming in showing us their phones and saying, ‘Can I have that?’ We put weird flavours on our ice-cream van, and that’s what people want after seeing it on Twitter. There’s a lot of adventurous palates.”At the level of Science Cream and Ginger, margins are tight. They are producing small volumes and using expensive ingredients that need labour-intensive preparation and cooking. But mainstream dessert bars can be very lean, nimble businesses. At Creams, all its gelato (a lower-fat Italian version of ice-cream, made with more milk and less cream) is manufactured at a central production facility. Its cakes are bought-in. No chefs are needed. There’s no big kitchen investment. Throw in its counter-ordering and the fast turnover of customers and, even though the average spend at Creams is only £8 (two scoops of ice-cream for £3.95 most of its sundaes are £6–£8), it is a potentially lucrative business.“These dessert bar formats are absolutely outpacing the growth of normal restaurants,” says Joe Lutrario, deputy editor at Restaurant magazine. “Waffles, coffee, cake, ice-cream, it’s all serious money-making stuff and you only need a few staff to serve it. It’s a different, more profitable model and you can have an experience there for six quid, which is dramatically cheaper than somewhere like Nando’s.”Sat in Creams’ Stockport branch – a contemporary diner decorated with street art-bedecked skateboards, music pumping away in the background – it is easy to understand its appeal. It feels just cool enough to impress pickier teens without alienating anyone, including their parents. The unusually cheery staff make it welcoming, and my five-year-old is entranced by the gelato display.That product itself is Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s quality (a compliment!), and if a sample crepe feels a little sad and flabby, a cookie-dough crush sundae, topped with Mr Whippy-style ice-cream, caramel sauce and cookie dough crumb, is wolfed down. The kid’s blue bubblegum ice-cream is vile, obviously, but it does mimic that “screwball” flavour with eerie accuracy. None of this is cheap. Three of us are in and out in half-an-hour, £20 lighter. But the young couples in the neighbouring booths are in no hurry. You could stretch a tenner out here over an hour or so, which people seem to be doing more and more. For the ice-cream parlour’s rise is not solely a story about changing trends in ice-cream consumption (we are eating less ice-cream, but opting for better-quality options when we do indulge), but also a cultural shift in how we socialise.Founded in 2004 in Walthamstow, east London, Afters Original was one of the capital’s first dessert bar chains. It now has 10 sites. It opened, in no small part, to give young Muslims and families somewhere to hang out, locally. Its venues (garishly pink, US-inspired diners decorated with giant jukeboxes and even the occasional Chevrolet) are all alcohol-free, as is Creams, and open until late (1am in some cases), serving a global menu ranging from Mississippi mud pie to malai kulfi. “The Muslim community or people who don’t drink had limited places to go socially, and it can get boring going to the cinema every week,” says the owner, Kais Niaz. “This was kind of a replacement. Also, a lot of the old, traditional east London ice-cream parlours had closed. We created this buzz about dessert.”That buzz has now gained a national traction. Creams’ Adam Mani argues that a broad swathe of millennials, many non-drinkers or infrequent drinkers, are looking beyond the pub or coffee shop (“that’s an older generation”) for places to meet: “Youngsters don’t necessarily want to be in environments with alcohol, and families feel safer sending their kids to a place where they can have an ice-cream. We try to accommodate every ethnicity, dietary restriction and taste. I think that’s worked well in the sense that people’s social and cultural sensitivities are unconsciously accommodated.”Anecdotally, women are using dessert bars a lot, too both dry ones and those that serve booze. “It’s very female-led,” says Anthony Quinn, owner of Nottingham’s The Pudding Pantry. “Often, you look around and there’s not a single male. It’s an alternative to a bar. Come here and have a prosecco and some puddings.”All this sounds like a future-proofed demographic – young, multi-ethnic, female – that big corporations such as Unilever, owner of Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s and Carte D’or, must be desperate to connect with. But Unilever shows little sign of entering this high-street parlour game. Its Ben \u0026amp Jerry “scoop shops” are almost entirely in cinemas. Such “dinosaurs” are poor, argues Mani, at adapting to youth trends: “London is a phenomenal melting pot of ideas and cultures and a lot of bureaucratic institutions don’t tap into that knowledge.”Could concerns about obesity and the growth of healthier diets be an existential threat to this boom? “I don’t feel threatened,” says Kelsey. “There’s so much noise around those issues, but most sensible people know you can’t live on ice-cream.”Niaz, whose Afters venues literally have their cake and eat it by also serving sorbets and healthier smoothies with names such as “flu-fighter”, sounds equally unconcerned: “It’s been designed as a treat, not an everyday meal. It’s not cheap-cheap. It’s a luxury.”In a global context, it is a luxury that still offers plenty to explore. A new development in London’s Chinatown, Central Cross, is home to several east-Asian dessert bar brands, such Guo C 100 and Roro, that serve durian milk puddings and Cantonese mango pancakes rarely seen in the UK. Someone from Creams, which already sells Hong Kong-style “bubble-pop” waffle cones, is probably there, right now, eating hard in the name of research. The future? It looks very sweet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b76e40f3e61a88ac6c8c564396be354f9f4ce11/0_185_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9459291d8e72749a48312aed5f539c26","title":"travellers community against settling local common","story":"In this series Poppy Noor discusses an issue concerning how we can build happy, well-run communities. But what do you think? Send us your thoughts and responsesOccasionally Travellers settle on a small common near where I live. There is a playground on the common, but the caravans that were previously here weren’t near it, and didn’t take up much space. I have never noticed any problems when Travellers settle here, but the rest of my community are vehemently against it. They insist that stealing and litter-dropping rise when Travellers arrive. They have signed petitions and asked the council to prevent them from settling. This anti-Traveller sentiment seems to unite all parts of the community. Recently I noticed that large rocks and raised plant beds had been placed around the common, which someone informed me was a council initiative to stop Travellers driving on to the land. How do I know if this is true? Why is it that being anti-Traveller is still acceptable and why is the council supporting the community in this regard? Surely, the Travellers are legally allowed to settle on this land as it is held in common.Additionally, Nuttall says, it’s common for local authorities to limit opportunities for Travellers to stop over, even when it is their right to do so: “Local authorities spend hundreds of thousands every year creating ditches and earth mounds, and putting up metal barriers and gates, that prevent Travellers from settling when it may actually be cheaper to house them.” Such restrictions not only stop the council earning money through rents and council tax from the Traveller community, they also create health, education and housing inequalities.So there could be a battle ahead. I have looked into the detail of the common that you mention. It came under local authority ownership a long time ago, meaning your local council is responsible for it. You should scour your council website to see whether any development plans for the common have been included in recent planning or policy papers, giving the reason why. It’s unlikely you will find an outright mention of wanting to disturb a specific community, but you can check whether the council has considered the needs of Travellers through an equality and impact assessment, and write in to raise your concerns if not. But be wary of trying to be a saviour: your intentions may be good, but without consultation with the Traveller community, you could end up accidentally causing more harm. You can take Gypsy and Traveller cultural awareness training online.I have also found a user group that maintains the common. The members have planted trees, hedges and bulbs, so may have been involved in installing the rocks and plants. You should join this group. You won’t know whether they were involved in the decision – and whether their aims were sinister or careless – until you do. Their mission statement is to protect and enhance the common and to improve its use and enjoyment by locals. They may benefit from hearing from you if they truly want to achieve this goal. You may be the only person in the group thinking about the impact of recent changes or you may provide useful scrutiny and accountability if their aims are more sinister.You are in a difficult position. If prejudice is the driving force at play here, you may find yourself confronted with resistance and denial. But it sounds like you have the compassion and sensitivity to take on the task.

Both companies are already under investigation by the Electoral Commission over their activities surrounding the EU referendum. They are controlled by Banks. The £12m is in addition to the £9m he has already been reported to have provided to the Brexit campaign.When asked what the administrative services entailed, Liz Bilney, the chief executive of Leave.EU and a director at both companies, said they related to “campaign management services, ie everything that was spent and recharged in running and setting up the leave campaign to the month and year to May 2016.”The timeline suggests Leave.EU received the sum in a comparatively short period of time. The group was incorporated in September 2015, five months before David Cameron formally announced the referendum. The regulated period, in which Leave.EU’s spending cap of £700,000 took effect, began on 15 April 2016.“It includes costs prior to the regulated period, which were assessed as to whether any element should be included in the regulated period,” she said.It remains unclear what the £12m of campaign management services entailed, and when Better for the Country began providing them. Bilney refused to elaborate on what the “campaign management services” were, and insisted the phrase was self-explanatory. “Every single invoice was analysed to ensure that it did not correspond or have any overlap into the regulated period,” she said. “So if the Electoral Commission have any issue with that, they will be looking at it, and we don’t need you to be looking at it.”When asked how a company of 33 employees had generated £12m of expenses, Banks said: “The campaign sent 11m letters, millions of leaflets, Facebook advertising, rallies around the country, and so on.”The Electoral Commission declined to comment and directed the  to its two continuing investigations.Darren Hughes, the chief executive of the Electoral Reform Society, said it would be for the commission to determine the facts of any inidual case, but called for the government to update electoral finance laws.“Spending limits are there for a reason: to prevent campaigns being held to ransom by big donors, and to prevent an arms race between opposing factions,” he said. “Politics must not be won on the basis of who can spend the most but on a level playing field of clear, reasoned arguments.“Whatever the facts of this case, it is time for a review of election spending rules – they must be made crystal clear.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba55381a9adef8dfb531ba85be4da5519c459078/170_0_1707_1024/master/1707.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aa00393aa217f8c686b947f6a78574dc","title":"corbyn 20 comes out swinging and floors may with plain english","story":"At PMQ’s, the Labour leader has a revolutionary plan: ask the questions the country wants answered At some point in the last week the Labour leader has undergone a major reboot. At recent prime minister’s questions Jeremy Corbyn’s main achievement has been to make Theresa May appear less hopeless than she really is by failing to speak in joined-up sentences or asking questions even he couldn’t understand. All the prime minister had to do to survive unscathed was stand up and answer the question she would like to have been asked. Something that even she could just about manage.Corbyn 2.0 had a revolutionary plan. Talk in plain English. Keep things short and sweet. Stick to one subject. Don’t attempt the impossible of thinking on his feet. And ask the questions that everyone in the country wanted answered. He began by highlighting the government’s isions on Brexit. Did she agree with her foreign secretary that her favoured “customs partnership” arrangement was crazy?The prime minister couldn’t cope. May has been through several iterations of her own – no one is entirely sure if we are currently at Maybot 5.0 or Maybot 6.0 – but she has yet to find a system that is passably functional. Rather it seems that each upgrade only serves to further weaken her. Even though Boris Johnson’s contributions to cabinet collective responsibility had been front page news for a couple of days, she was totally taken aback by the question.“We are leaving the European Union and we are leaving the customs union,” she said, playing for time as so often before by offering nothing that advanced the public understanding of anything. It’s becoming clearer by the day why the government has made so little progress in its Brexit negotiations. It’s not just that no one can agree on what it is they want, but that every new development seems to take the cabinet completely by surprise. Michel Barnier must have more enlightening conversations with his grandchildren.Corbyn relaxed into his script. No deviation, no repetition, no hesitation. The Labour backbenchers couldn’t believe what they were hearing. The best response they can normally muster for their leader is a passive-aggressive silence, but now some were actively encouraging him. Their man was successfully embarrassing the prime minister by simply stating the obvious. The government was committed to working on two solutions to the customs union that both the government and EU agreed were unworkable and unacceptable. You’d be pushed to come up with a better definition of clueless.“We are leaving the customs union,” the Maybot said again as her computer crashed and she burned. By the time the exchanges between the two leaders came to an end, she was just a mess of wires and smoking silicon chips with a disembodied voice, both shrill and brittle, begging someone to unplug her. On days like this, it is hard to see how she can remain in the job. Or how she could even want to. It feels as if it’s only the pressure coming at her from all sides that is stopping her falling apart.With John Bercow away at Michael Martin’s funeral, it was deputy speaker Lindsay Hoyle who was left to preside over the proceedings. Taking his cue from Corbyn’s one-line questions, Hoyle moved things along at a nice clip, putting a stop to the braying with a simple hand gesture and keeping the odd outburst of Tory sycophancy to a minimum. PMQs was all wrapped up in under 40 minutes and the MPs roared their approval. Then, they would have done so if he’d let it run for over an hour. Not being John Bercow is more than enough to raise the roof in some quarters.Boris Johnson had managed to prove his loyalty to May by refraining from heckling her – being so jet-lagged he could hardly keep his eyes open must have helped – but once she had left the chamber it was his turn at the dispatch box to explain how his one-man mission to nominate Donald Trump for the Nobel peace prize had ended with the US president canning the Iran nuclear deal. It wasn’t his finest hour, but even he seemed surprised that so many of his own MPs, including former defence secretary Michael Fallon, were so quick to hail Trump’s genius. With just a hint of Boris being in charge, the lunatics really are taking over the asylum."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ed4f61c099f2a78dd464d988e019864ea5a48ba/0_73_840_504/master/840.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f3edbabe02840d405089394db2bbeda6","title":"how bereaved parents became accidental world leaders in 3d printing","story":"Naveed and Samiya Parvez watched their son, who had cerebral palsy, suffer distressing measuring methods to get the splints and braces he needed. Now, they’ve revolutionised the processNaveed and Samiya Parvez built a business so that other families wouldn’t have to suffer what they did. The couple set up healthcare service Andiamo following the death of their nine-year-old son, Diamo. Diamo had cerebral palsy and relied on braces and splints, known as orthoses, to support and protect his body. The process of getting fitted for orthoses caused Diamo and his family so much distress that Naveed and Samiya became determined to find an alternative.The procedure for being measured for orthoses was a harrowing experience for Diamo. Naveed had to restrain him to keep him still while cold plaster was wrapped around him – a process that takes an hour. “He went blue in the face screaming when they did this to him. You’re pinning a child down who is non-communicative,” he says. “You’d be horrified doing that to an adult – doing that to a kid who has no idea what is happening to them is even worse.” It would then take three to six months for the orthoses to be created on the NHS, by which point Diamo would have grown, so the fit was rarely a good one. The family also tried private healthcare services, which could create the orthoses within six weeks, but used the same plaster cast process and so were just as unreliable in terms of fit. Private treatment was also prohibitively expensive, with one brace, which would be outgrown within nine months, costing around £5,000. He and Samiya consulted experts and researched 3D printing, scanning and materials science, and 12 months later created the first prototypes for orthoses. Their London-based business uses 3D scanning and printing to measure and produce orthoses for children and young adults who are unable to use their limbs, or can’t control their posture. “3D printing experts started coming to us and saying ‘We’ve never seen what you’ve done before,’” says Naveed. “We had Google ringing us up for advice. That’s when we realised that this tiny little team with this crazy idea had suddenly become a world leader by accident.”The measurement process involves moving a handheld 3D scanner over the body for about a minute. The scan is much more accurate than a plaster cast – and the whole process is even fun, according to Naveed: “Kids love it. Either they want to watch what’s going on, because it’s cool and interesting, or they’re watching a cartoon on their tablet while we quickly scan them, and they’re just completely oblivious.” The 3D-printed orthosis is lighter and less cumbersome than a traditional brace, is ready within a week, and costs approximately £1,500.Since Andiamo launched, other companies offering 3D-printed orthoses have emerged, such as Plus Medica, but Naveed says Andiamo is the only service of its type focused on paediatrics. “We designed the whole process around the family’s experience,” says Naveed.Naveed and Samiya, who currently have 30 patients and have delivered 160 orthoses to date, now plan to expand. “Our goal is to see at least another 100 new patients in the next 18 months,” says Naveed. Orthoses have broad applications across the medical world, such as in healing complex fractures, so Andiamo’s potential is huge. Naveed and Samiya hope to treat 15 million children over the next 10 years.“We couldn’t really think of a better way of remembering Diamo than being able to create a legacy that means that no other child or family has to go through what we did,” says Naveed. “That bloody-mindedness just pushed us through.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6555b5ec10d71895ce8ab3bf5110caf27e4820e/0_40_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8fab0391de9270c1b50f93f463ee4f3c","title":"how oregon grew too much marijuana to sell","story":"Oregon farmers have grown three times what their customers can smoke in a year, causing bud prices to plummet and panic to set inA recent Sunday afternoon at the Bridge City Collective cannabis shop in north Portland saw a steady flow of customers.Little wonder: a gram of weed was selling for less than the price of a glass of wine.The $4 and $5 grams enticed Scotty Saunders, a 24-year-old sporting a gray hoodie, to spend $88 picking out new products to try with a friend. “We’ve definitely seen a huge drop in prices,” he says.Across the wood and glass counter, Bridge City owner David Alport was less delighted. He says he’s never sold marijuana this cheap before.“We have standard grams on the shelf at $4,” Alport says. “Before, we didn’t see a gram below $8.”The scene at Bridge City Collective is playing out across the city and state. Three years into Oregon’s era of recreational cannabis, the state is inundated with legal weed.It turns out Oregonians are good at growing cannabis – too good.In February, state officials announced that 1.1m pounds of cannabis flower were logged in the state’s database.If a million pounds sounds like a lot of pot, that’s because it is: last year, Oregonians smoked, vaped or otherwise consumed just under 340,000lb of legal bud.That means Oregon farmers have grown three times what their clientele can smoke in a year.Yet state documents show the number of Oregon weed farmers is poised to double this summer – without much regard to whether there’s demand to fill.The result? Prices are dropping to unprecedented lows in auction houses and on dispensary counters across the state.Wholesale sun-grown weed fell from $1,500 a pound last summer to as low as $700 by mid-October. On store shelves, that means the price of sun-grown flower has been sliced in half to those four-buck grams.For Oregon customers, this is a bonanza. A gram of the beloved Girl Scout Cookies strain now sells for little more than two boxes of actual Girl Scout cookies.But it has left growers and sellers with a high-cost product that’s a financial loser. And a new feeling has descended on the once-confident Oregon cannabis industry: panic.“The business has been up and down and up and down,” says Don Morse, who closed his Human Collective II dispensary in south-west Portland four months ago. “But in a lot of ways it has just been down and down for dispensaries.”This month, WW spoke to two dozen people across Oregon’s cannabis industry. They describe a bleak scene: small businesses laying off employees and shrinking operations. Farms shuttering. People losing their life’s savings are unable to declare bankruptcy because marijuana is still a federally scheduled narcotic.To be sure, every new market creates winners and losers. But the glut of legal weed places Oregon’s young industry in a precarious position, and could swiftly reshape it.Oregon’s wineries, breweries and distilleries have experienced some of the same kind of shakeout over time. But the timetable is faster with pot: for many businesses, it’s boom to bust within months.Mom-and-pop farms are accepting lowball offers to sell to out-of-state investors, and what was once a erse – and local – market is increasingly owned by a few big players. And frantic growers face an even greater temptation to illegally leak excess grass across state lines – and into the crosshairs of US attorney general Jeff Sessions’ justice department.“If somebody has got thousands of pounds that they can’t sell, they are desperate,” says Myron Chadowitz, who owns the Eugene farm Cannassentials. “Desperate people do desperate things.”In March, Robin Cordell posted a distress signal on Instagram.“The prices are so low,” she wrote, “and without hustling all day, hoping to find the odd shop with an empty jar, it doesn’t seem to move at any price.”Cordell has a rare level of visibility for a cannabis grower. Her Oregon City farm, Oregon Girl Gardens, received glowing profiles from Dope Magazine and Oregon Leaf. She has 12 years of experience in the medical marijuana system, a plot of family land in Clackamas county, and branding as one of the state’s leaders in organic and women-led cannabis horticulture.She fears she’ll be out of business by the end of the year.“The prices just never went back up,” she says.Cordell ran headlong into Oregon’s catastrophically bountiful cannabis crop.The Oregon Liquor Control Commission (OLCC) handed out dozens of licenses to new farmers who planted their first crop last spring. Mild weather blessed the summer of 2017 and stretched generously into the fall. And growers going into their second summer season planted extra seeds to make up for flower lost to a 2016 storm, the last vestige of a brutal typhoon blown across the Pacific from Asia.“That storm naturally constrained the supply even though there were a lot of cultivators,” says Beau Whitney, senior economist for New Frontier Data, which studies the cannabis industry.It kept supply low and prices high in 2017 – even though the state was handing out licenses at an alarming rate.“It was a hot new market,” Whitney says. “There weren’t a whole lot of barriers to entry. The OLCC basically issued a license to anyone who qualified.”Chadowitz blames out-of-state money for flooding the Oregon system. In 2016, state lawmakers decided to lift a restriction that barred out-of-state investors from owning controlling shares of local farms and dispensaries.It was a controversial choice – one that many longtime growers still resent.“The root of the entire thing was allowance of outside money into Oregon,” Chadowitz says. “Anyone could get the money they needed. Unlimited money and unlimited licenses, you’re going to get unlimited flower and crash the market.”As of 1 April, Oregon had licensed 963 recreational cannabis grows, while another 910 awaited OLCC approval.That means oversupply is only going to increase as more farms start harvesting bud.The OLCC has said repeatedly that it has no authority to limit the number of licenses it grants to growers, wholesalers and dispensaries (although by contrast, the number of liquor stores in Oregon is strictly limited).Since voters legalized recreational marijuana in 2014, many industry veterans from the medical marijuana years have chafed at the entrance of new money, warning it would destroy a carefully crafted farm ecosystem.The OLCC remains committed to facilitating a free market for recreational marijuana in which anyone can try their hand at growing or selling.The demand for weed in Oregon is robust – the state reeled in $68m in cannabis sales taxes last year – but it can’t keep pace with supply.Whitney says it’s not unusual for a new industry to attract speculators and people without much business savvy.“Whenever you have these emerging markets, there’s going to be a lot of people entering the market looking for profit,” he says. “Once it becomes saturated, it becomes more competitive. This is not a phenomenon that is unique to cannabis. There used to be a lot of computer companies, but there’s not so many anymore.”Across rolling hills of Oregon farmland and in Portland dispensaries as sleek as designer eyewear shops, the story plays out the same: Business owners can’t make the low prices pencil out.Nick Duyck is a second-generation farmer and owner of 3D Blueberry Farms in Washington county. “I was born and raised on blueberries,” he says.But last June, Duyck launched Private Reserve Cannabis, a weed grow designed to create permanent jobs for seasonal workers.“By starting up the cannabis business,” says Duyck, “it keeps my guys busy on a year-round basis.”He invested $250,000 in the structural build-outs, lighting, environmental controls and other initial costs to achieve a 5,000 sq ft, Tier I, OLCC-approved indoor canopy.Ongoing labor and operational costs added another $20,000 a month.Weed prices were high: Duyck forecast a $1,500 return per pound. If Duyck could produce 20lb of flower a week, he’d make back his money and start banking profits in just three months.October’s bumper crop tore those plans apart.“We got in at the wrong time,” Duyck says. “The outdoor harvest flooded the market.”By the start of the new year, Duyck was sitting on 100lb of ready-to-sell flower – an inventory trickling out to dispensaries in single-pound increments.So he turned to a wholesaler, Cannabis Auctions LLC, which holds monthly fire sales in various undisclosed locations throughout Oregon.Weed auctions operate under a traditional model: sellers submit their wares, and buyers – dispensary owners, intake managers and extract manufacturers – are given an opportunity to inspect products before bidding on parcels awarded to the highest dollar.Duyck sent 60lb of pot to the auction block in December. He had adjusted his expectations downward: he hoped to see something in the ballpark of $400 a pound.It sold for $100 a pound.“The price per pound that it costs us to raise this product is significantly higher than the hundred dollars a pound,” says Duyck. (A little light math points to a $250-per-unit production cost.) “Currently, we’re operating at a $15,000-per-month loss,” Duyck says.If prices don’t improve soon, Duyck says he won’t be able to justify renewing his OLCC license for another year.“The dispensaries that are out there, a lot of them have their own farms, so they don’t buy a lot of product from small farms like us’” Duyck says. “If you really want to grow the product, you almost have to own the store also.”Middlemen – store owners without farms – are also suffering. Take Don Morse, who gave up selling weed on New Year’s Eve.Morse ran Human Collective II, one of the earliest recreational shops in the city, which first opened as a medical marijuana supplier in 2010. At times, Morse stocked 100 strains in his Multnomah Village location.Morse lobbied for legal recreational weed and founded the Oregon Cannabis Business Council.The shift to recreational was costly. With his business partner Sarah Bennett, Morse says he invested more than $100,000 in equipment to meet state regulations.By last summer, new stores were popping up at a rapid pace. Morse’s company wasn’t vertically integrated, which means it did not grow any of its own pot or run a wholesaler that might have subsidized low sales.“Competition around us was fierce, and the company started losing money, and it wasn’t worth it anymore,” Morse says. “At our peak, we had 20 employees. When we closed, we had six.”Morse couldn’t see a way to make the numbers work. Human Collective priced grams as low as $6 to compete with large chains like Nectar and Chalice, but it struggled to turn a profit.“When you’re the little guy buying the product from wholesalers, you can’t afford to compete,” he says. “There’s only so far you can lower the price. There’s too much of everything and too many people in the industry.”So Morse closed his shop: “We paid our creditors and that was that. That was the end of it.”Despite losing his business, Morse stands behind Oregon’s light touch when it comes to regulating the industry.“It’s just commercialism at its finest,” he says. “Let the best survive. That’s just the way it goes in capitalism. That’s just the way it goes.”Just as mom-and-pop grocery stores gave way to big chains, people like Morse are losing out to bigger operations.Chalice Farms has five stores in the Portland area and is opening a sixth in Happy Valley. La Mota has 15 dispensaries. Nectar has 11 storefronts in Oregon, with four more slated to open soon.Despite the record-low prices in the cannabis industry, these chains are hiring and opening new locations, sometimes after buying failed mom-and-pop shops.The home page on Nectar’s website prominently declares: “Now buying dispensaries! Please contact us if you are a dispensary owner interested in selling your business.”Nectar representatives did not respond to a request for comment.Because the federal government does not recognize legal marijuana, the industry cannot access traditional banking systems or even federal courts. That means business owners can’t declare bankruptcy to dissolve a failed dispensary or farm, leaving them with few options. They can try to liquidate their assets, destroy the product they have on hand and eat the losses.Or they can sell the business to a company like Nectar, often for a fraction of what they’ve invested.Deep-pocketed companies can survive the crash and wait for the market to contract again.Oregon faces another consequence of pot businesses closing up shop: leftover weed could end up on the black market.Already, Oregon has a thriving illegal market shipping to other states.US attorney for Oregon, Billy Williams, has said he has little interest in cracking down on legal marijuana businesses, but will prosecute those shipping marijuana to other states.“That kind of thing is what’s going to shut down our industry,” Chadowitz says. “Anything we can do to prevent Jeff Sessions from being right, we have to do.”Ask someone in the cannabis industry what to do about Oregon’s weed surplus, and you’re likely to get one of three answers.The first is to cap the number of licenses awarded by the OLCC. The second is to reduce the canopy size allotted to each license – Massachusetts is trying that. And the last, equally common answer is to simply do nothing. Let the market sort itself out.Farmers, such as Walker of East Fork Cultivars, argue that limiting the number of licensed farms in Oregon would stunt the state’s ability to compete on the national stage in the years ahead.“We’re in this sort of painful moment right now,” says Walker, “but I think if we let it be a painful moment, and not try to cover it up, we’re going to be better off for it.”Walker and other growers hope selling across state lines will someday become legal.Every farmer, wholesaler, dispensary owner and economist WW talked to for this story said that if interstate weed sales became legal, Oregon’s oversupply problem would go away.Under the current presidential administration, that might seem a long shot. But legalization is sweeping the country, Donald Trump is signaling a looser approach, and experts say Oregon will benefit when the feds stop fighting.“The thing about Oregon is that it is known for its cannabis, in a similar way to Oregon pinot noir,” Whitney says. “For those who are able to survive, they are positioned extremely well not only to survive in the Oregon market but also to take advantage of a larger market – assuming things open up on a federal level.”Looking for more great work from the Portland, Oregon, alt-weekly paper and website Willamette Week?

With this paper comes an admission from the governing body’s chief executive, Tom Harrison, that the sport has previously fallen short.“Cricket is a force for good in society and our job is to ensure that it makes a positive impact on as many people’s lives as possible,” said Harrison. “While we’ve long acknowledged the passion for the game in south Asian communities and had the best intentions, we have never fully understood how to engage with them. This report gives us a road map to change that.”The rule was named after the former Pittsburgh Steelers chairman Dan Rooney, who was behind the introduction of a similar policy for the NFL in 2003. It will ensure at least one BAME candidate who meets the application criteria for any ECB coaching job will be interviewed and follows a similar move by the Football Association in January. In addition, 10 south Asian coaches will be given mentoring and work placements in the next two years.Moeen Ali, who in 2016 was part of an England Test team that for the first time included four British Asians, along with Haseeb Hameed, Zafar Ansari and Adil Rashid, said: “Growing up in inner‑city Birmingham, I fully understand some of the challenges and barriers for young south Asian cricketers. I see many of those challenges now when I help my dad coach at his cricket academy. Many parents are still struggling to afford kit for their kids and the new bursaries will give emerging players the opportunity to continue to improve and develop in the game.”Another target in the “core cities” will be to establish female-only cricket sessions for the south Asian community, with 200 female coaches deployed, after the ECB’s research showed a lack of such opportunities to be another concern. Soft-ball women’s leagues will also be established in these areas.The ECB is also seeking to address why the recreational numbers are not reflected in first-class professional squads. The governing body will increase mentoring, offer assistance with education outside of cricket and deliver a programme of unconscious bias training for academy directors to tackle drop-offs from the youth intake.The match experience is to be tailored in a way that opens up the sport to all, with halal and vegetarian food options, flexible family ticket offers and multi-faith prayer facilities at all major venues. Both the 2019 World Cup and the ECB’s new 100-ball tournament, which starts in 2020, will also be heavily marketed towards the south Asian community.Lord Patel said: “As a British Asian who grew up playing cricket in the streets and on the pitches of Bradford in the 1960s, I have first-hand experience of the enormous benefits of our sport. Cricket gave me the confidence, connections and opportunities to meet new people outside my community, as well as develop life-long friendships.“The passion south Asian communities in the UK have for cricket remains high but, over 50 years later, there is still so much untapped potential. This plan will help to change that – starting today.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd319bd00dd469114d4089006ca1ba00c333b08a/0_58_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4c4e70080464553e57e47fee3e6ce8d8","title":"kyle edmumd pulls off shock victory over novak djokovic madrid open tennis","story":"Britain’s Kyle Edmund secured one of the biggest victories of his career by defeating the former world No\u0026nbsp1 Novak Djokovic in the second round of the Madrid Open.Edmund had never won a set in his previous three matches against Djokovic but deservedly came out on top in a high-quality contest lasting an hour and 42 minutes.The 23-year-old Briton saved three break points in the deciding set to seal a 6-3, 2-6, 6-3 victory and set up a meeting with the eighth seed, David Goffin, in the last 16. Edmund made the ideal start with a break of serve in the opening game and, although Djokovic immediately hit back, Edmund broke twice more to take the first set.Djokovic looked to be getting back to somewhere near his best as he took the second set in style to set up a decider, but Edmund recovered from 0-40 down in the fifth game to remain in front and then claimed the decisive break before serving out for the match.“It was a great experience first of all to beat Novak, I’ve lost to him three times,” Edmund told Sky. “He’s a legend so your first match when you share the court is an\u0026nbspexperience but now, especially after reaching the semis of the Australian Open, it’s time to try and beat these guys and I was very pleased today how I managed my game, especially in the\u0026nbspthird set.The win is likely to take Edmund, who has risen to British No\u0026nbsp1 during the extended absence of Andy Murray, inside the world’s top\u0026nbsp20 for the first time next week. “It was a goal of mine to get inside the top 20, there’s no reason why I couldn’t,” he said. “You have to set targets and I thought that was a very realistic target, so I’m pleased it’s happened.

The e has remained, stubbornly, much the way it has since it opened in 1969. There’s neither a cover charge nor fancy cocktails and patrons can help themselves to barbecued chicken and other comfort food for free. In the corner, Samuel Hargress Jr, the 81-year-old owner who lives on the premises, was holding court in a fedora and tweed jacket.“I’m old-old-school. Things are real different now to when I came along,” he said. Since purchasing the bar for $35,000, Hargress has been a central figure in one of New York’s most historic – and rapidly changing – neighbourhoods. Though his establishment maintains a local following, these days it’s famous enough to attract international visitors. “You’ve got people from all over. Everybody here’s partying and dancing. They don’t know each other but it don’t matter.”Harlem’s history has long been marked by waves of new arrivals and change. Over the years, it has been home to everyone from George and Ira Gershwin to Duke Ellington. Before it became a haven for African-American intellectuals, poets and musicians during the Harlem Renaissance in the 1920s and 30s it was a stronghold of Jewish luminaries, many of whom were displaced by rapid development on the Lower East Side. After a period of decline in the 1970s and 80s, the neighbourhood is once again a hotbed of cultural activity.“It’s an evolving community. I’ve been here since 1980 and it didn’t just change overnight,” says John Reddick. A Harlem historian and preservationist, Reddick leads neighbourhood walking tours.“A lot of tourists have all this baggage and it takes a certain willingness to get beyond that. They think I’m just showing them the nicer side of Harlem, even though these buildings have been here for more than 100 years. I get this all the time: ‘Where in Harlem should you not go?’ There’s nowhere in Harlem I would not go.”Reddick urges visitors and newcomers to make a more meaningful connection with the existing community, whether by visiting a local church or enjoying the free art and live performances at Marcus Garvey park, St Nicholas park and Jackie Robinson recreation centre. Above all, he hopes that everyone who comes gains an appreciation for the neighbourhood’s near-mythic quality and what that has meant for different generations.“Look out of your window and it’s like this Fred Astaire-and-Ginger-Rogers view,” he says. “There’s this exhilaration of being in Harlem this sense that you’re part of this great metropolis. I feel it now, so you can imagine what it must have been like in the 1920s or 30s for somebody such as the poet Langston Hughes.”While there is much that Hughes would still recognise, it is impossible to ignore some of the changes. As with almost any neighbourhood in Manhattan, particularly one marked by handsome, turn-of-the-century brownstones and broad boulevards, Harlem’s property values have skyrocketed, causing residents to question what the future holds. A recent attempt by developers to rebrand the desirable area between 110th Street and 125th Street as SoHa resulted in a backlash by activists. Yet despite the Whole Foods on 125th Street and the queasy spectacle of a townhouse going for more than $4m, Harlem and its cultural institutions have managed to hold on to a distinct identity.“Harlem, throughout all the waves of gentrification and forced migration, has maintained a sense of itself,” says Nico Wheadon, director of public programmes and community engagement at the Studio Museum on 125th Street, which showcases work by African-American artists. “That’s because in its essence, it is an artistic, creative place. There is a history of struggle and protest to maintain that.” As with the National Black Theatre, another important Harlem institution, the Studio Museum turns 50 this year.Some of the efforts to maintain a sense of community have been quieter endeavours such as The Laundromat Project, which provides support for local artists and hosts programmes in laundromats and other public spaces. Another small startup is Hot Bread Kitchen, a non-profit project based in La Marqueta in East Harlem that provides female immigrants facing economic insecurity with a living wage, job training, and support.Meanwhile, the Studio Museum is in the process of redefining itself, moving beyond the walls and connecting with the broader public through art installations in parks and libraries, creative workshops talks, and even dance parties, such as its popular summer series, Uptown Fridays! Though the museum has shut its doors (there are plans to demolish the existing property and rebuild on the same site) it remains an active part of the community, including as its links with El Museo del Barrio, a Spanish Harlem art showcase.As with many Harlem residents, Wheadon finds the neighbourhood fulfils most of her social and entertainment needs. For an evening out, she heads to Vinatería, a stylish Mediterranean spot or 67 Orange Street for cocktails. She’s equally in love with the classics, from the amateur nights at the Apollo Theater to live music at Showman’s Jazz Club (375 West 125th Street), which she says feels “like the Harlem that I imagined before I moved here. It’s a time warp.”Change has, in part, been driven by Harlem’s thriving culinary scene. At its forefront is Marcus Samuelsson, the celebrity chef behind the Red Rooster restaurant, its subterranean sister venue, Ginny’s Supper Club and the Streetbird Rotisserie. Born in Ethiopia and raised in Sweden, Samuelsson spent eight years learning about the neighbourhood prior to opening Red Rooster, attending church events, eating at places such as Silvia’s – a soul-food staple opened in 1962 – and listening to residents.“When you think about the Studio Museum or the National Black Theatre, you’re thinking about this incredible depth of art, of music. We want this to be a destination for food as well,” Samuelsson says. “For me it was about working where you live and creating jobs to restore your community.”Samuelsson’s talk of community is more than lip-service. He works closely with the Careers through Culinary Arts Program, a programme that helps disadvantaged teens enter the restaurant industry and is an integral part of Harlem EatUp!, an annual food festival that highlights both established chefs and small-time food entrepreneurs. Samuelsson respects the older establishments, though he does not view the broader range of options as inherently negative.“You have ramen restaurants now, you have mixologist bars, you have craft coffee and I think that’s great. A community should be able to have both. You want it to be a place where people who live there don’t have to leave to go to a great place,” he says.Likewise, Wheadon feels optimistic that the neighbourhood will continue to hold onto that in the future.“Someone asked me the other day: ‘What is blackness to you?’ I said: ‘It’s celebration.’ I can’t walk to or from work without being swept up in somebody’s something,” she says. “There’s something beautiful about that and I think that Harlem will always have an element of that.”At Paris Blues the scene was certainly one of celebration. As the night wore on, musicians from nearby bars stopped by to jam with the band. Although Hargress is constantly approached with offers from developers, he has no intention of retiring or selling the joint.“I have fun with them. One guy offered me $6m,” he said, adding with unrestrained glee, “So I told him, you come up with $10m, then maybe you can call me back.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d923a1b967a417403fea3166a84a4b4adfdbeac/0_0_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a3baa62f4a694f58c753f9f72a9dfd80","title":"hawaiis kilauea volcano erupts in pictures","story":"The eruption of Kilauea volcano has sent lava flowing into residential areas on Hawaii’s Big Island, with residents ordered to abandon their homes.

If the pair fail to reach an agreement by Thursday, then the president will be forced to appoint a caretaker government.Di Maio – whose party emerged as the largest single party in the election – insisted that the only way the parties could work together would be if Salvini dropped Berlusconi, who Di Maio sees as the potent symbol of the corrupt politics his party has railed against.“Some important personalities within the party would be scared about the prospect of new elections. They have the impression that Forza Italia could be finished off,” said Massimiliano Panarari, a politics professor at the Guido Carli Free International University for Social Studies in Rome.“It’s also further evidence that the aggressive political effect and expansion power in public opinion of Berlusconi is finished.

He will be sworn in by the king on Thursday.A euphoric mood gripped Malaysia at the announcement, which many had believed impossible. “We are so happy, such a proud day for Malaysia,” said David Thaiga, 57, who joined others in the street to celebrate. “We have been waiting for this for the past 60 years. This is a miracle for us. And even though I was not a fan of Mahathir, I think he was the only one who could have brought this victory.”Sukumira Sekhar, 84, witnessed the beginning of Malaysian independence and lived through 60 years of rule by the Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition, said: “I’m so happy I survived to see this. I wish I could jump up and down for joy, but be sure my heart is jumping up and down. I’m so proud of the people of Malaysia, especially the young people and the Malays who swung it.”Mahathir’s win marks the end of the nine-year tenure of Najib, who came to power in 2009 and whose reputation was tarnished by the 1MDB corruption scandal in which $2.6bn was embezzled from a government fund he was overseeing – including $681m that was alleged to have ended up in his personal bank account.1Malaysia Development Berhad, was set up in 2009 to promote economic development. The Malaysian prime minister, Najib Razak, chaired its advisory board and, according to the US Justice Department, top executives and associates of Najib looted $4.5bn from the fund between 2009 and 2014, laundering it through the US, Singapore, Switzerland and other countries. Hundreds of millions landed in Najib\u0027s bank account, though he denies any wrongdoing.\u0026nbspThe US Justice Department is seeking to recover money from the fund it says was gambled in Las Vegas, used to buy hotels, apartments, a luxury yacht, a jet, diamond jewellery, art works and to finance Hollywood films including the Wolf of Wall Street and Dumb and Dumber To.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspUS prosecutors have alleged layers of foreign bank accounts and shell companies were used to launder the money and named Low Taek Jho, a friend of Najib’s stepson, as a key figure in the conspiracy. In one email he wrote Looks like we may have hit a goldmine after organising a 1MDB deal that would later allegedly become a money laundering vehicle.\u0026nbspSingapore has fined eight banks for failing to carry out proper anti-money laundering measures in relation to 1MDB and given prison sentences to several bankers.A parliamentary inquiry found many irregularities but had no mandate to prosecute so, outraged by the scandal, 92-year-old former leader Mahathir Mohammad came out of political retirement and opposition united behind him for the elections. The government recently passed a fake news law that could be used to further stifle reporting on the case within Malaysia.Mahathir’s victory marks the first time that a Malaysian prime minister will not be from the UMNO party and not be part of the BN coalition, of which UMNO is the main constituent.The win indicates that a mood for change has gripped the country, following the “Malay tsunami” in which many ethnic Malay voted for the opposition for the first time. The campaign also galvanised the youth vote for the first time, with young people taking to social media to add their support to the opposition.“This is a pure adrenaline rush. We have been waiting for this change for the longest time,” said Naveen Kumar, 31. “We have been infected with a BN government for so long and now it’s a total relief.”Dr Mahathir Mohamad was Malaysia\u0027s longest-serving prime minister, holding office from 1981 to 2003. He is credited with overseeing a period of economic growth but was also notoriously authoritarian, cracking down on the opposition, the judiciary and the press. Mahathir selected Abdullah Badawi as his successor, but toppled him in 2009 after poor election performance and installed another protege, Najib Razak, as prime minister.Having officially retired, Mahathir then denounced Najib in 2015, after the 1MDB scandal broke. In 2018, it was announced he had switched to the opposition party, and, at 92-years-old, would be running against as prime minister to bring down Najib. If he wins, he will be the oldest leader in the world.Shaliz Kumar, 28, said: “The young people had a big part to play in this. I called all my friends to make sure they had voted.”The official results, usually announced by 11pm, were not released until around 3am, and some alleged that Najib was trying to stall the announcement. Constituencies that were swinging towards the opposition also reported electricity blackouts, hindering the final count.In the end, however, Najib made no public statement after Mahathir had claimed victory in the early hours of Thursday morning.Mahathir’s selection as opposition leader had made this an unusual election: he was an UMNO member when he first came to power in 1981, and played a key role selecting his protege Najib as prime minister in 2009. The relationship soured in 2015 after Najib was implicated in the 1MDB scandal, and this year Mahathir announced he was not only forming his own political party, Bersatu, but switching sides and joining the opposition coalition.Najib had initially been expected to win easily, but, as campaigning picked up, the opposition dominated the narrative, raising issues such as corruption and the rising cost of living. After claiming victory on Thursday morning, Mahathir was asked whether he would seek to prosecute Najib for his alleged role in the 1MDB scandal. “We are not seeking revenge, we are seeking to restore the rule of law,” he said. As part of his agreement with Pakatan Harapan, Mahathir will only be prime minister for two years, and then will cede power to Anwar Ibrahim. Anwar, who was also once Mahathir’s protege, is currently in jail serving a second sentence for sodomy.Mahathir and Anwar fell out publicly in 1999 and Mahathir was responsible for jailing Anwar, but the pair put aside their differences in their united desire to take down Najib.The plan now is for Mahathir to have Anwar pardoned so he can take office. “He’ll be released in June,” said Mahathir. “Once he’s pardoned, he’s eligible to be PM again.” Mahathir also announced after his victory that he would appoint Wan Azizah, Anwar’s wife, as his deputy prime minister.The police have warned people against gathering in the streets to celebrate in case of rioting however, a large group gathered outside the Pakatan Harapan headquarters in Petaling Jaya to cheer and wave flags. For Dr Mohan Mahatheva, who was in the crowd, “tonight this is true freedom for Malaysia. We freed ourselves from colonialism, now we have freed ourselves from kleptocracy,” he said. “At least I know my children will live in a truly independent Malaysia.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3488974.1525855023!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"apartments planned for south dublin branded a monstrosity","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            An architect’s drawing of the proposed apartment complex beside the Golden Ball pub in Kilternan. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            Georgian-style apartments planned for Kilternan.Residents in south Dublin have objected to plans for a six-storey Georgian-style apartment scheme at the foot of the Dublin mountains in Kilternan on the grounds it would be “totally unsuitable” for the local rural area.Developer Greg Kavanagh’s Calerotech Ltd has sought planning permission from Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council for the complex of 97 apartments at the Golden Ball pub. If granted permission it would be the first apartment scheme in Kilternan.The design of the complex “seeks to delve into a portion of the nation’s richest historical architectural heritage” the application states, and is based on the Custom House and the “Georgian Squares of Dublin” according to the developers. It also represents a “back to basics” approach in terms of design, Calerotech said.Local resident Anne-Marie Leen described the scheme as a “monstrosity of a development” which is “totally unsuitable to the areas and is only at best suitable for a city centre location, and probably not suitable in Ireland at all”.The apartments would not be in keeping with the “countrysidevillage feel” of Kilternan, she said.Another local, Ciarán Moulton, said the scheme would “adversely effect the views to the Dublin mountains enjoyed by local residents”, would worsen local traffic, and affect visibility on the main road.The Balally Residents Association said the height and scale of the development was “more aligned to a city – not a rural suburb”. It would increase the already “massive traffic delays” and the pressure on the Luas Green line, it said.Several residents emphasised the low-rise nature of the area, which is dominated by bungalows and two-storey houses, and said the additional traffic would damage air quality and affect the health of existing residents.In relation to the scale, Calerotech said when Dublin’s Georgian squares were first planned they were considered “too urban” for their locations, and that 60 years ago “ Cabra, Crumlin, Ballymun etc” were mostly green fields.Local Fine Gael Cllr John Kennedy made a submission in favour of the scheme which he said appeared a more “family friendly” size than most apartment schemes in Dublin“The ornate design of the exterior is of a significantly higher standard than typical apartment scheme designs and would be reminiscent of well-regarded architecture seen in London and Paris,” he said.“I think it would be unlikely that a better designed scheme would ultimately materialise in future on these lands.”Mr Kavanagh, the self-described “Ronaldo of the property market” 18 months ago left New Generation Homes, the high profile development company he founded with Pat Crean. New Generation made headlines from 2011 onwards when it spent up to €300 million buying up development land at the bottom of the market.Submissions on the Kilternan plan can be made to Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council until Thursday."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Research Lives: Dr Junsi Wang, TCD PhD graduate and Takeda researcherIn the \u0026lsquoColumbian exchange\u0026rsquo, plants, livestock and diseases have as much impact as peopleCar makers and tech firms rely on cobalt mined in Katanga, the unstable province where Irish soldiers were attacked in 1961Simon Harris explores how to hold \u0026lsquobespoke\u0026rsquo inquiry to permit women to testify in publicNational Citizens\u0026rsquo Dialogue on the Future of Europe took place in Dublin on WednesdayIssue raised after reports that three ministers told Cabinet this week they wanted HSE boss to step down\u0026lsquoNo evidence\u0026rsquo to support doubters of cervical cancer preventer\u0026lsquoWe have each other\u0026rsquos mobile numbers,\u0026rsquo says Leo VaradkarOrganisation is working to deal with safeguarding failings, Oireachtas committee toldJanette Lakes alleges Fingal County Council failed to fix leaks in Blanchardstown houseMany of the country\u0026rsquos 31 city and county councils have different registration rulesVaradkar criticises \u0026lsquoextraordinarily inaccurate\u0026rsquo and \u0026lsquoquite grotesque\u0026rsquo poster imagesDubliner (37) has pleaded not guilty to murder of David Douglas on July 1st, 2016Taoiseach rejects renewed call by Mary Lou McDonald on HSE boss to stand downVictim feared for life during break-in as burglar wielded yard brush in his handsNorth Antrim MP Ian Paisley characterised the move as a \u0026lsquoLeveson for Northern Ireland\u0026rsquo"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3489546.1525891458!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"minister considers public hearings in cervicalcheck investigation","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Health Simon Harris: “We don’t want to go down a big tribunal route that will go on forever and ever.”  Photograph: Tom HonanMinister for Health Simon Harris is exploring how to hold public hearings during the investigation into false smear testing for the CervicalCheck national screening programme and its failure to tell the affected women.Mr Harris told the Oireachtas health committee that he had made initial inquiries with the Department of Justice about creating a “bespoke” commission of investigation, which are typically held in private, to allow people who want to testify in public.The Government has said that a commission of investigation will follow an initial seven-week scoping inquiry into the scandal that is being chaired by Dr Gabriel Scally, the Belfast-born public health veteran.“Can a commission hold any of its hearing in public? There seems to be a viewpoint that it possibly can at the discretion of the chair,” the Minister told TDs and Senators during his testimony to the committee.Mr Harris was questioned during the lengthy hearing on the Government’s plans to investigate false tests given to 209 women with cervical cancer and how at least 162 of them were not told they were inaccurate.The Government has ruled out a tribunal of inquiry, one of the most public ways of investigating the controversy, preferring instead to hold a commission of investigation that could report more quickly.There was a “legislative conflict” between a “very public” tribunal and a commission of investigation that is “generally not public but quicker”, said Mr Harris, and he was looking at a way of “aligning the two”.“We don’t want to go down a big tribunal route that will go on forever and ever with very sick women involved it is not appropriate,” said the Minister.The scandal came to light due to the refusal of terminally ill Limerick woman Vicky Phelan to sign a confidentiality clause as part of a €2.5 million High Court settlement with US-based Clinical Pathology Laboratories, which missed her cervical cancer during a 2011 smear test carried out by CervicalCheck.Ms Phelan was diagnosed with cancer three years later and a 2014 audit showing her original smear test to be inaccurate was withheld from her by CervicalCheck until September 2017.The 43-year-old mother of two told The  she refused to sign a gagging clause so as to allow other affected women to be told and she still “firmly believed” that the investigation had to be held in public.“I can’t see why they can’t push through legislation for a public type of commission of investigation because the outrage that is evident across the country would justify something to be done in public,” she said.Mr Harris said the Taoiseach has asked the Attorney General to work with the State Claims Agency, which defends litigation against the State, to see if there is a way to allow affected women to avoid a difficult trial and an “adversarial situation”, as Ms Phelan had endured last month, where the liability rests with the US labs.The Minister said the Government would await the findings of the Scally inquiry at the end of June before deciding on a redress scheme to compensate affected women to assess the liability for the State and the labs."},{"url":null,"title":"peston ireland has undermined britain for over 100 years","story":"  May 6, 2018TV presenter Robert Peston makes the claim during interview with Jacob Rees-Mogg   May 9, 2018TV presenter moves to clarify controversial remarks made on his Sunday programme "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3489628.1525897181!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"taoiseach defends lack of communication with theresa may","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar has defended his lack of contact with British prime minister Theresa May over the past six weeks. Photograph: ReutersYves Herman Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has defended his lack of contact with the British prime minister Theresa May for the past six weeks, despite the ongoing Brexit crisis and the suspended Belfast institutions.Mr Varadkar said that he and Ms May had each other’s mobile numbers and could contact each other whenever they needed to. “Currently the focus is on negotiations in Brussels and on the various cabinet meetings that are happening in the UK to determine what its position will be on the customs union, or a customs union partnership, and how that position might evolve,” he said.A meeting “is under consideration for next week” if they are both in Sofia, Bulgaria at the same time. But “the most useful conversation is the one which will be had once the British government has decided its position on the new customs arrangement”. Until then “it is very hard to make any particular progress at the moment”.Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin, who raised the issue in the Dáil, believed it was probably the only time in the past quarter of a century that leaders on both sides went so long without speaking, particularly during such a period of crisis.He expressed concern at the lack of communication, saying that the absence of the anti-Brexit majority in the North from any major discussions “causes damage every day”.And he said it was very surprising given the threat posed by an absent Northern Executive, and by the British government’s refusal to establish consultation processes with Dublin over the suspension, that the Taoiseach had had no contact with Ms May.Mr Martin, a former minister for foreign affairs, said the British-Irish intergovernmental conference should have been convened by now and the maximum use of the Belfast Agreement was imperative.“Otherwise, elements of the agreement can fall into abeyance and that ultimately brings the agreement itself into disrepute,” he warned.His call was echoed by Sinn Féin president Mary Lou McDonald who said that while it was “no silver bullet”, a forum was needed to provide a roadmap.Green party Eamon Ryan said the lack of contact for six weeks was “remarkable” and he called on the Taoiseach to engage with the smaller parties including his own colleagues in the North. “Relying on the big two” – the DUP and Sinn Féin – “is not clever at this time”, Mr Ryan said.The Taoiseach said there was a lot of contact at official and political levels. He told Mr Ryan he welcomed forces in the North other than unionist or nationalist but said they had to have regard to parties’ mandate when organising meetings.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3482811.1525861602!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"how nonhuman life forms can change the course of history","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIn Alfred Crosby’s ‘The Columbian Exchange: Biological and Cultural Consequences of 1492’, published in 1972, he argued for a different way of looking at the impact of the voyages of discovery on both the Americas and EuropeA few weeks ago, the historian Alfred Crosby died at the age of 87. He may not be well known to readers of science pages but he should be: he pioneered a way of using science to think differently about history. Historians usually consider “scientific history” to begin with the German empiricist Leopold von Ranke in the 19th century. Von Ranke advocated close interrogation of sources in order to develop a neutral history that was as close to the facts as possible. Crosby, however, suggested the use of scientific ideas to change the way historians look at the past. He advocated a view of the past that considered humans as part of an ecological system in which they were not the only actors who could change history.Crosby’s pioneering work was The Columbian Exchange: Biological and Cultural Consequences of 1492, published in 1972. In the book, Crosby argued for a different way of looking at the impact of the voyages of discovery on both the Americas and Europe. He suggested the migration of European diseases, livestock and crops was just as important as the migration of European people. Further, he considered the long-term impact of the flow of non-humans between the Old World and the New World. Among his suggestions was that the importation of the potato into Europe and sweet potato and cassava into Africa fuelled population expansions in both places, while smallpox decimated Native American populations. A later book, Ecological Imperialism, considered how winds and weeds contributed to colonialism alongside germs and livestock. Crosby struggled to find a publisher for The Columbian Exchange because his ideas were new and unusual. Now historians and textbooks commonly use the phrase when they discuss European colonisation.Crosby decentred history by thinking about humans as just one group of potential actors in an ecological system. Despite decades of growth in the discipline of environmental history, this view of the past is still more common among scientists than it is among historians. We do not often try to view history from the point of view of microbes or wheat or weeds.As climate change makes us appear more vulnerable to processes we have had a hand in starting but seem unable to stop, perhaps this is a good time to start thinking about history differently. Such a history could take many forms, but invasive species are one place to start and Ireland has plenty of these.The zebra mussel is a freshwater mollusc that is native to Russia and the Ukraine. Zebra mussels arrived in Ireland in the 1990s (perhaps much earlier) either with ballast water discharged into the River Shannon or perhaps with imported second-hand leisure craft that had not been cleaned. They reproduce rapidly and cause damage by clogging pipes, coating the surfaces of boats and gumming up engines. They have spread into multiple waterways in Britain, Ireland, southern Europe and North America. The zebra mussel has hitchhiked on our global trade systems and used us to dramatically expand its population and geographical range. In Britain, they were introduced in the early 19th century and spread through the canals developed to facilitate internal trade. Ireland’s canals, now used for leisure boats, continue to spread the mussel on this island.The innocuous little organisms, growing to only about 2cm or 3cm, have proceeded to wreak various kinds of havoc in their new environment. Their very efficient filtering systems have changed the lakes and rivers where they spread, killing off native mussels and possibly affecting eels in Lough Erne. They clogged pipes leading to a salmon fishery resulting in a loss of fish. They have coated piers and anchors and buoys and even parts of the Ardnacrusha power plant. They have also brought into being a variety of human responses to try to get them under control. There has been significant investment in scientific research, the development of a Zebra Mussel Control Group, and a campaign of flyers and signs to caution boat owners and others to prevent further spread. Chemicals have been developed and deployed to kill the mussels. If we view the history of inland waterways from the point of view of the zebra mussel, we get a picture of how a non-human organism can change the course of history that Crosby would have approved of.– Dr Juliana Adelman lectures in history at Dublin City University"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3482848.1525348468!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"why congo could stop the charge of electric vehicles","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe higher the cost of cobalt, the more you will pay for an electric car. Photograph: Thomas LohnesGetty ImagesThe Congo. September 1961. Irish soldiers in Jadotville are attacked by separatist Katangan forces led by Belgian mercenaries. Jadotville is a copper-mining town in Katanga, a province in south-east Congo that is rich in minerals. The events in Jadotville feature in a popular film on Netflix starring Jamie Doran as Irish commander Pat Quinlan. Mineral wealth drove the Katangan conflict. Katanga is back in the news. The copper mines again are involved. Car company execs are hearing “Katanga” and fretting about the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The reason: it mines most of the world’s cobalt – a sought-after ingredient for electric vehicles (EVs). Odds are you own Congo cobalt, since each smartphone batteries contains 10 to 20 grams. Electric cars are hungrier for it, packing between six and 15 kilos. Car makers depend on big DRC mines for the metal – not ideal given its predilection for corruption, political instability and war. About two-thirds of the global mine supplies of cobalt are concentrated in just one country, which is a worry anyway, says Jack Bedder, a market analyst at the consultancy Roskill. But the concern is greater when this country is as unstable as the DRC. Plus there are concerns around child miners and illegal mining for DRC cobalt.How did the world’s switch to electric vehicles get hitched to this risky country? It is partly a matter of geology. Cobalt is concentrated in the Congo, where it is a by-product of nickel and copper mines. There are few new cobalt mines elsewhere that can compete with the volume of those in the DRC, explains Bedder, so the country will remain at the centre of cobalt supply. Meanwhile, electric cars are gaining ground, with about one million EV sales predicted in China this year, as the country bets on them as an industrial strategy and for better air quality. Not all Li ion batteries need cobalt, but most do, which explains why cobalt’s price has shot up from about $25,000 per tonne to $90,000 per tonne in two years. This matters for electric cars, because up to half their cost is made up of the battery and ingredients account for 50 to 80 per cent of the battery itself. The higher the cost of cobalt, the more you will pay for an electric car. Right now, lithium and the cobalt are pretty much irreplaceable. The workings of the Li ion battery help explain why. When your phone battery needs to be recharged, most lithium ions sit inside graphite in the battery. “Graphite is a layered material and you can store a lot of lithium in it,” says battery chemist Prof Colm O’Dwyer of University College Cork. The lithium ions can exist easily.When you juice up a phone battery, lithium ions zip to the other side of the battery, which houses the higher voltage material. “Lithium is light and can diffuse quickly,” says O’Dwyer. There it slots into a layered material made with cobalt. The high voltage is due to the energy needed to get the lithium in there, which can be compared to pushing a ball up a steep slope. The lithium flows quickly downhill to the lower voltage graphite when your battery is turned on.Unlike other metals, cobalt atoms do not sneak back into gaps left by the lithium ions, because they are energetically satisfied. This makes for a stable battery during charge and recharge. “You need a certain amount of cobalt because it is so good at retaining this layered structure,” says battery chemist Prof Gerbrand Ceder of University of California, Berkeley. This allows the lithium flow back and forth.The cobalt atom is also small, which helps boost the amount of energy you can pack into a small space. Indeed, a mix of lithium and cobalt oxide packs the most power, making this the recipe for smartphones. Electric car batteries, however, cannot afford to be so rich in cobalt, and mix it with nickel and manganese (or aluminium) for different flavours of lithium ion battery. The most popular recipe started off with one cup of nickel, one cup manganese and one cup cobalt (NMC 111, for short). Huge research efforts have gone into reducing cobalt, while increasing nickel, though this is a challenge from a safety point of view. “People are trying to push that limit hard to get to 8 or 10 per cent cobalt,” Ceder explains. But battery experts expect demand for Congo cobalt to continue to rise. It took more than three decades for Li ion batteries to challenge the internal combustion engine on performance and cost, having been pioneered by Prof John B Goodenough at the University of Oxford in the ’80s and commercialised by Sony in the ’90s. Li ion batteries are predicted to be with us for at least another 10.The Congo threw up surprises for the Irish Army in the 1960s. It could yet throw a ner in the works of electric cars, because of cobalt. If car companies cannot get enough of it – or pay too high a price – the competitiveness of the electric car could stall.

But the prime minister has consistently denied any wrongdoing and has been cleared of any offence by Malaysia’s attorney general.  We are not seeking revenge, we want to restore the rule of law, Mahathir told reporters, as he declared victory.A win means for Dr Mahathir would make him the world’s oldest head of state. But in one of the biggest U-turns of his 70-year career in politics, he has signaled he is ready to hand over power to Anwar Ibrahim, an opposition icon who he sacked as his deputy in the 1990s.Mr Anwar is currently serving time in jail after being convicted of sodomy, in a case his opposition party claim was created to curb their rise in popularity. He will be released in June.He said he would be sworn in Thursday.Despite the shock result there were no reports of trouble on the streets, where pockets of celebration erupted overnight.A flag-waving crowd of supporters gathered on a field outside the headquarters of Mahathir\u0027s party near Kuala Lumpur.The time for change has come, and I hope the people in power realise this, said Asifa Hanifah, a young woman who joined thousands of opposition supporters in central Kuala Lumpur who waved flags, cheered and honked car horns.Malaysian police officers fire tear gas towards opposition party supporters in PutrajayaSuva Selvan, a 48-year-old doctor, said he felt the country had just won its independence.I feel that with this change we probably can see something better in the future... our hope for the future is a better government, fair, free and united, he told AFP.Najib was nowhere to be seen as the evening wore on, and was believed to have holed up inside his house for talks with senior members of BN.Dr Mahathir raised the suspicion of foul play by the election commission for being slow to declare the results as he claimed the victory before official results were announced.“The likelihood is that they (Barison Nasional) would not be forming the government,” he told a press conference. “We believe certain meetings are being held. And we worry what’s the intention of these meetings.”He added: “We hope and pray that the people respect law and order. This is very serious.”Supporters of Mahathir Mohamad, cheer as they watch live televised result announcement oDr Mahathir alleged that the election commission was “holding back the results” and not doing their duty. “The time is very late now. By now we would know who’s wining or losing. But there’s a deliberate attempt to delay by not signing the form,” he said.The election commission denied they were sitting on the results, and said the final tally could take several hours.Please review our commenting policy Barn owl that caused a flap at a wedding is ‘sacked’ by the venueMedics to assess 999 patients over live video footage from smartphonesFears of \u0026#39Brexodus\u0026#39 of academics from Britain\u0026#39s universities are \u0026#39a myth\u0026#39, figures showWorld\u0026#39s deepest plastic bag found at bottom of Mariana Trench - highlighting spread of ocean pollutionYounger GPs \u0026#39really don\u0026#39t like\u0026#39 working long hours, says senior medic as pressure piles on surgeriesBritain\u0026#39s Fat Fight with Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, part 3 review: a bathetic conclusion to this righteous campaignHarry and Meghan: A Love Story, review – a perfectly handy primer for the couple of the yearHouseholds braced for deluge of junk mail as Royal Mail prepares to capitalise on data crackdownComment: The Iran deal was a monument to Western myopia and groupthink.

Companies involved later confirmed the payments.Around $500,000 was paid to Essential Consultants, Mr Cohen\u0027s company, between January and August 2017 by Columbus Nova, a New York-based investment firm.It is headed by Andrew Intrater, the cousin of Viktor Vekselberg, a Russian billionaire with ties to the Kremlin.Mr Vekselberg heads the Renova Group and is worth $14.6 billion amassed from aluminium and oil.He attended Mr Trump\u0027s inauguration in January 2017, but was targeted for US sanctions last month. The New York Times reported last week he had been questioned by the team of Robert Mueller, the special counsel investigating Russian meddling in the US election.In a statement Andrey Shtorkh, a spokesman for Mr Vekselberg and the Renova Group, said neither Victor Vekselberg nor Renova has ever had any contractual relationship with Mr Cohen or Essential Consultants.Richard Owens, Columbus Nova\u0027s lawyer, said the company was solely owned and controlled by Americans and hired Mr Cohen as a business consultant partly for expertise on property investments.He added: Neither Viktor Vekselberg nor anyone else, other than Columbus Nova\u0027s owners, were involved in the decision to hire Cohen or provided funding for his engagement.Essential Consultants was the same company Mr Cohen used to pay $130,000 in hush money to Ms Daniels days before the 2016 election. Mr Trump denies her allegations of an affair.According to the New York Times a total of $4.4 million flowed through it from shortly before the election to January 2018.Other large sums were paid to Essential Consultants by AT\u0026ampT, pharmaceutical giant Novartis, and Korea Aerospace Industries.Novartis said it had been contacted by Mr Mueller\u0027s office and had co-operated fully. It said Mr Cohen was paid for advice on health policy. Shortly after the payments a senior Novartis executive dined with Mr Trump at the World Economic Forum in Davos.A\u0026ampT said Mr Cohen had been hired for insight into understanding the new administration. At the time it had a major merger, with Time Warner, under review by the US Justice Department.Mr Avenatti told MSNBC: Michael Cohen appears to be selling access to the president of the United States.Mr Cohen has dismissed Mr Avenatti\u0027s assertions as inaccurate.Medics to assess 999 patients over live video footage from smartphonesFears of \u0026#39Brexodus\u0026#39 of academics from Britain\u0026#39s universities are \u0026#39a myth\u0026#39, figures showWorld\u0026#39s deepest plastic bag found at bottom of Mariana Trench - highlighting spread of ocean pollutionMahathir Mohamad, 92, claims shock win over ruling coalition in Malaysia electionsYounger GPs \u0026#39really don\u0026#39t like\u0026#39 working long hours, says senior medic as pressure piles on surgeriesBritain\u0026#39s Fat Fight with Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, part 3 review: a bathetic conclusion to this righteous campaignHarry and Meghan: A Love Story, review – a perfectly handy primer for the couple of the yearHouseholds braced for deluge of junk mail as Royal Mail prepares to capitalise on data crackdownComment: The Iran deal was a monument to Western myopia and groupthink.

younger doctors really do not want to work a 14-hour day.“Many came into general practice so they wouldn’t have to.”Chair of the BMA’s General Practitioners’ Committee between 2007 and 2013, Dr Buckman said it is common for GPs to see approximately 36 patients each day, not including walk-in “emergencies” and those seen in out-visits.This can amount to around 12 hours of face-to-face time with patients and another two hours’ paperwork.The BMJ article argues the standard 10-minute consultation is too short to examine adequately and treat many patients and that the increased pressure is “now dangerous for doctors and patients”.Dr Buckman said younger GPs’ unwillingness to work the same hours of older colleagues stems partly from a different approach to patient safety, but is also because so many view general practice as an escape from the notoriously long shifts required in hospitals.He said any cap should not apply to “genuine emergencies” but added: “Most so-called emergencies are for minor ailments, certificates, insurance forms, or simple queries, and none of this justifies working into the evening.”The comments follows the recent proposal of guidance by the BMA to cap the daily number of patients seen by each GP.Top 10 | Highest paid jobs for 2017Meanwhile new research this week in the British Journal of General Practice revealed patients now find it harder than ever for patients to see the same GP.It showed the chances of seeing the same GP has fallen by more than a quarter since 2012, with access to the same doctor worst among the elderly, despite a pledge by ministers to restore the “personal link” between patients and their doctors.The Government has promised to create up to 5,000 extra GPs by 2020 compared to 2015 in a bid to ease pressure, as well as increasing incentives for experienced family doctors to keep practising.However, a review last year by the Royal College of GPs indicated that efforts to stop doctors quitting were not working with four in 10 saying they were planning to retire within five years.“We do not want to open GPs up to more attacks about lack of availability,” wrote Dr Buckman“We must collectively tell patients that there are not enough of us, and there are too many of them.” Barn owl that caused a flap at a wedding is ‘sacked’ by the venueFears of \u0026#39Brexodus\u0026#39 of academics from Britain\u0026#39s universities are \u0026#39a myth\u0026#39, figures showMedics to assess 999 patients over live video footage from smartphonesWorld\u0026#39s deepest plastic bag found at bottom of Mariana Trench -

These cars may be affected by an electrical fault which could cause the engine to cut out completely while on the road.BMW advert banned for condoning dangerous and irresponsible drivingBMW drivers voted rudest on the roadsThe motor company first issued a recall after the death of Narayan Gurung, a former Gurkha soldier who was killed when his car crashed into a tree after he swerved to avoid a broken down BMW.A spokesperson for BMW said: “BMW is expanding the existing B+ battery connector UK recall. This relates to predecessor generations of the 1 Series, 3 Series, Z4 and X1 built between March 2007 and September 2011.“BMW will be contacting all affected customers by post advising them of how they can book their car in to have the work carried out. We will commence contacting affected customers in the next three weeks.” The car manufacturer said the work should take no more than two hours, and there will be no cost to the customer.Alex Neill, Which? managing director of home products and services, said the recall raised “serious questions about the adequacy of the car recall system in this country”. “Drivers will be asking why it took so long for BMW to fully recall these potentially dangerous cars in the UK, several years later than recalls around the same fault in a number of other countries,” Mr Neill said.“The government must ensure that the DVSA has the powers that it needs to hold manufacturers to account and protect road-users from the dangers of unsafe vehicles.” Mwape Kambafwile said he stopped driving his BMW 3 Series car after it cut out completely while he was driving in December 2016.He said: “I just thought to myself if I was driving on the motorway with my family in the car, that could have been very dangerous.“I took it to BMW. The next day they called me to say they had found a fault, it looks like the cable had burnt out and no current was passing through the fuse box. I felt so uncomfortable driving it that we took taxis, I walked to work every day. It was a nightmare, it wasn’t safe enough to drive.”Watchdog Live will air on Wednesday at 8pm on BBC1.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The time for woolly ideas is over,” Mr Hillman said. In response to the paper from key figures in the higher education sector, Mr Millward said: “I am pleased to see that many of the issues given priority are ones that I am already addressing in my guidance to universities and colleges. “For example, despite the progress made in access and participation for some groups, there are still wide gaps for mature students, for white males from the lowest income groups, and at the universities with the highest admissions requirements. “And when students do enter higher education, certain groups also face real barriers to succeeding during and after their studies, particularly black and Asian students and those with disabilities. “I have made it clear to universities and colleges that I expect them to address these issues in their access and participation plans, which the OfS must approve if they wish to charge higher tuition fees.”Student news in picturesStudent news in

They did so this year with added piquancy because it was the 50th anniversary of the famous “Mai 68” when, in the Latin Quarter of Paris, the Left Bank, the whole month was devoted to riotous assembly led by students. In contemplating these events, I recall Wordsworth’s often quoted phrase: “Bliss it was in that dawn to be alive” – unless, of course, you were struck by a cobblestone hurled by a student demonstrator or soaked and knocked off balance by a police water cannon.Presumably those who were demonstrating in Paris last Tuesday have now resumed their normal lives. The point about May 1968, however, is that they didn’t go back to college or to work the next day, they carried on, some of them for the whole month. Why was that? After all, economic growth had been unusually strong, the country was calm, both politically and socially, inflation was weak, living standards had been rising and there was little unemployment.Was it in a way a very 1960s thing? That question is prompted by a French historian of the period, Éric Alary, who observes that “May 68 is seen as a period when audacious moves seemed possible and during which society profoundly changed”. For that is an accurate description of the nature of the 1960s, whether in Western Europe or in North America.At the same time, there was a big rise in the sheer number of young people as a result of an increase in the birth rate in the closing stages of the Second World War and for some years afterwards. Thus, in France, the under-20 cohort rose from 30.7 per cent of the population in 1954 to 33.8 per cent in 1968. At the same time in France (1967), the school leaving age was raised from 14 to 16.  Two men take evasive action during a Paris street riot on 30 May (Getty)This required a massive expansion of teaching staff and building. As a result, students often found themselves being taught by hastily trained teachers in hastily built class rooms. In France, as in Britain, this was followed by a big expansion of the university sector. There was inevitably something ramshackle about it all, and students noticed. Yet the command structures of educational establishments remained unchanged. Nonetheless, universities are never just academic establishments full stop. For their campuses and their indoor and outdoor spaces lend themselves to meetings and debates and even to organising mini demonstrations. The intellectual gods of these 1960s students were Marx, Freud and Sartre, the French existentialist philosopher. In a famous passage, Sartre wrote that “God does not exist, and as a result man is forlorn, because neither within himself nor without does he find anything to cling to”. This struck home. For as Bob Dylan sang in 1965 – “How does it feelHow does it feelTo be on your ownWith no direction homeLike a complete unknownLike a rolling stone?”One had either to start things on one’s own without adult backing, or not at all. This was an unprecedented and intoxicating freedom. As the French student leader Dany Cohn-Bendit told the Paris demonstrators in May 1968: “There are no marshals and leaders today. Nobody is responsible for you. You are responsible for yourselves.”In fact, as is the way of things, Mai 68 began not in central Paris, but in Nanterre, a suburb seven miles to the northwest, and not in May but on 22 March. The construction of the university of Nanterre campus in a bleak shanty town had begun in 1962. In the spring of 1968 it was still not finished. The building were exceedingly functional and contained some 12,000 students. They were particularly shocked to find themselves living and doing their studies in what was in effect a building site. They demanded, too, the right to circulate freely between the residences of males and female students, still forbidden in what one might call pre-1960s style. There was a lot of justified discontent.Daniel Cohn-Bendit  was known as ‘Dany le Rouge’ because of his politics as well as the colour of his hair (Getty)Some 150 students, including far-left groups together with a small number of poets and musicians, occupied a building. The police surrounded it. After publication of the students’ wishes, they left the building without any trouble. But then they took their protest movement to the Sorbonne in the very middle of the Latin Quarter. That was how Mai 68 started.In a drastic action, the authorities shut down the University of Nanterre on 2 May. The students who had decamped to the Sorbonne were bound to think that this was a hostile act, an outbreak of war between the university authorities and the student body. It had been natural to head to the Sorbonne, France’s premier university, which had the prestige of its ancient foundation 700 years earlier. This meant nothing to the police, of course, who invaded the Sorbonne the next day.In response, on 6 May the national students’ union and the union of university teachers organised a protest march. It was one of the key events of the month. The head of the Paris police was obsessed by the need to protect the Sorbonne and its surroundings from a massive invasion by the students. He placed 1,500 officers in defence. But then came 6,000 protesters in waves. Overnight the confrontation was particularly violent. Thousands of cobblestones were ripped up and used as projectiles by the demonstrators. The police responded with teargas grenades. Dozens of gendarmes were taken to hospitals. Students were wrenched from the arms of the police by their colleagues.The next day, students, teachers and increasing numbers of young workers gathered at the Arc de Triomphe to demand that all criminal charges against arrested students be dropped, that the police leave the university and that the authorities reopen Nanterre and the Sorbonne. But negotiations broke down. When the students returned to their campuses to find that the police were still in occupation, a near revolutionary fervour began to grip them.The lyrics of Bob Dylan captured the sense of isolation and alienation felt by many young people (Redferns)The events were broadcast on radio as they occurred, and the aftermath was shown on television the following day. This demonstration of heavy handed police brutality brought on a wave of sympathy for the strikers. Moreover, in a highly significant move, the major union federations called a one-day strike and demonstration for Monday, 13 May. The workers were going to march with the students.They had their own grievances. There had been sporadic industrial trouble since the beginning of the year. More than half of them put in a 48-hour week. They feared that their standard of living had ceased to improve. Unemployment, albeit from a low base, was beginning to rise. As a result this was no longer a Paris event, for workers took to the streets throughout France. Their slogan was “Ten years! That’s enough!” referred to Charles de Gaulle’s long period as president.French politicians Michel Debre and Andre Malraux at the tomb of the unknown soldier, demonstrating their support for De Gaulle (Getty)The events the next day, 14 May, were as important. For workers began occupying factories, starting with a sit-down strike at the Sud Aviation plants near the city of Nantes. If students could occupy their universities, then workers could seize control of their factories. By 16 May, workers had occupied roughly 50 factories throughout France and 200,000 were on strike by 17 May. That figure snowballed to two million workers on strike the following day (18 May) and then ten million, or roughly two thirds of the French workforce on strike the following week (23 May).The unions assumed that the workers simply wanted more pay. So, when they were able to negotiate substantial pay increases with employers’ associations, they thought their job was done. But workers had also demanded the ousting of the De Gaulle government and in some cases demanded to run their own factories.The demonstrations and the strikes went on. Meanwhile on the morning of 29 May, De Gaulle suddenly boarded a helicopter and left the country. He went to the headquarters of the French military in Germany and called a meeting of Council of Ministers for 30 May back in Paris. On that same day, the unions led 400,000 to 500,000 protesters through Paris chanting “Adieu, De Gaulle”. The head of the Paris police carefully avoided the use of force.Sensibly De Gaulle responded by dissolving the National Assembly and calling a new election for 23 June. He ordered the workers to return to work immediately, threatening to institute a state of emergency if they did not. The Communist Party agreed to the holding of the election. Immediately revolutionary feelings began to fade away. The police retook the Sorbonne on 16 June. And the Gaullists won the greatest victory in French parliamentary history.The May days of 1968, it turned out, had been a convulsive moment, nothing more enduring than that.

However, animals were not the only threat. Kenya was at the time a British colony.During the Mau Mau uprising of the 1950s, white families were fair game to the rebels thanks in no small part to the brutal nature of colonial rule. (In 2011 William Hague expressed “sincere regret” for the thousands who had been detained and tortured.) When Sheldrick was nine months pregnant she survived an ambush by Mau Mau fighters.Chained and tortured: The horror inflicted on India’s elephantsSo when a wild elephant she had mistaken for one of her hand-reared orphans turned on her in 1994, she took it in her stride.“I opened my eyes. I could feel the elephant gently insert her tusks between my body and the rocks,” she wrote in her autobiography, Love, Life and Elephants: An African Love Story, in 2012.“Rather than a desire to kill, I realised that the elephant was actually trying to help me,” she added. “I knew then and there that I had an absolute duty to pass on my intimate knowledge and understanding of Africa’s wild animals and my belonging to Kenya.”Born Daphne Marjorie Jenkins, Sheldrick came from a family of settlers who left rural Scotland for Africa in the mid-1820s. Her great-uncle Will, a successful farmer in South Africa, began the family’s connection with Kenya after meeting governor Sir Charles Eliot. Eliot was offering free land to families prepared to move to his new colony. Among the families that subsequently boarded the boat to Mombasa were Daphne Sheldrick’s great-grandparents.The author’s work on the Ban the Bloody Ivory campaign drew in stars including Joanna Lumley (front, centre) (Rex)The settlers arrived to an uncertain future in a country with none of the comforts of home. They could not move their livestock inland without first swathing them in cloth to foil the tsetse fly. The new railway was notorious for the number of workers eaten by lions during its construction. And the 5,000 acres of virgin bush gifted by the British government were in fact already home to the Masai. After an arduous four-month journey to get there, Sheldrick’s family had to move on again.I knew then and there that I had an absolute duty to pass on my intimate knowledge and understanding of Africa’s wild animals and my belonging to KenyaBy the time Sheldrick was born, third of Bryan and Marjorie Jenkin’s four children, the family was established on a farm in Gilgil in the Great Rift Valley. Marjorie Jenkins was determined to instil in her children a love for the natural world. Family walks included not just the farm dogs but an impala, a waterbuck and Rikki-Tikki-Tavi, a brown-furred dwarf mongoose. At the age of four, Sheldrick was given responsibility for the care of an orphaned infant bushbuck.It was an idyllic upbringing but it was hard to run a European farm among African predators such as lions and leopards. At the same time, the global picture was changing rapidly. With the Second World War reaching Ethiopia, the British government looked to Kenya to feed the troops. Bryan Jenkins was tasked with shooting thousands of wildebeest and zebra in the Southern Game Reserve. He set up a portable biltong factory, assisted by two Italian prisoners of war. It was while camping nearby that six-year-old Sheldrick was woken by lions. Attracted by the smell of meat, they stayed to lick salt from the tarpaulins.The author’s work on the Ban the Bloody Ivory campaign drew in stars including Joanna Lumley (front, centre) (Rex)As soon as she was old enough, Sheldrick, who could speak Swahili, was sent to boarding school. She was a keen student, graduating eighth in her year and winning a university bursary. However, she was already in love with Bill Woodley, a student from her brother’s school, and chose instead to leave full-time education to be with him.Khurshid Drabu: Britain’s first Muslim judgeRemembering Avicii, Swedish superstar of electronic dance musicLeila Abashidze: Georgian actress who became a star of Soviet cinemaJanka Nabay: Musician who brought Sierra Leone’s bubu to the worldIsao Takahata: Japanese animation master who co-founded Studio GhibliAt around the same time, a state of emergency was declared in Kenya after Mau Mau guerrilla fighters, drawn from the Kikuyu, Meru, Embu, Kamba and Masai people, rose up against white colonial rule. The insurgency was put down with shocking brutality by British colonial officials and Kenyan “home guards”. Thousands of civilians were rounded up in mass detention camps and subjected to beatings, sexual assault and even castration, allegedly sanctioned at the highest level. (Finally, in 2013, after a long legal campaign, the British government apologised.)Mau Mau retaliation was equally bloody and Sheldrick’s family did not escape the violence. During a Mau Mau raid on her great-aunt’s farm, five people, including three children, were burned alive. Sheldrick’s grandparents were beaten and left for dead in an alleged Mau Mau robbery. Meanwhile, a worker on the Jenkins’ farm wasted away and died, convinced he was cursed after refusing to kill his employers at the Mau Mau’s behest.The David Sheldrick Trust has been reintroducing orphans back into the wild at Tsavo National Park since 1987 (Rex)In the midst of this unrest, Sheldrick married Woodley, visiting the United Kingdom for the first time on their honeymoon. After their marriage they moved to Tsavo National Park, where they worked as wardens. In January 1955, Bill took the now heavily pregnant Sheldrick back to visit her family in Gilgil. Returning in darkness, they were ambushed. “A terrifyingly loud sound erupted and in the arc of the headlamps we could see crazed, menacing figures, clad in skins, coming towards us in a great swirl of anger and noise. Some were wielding pangas, some were hurling enormous boulders and others were firing at us from point blank range.”Sheldrick continued working into later life (Rex)Bill Woodley saved his wife and unborn daughter, Jill, by driving straight through the Mau Mau attackers. A year later, the capture of Mau Mau leader Dedan Kimathi marked the official end of the “Emergency”, but the rebellion continued underground for almost a decade.The Woodleys survived the ambush but soon after their marriage foundered. Sheldrick, still Mrs Woodley as she then was, had fallen hopelessly in love with her husband’s boss with whom she had much in common. David Sheldrick was a keen naturalist dedicated to ending poaching. During his anti-poaching campaign, more than 25,700lbs of ivory was recovered and in 1959 and he was duly awarded an MBE. Meanwhile, Bill Woodley’s passion for hunting, so much at odds with his role as warden, was beginning to grate. Sheldrick left him for his high-minded superior.Sheldrick married David in 1960. Their family quickly expanded to encompass a variety of furry and feathered orphans, such as Gregory Peck, a buffalo weaver-bird, and Old Spice, a civet cat with a passion for the aftershave that bore his name. Soon after came a human daughter, Angela.We had come to Kenya as children of pioneering families who had lived through difficult times as their parents struggled to farm the land, and when grown had served Britain with distinction in its world warsDavid Sheldrick had already raised two orphaned elephants, Samson and Fatuma. His observations of the pair formed some of the first studies on elephant diet and migration. Daphne Sheldrick took charge of further orphans including one she named Aisha. In an interview, Sheldrick explained: “She came to us as one of the smallest elephants I had ever seen, with soft fuzz and ears as soft and pink as petals. When she arrived, my heart plummeted as we had never been able to save an elephant this young.”The Sheldricks had already discovered that elephants do not thrive on traditional baby formula and after a few days on glucose and watered down cow’s milk, Aisha was wasting away. As a last resort, Sheldrick tried coconut oil. It worked. Aisha began to thrive on Sheldrick’s recipe and the future of many more orphaned elephants was assured.Sheldrick leaves two daughters, four grandchildren, and a huge family of elephants, rhinos and many more (DSWT)By the early Sixties, the Mau Mau Uprising may have been over but the “winds of change”, as referenced in Harold Macmillan’s 1960 speech in South Africa, were blowing across the continent. When it came to Kenya, the British government decided that continuing colonial rule required more force than they were prepared to expend and Kenya was granted independence in 1963. The Duke of Edinburgh presided over the handover to Jomo Kenyatta.They suffer loss and heartbreak on an almost daily basis, they grieve and mourn the loss of loved ones just as deeply as us, but they turn the page to focus on the living, and I try to emulate thatThe change of rule caused much anguish for the white settler families, who, as Sheldrick described, “had come to Kenya as children of pioneering families who had lived through difficult times as their parents struggled to farm the land, and when grown had served Britain with distinction in its world wars. Britain began to turn its back on those people – even the daily BBC programme previously announced as ‘Home News from Britain’ became ‘News From Britain’, a subtle change that did not go unnoticed.”Sheldrick’s husband was among those who struggled to renew his British passport at the time. David Sheldrick put the situation succinctly: “There was no question about me not being British when the Second World War broke out and I was called up to fight for your bloody country.”In 2016 Sheldrick warned that if the ivory trade continued, the African forest elephant could be extinct by 2025 (Rex)The Sheldricks worried that the transition to independence would adversely affect Kenya’s national parks but it was their success in making the park a safe haven for elephants that caused the next problem. The elephant numbers at Tsavo had grown dramatically – from an estimated 5,000 to 15,000 – and the increased competition for food led to the devastation of much of the forest landscape. However, David Sheldrick firmly resisted the idea of an artificial cull and, in time, the more open grasslands created by the elephants’ indiscriminate browsing attracted new species, including antelope and buffalo. The Tsavo lions thrived.Money, corruption, greed and ignorance motivates the evil ivory and rhino horn tradeIn 1976, the parks were finally brought under government control, merging with the Government Game Department. Sheldrick explained that for the park’s “wild inhabitants, especially rhinos and elephants, who became instant targets, it was the death knell”. Shortly afterwards, David Sheldrick was offered a desk job in Nairobi and the family left Tsavo to an uncertain fate.David Sheldrick died that same year. After his death, devastated Sheldrick began to raise funds in his memory to continue the work that meant so much to him.‘Born to be Wild’, narrated by Morgan Freeman, shone a spotlight on the rehabilitation efforts in Kenya (Getty)The first official fundraiser was a film by former warden Simon Trevor. Somali gangs, armed with AK47s, had been gunning down entire Tsavo elephant herds, turning the park into a no-go zone. Trevor’s film on the crisis, Bloody Ivory, came to the attention of President Arap Moi, who agreed to attend the premiere. Alas, Moi was a no-show, but a few months later the Vatican proposed a papal visit to Kenya, during which the pope wished to bless an elephant and a rhino calf. Sheldrick obliged. The logistics were difficult but the publicity was priceless.Sheldrick was named one of the most significant conservationists ever (DSWT)In 1987, the David Sheldrick Memorial appeal became The David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust (DSWT), with a mission statement declaring it “embraces all measures that compliment the conservation, preservation and protection of wildlife”. Over the next 30 years the trust expanded to three sites: the elephant nursery at Sheldrick’s home in Nairobi, and two centres in Tsavo where the orphans were reintroduced into the wild.There was no shortage of infant elephants to be reared. Though President Moi tried to signal an end to the ivory trade by publicly burning Kenya’s stockpile in 1989, the international appetite for ivory remained undiminished. Between 2003 and 2013, the DSWT saw a 500 per cent increase in the number of orphans rescued, driven by demand for ivory from China. In an interview in 2016, Sheldrick lamented that elephants were being killed at a rate of 50 a day, telling Bohotraveller: “Money, corruption, greed and ignorance motivates the evil ivory and rhino horn trade.”UK ivory trade ban a positive step but what next for Africa’s elephantConservationists warn its too early to celebrate elephants\u0027 safetyEurope must choose: elephants or ivoryYoung Kenyans care for nature but are detached from conservation Wildlife conservancy grows cattle feed to fend off droughtFamily of elephant conservation pioneer pledge her legacy will live onSheldrick spread the word about the crisis facing the elephants with numerous television appearances. She published four books, including her autobiography. Meanwhile, her work was recognised all over the world. In 1989, she was appointed MBE. She was awarded an honorary doctorate in veterinary medicine by Glasgow University. In 2001, the Kenyan government awarded her the Moran of the Burning Spear and in 2006 Sheldrick became a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire, “for services to the conservation of wildlife, especially elephants, and to the local community in Kenya”. Her knighthood was the first to be awarded in Kenya since the country’s independence in 1963, something that Sheldrick said “left me dumbfounded but nevertheless extremely proud”. At the time of Sheldrick’s death in April 2018, the DSWT hand-reared more than 200 orphaned elephants, more than 100 of whom were successfully released into the wild. As the trust approached its 40th anniversary last year, Sheldrick told Eluxe magazine: “I have always turned to the elephants for inspiration in the face of adversity. They suffer loss and heartbreak on an almost daily basis, they grieve and mourn the loss of loved ones just as deeply as us, but they turn the page to focus on the living, and I try to emulate that.”As Sheldrick wrote in her autobiography: “Elephants are, indeed, just like us, and in many ways better.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Even the government’s own research says the northeast economy will lose growth once we leave the EU regardless of the dealFive Labour MPs from the North East“Because this is so important, we believe the British people should have their say on the final Brexit deal.“Just as the people had their say in the referendum in 2016, we believe the final decision on this country’s destiny should lie with the British people in a people’s vote.”The MPs in particular highlight how firms like Nissan in Sunderland, Hitachi in County Durham and in the chemicals industry on Teesside, providing thousands of jobs, see their future within the EU customs union and single market – which both Conservative and Labour leaderships are committed to quitting.Keir Starmer: Brexit deal means UK will be tied to single market ‘in perpetuity’They also raise concerns over damage to the NHS and concessions that will have to be made to other countries to secure trade deals.They write: “There is so much at stake here. Even the government’s own research says the northeast economy will lose growth once we leave the EU regardless of the deal.“This will hit living standards of families throughout the region.

It’s utterly astonishing.”When asked if Mr Corbyn would back the amendment, that commits the UK to staying in the European Economic Area, his spokesman said it was “not what we are proposing”.He went on: “We will be pressing the case in the Commons, as the leadership has done in the House of Lords, for a new relationship with the EU, a close relationship with the EU, that is based on a close relationship with the single market ... we will try and unite people around that position, which we think is the right one to promote a Brexit which puts jobs and the economy first.”Business secretary Greg Clark: Thousands of jobs at risk if Theresa May drops Brexit ‘customs partnership’ planMr Corbyn’s spokesman explained that staying in the EEA could undermine a future Labour government’s ability “to intervene” in UK industries with particular issues around state aid and reversing privatisation.Ms May’s cabinet is also deeply ided on Brexit, with the issue of what kind of customs relations to adopt set to be discussed again at a meeting of senior minister on Tuesday.Foreign secretary Boris Johnson has denied being disloyal, despite calling the option of a “customs partnership”, said to be preferred by Ms May, a “crazy” idea.

The European system has a number of technical advantages over the existing generation of GPS and would be operated independently by Europe without reliance on the US.The presentation drawn up by British negotiators outlines how the UK and EU could build a strong security partnership after Brexit, but adds: “The arrangements for any UK cooperation on Galileo are an important test case of the depth of operational cooperation and information sharing envisaged under the security partnership.”British officials said it would be harder for the UK to work closely with the EU on security without full participation in the scheme.The UK negotiators said they want “continued UK participation in the development and operation of the open signal” of the system despite the UK leaving the bloc, as well as access to the private regulated signal for British armed forces.One year to Brexit: What is still needed to complete a deal with the EU?They have also demanded that British defence firms must be allowed to bid for contracts on the EU’s secure network on the same “fair” basis as EU firms despite Britain’s departure.The European Commission has already moved to relocate a backup control centre for Galileo from Britain because of Brexit, with operations underway to relocate it to Spain.Brussels has also moved to lock Britain’s defence industry out of bidding for contracts related to the €10bn (£8.8bn) programme – which prompted the defence secretary, Gavin Williamson, to warn that the move would be “detrimental to European security”.The UK presentation said Britain will move to develop its own satellite system to compete with Galileo if it doesn’t get full continued participation in the project.David Davis, the Brexit secretary, last year denied the UK was threatening the EU over defence and security to get a better deal, after Theresa May said no deal would be bad for security. “This is not a threat. This is a statement of the fact that this will be harmful for both of us if we don’t get a deal,” he said at the time.The first Galileo satellite was launched in 2005 and the system is expected to be completed by 2020, with early operational capability planned for later this year and full capability by 2019.

A mother of one of the young men wrote on Facebook that a store manager followed the trio out of the Brentwood, Missouri store, where she said police officers “surrounded them as the manager falsely accused and reported that they had stolen ‘several items’ from the store”.“I am appalled that my son and his friends were harassed, falsely accused and questioned for stealing when NO ONE STOLE A THING!” Twyla Lee wrote.Nordstrom swiftly moved into damage control.

The arrests were often violent, and sometimes with the support of unofficial vigilante forces. Police released Mr Navalny later that evening, but many of his supporters remained in custody throughout the inauguration. Today’s ceremony mainly followed the protocol of previous years, but there were departures. The major innovation was the debut of Mr Putin’s new 12.5bn ruble limousine, the “Kortezh”. But the car would not sweep through central Moscow as six years ago. The image of a depopulated city centre on lockdown that day left an awkward aftertaste, and today there would be no repeat.Instead, Mr Putin’s new limousine made the short trip from his Kremlin offices to the ceremonial halls. Key Putin opponent among hundreds arrested in violent Moscow clashesTrump targets Russian oligarchs and Putin allies in fresh US sanctionsDonald Trump suggested meeting Vladimir Putin at the White HouseTrump ‘tells Vladimir Putin: “If there is an arms race, ‘I’ll win’”Inside, dignitaries included some of Mr Putin’s closest friends, like the former German chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and American actor Steven Seagal. There were the stars of Russia’s beau monde – from film director Nikita Mikhalkov to rapper Timati. And there was a mix of the stranger symbols of Mr Putin’s rule: biker Alexander Zaldostanov, aka “the surgeon” the uber-loyal head of the Russian Orthodox Church Patriarch Kirill and the tsar-worshipping, ultra-conservative Natalia Poklonskaya. Pro-Kremlin youth and the heads of the regional electoral commission were also on the guest list. These groups were the sergeants of March’s presidential elections, considered a great success. That vote returned Mr Putin with a 77 per cent share, and proved to be a disaster for the liberal opposition. Looking relaxed, contented, and not without swagger, Mr Putin delivered a short address. The message was simple enough. The president repeated the promises of a decisive technological breakthrough he first made during his state-of-the-nation speech in March. But he was notably less belligerent this time. Nuclear weapons had given way to motherhood, youth and raising living standards. “Russia has been through troubles before,” he said. “And we always rise above them, like a Phoenix.” Later in the day, the president confirmed that, as expected, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev would retain his role as head of the government. According to some sources, Mr Putin was also likely to appoint the liberal reformer Alexei Kudrin to a top economic post. World news in picturesWorld news in picturesIranian MPs burning a US flag in the parliament in Tehran.

These will mostly be paid for by increased taxes, given the limited appetite for serious reform.“No one is debating whether to reject crony capitalism, state control of business and the economy, or the confrontation with the West,” said Valery Solovey, professor of the Moscow State Institute for International Relations. “Of course, this is why there will be no real breakthrough”.According to a poll published on Monday by the independent Levada Centre, Russians say welfare and inequality remain the government’s biggest failure to date. The Kremlin fares better when it comes to foreign policy, with half mentioning the return of great power status as Mr Putin’s major achievement. The combination of both factors means political liberalisation is unlikely to be around the corner, Mr Solovey said.“It is too early to make strategic conclusions,” said Mr Solovey. “But if confrontation with the West and social tensions continue on their current trajectory, domestic policy is only going to get tougher.” or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Brexit shock as peers vote to keep Britain shackled to EU agencies                Lord Lawson makes BRILLIANT point about why EU wants a BAD Brexit dealAnd according to an online poll of 6,700 Express readers, 94 percent of respondents believe the House of Lords should be abolished.Peers have come under intense criticism from Eurosceptics in recent weeks for what they view as attempting to water down Theresa May\u0027s Brexit plans.The Lords has already dealt 13 defeats to the Government on its EU Withdrawal Bill.Peers voted for a series of amendments to the landmark legislation which include changes which stop Britain achieving a clean Brexit.The amendments need to be agreed by MPs before they become binding.However, Mrs May has a working majority of just 13 seats in the House of Commons, meaning she is left vulnerable by every vote on Brexit.\u0026bullPARLIAMENT153,000 people backed a petition calling for a referendum on axing the House of LordsWhat\u0027s the purpose of the House of Lords? How do you become a Lord? What are the House of Lords traditions?

In 2007, the average weekly hours per job was 31.Meanwhile, in his Scottish Trends analysis economist John McLaren said ministers had not updated their GDP per capita ranking among Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries in in more than two years.Since March 2016, Scotland has fallen three places to 18th, one place below the UK.Mr McLaren said the country had fared relatively badly since 2014 adding: The main reason for this relative fall is the decline in the contribution of the North Sea, in turn a combination of a falling oil price and falling North Sea output.Scottish Tory economy spokesman Dean Lockhart said it was another example of SNP incompetence in the economy.He said: \u0026ldquoThe failure of the SNP to improve these essential elements of our economy continues to cost the Scottish people jobs and income.After 11 years of an SNP administration, the Scottish economy has fallen down the international rankings and productivity has declined.Carolyn Caddick, economy spokesman for the Scottish Liberal Democrats, said: Scottish ministers have serially failed to boost productivity and the economy is stuck in the doldrums.

And Brexit is splitting Labour as much as it is the Tories.Ex-Europe minister Caroline Flint ripped into Corbyn for siding with Brexit wreckers and using the issue to bash the Tories. Intriguingly, she believes Britain would have voted OUT whenever the referendum was staged in the last ten years — even if Labour had been in power.Now she believes Remainers should accept the voters’ ­verdict and help deliver the best Brexit deal possible.The Doncaster MP aimed her remarks at Corbyn but she might as easily have been talking about Alastair Campbell, who is campaigning for a ­second referendum.“Two-thirds of Labour MPs represent Leave-voting areas,” says Ms Flint. “We are alienating many traditional Labour voters.”Even Corbyn’s own supporters want him to ditch his opportunistic sabotage tactics.Steve Howell, who helped run his 2017 election bid, ­predicted a voter backlash with Labour shut out of power for a decade.“Labour is seen as too Remain,” he said. “We ignore this at our peril. We would hand Leave-voting areas over to the Tories and be destroyed at the next General Election.”Thursday’s elections prove voters of all parties are sick of Westminster shenanigans and will punish the party they blame most for a bad Brexit.Right now, that looks like Labour.“I feel pity for the women and contempt for the men,” she writes. “The man walking in pride, showing us his caught prey.“The law of this country, the law of all countries, should change. Covering a face is literally killing an identity. I would love to see men covered with burkas, for a few hours, when it’s hot.“Let’s ask them, ‘How are you feeling? Good?’”This heatwave Bank Holiday is the perfect chance to try this experiment, chaps.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

When I do talks on obesity one of my top ten tips is pay at the pump, don’t go into the kiosk, and people really get that.”Industry claims that regulations on advertising are already tight are a “shocking sham”, MPs were told, as junk food adverts regularly appear on YouTube and Facebook.Dan Parker, an advertising executive turned obesity campaigner, said rules that prohibited online advertising for junk food on sites where more than a quarter of the audience were children were useless.“This code does not include Google, or any search engine,” he said.“It does not include YouTube, it doesn’t include Facebook, Twitter or any other social networks.“It is a shocking sham. If I type My Little Pony into Google, do I see junk food ads? Yes.”Stephen Woodford, chief executive of the Advertising Association, said: “My view, which is in line with a consensus of academics, is that advertising has a small impact on food preference.“It has even less impact on overall diet and even less on overweight and obesity.”Obesity levels in the UK have more than trebled in the last 30 years and, on current estimates, more than half the population could be obese by 2050, according to the NHS.About 27 per cent of the UK population is considered obese and a further 34 per cent are considered overweight, according to the latest Government statistics.Carrying excess weight, even if its just a little, has been linked to type 2 diabetes, stroke, heart disease and 11 different types of cancer.World Cancer Research Fund estimates 25,000 cases of cancer could be prevented every year in the UK alone if everyone was a healthy weight.According to the World Health Organisation heart disease was the biggest killer in 2015 followed by stroke, both of which were responsible for 15 million deaths worldwide."},{"url":null,"title":"labours emily thornberry suggests little miss books should be renamed because little implies women are worth less","story":"The Shadow Foreign secretary suggested the Little should be dropped from the female versions of the kids books because it implied that women were less.She told ITVs Good Morning Britain today: I dont like this thing about being little.

Iran is getting the direct assistance from the North Koreans.“The Iran regime shares its own experience and expertise with North Korea”The report alleges that Iran pays the impoverished hermit kingdom in oil in exchange for its nuclear expertise.Despite the 2015 nuclear deal, which President Trump has withdrawn the US from, Iran has continued to develop nuclear-capable missiles, claims Jafarzadeh.He added: “These missiles are not being developed for defensive purposes.“One of the main goals is the missile programme is to develop nuclear-capable missiles that are able to carry nuclear warheads with a range of over 2000km.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000404722026.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"ants home invasion what to do","story":"Heres all the information you need to know.Ants love your home, especially your kitchen as it is one huge source of food for the pesky insects.An scout ant will leave the nest in search of food, leaving a trail of pheromones.Once it finds food it will follow the trail back, leaving even more pheromones, which then other ants will follow as they go out for food.Soon enough youll have a whole army running all over the place in search of everything from grains of sugar to dirty dishes.Store all food away, ideally in airtight containers, if possible.Dont leave food outClean up any food and drink spills as soon as possible.Clean thoroughly, including cupboards.Wash pet bowls regularly - ants are also partial to cat and dog food too.Take out your rubbish regularly.Clean your entire kitchen with a natural, homemade anti-ant spray, made with one part water, one part vinegar - this destroys their pheromones.Hopefully this will mean the ants move elsewhere in their search for food.Use various ant deterrents such as salt, chalk, curry powder, pepper and cinnamon and line doors and windows with any of these - but these might not be ideal if you have pets and/or small children.If you can follow the ants back to their nest find out how they are getting in and block up any holes with sealant, especially around doors and windows.Perhaps as a last resort, if you know where the nest is, open it up with a knife and then pour a kettle full of boiling water down it.A bit drastic but this will kill all the ants, including the queen. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Any relationship that she was in, there was always an element of marriage in the back of her mind.“Meghan would very quickly go into thinking, ‘What would this relationship look like in ten years?’”The book’s 35 rules include “No More than Casual Kissing on the First Date”, “Don’t Rush into Sex”, and “Don’t Talk to a Man First (and Don’t Ask Him to Dance).”Written by Ellen Fein and Sherrie Schneider, the guide was an instant sensation when it was first published in 1995.It was also controversial because its rules rejected many feminist ideas. But the source says the techniques Meghan learned from the book were instrumental in her wooing first husband, film producer Trevor Engelson, now 41.The pair began dating in 2004, became engaged in 2010 and married in September 2011. They split two years later.The source said: “She put all The Rules into play with Trevor. He had the bravado, the charisma and the looks.”The chat will be broadcast live on talkRADIO.Free drink and nibbles.To get a ticket go to:He also — apparently — had the finger of fate on his side.A source told The Sun that a fortune teller in Argentina once informed a young Meghan that she would wed a man with “curly red hair”.The aspiring actress was given the reading by a clairvoyant in Buenos Aires in 2003 while she working as an intern for the local US embassy.The source said: “She took the prediction quite seriously and when her first husband Trevor Engelson came along, she believed it was a reference to his curly hair.“She thought he must be The One.”Here The Sun reveals six other romances in Meghan’s life before she met her true Prince Charming.WHILE working as an intern at the US embassy in Buenos Aires in 2002, 20-year-old Meghan caught the eye of a passionate and wealthy Argentinian tycoon.One evening, the smitten businessman sent his car to pick up the uni student and take her for a date.A well-placed source told The Sun: “It was something of a liberation for her.“She was off in Argentina, away from everybody and she had this little adventure on the quiet.“He was a successful businessman and it was a case of, ‘I will send a car for you, be ready’.She was really taken by that.”The source said Meghan found the occasion “exciting” but added: “It was very unlike her.”Meghan was in her final year at university at the time, studying international relations and theatre.She took a break to spend “a few months” working at the embassy, where she says she became convinced she would “for sure have a career in politics”.MEGHAN had a single date in 2004 with Scary Movie actor Simon Rex – who long before meeting her had made several porn films.Former model Simon, now 43, even claims to have won an award for Best Gay Solo Video in 1997.He is now also a comedian and rapper, using the rap name Dirt Nasty, and proudly reclines naked on a bearskin rug with his dog Duane in the banner photo on his Twitter home page.Simon also posts crude jokes, recently posing in a Coca-Cola costume with the caption: “I think I have a Coke problem.”Friends say Meghan and Simon had their one-off date in Los Angeles after meeting on the set of short-lived US sitcom Cuts when they both guest-starred in the same episode.He later landed a leading part as George Logan the Scary Movie franchise, and also had a small role in Baywatch. In a 2014 interview he admitted to doing porn as a young man to pay his bills.He said: “I went there and did that s***. It was just enough to pay the rent at the time. I was living in the moment. In hindsight it wasn’t the best move.”There is no suggestion that Meghan ever knew about his porn past.ACTOR and screenwriter Shaun Zaken had a six-month romance with Meghan in 2003.The pair had both attended Chicago’s Northwestern University and both had ambitions to make it in Hollywood, Meghan’s home town.Shaun, now 38, who later played a waiter in an episode of Sex And The City, would practise his audition lines with her.But when he did not want the commitment she craved, they split up.A source said: “His family are well-off with a home in the Hamptons (a posh resort in New York state) and he had good connections in Hollywood. She liked that lifestyle and his access.“But they were both quite demanding and there were passionate public rows.“She really pursued him because she saw a future with him, but he wasn’t ready for that kind of commitment.“She was broken hearted by their split.”Shaun is now a comedy writer and wrote a show last year about a fairytale Prince Charming landing in modern-day Los Angeles.AFTER splitting up from Shaun Zaken in 2003, Meghan dated another actor and writer, Brett Ryland, for five months.Brett – who has appeared in a handful of obscure US television dramas – for five months.One pal said: “Brett adored Meghan. He was constantly trying to shower her with love and she enjoyed the attention, but she seemed to be in it more for the affirmation.“He didn’t have the kind of bravado or high profile she was looking for in a partner. He tried hard but there wasn’t much glamour or huge chemistry.“One day the switch just flipped, like it did with (first husband) Trevor, and she called it off. But he is a good guy, so they stayed friends.”Brett, who lives in Los Angeles, later became a writer for hit show Two Broke Girls before becoming a content media manager for a social media firm.DURING Meghan’s first year at university in Chicago, she fell for strapping college basketball star Steve Lepore.She would gush to pals about her “tall, dark, handsome all-American” boyfriend.A source told The Sun: “She was moving into a new world from LA and being able to land a guy who was already settled and popular was important for her.“She was very proud of having landed this handsome guy and happy to share photos of him. She spoke of how broad and beautiful his chest was.“Meghan was used to being ‘the star’ of the pairing but Steve was the star of the basketball team. She hadn’t ever dated someone like that.”But after five months in 1999, Steve transferred from Northwestern University to a college in North Carolina.Steve, 38, now lives with wife Carrie, 33, and their baby daughter in Virginia, and is a basketball coach at a military academy.After striking out with Steve, Meghan began a stormy nine-month romance with a wealthy fellow student at Northwestern. They had a tumultuous relationship.The source said: “She was very much in love with him, but it was a tempestuous relationship.“It was highs and lows. She was ecstatic when things were good and then she would be in a really dark place.“She was taken by his status as his family were wealthy diplomats, but when she went to Argentina she cut ties and it taught her some lessons about who she should be with.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Rotten weather in April meant sales for the year to date were up just 1.3%.  The Newcastle-based business it was also being hit by wider “uncertainties” as it warned full year profits would fall short of forecasts. It prompted a 15% slump in its share price - one of the worst one-day falls since it listed on the stock market in 1984. Greggs’ boss Roger Whiteside said it relied on people being out and about shopping, working and travelling. “Customers don’t come out looking for Greggs,” he said. Falling numbers of people hitting the high street has forced the firm, with nearly 1,900 branches, into a big shift.  Just 20% of its shops used to be away from high streets. That’s now a third, with a target of 60% in places such as business parks and railway stations. Whiteside said: “Each time we are opening it’s away from high streets.” Greggs, best known for its sausage rolls and doughnuts, also offering more healthy options.

Managing Director Colin Paynter said work on Galileo, currently run out of Portsmouth, will move to France and Germany “on day one” if the firm wins a new \u0026pound175m contract. He said Brussels made a condition that the work, on ground control operations, “has to be led by an EU-based company by March 2019.” He told MPs on the Brexit Committee: “We have committed to, should we win that bid, we will do all the work in the EU27 at our sites in France in Germany.  Britain could launch its own satellite GPS system if the EU bans it from the Galileo programme after Brexit  “That has made us slightly less competitive because we’re moving away from where the heritage and skill is, which is in the UK.” “And I think a number of companies are in the process of moving that work so they comply with conditions of the tenders.” Airbus put in its bid last month.  It is the latest twist in a Brexit row over Brussels’ \u0026pound9bn satellite navigation network. Brussels has reportedly threatened to cut UK ties with Galileo, an EU rival to the US-controlled GPS network, on security grounds. In turn UK sources are threatening to block Galileo from using UK overseas territories, block UK firms from passing sensitive information to the EU - or even set up a \u0026pound3bn rival UK system.  A top military chief branded the EU’s threats “odd”. Air Marshal Edward Stringer, RAF Director General Joint Force Development, told the Policy Exchange think tank: “European defence is a nicety - the defence of Europe is a necessity. “When you consider how much we share with our European allies it does seem odd that security questions are raised over something like Galileo. I’m sure those are not insurmountable.”  Top Lockheed Martin executive Patrick Wood added the row was “a small glitch along the way”.

Siemens UK chief executive Professor Juergen Maier, who sits on the Northern Powerhouse Partnership board, urges firms across the region to invest to fuel an economic resurgence. He believes 175,000 new jobs in engineering, software and design could be created over the next decade. Speaking in apprentices, students and business chiefs in Sheffield, he will say: “Leading the next Industrial Revolution cannot be done from Whitehall, it cannot be done from London.  “It can only be done in the North. This city of Sheffield was world-renowned for high-quality steel production, but fell into decline as the industry collapsed and cheaper alternatives across the world became available. “We should all be determined that we do not let this happen again. “This is our chance to reverse that decline and create the high-skilled jobs for generations to come. “Through embracing technology we can lead the world once again – exporting new northern industries all over the globe.” Mr Maier warns that using 3D printing, robotics and virtual and augmented reality into day-to-day operations is fundamental to the survival of emerging firms. He believes the North has the chance to rejuvenate towns and cities that have fallen into decline, address the longstanding imbalance between North and South and the over-reliance on London.

MPs warn struggling entrepreneurs face being “crushed” by a crackdown under Universal Credit. Self-employed UC claimants are banned from getting more benefits than if they earned minimum wage in a regular job. This ‘Minimum Income Floor’ means their benefits are capped each month - even if their firm makes a loss. Tory ministers claim this will “incentivise” the self-employed to make their firms “self-sufficient”. But it will slash \u0026pound2,927 a year off 432,000 people’s benefits by 2023, according to the independent Office for Budget Responsibility. The Commons Work and Pensions Committee today warns this “threatens” Tory vows to back entrepreneurs and “risks denting the case for UC overall.”  Chairman Frank Field, a Labour MP, said: “Universal Credit was not designed with self-employment in mind and it shows. “Its current set-up for people starting and running their own business risks crushing potentially viable, productive enterprises. “At the same time, it risks throwing away the significant investment of taxpayer’s money in them to that point.” Today’s report calls for the “start-up period”, where new strivers are exempt from the cap, to be extended from one year to three. And it says the one-month periods for calculating income should be extended to a year for people with “volatile” incomes. MPs also attack plans to publish no “significant analysis” of the policy’s impact until Autumn 2019 - four years after UC started rolling out.  Federation of Small Businesses chairman Mike Cherry warned the policy will “force” disabled people to “take a job rather than create one”. He added: “The Minimum Income Floor is bad for entrepreneurialism, pure and simple. “It generally takes two to three years to get a viable firm off the ground. “The Universal Credit system fails to recognise that fact and, in doing so, threatens the futures of successful firms.” Luke Johnstone, who founded his smoothie firm Pack’d while on benefits, told MPs it took him two years to make his firm successful. “Moving to Universal Credit would give me too short a window to create a viable business,” he told the committee.

And he made a very good fist of it.  Given Labour’s own difficulties on the issue as illustrated by last night’s rebellion in the Lords you could understand why Corbyn might have wished to avoid the subject.  Clearly the Cabinet’s disarray was too tempting to ignore for the Labour leader. Corbyn’s questions were uncharacteristically sharp and direct. Does the Prime Minister agree with the Foreign Secretary that her plans for a customs partnership were crazy? was his opening gambit.  Theresa May immediately relapsed into her dismal speak-your-weight machine mode. We are, she said, leaving the European Union and leaving the customs union. As with all her subsequent answers these words were delivered with a weight and importance that belied the triteness and inadequacy of their content. Perhaps she surmised that if she feigned the role of Prime Minister nobody would realise she was a malfunctioning hologram bereft of any answers. Corbyn briefly acknowledged her non response before moving on to the the wider Cabinet confusion. He noted the differing views between the Business Secretary and the Foreign Secretary on the proposed customs arrangements. He pointed out that neither of the Cabinet’s preferred options were workable. And he noted that after 23 months the Government had failed to come up with a solution. When, he asked, would the Government bring forward the trade bill and the customs bill?  The Prime Minister did not such much duck the question as run to the other side of the country, hide under a blanket and put her fingers in her ears before muttering “can’t hear you, can’t hear you.” We are working for the best deal, was the best response she could muster. Which you suppose is reassuring when the alternative would be a government knowingly working for the worst deal. Mrs May ended with a feeble attack on Labour’s performance in the local elections. Six times she was asked a direct question by the Labour leader and six times she failed to give a straight answer. Who knew that Brexit could prove such fertile ground for a Labour leader generally regarded as ambivalent on the subject?

Kaylene Vymola, 21, wanted to get in shape in time for a dream holiday to Mexico, so she\u0027d feel confident in a bikini on the beach. Though the instructional technology rep cut out unhealthy food she says she didn\u0027t hit the gym once - and instead opted to start walking everywhere. Kaylene would trek on her lunch breaks and go for hour-long strolls around her neighborhood each night. By the time she and boyfriend Alex Lo Monaco flew to Playa Del Carmen six months later she had dropped an impressive 40lbs, losing another 20lbs when she returned. Kalyene says she felt good in her bikini and to top it all off, romantic Alex, a customer service rep, got down on one knee while they were away and asked her to marry him.  Now the beautiful bride-to-be said she feels happier and more confident and has revealed her simple secret to success. Kaylene, of Niantic, Connecticut, said: It was just walking. I never stepped foot in a gym, I just walked and walked and walked and walked.I would walk about 15,000 steps a day - six miles. I would always walk during my lunch breaks. It was either sitting at my desk or sitting in a cafe, or going outside and going for walk. Every day after work I would go for an hour long walk through my neighborhood.Honestly I didn\u0027t feel that I needed to go to the gym. I didn\u0027t want to spend the money on it. I had a lot of people come up to me and ask me, \u0027How did you do it?\u0027 I had a lot of family members who said, \u0027You look great. \u0027I feel a lot better now. I feel much more confident, not only in my looks but in my personality. I feel like I can talk to more people. I definitely have more energy as well. I could go all night walking around my neighborhood now.  Kaylene decided to make a change in July 2017 in time for her vacation that December, firstly by cutting out some of the junk she was eating. She stuck to her favorite breakfast of eggs but switched chips and sandwiches from Subway for grilled chicken and salads at lunch. For dinner, she ditched carb-heavy pizza and pasta in favor of protein-based meals and she completely cut out her guilty pleasure - chocolate. Instead of munching on Kit Kats and Reese\u0027s she opted for healthy snacks and she swapped coffee for tea, always ensuring she was in a calorie deficit for the day. Kaylene also took up her walking regime and by the she stepped on the plane to Mexico she had lost 40lbs. She went on to lose a further 20lbs after returning home.  I have always kind of been on the overweight side and I was self conscious, she said. Through my teens, being in school and comparing yourself to other skinny little girls who get all the attention from the guys - it was very frustrating. I wasn\u0027t extremely down about it but it always kind of bothered me. I felt unhappy. In summer you want to wear bikinis and dresses and I was very hesitant because I didn\u0027t feel great in them. We have four beaches in the town I live in and my friends would always go, but I would avoid it. I wasn\u0027t worried about comments, it was more that I didn\u0027t want to be around a bunch of really good looking people and I felt I didn\u0027t look good. My goal was to feel confident in a bikini. I just wanted to feel better and more confident and not worry about people staring. It was torture in the beginning but Mexico was keeping me going because I had it booked.

After battling autoimmune issues, Taylor Muhl was diagnosed with ‘chimerism’ - a condition in which a fraternal twin dies in utero and is fused into the surviving twin.  The condition is named after the chimera, a fire-breathing female monster in Greek mythology with a lion\u0027s head, a goat\u0027s body, and a serpent\u0027s tail. As a result of her chimerism, Taylor has two sets of DNA, two sets of blood cells and two immune systems. Taylor\u0027s physical abnormality appears as a straight line that runs down the centre of her torso dividing it into two different colours - the left side of the pigmentation being her twin’s genetic makeup and the right side being her own.  After years of constant doctor visits and numerous tests, Taylor was finally diagnosed in her twenties and has decided to allow the world to see her skin in hopes of raising awareness about chimerism and to encourage other chimeras to embrace their condition publicly. Taylor, from Los Angeles, told Barcroft TV: I am my own twin because I have two genetic makeups within one body. It’s basically having totally two different humans under the same hood of the car, so to speak.  When I grew up no-one said anything about my second colour skin pigmentation because no-one really knew. The only people that did know were probably my closest friends and family. Anywhere I went publicly I always kept it covered. My whole life I was always told that my second colour skin pigmentation was just a birthmark. Most doctors, even in this day and age, don’t know about chimerism because it’s that rare.  Determined to have a natural pregnancy and home birth, Taylor’s mum Alex Muhl opted against having an ultrasound and so was completely unaware that she was due to have twins. She said: I had Taylor at home and I had two midwifes who took care of me. Everything was done naturally and part of it was to not upset the child. I just firmly believed it was something I did not want to do to the baby. I wanted it to be natural. So I never knew.  As soon as Taylor was born, we just swaddled her and enjoyed the moment. Then after the midwife swept her away to bathe her and weigh her and then brought her back, it was like, ‘Wow! What is this?’ And there was this demarcation down the middle of her abdomen.” Prior to being diagnosed, as a young child Taylor had a strange obsession with being a twin, constantly wanted to dress like her best friend and would even ofter ask her mother if she actually had a sibling of her own.  While working in the entertainment industry, she struggled to comfortably show off her torso, eventually leading her to try and laser off her ‘birthmark\u0027. Taylor said: I think my very first appointment was so painful to the point that it brought me to tears. I was just blown away because I couldn’t understand why it was hurting so bad if it was just a birthmark.  The doctor wanted me to come back for a second time and I just said, ‘No way, it’s staying on me.’ It was unbearable, so it cannot be removed. It’s been on me since the day I was born and it will be there till I leave. After hiding her stomach for most of her life, Taylor decided to come out publicly last year to finally freely showcase her pigmentation to the entire world - and says it has even helped her modelling career. Taylor said: I definitely had times in my life I had been insecure about showing my torso. I was so scared that if I showed my torso on a job or a photo shoot, that clients would never want to work with me again. Or I might not book the job to begin with because I am \u0027different’.

Bosses at the meet and greet firm, which is not affiliated with Manchester Airports Group, confirmed the car had been involved in a crash with two buses on the M60 on Friday, April 13.

Judge Steven Everett today jailed Antoniou for 21 months, telling him: “The message must be sent out to you and others that if you decide to put the boot in on somebody’s head and neck when he is completely out of it then the courts will deal with it most severely.” The judge said he took into account Antoniou’s exemplary character and successful career in specialised engineering, and that he will lose his job as lecturer for 40 students, but he pointed out that he “could have killed” the victim. The judge said that both men believed they were in a relationship with Maxine Farrah and it was a case of “excessive self-defence” after seeing the victim put his hand to his pocket. Antoniou, from Prenton on the Wirral, had pleaded guilty to inflicting grievous bodily harm. Rebecca Smith, prosecuting, told Liverpool Crown Court that Mr McNance, 50, had been in a relationship with Maxine Farrah from 2014 but they split up in early 2016.

A pal said: “They’re desperate to have children as soon as possible, they’re hoping it won’t take long.” It means young royals Louis, Charlotte and George may not have long to wait for a cousin following their Uncle Harry’s wedding. Pals of the 33-year-old prince and US actress, 36, agree a baby will be their top priority. Harry has said in 2015: “I’d love to have kids right now.” And he said in his engagement interview: “Hopefully we’ll start a family in the near future.”  And Meghan has confided in ex-agent Gina Nelthorpe-Cowne: “I’d absolutely love to have children, and I can’t wait to be a mother.” Joe Little, managing editor of Majesty Magazine, said: “You would imagine a baby must be quite high on the agenda given Meghan’s age.

A poll of 2,000 parents of children up to age 10, also found 41 per cent have abandoned attempting to get greens into kids’ diets because they are more concerned about ensuring they eat full stop. Twenty-nine per cent have lost their patience trying to get their youngsters to eat a healthy diet, with one in five saying they have given up because they were tired or in a rush. And shockingly, five per cent confessed they simply don’t think it’s important for their children to get their five-a-day. The research was commissioned by home appliance manufacturer Beko to celebrate the launch of its new ‘Eat Like A Pro’ campaign in partnership with FC Barcelona, which aims to help parents inspire their kids to eat a little bit healthier and tackle a global issue of childhood obesity.  Donald Shepherd, Marketing Director Beko UK said: “Our research shows that the battle to achieve a balanced diet continues and it’s as challenging as ever for some mums and dads to get fruit and vegetables into their little ones. “It’s been widely reported that in the UK, 25% of 2-10-year olds and one third of 10-15-year olds are overweight or obese*. “One of the challenges that has come out of this new research, is that 27 per cent of parents say that they need more exciting recipes that include fruit and vegetables, to help them achieve getting their kids to eat five-a-day. “With that in mind, through Eat Like A Pro we’re working with FC Barcelona’s nutritionist to create over 100 recipes that are simple but nutritious for all the family to enjoy.” In addition, three quarters of parents surveyed admitted they struggled to feed their youngsters fruit and vegetables, with one in 10 stating fresh food goes off before they have a chance to eat it. And 28 per cent of children avoid their veggies because they simply don’t like the taste.  Ironically, it would seem the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree with parents getting just three portions of fruit and veg daily themselves. As a result, six in 10 have resorted to ‘tricking’ their children into eating their veggies such as hiding them in other foods or bribing them. It’s fair to say parents are giving it their best shot, with 85 per cent explaining the value of a healthy diet to their little ones, but just half think their wise words actually have an impact. One in five said their kids’ friends have the most influence on their choice of foods, with an equal number in agreement their school plays the biggest part. Mums and dads admitted to first ‘giving up’ on getting greens in their kids at the tender age of four, but nearly one third confessed to exaggerating their veggie feeding endeavours to keep up appearances. Seven in 10 parents have confessed to battling with their youngsters to try and get them to eat their greens when they don’t want to.

Lambeth Police said: The woman injured on the bus as a result of the suspected noxious substance has been taken to hospital. Her condition is not life changing or life threatening. No major burns. Enquiries continue to trace the single male suspect. This attack appears to be a targeted \u0026amp not random. Images from the scene show a number of emergency service vehicles parked at the junction of Electric Avenue and Brixton Road. Another witnesses, Claire Martin, took an image from inside a bus of police cars parked along the street with police tape outside H\u0026ampM. Passer-by Becky Reid said: Feel physically sick after walking past a poor innocent person getting hosed down by firefighters are being could in the middle of an acid fight in Brixton. So scary this can happen on our doorstep. Hope they are ok?    The suspected attack comes after a bank holiday weekend crimewave. On Sunday morning, three people were hurt when they were doused with a noxious substance during a fight between two groups in Shacklewell Lane in Hackney, east London, at around 5.20am Police previously issued an appeal to help trace a single male believed to have been involved in the incident - but they have since said they are looking for a woman instead. The Met Police said in a statement: Officers continue to investigate after a woman was targeted in a suspected noxious substance attack in Lambeth. Police were called to Brixton Road, SW9 by The London Ambulance Service (LAS) at 13.45hrs on Tuesday, May 8, following reports of a woman being the victim of a suspected noxious substance attack whilst on a bus.

At a first glance, Carole Middleton and Doria Ragland appear to be polar opposites.  One is a yoga-loving, free-spirited social worker. The other is an uber-coiffed home counties matriarch and self-made millionaire.  Come May 19 , however, Doria joins the strange club that Carole has inhabited for the last seven years - an in-law to the royals.   This weird world they\u0027ll be thrown into - with it\u0027s unforgiving spotlight - might not be the only thing they have in common though.  1. Closeness to their daughters  The first time we ever heard the then-Kate Middleton speak was during her engagement interview, when she painted an image of a close-knit family and a happy upbringing. Fast-forward nearly eight years, and it\u0027s clear the Middletons are as tight as ever. In those early weeks after Prince George\u0027s birth, Kate and William relocated to Carole and Michael\u0027s house in Berkshire. Set on 18 acres of land, it provided a haven for the new family.  Carole is believed to be a hands-on granny with her grandchildren too. It\u0027s believed she\u0027s stepped in to give her daughter a helping hand now she\u0027s a mum-of-three , and is frequently seen at royal events - at the invitation of the Queen no less.  Despite geography keeping them apart, Doria and Meghan are no less close.           After divorcing Meghan\u0027s dad, Thomas Markle, when Meghan was six, Doria had Meghan live with her (although the Suits actor did see her dad regularly). On her now-defunct blog, The Tig, Meghan rather sweetly revealed her mum\u0027s pet name for her was Flower and has written about her several times.  In a post called Love Letter, she wrote: Dreadlocks. Nose ring. Yoga instructor. Social worker. Free spirit. Lover of potato chips \u0026amp lemon tarts. And if the DJ cues Al Green’s soul classic \u0027Call Me,\u0027 just forget it. She will swivel her hips into the sweetest little dance you\u0027ve ever seen, swaying her head and snapping her fingers to the beat like she’s been dancing since the womb. And you will smile. You won\u0027t be able to help it. You will look at her and you will feel joy. I\u0027m talking about my mom. It appears Harry is a fan of Doria\u0027s too, in the BBC interview following their engagement he enthused: Her mum’s amazing!  2. Work Much is made of Carole and Michael Middleton\u0027s success, but before Party Pieces elevated them into the category of the super-wealthy, Carole worked as a flight attendant.  As, apparently, did Doria in the years after her divorce from Meghan\u0027s dad, the Mail Online reports.  Since the Middleton\u0027s launched Party Pieces in 1987, the company is now believed to be valued at \u0026pound30 million.  Doria\u0027s long career is as social worker is no less impressive. The yoga fanatic is nicely tucked away from all the crazy circus of the royal wedding, and still works Didi Hirsch Mental Health Services in Culver City, California. 3. Marriage Carole and Michale Middleton married in 1980 and have presented a pretty solid front ever since. They\u0027re never not smiley and seen to be loving life. Doria and lighting-director Thomas married in 1979 in a wedding that is a far cry from the pomp and ceremony their own daughter will experience.   The bride wore flowers in her hair and the whole day had a New Age feel about, taking place at the Self-Realisation Fellowship Temple on Sunset Boulevard.   Sadly they divorced eight years later, but it\u0027s believed the split was amicable, and they will be presenting a united front at their daughter\u0027s wedding.  They both issued a joint statement following the news of Meghan and Harry\u0027s engagement, which read: We are incredibly happy for Meghan and Harry.  Our daughter has always been a kind and loving person. To see her union with Harry, who shares the same qualities, is a source of great joy for us as parents. We wish them a lifetime of happiness and are very excited for their future together. 4. Style and health Of the two women, Carole is the undisputed queen of splashing the cash on looking good. She\u0027s been known to frequent Richard Ward’s salon in Chelsea, where a Cleanse, Condition, Cut and Finish can set you back \u0026pound225.  According to the Mail, Carole is also partial to facial courtesy of celebrity facialist Linda Meredith, whose anti-ageing treatments cost around \u0026pound150.  That said, Doria\u0027s no slob when it comes to skincare.  When I was 13 years old, my mum had me start getting facials, Meghan has said. It seemed so silly at the time, trekking in my school uniform to see a woman named Anika who slathered my skin with Yon-Ka products and chatted away about the importance of eye cream.

But the 43-year-old has spoken out in a bid to convince the nation she is not evil and insist she knew nothing of the snatch plot that shocked the nation. Matthews even offered to take a lie detector test about what happened to her daughter when she vanished in February 2008 before being found at an accomplice’s flat tethered to a bed. And without any hint of remorse over the sick kidnap, she pointed to other vile criminals to justify her claim that she should not be branded evil.  Mum-of-seven Matthews said: “I’m not Britain’s worst mum. I didn’t kill anybody. “Baby P’s mum and Maxine Carr don’t get the abuse that I do. “None of it’s true. I’m on the edge. It makes me want to kill myself but I’d never do that. I’m scared I’ll die lonely and alone.” Despite being found guilty of snatching Shannon when the youngster was nine and serving four years of an eight year sentence, Matthews still refuses to accept she took any part in the plot to cash in on \u0026pound50,000 reward money. She said she was made a “scapegoat” and added: “From the start I didn’t know where she was. Others were involved. I didn’t have a clue. “You can’t kidnap your own child. I know the truth and I wasn’t involved in it. I still have nightmares thinking that it’s all going to happen again.  “I want to take a lie detector test to prove my innocence.” But she says she fears she won’t be forgiven.  Shannon was kidnapped from near her home in Dewsbury Moor, West Yorks. Her disappearance sparked a massive month-long police search. Matthews and her then boyfriend Craig Meehan joined the hunt and she made several public appeals for help to find her daughter. Shannon was found on March 14 at Michael Donovan’s flat in nearby Batley Carr. She had been drugged. Donovan was also found guilty of kidnap, sentenced to eight years and released after four. But he was recalled to prison in 2012 after a bust-up in Leeds. Born-again \u0026shyChristian Matthews spoke about her time behind bars. She said: “When I was first in jail I thought I was going to die. I panicked.  “They were banging on my cell door saying, ‘Come out here, you dirty nonce.’ Prison made me weaker. I don’t feel like the same person any more. I was beaten up inside because of who I was. “Once they threw a snowball with a rock in it at me and other times I was punched. I didn’t say anything, I was too scared.” But Matthews insisted she did make friends, including a transgender prisoner in Peterborough’s segregation unit. And she claimed she had admirers on the outside. She said: “Men used to write to me with semi-naked pictures and ask if I fancied meeting up because everyone makes mistakes.” Matthews also used our interview to deny claims she has a 72-year-old “sugar daddy”, Eric Anderson.  She said: “I have standards. I’m very lonely and I found a friend who I thought I could trust. A true friend. “He was just somebody to talk to because I’ve got nobody else. Somebody has blown our relationship out of context. He did give me money because he wanted to help me. “He got the money from some inheritance and said he wanted to help me out because I’m struggling. “He’s like a father figure to me, like an uncle. There’s no sex involved. I’ve known him for years. Eric takes me for coffee and KFC and tells me not to go with the nasty men I have met and not to be taken advantage of. I’ve sworn off men. I will never get married. I don’t trust them at all. “I’m trying to get my life back on track and everything that is being said is not true.”  Matthews also denied claims she was selling sandwiches to the \u0026shyhomeless that had been handed out free by Pret a Manger shops. She said: “I never sold them I gave them to the homeless. “This woman that’s a church person was handing them out. “It was getting dark earlier and I used to go to help pick them up and take them to the homeless around the station. Sometimes I’d take them to the \u0026shySalvation Army. It makes me sick what was said, that’s not me. I was doing it out of the goodness of my heart.”  Matthews was relocated to a town in the south of England for her own safety after being released from prison. She said she spends her days walking from charity shop to charity shop, trawling for bargains. But she also works as a volunteer in a \u0026shyChristian charity shop. She added: “I am really proud of getting a job. It makes me feel like I’ve achieved \u0026shysomething for myself. “I feel I’m not being judged when I’m there. I love my job and I love going in every time. They say I’m a good worker, one of their best and I could get a paid job in the future.”  But Matthews revealed she has now stopped going to church. She said: “People found out who I was and I was getting grief there, people saying, ‘Oh, do you know who that is?’ “I felt uncomfortable and there were kids there as well. I still believe in God, I just don’t go to church now.” Matthews lives in a one-bedroom basement flat with her budgie Bob. She said she is still “terribly lonely” and added: “I talk to Bob when I get home. I feed him from my hand. “I don’t want a man. I don’t trust them. It’s just me and the budgie now.” Because of her time behind bars Matthews said she is uncomfortable indoors. She added: “I hate being trapped. I have to get out.”  When she goes out she puts a head band on to cover up her roots as her natural ginger hair starts to appear. She isn’t very well – doctors said she has gallstones – and she is on pills to ease the pain as she awaits surgery. Matthews said: “It scared me. I’ve lost six stone since because it was down to fatty foods. I used to eat lots of sweets but now I try to eat better.” Last year the BBC screened a drama, The Moorside, about \u0026shyShannon’s kidnap. Gemma Whelan starred as Matthews, Sheridan Smith played her best pal Julie Bushby and Sian Brooke was neighbour Natalie Brown. In the past, Matthews has spoken to the Mirror about how the only thing she missed in jail was sex and \u0026shyshopping. In another interview she claimed she knew where Shannon was after she had been snatched – contradicting her own story. Karen Matthews has not been paid for this interview.

But in the last few years it\u0027s gained a new lease of life thanks to the young royals, and it now seems to be an appealing place for many of them to call home. The Cambridge gang now live in a lavish home on the site, and Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will be moving in next door after their wedding. At the moment the couple live in the small two-bedroom Nottingham Cottage, but they\u0027ll be upgraded to Apartment 1 after their wedding. It\u0027s the second biggest on the site, and work is already underway to get the lavish 21-room wing all ready for them.  But the Cambridges won\u0027t be their only royal neighbours, as Kensington Palace is full of members of the royal family - 15 to be exact. So let\u0027s take a look at all Harry and Meghan\u0027s neighbours.  The Cambridges - Apartment 1A Wills, Kate, George, Charlotte, baby Louis and Lupo the dog now live in the biggest home on the site - Apartment 1A.  It boasts six-bedrooms and was once home to Princess Margaret. After their wedding Kate and Wills spent \u0026pound4.5million doing it up. Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank - Ivy Cottage The engaged couple are the newbies in KP, having moved in just last month.  They live in Ivy Cottage, which is just around the back from Harry and Meghan\u0027s current home. Eugenie is Prince Harry\u0027s cousin, and they\u0027re said to be good pals who enjoyed partying together. The couple will marry in St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor Castle, the same venue as Harry and Meghan, in October. The Duke and Duchess of Gloucester - Apartment 1 (for now) Prince Richard, the Queen\u0027s cousin, currently lives in Apartment 1 however he\u0027s about to be booted out to make room for Harry and Meghan.  The couple\u0027s children have now all grown up and flown the nest, so they\u0027ve agreed to move out so the new couple can have more space. But don\u0027t worry, they\u0027re not being turfed out into the street. According to the Daily Mail, they\u0027re moving into the Queen\u0027s private secretary Sir Christopher Geidt\u0027s old apartment. It\u0027s a lot smaller, but apparently they don\u0027t mind... The Duke and Duchess of Kent - Wren House Prince Edward is also the Queen\u0027s cousin and he lives in an apartment with his wife Katharine.  We don\u0027t know much about their home and they\u0027ve always kept the details very private. Prince and Princess Michael of Kent - Apartment 10 Michael is another of the Queen\u0027s cousins, but their living situation caused a bit of controversy back in 2001 when it was discovered the couple were paying peanuts to live in KP.

As a nation we just all really love Prince Harry . We’ve been rooting for him, hard, since we saw that image that haunts us – which I don’t even need to expand on, because everyone immediately knows what I mean – back in 1997.  That’s over 20 years of rooting. So we’re pretty much definitely, unreservedly, on board with anyone who makes him as happy as he currently is.  Obviously it doesn’t hurt that Ms Markle’s ’mazing in her own right, too though. It’s the buttercream icing on top of the lemon and elderflower wedding cake she’s chosen, which is just the kind of perfect detail that makes us like her even more.  The funny thing is that Harry’s so delighted with her, we’d have loved and accepted Meghan wholeheartedly whatever she was like. It’s almost a waste for her to be as good as she is.  Let’s put aside the obvious (ethnicity, marital status, etc) because it’s a breath of stale air to describe her as a breath of fresh air, and yet impossible not to. There’s something extra about Meghan that seems different. Maybe it’s because she’s from another country, so hasn’t grown up being fully familiar with how stiff and formal the royals are... or maybe she knows all too well, and has decided it’s time for a change. The Royal Family are famously standoffish, but Meghan’s a hugger. When we see her with the public, sometimes it can seem a bit much, but that’s just because of how conditioned we are, what we’ve become used to over the years. Everywhere she goes at the moment, she’s meeting people who are genuinely thrilled for her, swept up in her love story and fervently wishing her the best – it’s actually extremely appropriate to be charmed by that. Meghan’s not being over the top, she’s behaving like a normal human being with feelings rather than a stuffy robot.

Mandisa Mayne\u0027s strange habit began when she was still in school and saw her stealing bits of chalk from the classroom blackboard to munch on. By the time Mandisa, 36, reached secondary school her chalk-eating habit was in full throttle an saw her consuming more and more. The mum-of-two, from Birmingham, admitted her two children, and business owner husband, who she does not wish to name, find her eating habits very strange. She said: My cravings started with chalk. I used to steal it from the blackboards and nibble it during lessons as a child. The more I did it, the more I enjoyed it.  “By secondary school, I was full-on craving it and needed to eat more and more. “I used to take the chalk from the art department and eat that. Then, when I started getting pocket money, I would go to the shops and buy my own supplies.” Buying ten packets of chalk at a time from her local Wilko shop, as she got older, Mandisa struggled to control her cravings at work. She admitted: “When I became a teacher, I’d eat clay and chalk in my classroom in my breaks. Before that, working in admin, I remember one time when I was pregnant, when my work building was being refurbished and plaster was hanging off the wall, I couldn’t resist getting a screwdriver and hacking more plaster off, just so I could eat it. It was an uncontrollable craving - I just couldn’t help it.”  After she had been with her husband, who she met in 1999, through mutual friends, for two weeks, she revealed her peculiar food choices. Remembering his reaction, she said: He was shocked, but that wasn\u0027t going to stop me - nothing would. But, Mandisa\u0027s palette changed with age and, in 2011, when she discovered clay, it wiped clean her craving for chalk. She continued: I\u0027d had enough of chalk, I’d got to the point where it really wasn’t doing it for me. “All the shops I was buying it in were cheap and it didn’t taste like it used to. “I tried everywhere to find something which was as good as the old stuff, but I had no luck.” Admitting that her husband and her kids still find her clay eating habit strange, she said: I\u0027m passionate about clay. I started selling it, as I wasn\u0027t passionate about teaching anymore. I order in up to 40kg a week, keep it all around my house and then distribute it. Now I\u0027m a successful businesswoman, selling it to people just like me. “Eating clay makes me feel healthy, it’s just like a detox. I even eat it off a spoon, sometimes, like yoghurt or ice cream.”  Mandisa discovered her new favourite snack after finding an online forum, where people discussed their non-nutritious eating habits - stumbling on the condition, pica. “I’d never heard of it before, but it sounded just like me, she said. I asked if anyone had any other alternatives to chalk and someone mentioned clay. “I ordered 300g of the stuff from Georgia, USA, for \u0026pound30, and other types from Africa, Russia and the Ukraine ... and I was hooked.” Before she set up her business she was spending \u0026pound20-a-week on a 500g bag. And Mandisa, who eats it as chunks, is particularly partial to a bite after a helping of fast food, like pizza. She continued: “I’ll take it to the cinema in a little bag and eat it after my popcorn, have it on a night out, after we\u0027ve been to the chip shop, or nibble on a small amount if I have indigestion. “It’s always in my bag, wherever I go.” Mandisa has been warned by colleagues she could be damaging her body, but she remains adamant that her weird snack is good for her.

We got Tilly when he was four years old, so he\u0027d never known life without her. “She was his best friend, he spent a lot of time with her. “We buried her in the back garden, and on the day we buried her he slept for an hour in a chair beside her, with his headphones on listening to music. “He also slept with her blanket for the first couple of nights – but then stopped that. He said it was too soon, and we didn\u0027t give her enough of a chance to get better.”  Less than a year before Seb\u0027s death, the Year 10 Heathfield Community School student had, on two separate occasions, taken an overdose. But Claire said Seb was a popular, well-liked boy who enjoyed going out with friends, and in the months leading up to his death she had no concerns about his mental health.  Coroner Tony Williams, at Taunton Coroners Court, recorded Seb\u0027s cause of death as hanging – but added that Seb\u0027s intentions at that time were not clear, reports Somerset Live .  A statement from Claire read at the inquest in Taunton heard that she had left Seb alone at their home in Creech St Michael for a couple of hours in the morning. The statement said: “At around 10am on Saturday, November 18, I took my two younger daughters to a party. “Just before leaving the house I popped my head around the door of Seb\u0027s room to see if he was okay.  He was still in bed in his pyjamas, playing on the iPad. He seemed okay, there was nothing out of the ordinary.” Claire said she returned home at around 12.30pm and called up to her son, but received no reply, and assumed he had gone out with friends. She said: “I pottered around the kitchen making lunch, and then I noticed that his shoes were by the back door. “I went up the stairs to see if he wanted some lunch. The door was ajar so I pushed it open and ran into his bedroom. “I was screaming, so my daughter ran to get our neighbour. I was also on the phone to my partner, Paul, the whole time, and he rang the ambulance.” Claire said that on Friday, November 17, the night before Seb\u0027s death, he had gone out with friends, and seemed in good spirits when he returned.

Parents and students at Mount Pleasant Primary School in Shrewsbury, where a school dinner costs \u0026pound2.20 per day, have been warned in a newsletter that arrears exceeding \u0026pound6.60 will mean the school will only be able to offer bread, fruit and water to pupils. Children falling foul of the policy are also being sat away from other pupils to eat. Mum Jamie-Lee Heath, whose daughter Madison attends the school, for four to 11-year-olds, said the rule was shocking and showed no compassion whatsoever to the children they see every day. Jamie-Lee received a text from the school just one hour before lunchtime to say \u0026pound4.40 was owed and no dinner had been ordered for Madison. She said Madison had accidentally left her lunch in her father\u0027s car the day before and was given a hot meal, leaving her owing \u0026pound2.20. Madison went to school without money or lunch the following day and despite her father agreeing to pay at the end of the day because he had no cash on him, the school text Jamie-Lee who quickly managed to pay the arrears in time.  The 30-year-old kitchen designer said: My daughter left her lunch in her dads car and was given a hot lunch instead, putting her in arrears of \u0026pound2.20. I was completely unaware of this as we share custody and she was with him that entire week. The very next day the school refused to order her a lunch and text me about an hour before lunchtime stating so. I called up immediately and explained I would pay online straight away as I didn\u0027t realise she had arrears or no dinner money but also asked about what she would have been given if I hadn\u0027t managed to read the text in time. This is when the bread, fruit and water policy was explained to me. It had been mentioned in a previous school newsletter but I must admit I hadn\u0027t read it properly. I then wrote a status on my personal Facebook page alerting other parents who may have missed the newsletter about what was happening. People caught on pretty quickly and it was shared and commented on quite a lot with most people agreeing that this was just a step too far. Not only was my child not in the arrears amount threshold, I also pay \u0026pound50 plus a week in advance for her breakfast clubs, dinners and after school clubs which the school are well aware of. To withhold a hot dinner from her over the matter of \u0026pound2.20 seemed shocking to me and many others. Myself and others also agreed that the fact the child would be taken away from their friends and given a different \u0027lunch\u0027 in a separate room seemed like a punishment to a child and could easily create upset or bullying opportunities.  To take such a sharp stance on such a small amount of money just doesn\u0027t tie in with how I imagine schools would like to be seen. No compassion whatsoever to the children they see every day. I would have been at work when the text was sent. If I had missed that text due to being in a meeting or with a customer I have no doubt that they would have followed through with the bread and water. I work 40 plus hours a week as a kitchen designer but luckily that week was my first week of maternity leave and I was off. I also find it appalling that if indeed a parent was struggling to pay lunches for whatever reason, it is the child who would suffer. Surely the first port of call is offering support and help to the parent and a point in the right direction. Not segregation of the innocent child. My issue is with the policy and how it may affect a child. To be taken away from your peers and not fed the same meal that you would normally expect. For this to happen regardless of whether the parent is a repeat offender or it\u0027s a one time genuine error as it was in this case, is just not a reasonable method. We want our children to be alert and happy at school, as we all know children learn better this way. To do this they need a full stomach. I understand repeated missed payments must be frustrating to deal with, and it\u0027s surely not the best use of school resources chasing up parents who have forgotten to pay or are struggling to pay. But they are children. It is not their fault. There surely needs to be a rethink at Mount Pleasant and indeed at any other school adhering to this policy. The school highlighted the policy in their June newsletter last year.

Now experts have worked out Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0027s big day could come with a hefty price tag - a cool \u0026pound32million. The average person spends \u0026pound17,913 on their day, but the royal couple\u0027s comes with a lot of extras - from bespoke silver plated fanfare trumpets to a drone destroyer. Wedding planning company Bridebook has calculated the cost based on flowers, food, entertainment and the main attraction, the dress coming in at \u0026pound1,969,873, but there\u0027s also the \u0026pound120,000 honeymoon and \u0026pound30m security costs. It\u0027s unsurprising then that the wedding, which is being held at Windsor Castle on May 19 , is expected to make the list of one of the top ten expensive weddings of all time. The main cost is down to security, as Windsor will be locked down for the day, bumping up that security bill, including snipers, undercover police and a counter-drone system - it\u0027s estimated to all cost \u0026pound30million. The bill is expected to come in higher than brother Prince William\u0027s wedding, which cost \u0026pound20m - though it was a larger affair - because of the ongoing terrorist threat level. Venue - Free  The ceremony is taking place at St George\u0027s Chapel, Windsor Castle while the reception will be in St George\u0027s Great Hall, within the castle.  Marquee - \u0026pound350,000 Later the party moves to the Upper Ward grounds of Windsor. While the pair don\u0027t have to pay for the venue, they will have to fork out for that marquee.  A luxury glass marquee, similar to Pippa\u0027s cost \u0026pound300,00- plus additional catering and staff.  Catering - \u0026pound286,000 There\u0027s the formal lunch reception for state guests and the dinner reception for their family and friends. This will end up being one of the more costly parts of the wedding. Sausage rolls and hot tea for the members of the public won\u0027t come cheap either, with 2,640 of them it could come in at \u0026pound26,000! Cake - \u0026pound50,000  Harry and Meghan are opting for a banana wedding cake (we know) as well as a second cake. The unique cake will be made by pastry chef Claire Ptak , - owner of London hipster hotspot Violet Bakery. It will be covered with buttercream and decorated with fresh flowers. Drinks - \u0026pound193,000 It\u0027s not a party, without a tipple or two! The drinks will most likely come from the Palace Cellars, but they\u0027re still worth a fair bit. If we\u0027re looking at the number of guests, they\u0027ll probably need 2,300 bottles to keep guests happy. Bridebook works out roughly 1,700 bottles of champers will be served throughout the day and 650 bottles of wine, whiskey and cocktails. A bottle of Bollinger, the family\u0027s favourite champagne, comes in at \u0026pound80 a bottle - that\u0027s \u0026pound136,000 overall. Prince Charles enjoys the 15-year-old Laphroaig Scotch and the multitude of bottles of Tignanello Wine (Meghan’s personal favourite according to her old lifestyle blog, “The Tig”) so the bill really adds up. Prince Harry\u0027s fav drink comes in a little cheaper - it\u0027s a Vodka Redbull. Dress - \u0026pound300,000 Meghan is expected to rack up quite the bill with her wedding dress , which is fair enough considering all eyes will be on her. Most of the budget will go on her first dress, which will be made just for her. There\u0027s a lot of rumours as to who will design it and what it will look like, but you can expect a clean, classic look with a modern twist. A dress like this, plus her second outfit for afterwards will come in at \u0026pound300,000 plus. She\u0027s teaming it up with a tiara .  Other sources have predicted that Meghan\u0027s dress will cost far less. Royal expert Katie Nicholl, author of Harry: Life, Loss and Love, told The : “Meghan is very mindful of wanting to send the right message with her gown. “It’s going to be iconic and fit the backdrop of Windsor Castle, but it would send off the wrong message to wear a dress that in cost alone would upstage Kate’s.” Kate\u0027s dress, Sarah Burton for Alexander McQueen, came in at \u0026pound250,000. Flowers - \u0026pound110,000  This often costs more than you expect, and with two locations it\u0027ll cost even more. Flowers for the marquee alone cost cost approximately \u0026pound70,000. The flowers in St George\u0027s Chapel and at the formal reception which follows will be provided by self-taught florist Philippa Craddock. Photos - \u0026pound17,000 Cheap hey? Dorset-based Millie Pilkington, the private wedding photographer for the William and Kate’s wedding and Pippa Middleton’s, is expected to take the pics, though Hugo Burnand should also be around for the official snaps. Stationary - \u0026pound20,000  Kensington Palace has announced Barnard and Westwood made the beautiful bespoke invitations for the Royal Wedding. A 200 piece Bespoke Stationery set from Barnard and Westwood exceeds the \u0026pound10,000 mark. The invites, with the Three-Feathered Badge of the Prince of Wales printed in gold ink, could cost a total of \u0026pound200,000 for the circa 4000 invitees, including members of the public, or \u0026pound50,000 for the VIP guests alone. Music - \u0026pound300,000  That\u0027s the bell ringers, organist, choirs....then the music for the reception too. Rumours are flying around as to who will perform - from the Spice Girls to Elton John in the running, Coldplay\u0027s Chris Martin or Meghan\u0027s mate Rihanna...but there\u0027s still the church music to pay for. Trumpets - \u0026pound90,000 Yes, trumpets. The Ministry of Defence has made a request for 20 silver-plated fanfare trumpets stamped with the Royal Coat of Arms. Made in the same workshop where Will \u0026amp Kate’s wedding and the London Olympics’ trumpets came from, each bespoke trumpet costs between \u0026pound3,000 and \u0026pound6,000. Decorations - \u0026pound130,000 The lighting for the church, marquee and furniture all rack up the cost.  Wedding rings - \u0026pound6,000 Since 1923, it has been a tradition in the Royal Family to use Welsh gold for the wedding ring of the bride. Royal warrant holder Wartski, with ties to Wales, created Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge’s ring, so could be the same choice of Meghan’s.  Prince Phillip and Prince William chose not to wear a ring, but it\u0027s thought Harry will opt to follow in his father\u0027s footsteps and wear a band. Charles\u0027 is on a ring on his little finger on his left hand, but Harry may opt for the traditional fourth finger.  While Meghan isn\u0027t opting for adult bridesmaids she is having the kids as flower girls and the boys as page boys. A page boy outfit will cost around \u0026pound226 each, and flower girl dresses \u0026pound340. Groomswear – \u0026pound8,000 As a qualified Apache Helicopter Commander, Prince Harry is likely to be wearing a tailor-made Royal Air Force uniform to his wedding. He\u0027ll need to change later too, so a tuxedo or suit also needs to be bought. Hair and Makeup – \u0026pound10,000  Belgravia’s Neville Hair \u0026amp Beauty is a favourite of Meghan’s, or she may opt for Hannah Martin of Bobbi Brown and Richard Ward, who did Kate and Pippa’s wedding makeup and hair. Church Fees – \u0026pound175 The couple have to pay their fees just like everyone else.  Security - \u0026pound30m This is the most expensive elements of the day. A hefty \u0026pound30m was spent on Kate and Wills\u0027 big day so expect more of the same. While the wedding isn\u0027t in central London, there\u0027s still a huge number of members of the public attending. With the threats made against the couple ahead of the service, security is sure to be tight - with drones, snipers and undercover cops. There\u0027s a British counter-UAV system, costing \u0026pound1m, used to deactivate intruders and sneaky drones - including pap ones! Entertainment – \u0026pound55,000 This is mostly a guest. Expect the Royal Air Force to be in there somewhere, maybe some fireworks, entertainment for all those children... it all adds up The Honeymoon \u0026pound120,000  Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are reportedly heading to the exotic country of Namibia for their honeymoon . Sources have also revealed that Meghan will be the one paying for the honeymoon as gift to the Prince and that the cost will be upwards of \u0026pound100,000. Transport – Free The Queen has her own fleet of cars, she\u0027s got this.

James Shaw, whose eldest daughter, Ella, reached the talent show\u0027s semi-finals in 2015, was out with his wife during the \u0027girls-only\u0027 house party. He was supposed to be out for the night with partner Janine, but could not resist logging on to their home security system using the app. He was horrified when he saw four young men at the party - which was supposed to be \u0027girls-only\u0027 - and rushed back home to break it up.  Mr Shaw, 50, arrived to find Cameron Hull, 18, kissing one of his other daughters, and the teenager was given his marching orders, a court heard.   Hull was going to leave quietly but then realised he had forgotten his brand new jacket. When he went back to get it, he found the dad barring his entry and there was another bust-up in which Mr Shaw was punched in the face. Hull, who lives around six miles away from the Shaws\u0027 home in Langho, Lancashire, admitted assaulting the dad during the incident in March. He was handed a conditional discharge for eight months by Blackburn magistrates, and ordered to pay \u0026pound100 compensation.  Last night, the labourer claimed he and his pals did not know 21-year-old singer Ella\u0027s family lived at the home, the Daily Mail reports.   He reportedly said: We got invited to a party that night by the hostess’s friend. I did not know the name of the girl I was kissing. He added: We did not know it was Ella Shaw’s family place. Mike Church-Taylor, prosecuting, had told JPs that Mr Shaw had gone out with his wife but was keeping an eye on his home via the cam app. The prosecutor said: He saw four young men in the house and decided to go home. The four males ran from the house but the defendant then tried to get back in. Mr Shaw blocked his way and was punched in the face for his trouble. Damian Pickup, defending, said his client had never been in trouble with the police before and had been invited to the party.  He was kissing the girl when her parents returned home unexpectedly, said Mr Pickup. It is clear she had been told she could have a small party but it appears they didn\u0027t expect males to be there. My client says the girl\u0027s parents went mad and much of their anger was directed towards him because he had been kissing their daughter. Mr Shaw cornered the teenager, from Blackburn, and yelled at him before kicking him out of the house, the court heard. He realised he had left his brand new jacket in the house and returned to get it, said Mr Pickup. He was met with further aggression and accepts he punched the aggrieved in the face.

The Hollywood starlet, 36, best known for her role in hit series Suits, has wowed the world while accompanying husband-to-be Prince Harry at events across the globe. And since their engagement last November, excitement about the royal wedding has rocketed with fans, royal-watchers and media around the world fascinated by every last detail. Meghan has already given up her acting career as she prepares to become an official royal, undertaking royal duties and charity work as a full-time job. But while her life has taken a dramatic aristocratic turn, the brunette-haired beauty has far more humble roots than Prince Harry.  The actress was born to Thomas Markle Snr and Doria Ragland in 1981, who divorced in 1987 - around 10 years after first meeting. Meghan has two half siblings, Samantha and Thomas Jnr, who are the children of Thomas Snr from his first marriage to Roslyn Loveless. While Meghan\u0027s parents will attend the wedding together and her father will walk her down the aisle, her frosty relationship with her half-siblings mean they will not feature in her big day. Here, we\u0027ve taken a closer look at who Meghan Markle\u0027s family are. Doria Ragland, Meghan\u0027s age-defying yoga teacher mum  Meghan has previously gushed about her \u0027free spirit\u0027 yoga instructor mum, Doria Ragland, who lives in Los Angeles and rocks dreadlocks and a nose ring. We first got a glimpse of Doria at the Invictus Games last October. After 17 months of keeping a low profile while dating, Harry and Meghan stepped out together for their first properly public display of affection - and she brought her mum too. Meghan\u0027s mum is in her early 60s, but her youthful complexion makes her look more like a sister than a mother to Markle. Born in 1956, Doria later became a social worker and yoga instructor in California, and the latter might give us a clue to her age-defying physique. She met Meghan\u0027s lighting director dad while working as an assistant make-up artist at ABC television. They married in 1979 and Meghan arrived in August 1981. The couple were to split citing irreconcilable differences when their daughter was just six. Meghan has previously revealed that her African-American mum used to be mistaken for her nanny, and that she was once called the N-word because she wasn’t pulling out of a parking space quickly enough for another driver. My dad is Caucasian and my mom is African American. I’m half black and half white, Meghan wrote in an essay for Elle magazine. Being biracial paints a blurred line that is equal parts staggering and illuminating. While my mixed heritage may have created a grey area surrounding my self-identification, keeping me with a foot on both sides of the fence, I have come to embrace that. To say who I am, to share where I’m from, to voice my pride in being a strong, confident mixed-race woman.” Doria will be playing an important part in the royal wedding, accompanying Meghan in the bridal car on her way to the ceremony at St George\u0027s Chapel, Windsor Castle. Thomas Markle Snr, the reclusive dad who\u0027ll walk her down the aisle  Meghan\u0027s father was a workaholic who already had two children from his first marriage to Roslyn Loveless when he met Doria. According to his son Thomas Jnr, his life was to change when Meghan came along. “Before then, dad’s work took priority over everything, but she became his whole world,” he said. I remember when she came home from the hospital, he had decorated the bathroom with little angels and fairies. Like his daughter, Thomas Snr worked in entertainment, winning awards for his lighting direction. He worked on iconic America shows including Married with Children and General Hospital. The family\u0027s situation was to improve when Thomas Snr won \u0026pound560,000 on the lottery. This allowed Meghan to be privately educated, and she regularly visited the TV sets were her father worked, including Married With Children. “There I was, behind the scenes of a glossy soap opera and a TV sitcom, surrounded by famous actors and their glam teams, multi-million dollar budgets, and crew lunches that always included filet mignon and enough sweets to make you think you were at Willy Wonka’s Chocolate Factory, Meghan on her blog, The Tig.  Thomas Snr\u0027s split from Doria was bitter and he decided to leave LA for Mexico after declaring himself bankrupt with credit card debts of \u0026pound24,180. He now lives a reclusive existence near Rosarito Beach. There had been some debate about whether Meghan\u0027s 73-year-old dad would be lured from his retreat to walk her down the aisle. But Kensington Palace has confirmed he will be at her side on her big day. Thomas Snr will meet son-in-law to-be Prince Harry for the first time in the week before the wedding. Meghan\u0027s parents will also spend time with the Queen and Prince Philip, Prince Charles, Camilla and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.  Thomas Markle Jnr shares his moniker with his father, Thomas Snr. He was 14 when Meghan was born after his father met Doria Ragland in the late 1970s. Thomas Jnr then grew up in the same household as his father, sister Samantha, step-mother Doria and half sister Meghan. Now living in Oregon, the window fitter is married to Darlene Blout and has two sons of his own. While the world will watch his father walk Meghan down the aisle on May 19, Thomas Jnr will not attend the Royal wedding. The 51-year-old has reportedly battled alcohol issues in the past and was arrested in 2017 for threatening his wife with a gun. Thomas exclusively spoke to the Daily Mirror about the frosty relationship with Meghan. He said he was left \u0027deeply hurt\u0027 by the royal wedding snub and that fame had changed the American actress. Thomas Jnr said: She’s clearly forgotten her roots. It’s torn my entire family apart. He added: Meg likes to portray herself as a humanitarian, a people’s person and a charitable person but she is none of those things to her family. She is giving the greatest \u0026shyperformance of her life. She is acting phoney. Once she got into Hollywood she turned into a different person. He has gone so far as to write an open letter urging Harry to call of the wedding before it is too late. Thomas Jnr was a little kinder during an interview he gave just after the news of the couple\u0027s relationship emerged. It was just obvious from day one that she was destined to be somewhere really big. She\u0027s always been a princess. She\u0027s carried herself on that level from day one.” Thomas Jnr is currently estranged from his full sister Samantha, who he believes is trying to ride Meghan’s coattails. She\u0027s battered this whole Meghan thing since day one and she\u0027s obviously doing this for her little flash in the pan fame and fortune. Telling the whole world about her pushy princess sister, which is just horrible [and] not even true,” he said. Samantha Grant, the step-sister who\u0027s writing a tell-all book  Samantha Grant - born Yvonne - lives in Florida and has three children. She lived with Doria, Thomas Snr and her brother during Meghan\u0027s early years. But like her brother, she now has a difficult relationship with the bride-to-be and will not be at the wedding. Now a writer and counsellor, she is confined to a wheelchair after being diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 2008 The 53-year-old claims she has not spoken to her half-sister for three years. All hell broke loose when she revealed plans to write a tell-all book entitled The Diary of Princess Pushy\u0027s sister. She has also accused Meghan of behavior \u0027not befitting of a Royal family member\u0027 and accused her half-sister of distancing herself after the MS diagnosis.  However, Samantha did have some positive things to say during an interview with Good Morning Britain. She\u0027s very strong she\u0027s very worldly and educated, graceful, Samantha told the show, discussing Meghan\u0027s future royal role as Harry’s wife. I think she will absolutely be a compliment to her role and I think the public will be surprised by how graceful and lovely she is. Despite the animosity, Samantha wanted a royal wedding invitation. She is not believed to have received one. Tyler Dooley, the cannabis farmer nephew  Meghan Markle\u0027s 25-year-old nephew has revealed he is a proud cannabis farmer who will reportedly make a special potent batch of the drug called Markle\u0027s Sparkle. Tyler lives in Oregon, where recreational marijuana was made legal in 2015. Reports say Tyler is proud of being part of the industry, which remains illegal in the UK. The 25-year-old, who remembered being babysat by Meghan when he was a kid, told the Daily Mail : We are passionate about marijuana and all the good things it brings. Prince Harry enjoys a good party. I’d be happy to show them around if they ever come out here and educate them on the medicinal benefits of marijuana which helps everything from post-traumatic stress syndrome to insomnia to pain in cancer patients. Tyler, the son of Meghan’s half-brother Thomas Markle Jr, reportedly tried his first joint at high school but says he no longer uses the drug. Since it was made legal in his state, Tyler got involved in the business and is paid a commission for sales and marketing jobs.  Frederick Markle, the \u0027recluse\u0027 bishop uncle with a \u0027congregation of one\u0027 Frederick Markle, 75, is the brother of Meghan’s dad, but their lives couldn’t be more different. While Thomas’s career too him to Hollywood, Frederick’s took him to Sanford, Florida, where he runs a ramshackle chapel and goes by the name Bishop Dismas. But despite being the leader of the Eastern Orthodox Catholic Church, he’s reportedly a recluse who can’t even work a mobile phone. “He is basically a real friendly guy but he doesn’t go for new ideas. He lives like a hermit. He’s got a cellphone but he can’t figure out how to switch it on. As for emails and computers, that’s all Greek to him,” a source said. However, while it attracted a congregation of around 40 in the eighties, these days reports claim that the only person who visits the church is the Bishop himself.

Meghan has two half siblings, Samantha and Thomas Junior, who are the children of Thomas Senior from his first marriage to Roslyn Loveless. Her half-brother, however, has been in the spotlight recently, mostly down to his predictions the \u0026pound32m wedding won\u0027t end well. But who is Thomas Markle Jnr?  The half-brother of Meghan Markle, who share the same dad Thomas Markle Snr , may not have the best relationship with the future royal, but it wasn\u0027t always that way.  He was 14 when Meghan was born in 1981 after his father met Doria Ragland in the late 1970s. Thomas Jnr then grew up in the same household as his father, sister Samantha, step-mother Doria and half sister Meghan. Now living in Grant\u0027s Pass, Oregon, the window fitter is married to Darlene Blout and has two sons of his own.  While the world will watch his father walk Meghan down the aisle on May 19, Thomas Jnr will not attend her and Prince Harry \u0027s wedding. The 51-year-old has reportedly battled alcohol issues in the past and was arrested in 2017 for threatening his wife with a gun. On growing up with Meghan Meghan\u0027s father was a workaholic who already had two children from his first marriage to Roslyn Loveless when he met Doria. According to his son Thomas Jnr, his life was to change when Meghan came along. “Before then, dad’s work took priority over everything, but she became his whole world,” he said. I remember when she came home from the hospital, he had decorated the bathroom with little angels and fairies.  His rocky relationship with Meghan Thomas has previously spoken exclusively to the Daily Mirror about the frosty relationship with Meghan. He said he was left \u0027deeply hurt\u0027 by the royal wedding snub and that fame had changed the American actress.  Thomas Jnr said: She’s clearly forgotten her roots. It’s torn my entire family apart. He added: Meg likes to portray herself as a humanitarian, a people’s person and a charitable person but she is none of those things to her family. She is giving the greatest \u0026shyperformance of her life. She is acting phoney. Once she got into Hollywood she turned into a different person.  He told Harry to call the wedding off in a letter In an explosive open letter to Prince Harry, dated April 26, Thomas slammed his half-sister as a jaded, shallow and conceited woman. He blasted the wedding as a fake fairytale that would make a joke of you [Prince Harry] and the royal family heritage.  The letter, shared with In Touch Weekly magazine, reads: As more time passes to your royal wedding, it becomes very clear that this is the biggest mistake in royal wedding history. Meghan is obviously not the right woman for you, the letter continues. I\u0027m confused why you don’t see the real Meghan that the whole world now sees. Meghan\u0027s attempt to act the part of a princess like a below C average Hollywood actress is getting old.  He also claimed their father is struggling financially after paying Meghan’s way at the start of her acting career and getting into debt. What kind of person starts out by using her own father until he\u0027s bankrupt, then forgets about him in Mexico leaving him broke, over mostly all her debts, the letter continued. And when it\u0027s time to pay him back she forgets her own father like she never knew him. It\u0027s very apparent that her tiny bit of Hollywood fame has gone to her head. Not to mention, to top it all off, she doesn\u0027t invite her own family and instead invites complete strangers to the wedding. Who does that?  Mr Markle finished with: Meghan is still my sister. She is family. So whatever happens is up to her, whether she wants to forget knowing me or the rest of her family, family comes first. Also, you would think that a royal wedding would bring a torn family closer together, but I guess we\u0027re all distant family to Meg. So... Is he invited to the wedding? According to numerous reports, he has not been invited to the wedding, with Meghan allegedly describing him as \u0027distant family.\u0027 Speaking to InTouch he said: “My attorney was reaching out to her people and the palace to basically [help us] try to get a retraction for all these false stories in [countries] where there are different laws.” He added: My lawyer had a phone meeting with her lawyer, and he emailed me some of [Meghan’s] direct words.  She said, ‘That’s distant family and I don’t know those people.’ That’s pretty harsh.” Mr Markle labelled her response as a “slap in the face” but admitted that the pair had not been in touch since Meghan moved to Toronto, Canada in 2011.  However, Thomas Jnr had said after news of the couple\u0027s relationship emerged that he had hoped to be invited to the wedding - and also hoped to invited his half-sister and Harry to his upcoming nuptials. He said at the time: It was just obvious from day one that she was destined to be somewhere really big. She\u0027s always been a princess. She\u0027s carried herself on that level from day one.” And he also defended Meghan, while slating his currently estranged full sister Samantha, who he believes is trying to ride Meghan’s coattails. She\u0027s battered this whole Meghan thing since day one and she\u0027s obviously doing this for her little flash in the pan fame and fortune. Telling the whole world about her pushy princess sister, which is just horrible [and] not even true,” he said.  His arrest and relationship with fiancee Darlene Thomas is due to get married himself this year to fiancee Darlene but the pair have had a tumultuous relationship. Darlene was arrested on New Year\u0027s Eve for allegedly attacking him in a drunken row . Thomas\u0027s fiancee Darlene spent last New Year\u0027s in jail after reportedly getting into a violent, drunken row with him. Police were called to the couple\u0027s home in Grants Pass, Oregon, around 20 minutes before midnight on December 31.  Darlene was booked on a charge of fourth-degree assault but prosecutors declined to take it any further. However, the charges were not pursued after Tom declined to assist. The year before, he was arrested on suspicion of holding a gun to his partner\u0027s head during another argument last year. The case was also dropped after Darlene refused to press charges. Speaking of his relationship with Darlene, he said: “I did get into to some trouble. It was a domestic altercation. The case was even dropped before it went to court. Darlene and I have always loved each other. “Darlene and I were actually made for each other so on her birthday we actually got engaged.

And former neighbour Julie Bushby, 48, did get a punch during their Bank Holiday reunion this week – a playful one on her arm as the pair bantered. Matthews, 43, told her: “I don’t hate you. You weren’t lying, just saying it as it was. In fact, I love you to bits.” Julie helped to get Matthews to confess to her part in daughter Shannon’s 2008 disappearance. She was in a police car with her, officer Christine Freeman and her pal Natalie Brown when the shamed mum admitted what she knew. Julie, a former chairman of the \u0026shyresidents association where the pair lived in Dewsbury Moor, West Yorks, then gave evidence against her at her trial – and the judge praised her for her honesty.  As Matthews, who served four years of an eight-year jail sentence, met her in a park at the weekend, she said: “She’s been my friend from day one and she’s the only one who didn’t betray me when others did. I don’t hate her at all for it. “She just did what Julie does, she was straight and honest.” Reviled Matthews spoke to the Mirror this week in a bid to prove to the nation that she is not evil.  She even offered to take a lie detector test about what happened to Shannon, who was found tied to a bed at accomplice Michael Donovan’s flat after a month-long search. Yet Matthews still denies her part in the sickening kidnap plot to cash in on the \u0026pound50,000 reward money. And pointing to other vile criminals, the mum-of-seven claims she was made a “scapegoat”, saying: “I’m not Britain’s worst mum. I didn’t kill anybody. Baby P’s mum and Maxine Carr don’t get the abuse I do.” Matthews did not recognise Julie until she said in her broad Yorkshire accent: “Hello, stranger.” Meeting at a secret location in the southern town she now lives in, Matthews told Julie: “It’s weird seeing you, it’s strange. But I’ve missed you.” The pair hugged before Julie, in her typical no-nonsense manner, challenged Matthews over fresh allegations about her having a 72-year-old sugar daddy and ripping off homeless people – which she denies. Julie teased: “So what’s this about you sh*gging an old man? You like them older, Karen, don’t ya! D’ya remember when you went out with [names a man], he was in his 60s or 70s.”  “I don’t remember him,” Matthews said, looking outraged. “But none of it’s true, Julie. He’s just a friend from work and I’m just so lonely and he was somebody to talk to. He’s nice to me.” She grimaced and pretended to be sick when asked if she had slept with him, saying: “I’m not interested in men at all. And I wouldn’t con homeless people. I’ve got a good heart really.” Leaving the park, the pair browsed charity shops together and popped into Poundstretcher. As they took a pleasure boat trip, Matthews waved to Bank Holiday sunbathers on the river bank while discussing her trial and catching up with gossip from her former home. Matthews told how she had never been on a boat before and Julie joked: “It’s all right, it might be your first and last time. I might throw you overboard!” Julie had to apologise frequently for forgetting to call Matthews by her new name, with the disgraced mum \u0026shyrepeatedly saying: “I don’t know her.” Matthews talked about her hobbies and told Julie how she enjoyed playing a colour by numbers game on her phone.  Julie laughed and said: “Anybody can colour in f***ing boxes, you want to try the real cross stitch. It’s very therapeutic.” As they passed luxurious back gardens along the river, Matthews said: “I wouldn’t like to live there, you’d have to fence it all off to keep the kids safe.” Julie, who was portrayed by Sheridan Smith in The Moorside, asked if Matthews had watched the hit BBC drama. “I did see bits of it but I didn’t like how they played me,” she said. She then added with a giggle: “But I thought that woman played you real good, Julie.” However, her smile vanished when the chat became more serious. Matthews told of her regrets at having missed her brother’s funeral because she was in jail, and her dad’s last year. And of mum June, who lives alone in West Yorkshire, she said: “She was a good mum, she did her best but we’re not in touch.” As the talk returned to her trial over Shannon’s kidnap, she said: “When they said ‘guilty’ to me in court, I was confused because I’d pleaded ‘not guilty!’. I hated sitting next to him [co-defendant Michael Donovan] in court. And then I got the same sentence as him and he’d drugged her. How can that happen?” Asked if she misses Dewsbury, she said: “I wouldn’t go back to Dewsbury, there’s nothing for me there... only Julie.” Julie laughed and said: “That’s all right, ’cos Dewsbury wouldn’t have you back anyway!” Mum-of-three Julie, who has seven grandchildren, is still living on the \u0026shyMoorside estate. She and Matthews were not best friends before Shannon vanished but knew each other and were at the same parenting classes. When Shannon went missing, Julie was one of the first people to offer help – organising the search, handing out posters and gathering people for candlelit vigils.

The driver was seriously injured after the HGV crashed into the central reservation and overturned.  Twelve tonnes of the chocolate oozed out all over the road and quickly started to harden, with firefighters saying it was worse than ice and snow to remove.  The smash completely closed the A2 motorway between Poznan and Konin, in Poland, much to the outrage of motorists.  Police spokeswoman Marlena Kukawska said:The driver of a lorry carrying milk chocolate for unknown reasons hit the barriers on the motorway that caused an overturn of the container lorry and spilled around the sweet liquid on all lanes. The traffic jams caused by the accident are enormous as it\u0027s one of the country\u0027s main motorways. We organised diversions and keep asking drivers for their patience and understanding.

The appalling story made headlines around the globe after the children\u0027s parents were arrested. But what happened to the family since January? Parents Louise and David Turpin are now facing 42 charges including torture, false imprisonment and child abuse after allegedly shackling their children to a bed in California. The pair are accused of subjecting their brood to frequent beatings and even strangulation over the decades they were kept locked up in filthy conditions. The children had so little contact with the outside world, one reportedly didn\u0027t know what a police officer was.  When officers discovered their filthy living conditions at their home in Perris, in January this year, they were horrified. David Turpin 57, and Louise Turpin, 49, began tying the children up as a punishment many years ago, according to prosecutors. It allegedly began with one of the boys being tied to the bed with rope, but when he escaped they started using padlocks and chains to control their children. What happened to the Turpin children?  Police discovered the Turpin children living in horrifying conditions, with three children chained to a bed in Perris, California. The horrifying scenes were uncovered in January when one of the 13 children, aged 17, escaped before making a desperate bid to inform someone of the siblings left locked up. Seven of the Turpin\u0027s 12 remaining children in captivity were adults, with all their ages ranging from two to 29. The conditions in the filthy four-bedroom Perris home were said to be dark and foul smelling and the children and young adults were malnourished and dirty after years of captivity. District Attorney Mike Hestrin said: All 13 of the victims and defendants would typically sleep all day and be up through the night.  Starting many years ago, the victims would be tied up as punishment. These punishments would last for weeks or even months at a time. Police arrested both parents who are facing a total of 42 charges with a preliminary hearing scheduled for June 20. Several of the children were said to have cognitive impairment and nerve damage from extreme and prolonged physical abuse. Attorney Mike Hestrin added: None of victims were allowed to shower more than once a year. What happened to the children after their rescue?  Following their rescue, the children were taken to a police station where they were given food and drinks after they told officers they were starving. They were then taken to different hospitals for treatment and to be given to chance to wash. Police said the parents “were unable to immediately provide a logical reason why their children were restrained in that manner. After recovering in hospital, CNN reported the children are now happy living in three separate homes in Riverside County. Six of the children are minors and seven are adults.  The adults spent time in recovery at the Corona Regional Medical Centre hospital for two months. The centre\u0027s CEO Mark Uffer spoke about the moment they left hospital, saying There were some tears flowing, both for the staff and the Turpin children, he said. They said they loved us, they were going to miss us, they hoped to see us soon., reports CNN . All seven adults are now living in a home together. Two of the youngest children were put into foster care, while the remaining four are at another home after authorities struggled to find accommodation for all six together. The children are reportedly regularly in touch via Skype. How were the children discovered?  The children were discovered when a 17-year-old girl plotted her escape alongside others help in captivity. Early one Sunday morning, she climbed out of a window with a one of the younger children, before the younger child became frightened and turned back. The teenager managed to alert police by that 12 of her siblings remained in captivity. She used a deactivated mobile phone to call 911. Police at the time mistook her for a child aged around 10 due to her severe malnourishment.

A great player, he has to show that in this type of game.“I was not unsatisfied with his performance (on Tuesday) because he has come back from a long journey from injury.“It was not easy to make him fit physically.“He played 90 minutes and he was a good player for us.”United are set to go in tomorrow with no fresh injury worries from the first game.And defender Mark Durnan could be added to the squad after stepping up his training this week after suffering from a swollen ankle.He’s been out since the win over league champions St Mirren early last month.Tickets for tonight are on general sale from the club shop at Tannadice.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5aead4c788077-791x564.jpg ","title":"scott fraser backs dundee united to finish the job against dunfermline","story":"\t\t\t\t\tHis gaffer insists the opposition are favourites but Scott Fraser believes Dundee United will go on and claim victory in tonight\u0026#8217s play-off quarter-final second leg against Dunfermline at Tannadice.Looking back at Tuesday’s goalless first leg at East End Park, the midfielder feels it was a result that could have been even better but also might have been worse.And, ultimately, the fact the draw was an outcome the Tangerines would have accepted before kick-off means, for him, it was a case of job done on the night.Well, part one at least and now he’s intent on finishing it off in the right fashion.“It could have been a win on Tuesday but before the game we would have taken a goalless draw,” he said. “With the run they’ve been on it is always a hard place to come, so the draw isn’t bad.Dundee United and Dunfermline battled out a 0-0 draw in the first leg.“When they go down to 10 men in the second half, obviously, we think that is maybe our chance to nick a goal and come back to Tannadice ahead in the tie.“We had chances and didn’t convert, so we’re a bit disappointed in that sense but they had chances as well and, in the end, the draw was probably a fair result.“When they went down to 10 men there were a couple of boys out on the pitch mentioned it was about being patient from then on.“Fans tend to think it’s easy when you have a man advantage, but sometimes it becomes harder because teams just sit in and try to hold on to what they’ve got.“That’s what Dunfermline did and fair play to them, they did it well. Now, though, we will fancy our chances going back to Tannadice.”And Fraser believes the United playing surface will give them an added advantage in the second leg.“It was a typical play-off. There’s a lot of pressure on teams in these situations and you know winning or losing can come down to small margins, so it was all a bit frantic at times.“We were trying to get our game going on a pitch that wasn’t great, so that was difficult and it suited them to put the ball in behind and run.“Tannadice should suit us better because our surface there is good and we can pass the ball. We’ll water the pitch and that will suit us when we get the ball down and try to pass it out from the back.”He’s also in no doubt knowledge gained from previous play-offs also has to give them an edge.“We do have a few boys who were in the play-offs last year with us or have played in them for other teams in the past and that helps. We know what to expect and how to handle it.“Last year at this stage we went down to Morton and got a good result, then came back to Tannadice and won well and we’ll be looking to do the same again tonight.“We’ve also got a lot of experienced boys like Scott McDonald, Bilel Mohsni and Willo Flood and they’re all a big help.”After his long injury lay-off because of well-documented problems with a broken foot, starting two games in three days will be a challenge, but he reckons he’s back to 100% fitness.“I’ve been working hard on it over the past couple of weeks and I was happy with the way I got through the 90 minutes on Tuesday.“We had the wee break last week in terms of no midweek game for a change and that meant I was able to put in some good work in training.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"scottish football pays tribute to legendary dundee football writer ron scott","story":"\t\t\t\t\tScottish football has paid tribute to a respected and popular Dundee sports writer  who has died after a short illness.Ron Scott, a former chief football writer at the Sunday Post passed away in Ninewells Hospital on Sunday.
