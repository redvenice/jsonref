Only Boris Johnson can save us.\u0027       Born in Southampton to second-generation Indian Punjabi parents, Mr Sunak has spoken publicly about how his father, a GP, and his mother, who is a pharmacist, had to make sacrifices to send him to Winchester College. He is pictured with his wife, Akshata, and their children The timing was crucial. It came as many Tory MPs were muttering behind closed doors that they did not feel Boris was a winner.But Mr Sunak\u0027s intervention showed that Boris had won over some of the brightest of the young generation of Tory MPs.And so, when Boris proved victorious, Mr Sunak was rewarded by being dramatically promoted to Chief Secretary to the Treasury.\u0027Rishi\u0027s job was to make sure northern voters aren\u0027t just on loan to us, but that they stay permanently with us,\u0027 said one source last night. \u0027He\u0027s now in the right job to carry on that work.\u0027Born in Southampton to second-generation Indian Punjabi parents, Mr Sunak has spoken publicly about how his father, a GP, and his mother, who is a pharmacist, had to make sacrifices to send him to Winchester College, where fees are currently £41,000 a year.While he is fiercely proud of his Indian and Hindu heritage, he regards Britain as his home.

He later set up his own business, Theleme Partners, in 2010 with an initial fund of £536million.

But whether Mr Sunak will have had time to revel in his palatial home in recent months is unlikely, as Mr Johnson has grown increasingly dependent on him.An assured media performer, Mr Sunak was one of only a handful of ministers who were trusted by 10 Downing Street to take to the airwaves during the recent election. He also stood in for Boris during some of the campaign\u0027s seven-way TV debates.But while he rarely slips up on policy, in truth Mr Sunak is not a brilliant orator, with one critic in the Labour-supporting Guardian branding him \u0027cheesy and wooden\u0027.         When grilled in a recent podcast by BBC presenter Nick Robinson about his professed love for Star Wars, Mr Sunak – who is also a devoted supporter of Southampton football club – batted off every question with ease But he radiates self-confidence and is never caught short when interviewers ask him about a hinterland beyond politics. When grilled in a recent podcast by BBC presenter Nick Robinson about his professed love for Star Wars, Mr Sunak – who is also a devoted supporter of Southampton football club – batted off every question with ease.He also admitted that he\u0027s a Coca-Cola addict and has \u0027seven fillings to show for it\u0027.Whether his amicable demeanour will be enough for him to thrive in one of Britain\u0027s Great Offices of State is yet to be seen.Indeed, his first big test will be next month\u0027s Budget.

Come and have a look yourself. Whoever painted, it’s worth admiring their creativity. Thank you.”The Banksy expert John Brandler said he believed the piece may well be by the elusive artist.“I would say it’s a Banksy,” he said. Brandler added that the piece had the sparsity and simplicity of the best Banksys. “I think it’s lovely.”Banksy often confirms his artworks by posting images of them on Instagram or his website but there is sometimes a lag between a work appearing and his endorsement.Kelly Woodruff, who co-owns the property on the corner of Marsh Lane and Avonvale Road, said: “It arrived on our wall overnight. I got tagged into Facebook with someone saying, is this your property?“And we were like, ‘woah it is’. We are super excited, obviously, and it’s my dad’s birthday today so we are very excited to have such a brilliant birthday gift.

First thing’s first is to maybe get some Perspex to preserve it so everyone can enjoy it and then try to get some professional advice.

Sometimes it doesn’t feel like the working day ever truly ends: the very thought – or threat – of an email pinging into your inbox means your free time isn’t really free at all. This shared experience makes Rebecca Long-Bailey’s recent announcement of a proposed policy enshrining the “right to disconnect” welcome. Perhaps for the first time in this fairly underwhelming Labour leadership election, we can point to something concrete and say “that’s a good idea” or “I’d want that in my workplace”.In 1886, factory workers in the US campaigning for an eight-hour day rallied around the slogan “Eight hours for work, eight hours for rest, and eight hours for what we will”. Today digital devices have eroded these hard-fought distinctions. The right to disconnect – which is simply the right for employees not to be contacted outside of office hours by their boss – largely speaks for itself. It’s an idea that could have profound effects on people working in occupations where a phone has become an electronic leash that employers can pull at any time. Putting an end to the toxic expectations of connectedness would allow us to reclaim the mental space to enjoy our evenings and weekends.Digital disconnection is currently a privilege. Paying attendees can take part in “digital detox” retreats, handing over their phones and laptops to enjoy an “off-the-grid” experience cut off from the flurry of communication. A universal right to disconnect would open up this possibility to everyone. Here’s the kicker: it might sound radical, but France already adopted a similar policy in 2017, which requires companies with more than 50 employees to draw up a charter that sets out times when staff should not send or answer emails. The Italian government introduced a similar law in the same year.This is a significant problem in the UK, where workload pressure is the single greatest cause of work-related illnesses. Employees in Britain already work among the longest hours and have the fewest national holidays compared with their European counterparts. A right to disconnect would empower workers to say no to the expectation of being “always on”. It would also bring back something that many of us have perhaps forgotten: the right to say no. As we move into a more digital world of email, WhatsApp and flexible working, work and life blend in new and uncomfortable ways. We need to update how we react to these changes. Though some jobs genuinely require an out-of-hours capacity, overtime should be remunerated or taken off as time in lieu.New employee rights fit for our digital economy could be the building blocks for a complete reimagination of our working culture. Part of creating a more sustainable society will involve critically examining the kind of work that takes place within it. When Franklin D Roosevelt set about confronting the twin economic and environmental crises of the Great Depression and the dust bowl, he included labour protections as a key part of his New Deal. The Wagner Act strengthened workers’ collective bargaining rights, allowing them to negotiate better working conditions, and the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 set maximum hours and minimum wages.Almost 100 years on from this pivotal legislation, the rights of working people have barely changed, but communications technology has dissolved the boundary between contracted and non-contracted hours. It’s time our political leaders recognised this, and provided a rulebook fit for purpose.• Will Stronge is co-director of the thinktank Autonomy"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b93fdcc648869363fe49a34869c02983082836ad/1053_131_2410_1446/master/2410.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f2dac84376f1b7288056817d9cfb9647","title":"oliver dowden new culture secretary bbc","story":"The new culture secretary will make seismic decisions on the national broadcaster and shape the future of British viewershipIn today’s cabinet reshuffle, the future of the BBC was placed in the hands of a politician who, in his maiden parliamentary speech in 2015, boasted that EastEnders characters Phil Mitchell and Ian Beale were his constituents. Oliver Dowden, the new culture secretary, even referred to himself as “the member of parliament for Albert Square”, the fictional setting of BBC1’s cockney soap.Dowden’s justification for this fantasy was that his Hertsmere constituency in Hertfordshire contains the BBC studio centre in Elstree, where shows including EastEnders and Strictly Come Dancing are filmed.However, BBC employees, and those currently applying to be the next director general, should not assume that this local connection gives them any advantage at a time when the future funding and scope of the corporation feels subject to aggressive government scrutiny. In a recent video post on his Twitter feed, recorded outside the BBC Studios, Dowden celebrated the news that Sky is building a huge broadcasting complex nearby.Such a neat fit between a secretary of state and their new portfolio is unusual, and unlikely to have been accidental. For a Johnson administration often obsessed with “optics” – how government actions look, rather than what they accomplish – there is a symbolic neatness in appointing an MP with those public service and commercial TV behemoths on his patch to a job in which his biggest task will be to shape the future for UK viewers.In first setting the level of the licence fee for the five years from 2022, and then starting discussions about a new BBC royal charter from 2027, Dowden will have to decide between a media environment that would be cheered on the EastEnders set – a BBC with the money and power it has now – or one that might more please the Murdoch-created and American-owned Sky: smaller, poorer, more exposed to market forces. With a 21,313 majority in Hertsmere, there is also no risk of the culture secretary being accused – as has happened to some politicians over HS2, for example – of tailoring his positions to avoid losing votes.On 1 April, Dowden will receive the responses to the recently launched public consultation on the decriminalisation of the TV licence fee. The government’s reaction to the results of this survey, scheduled for early summer, will give the first indication of how tough Dowden may be on the BBC.If criminal prosecution remains a possible consequence of failing to meet a fine for non-payment of the licence fee, then the prime minister and his peculiar Downing Street supremo, Dominic Cummings – a longtime critic of the BBC’s structure and content – will be seen to have pulled back from their most disruptive ambitions. (As they have resiled from suggestions after the December general election that the department for Digital Culture Media and Sport might itself disappear in a reorganisation of Whitehall departments.)However, if licence fee evasion becomes downgraded to a civil offence, then the incoming director general will fear the imminent negotiations over the level and existence of the licence fee. Building a working relationship with Dowden will be an urgent task.Apart from the appointment of the member for Elstree to preside over the future of TV, there is other evidence that this reshuffle has been more carefully planned than most.PMs generally have only 24-36 hours to construct their cabinets. However, Johnson’s and Cummings’s decision to keep most of the old cabinet in place from 13 December, until Brexit was “done” at the end of January, with DCMS incumbent Nicky Morgan carrying on from the Lord’s as Baroness Morgan of Cotes, means that both Downing Street and the appointees have had time to think.When a culture secretary is announced, reporters traditionally read back across the newbie’s Twitter feed for clues to their cultural appetites and instincts – and often find the entries eerily free of relevant references.With Dowden, though, there is a strong suggestion that he has known for a while which job was coming. Last month, on a tour of Scotland in his previous role as minister for the Cabinet Office, he visited Aberdeen Art Gallery, and wrote a newspaper article praising the V\u0026ampA in Dundee and hymning the importance of the Edinburgh fringe.This eases his entry to the brief. But the test will be what does in office. In his first official tweet in his new job, Dowden preached the importance of the national improvement of broadband, which also comes in his red box. But the self-styled “MP for Albert Square” will ultimately be judged on what happens to the organisation that makes EastEnders. Dowden will hope to say of the BBC, in a favourite Mitchell brother expression, “Sorted!” His problem is that sorting the corporation means so many different things to so many interested parties."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/507cfc290093c9d60d2337b27f818a93d05faac5/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d478165016a119a0826dbe6146caadc5","title":"i was told id never make it how one man went from factory floor to a professional engineer at network rail","story":"Alison Thompson is practice manager at Network Rail.

I support graduates from induction through to their first appointment at the end of our two-year programme, helping them align their objectives to the Engineering Council’s UK Standard for Professional Engineering Competence (UK-Spec) and making clear what’s expected of them. Graduates sign up to a training agreement which helps them work towards qualifying as chartered or incorporated engineers. My role is to help them achieve a broad experience across the company to further them on that training journey.So they’re working towards a professional accreditation?Yes. You may have a degree but that does not make you an experienced and competent engineer. A professional qualification as a chartered engineer or an incorporated engineer is recognised on the world stage.How did you find Andrew?He applied for our graduate scheme through our national recruitment campaign. He put himself through a degree with the OU, which he self-funded while working full-time. It’s very admirable. He’s had to work incredibly hard to get here.Do OU students stand out from other graduates?Definitely. A mature student who has chosen to study while working and taking care of a family often has a different mindset to a young person with little work experience.Does his drive to succeed impact his work?Absolutely, yes. Andrew is originally from Doncaster but accepted a place on our graduate programme in Milton Keynes and that’s another sign of his commitment – his willingness to spend time away from his family in order to achieve his aim. He has now taken up a permanent position in York so it worked out really well for him in the end. His attitude made him stand out.How?He was very quick to understand that he needed to build a professional network, and he did so very successfully. He went to every extra-curricular event he could, whereas not all graduates apply themselves to all the opportunities available to them. He also made some major changes to the way track maintenance is done, and these have been rolled out across the company.What were you doing before working for Network Rail?I’d been working in a factory that makes ingredients for pet food for eight years and I had one of those epiphany moments. I didn’t want to become an old man and look back and think that’s all that I ever did. When you’re earning good money, it’s difficult to make a change but I felt I had more to give than that.How did you engage with the OU?I chanced upon it, really. I was at my mum’s house and my sister and brother-in-law had a load of textbooks. They’d started courses with the OU so I asked them about it. We weren’t on a ton of money and my wife wasn’t working but I funded it myself.How did your company react to you becoming a student?As part of studying engineering, you’re supposed to look for mentorship and try to get hands-on experience so I went to speak to the engineering manager but, by the end of the conversation, he basically told me he didn’t think I’d ever make an engineer. They wouldn’t even release me to attend my final exams each year I had to take annual leave.It must have been difficult to motivate yourself without supportSomething like that can push you one of two ways. You either think: “I’m going to show him he’s wrong”, or you throw it in. I’m the kind of person that if someone tells me I can’t do something – unless it’s actually physically or technically impossible – I’m going to give it a try. I think that’s why I stayed the course.How long did it take you to complete your degree?Six years studying part-time (eight hours per week minimum) while working full-time days and nights in 12-hour shifts. I’d want to employ anyone who does that!How did you manage?One of the big things I learned was time management. There have been times when the family are out in the garden with the paddling pool and I’m at the kitchen table studying. And in the canteen, while all the other lads were playing cards, I was sat in the corner reading a book.What happened when you graduated?When I got to the end of my studies, I needed to make it all pay off. A lot of engineering jobs ask for three years’ experience, which I didn’t have, and there weren’t that many jobs going due to the recession. I looked for information on graduate schemes and decided to apply for one a day until I got something. I applied for the Network Rail graduate scheme and did online testing and a video interview and then I got invited to a graduate assessment centre in Glasgow.How did it go?I got a response saying I hadn’t been selected but they’d put me on the shortlist. A few weeks later, they phoned me up and offered me a place on the graduate scheme based in Milton Keynes.So your drive to learn has helped you to continue achieving?That’s engineering though, isn’t it? If there’s a problem and it can be solved, that’s what you’re driven to do. People say there’s no social mobility any more but I come from a working class background and I got my hands dirty for 14 years making pet food. Now I am an asset engineer providing a track engineering support service. But if people hadn’t taken the time to sit down and have those conversations with me … I’m thankful to Network Rail and the OU for helping me get here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b24bd31aeef5d02d7d371734887897115417541f/0_85_2121_1273/master/2121.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=142ccec2e91f595f6480ae981869d7e5","title":"can distance learning help to future proof workers","story":"Distance learning involves discipline and often digital-first thinking. In our rapidly changing world, these may be the skills employers needWhat makes a graduate employable? Those hiring want recruits with the right skills and knowledge, of course, but employers are discovering that other qualities such as tenacity, effective team working and digital dexterity are as – if not more – important as what someone studied. And distance learners are proving a valuable source of work-ready candidates who embody the traits organisations need now and for the roles of tomorrow.Over the past year, two-thirds of UK hirers struggled to find workers with the skills their organisations needed, research from The Open University (OU) has found. Employing people with the right digital and information and communications technology experience was a particular problem. At the same time, graduate recruiters are becoming less interested in the actual subject a person has studied – just one in four hires students from a specific disciplinary background, research from the Institute of Student Employers (ISE) shows.Instead, recruiters want to see candidates who show critical thinking, determination and a readiness to work. “Distance learning is filling a gap in the graduate talent market,” says Sally Hayes, director of students at the OU. “We attract a higher proportion of mature students, who come with the extra life and work experience employers say they want. And it’s a different style of study, which operates online and remotely. It takes six years to complete an OU degree studying part-time, so you have to be committed, organised and really dedicated.”Recruiters are most frustrated by graduate hires who show a lack of resilience once they are on the job, other ISE data shows. Inabilities to manage up or lead were other common bugbears. This is echoed in findings from the Chartered Management Institute’s (CMI) recent 21st Century Leaders report, which found being able to take responsibility was the attribute most valued by bosses in new employees. Given this desire for able, self-starting workers, it is no wonder graduates who have demonstrated self-discipline and drive acquiring degrees through distance learning are proving such an attractive prospect.The majority of those studying through the OU are aged between 25 and 44, with jobs and families. A successful degree outcome is dependent on iniduals maintaining motivation and being exceptionally determined, as well as having all the digital knowledge necessary to tackle an online course. Thanks to the internet, distance learning today looks very different to the remote studies undertaken in the past. Current OU students gain a digital fluency from day-to-day engagement with webinars and online tuition, as well as using interactive learning tools, such as virtual courtrooms for law students. In a rapidly changing, tech-driven world, such knowledge, plus the ability to work independently and flexibly, are valuable assets to employers.The OU seeks to pair its graduates with job opportunities through its OpportunityHub, a portal that advertises vacancies from partner employers, including Network Rail, the National Health Service, HMRC and TeachFirst, to name just a few.“Employers often say our graduates are more tech savvy, with great transferable skills,” says Hayes. “Some even suggest their retention rates are higher. It’s certainly true that theirs is a conscious decision to study and it’s a big investment for them. Many do it for a career change or to progress in their job, so they take it very seriously.”She adds: “Technology changes very quickly, but our students are used to working with OU tools on collaborative projects. These constantly evolve and students adapt. Those are just the type of skills employers are likely to need in the future.”“Many of those who take the OU nursing qualification have worked in the NHS for years as healthcare support workers and assistants, so they understand work and have pre-training experience,” O’Donnell says. “These students have roots in the area, they have families and an established base, which is good for retaining them for the longer term. They also see what we’ve invested in them and most want to return that value by staying with us once they’re qualified.”The OU has taught more than 2 million students since it was founded 50 years ago with a social mission to capture the talent of Britain. A reflection of its success in this aim is the fact it boasts such a erse student and alumni population in terms of ethnicity, socioeconomic background and geography. It has students and graduates in cities, towns and villages all over the UK, in every remote corner of Britain, as well as around the world. The OU also has the highest proportion of students with disabilities of any British higher education institution. Put simply, its students are everywhere and from everywhere, a fact that proves attractive to enlightened employers seeking to recruit a genuinely erse workforce.“Someone who completes an OU degree has been through so much, often juggling caring for children, work and typically 20 hours of study a week for years to get their qualification,” says Hayes. “If they complete the course, that shows great tenacity, as well as subject knowledge. It’s evidence in itself that these people are really exceptional.”Empower your business.

Like hundreds of thousands of young people across the world, she is following Greta Thunberg’s lead and campaigning for action on the climate crisis – but, far from any of the big city demonstrations, she’s having to go it alone.“I was quite scared the first time because no one was doing it with me,” says Amelia. “But I’m doing this because I care about something. I really want people to listen to me and to make a difference.”She holds a handmade sign reading: “I’m striking for our nature”, and it is her passion for wildlife and the outdoors that keeps her going each week. On the weekends she volunteers for Norfolk Wildlife Trust with her family and enjoys birdwatching.Nevertheless, there are times when striking alone can be difficult. “It is quite hard in the cold, especially when it’s freezing,” she says. A few of her friends at school are interested, but their parents are not so sure – with only one person, it is hard to get the ball rolling.Although there are young people from all walks of life striking alone, it’s often those in rural areas who struggle to make themselves, and the issues they most care about, heard. Holly Gillibrand, 14, in Fort William has been striking for more than a year: “The bigger towns and cities get all this media attention, obviously, because a lot of people turn up.“But I think the media tend to forget about the people in the rural places around Scotland and the rest of the UK. We have a different perspective on things and our voices deserve to be put out there just as much as anyone else’s.”But social media has provided a platform for rural voices to be amplified. In November Amelia’s father uploaded a video of her to Twitter after the prime minister, Boris Johnson, failed to show up to the climate leadership debate before the election. In it she said: “Tomorrow I’m going to be standing outside in the rain and you couldn’t be bothered to turn up in a warm studio to debate the other leaders. How pathetic are you?”It generated more than 1,000 retweets and praise from the wildlife presenter Chris Packham. “It was a bit crazy but I feel really proud because it shows that people notice and care,” Amelia says.It was the power of social media that inspired Anna Kernahan, 17, Grace Maddrell, 14, and Helen Jackson, 21, to set up Solo But Not Alone, a Twitter page dedicated to sharing the stories of solo climate strikers.“People will say: ‘Oh, you’re not alone,’ but it’s hard to see that when you are sitting there at the strike and there’s no one else around you, everyone’s walking past,” says Anna. She strikes alone in Belfast from 12pm to 3pm every Friday, often reading a book or catching up on homework. Although she struggles to get friends to join her, she has one powerful supporter to keep her going – Greta Thunberg.“My phone crashes whenever she retweets me because she gets so many likes,” says Anna.Within weeks of setting up Solo But Not Alone at the end of 2019, the trio had hundreds of followers, and have been able to profile solo strikers across the globe.It has helped them connect with people such as Mulindwa Moses, a 23-year-old climate activist from Uganda who strikes alone on the roadside. At one point he did it for 55 days consecutively, but now just strikes on Fridays and Saturdays, raising awareness for the Save Congo Rainforest and Two Trees a Week campaigns.Moses was inspired to take action after speaking to people who had lost family members in landslides and floods, which he later found were being caused by the climate crisis. “There are literally no reports about the climate and ecological crisis in the media, which has kept the population ignorant, and leaders are taking advantage of this to not take action,” Mulindwa says.Living in Kampala, Uganda’s capital, he strikes alone not because he lives in an isolated area, but because of his country’s lack of tolerance for climate activism.But like other solo climate strikers around the world, his loneliness is eased by the support he receives from fellow climate activists online. Anna says: “We really want to make sure that even if only one person is striking, their voice is heard and it is loud.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aaf4b21eb5dc969bd59baab7638dc5c083d114ce/0_75_1226_736/master/1226.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d12b6784767b91595544c1fbc1ac192a","title":"wildlife photographer of the year lumix peoples choice winner in pictures","story":"Sam Rowley’s Station Squabble, featuring a pair of mice fighting over a scrap of food at a London tube station, has been crowned winner of the wildlife photographer of the year: Lumix people’s choice award.

Is misinformation spreading on some sub-Reddit, somewhere, that face tattoos will prevent coronavirus? Or is it just stupidity? After all, Brown got a Nike trainer tattooed on his face, which at least perhaps confirms that karma is real, and self-inflicted. Rose had the words Slash and Bash tattooed on her forehead – which sounds like a cry for help until you learn one of her children is named Slash, and the other nicknamed Bash. (Which, actually, also sounds like a cry for help.)And then there was the rapper who got Anne Frank’s face tattooed on his face. It’s almost as if those inclined to get a face tattoo are also inclined towards errors in judgment.If the raison d’être of any alternative culture is that it is (by definition) not popular, it stands to reason that people who like tattoos must find increasingly subversive ways to wear them. Certainly, a shoe on the face is subversive – in the same way that learning to sleep standing up is subversive. On the one hand, it is one way to make a very mainstream practice niche. On the other hand, why be different, when you could just be normal?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a04e7ee6a51cbd7bcc1333b6a2b10829626c4e5/0_173_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eeb0642c1f450f0e1502fb4053de5bb4","title":"marc jacobs mixes mid century poise with neon pandemonium","story":"Clothes at New York fashion week show were as familiar and comforting as staging was unsettling and bewildering Marc Jacobs was scheduled to close New York fashion week with a catwalk show, but he closed it with a party instead. So riotous was his 15-minute Technicolor circus of punk ballet and Mrs Maisel-esque tailoring that when the pop star Miley Cyrus made a cameo appearance, strutting in a black bra top while trailing a zebra-striped coat along the catwalk behind her, many in the audience didn’t even notice.Park Avenue Armory, a cavernous cube of 55,000 sq ft, was bare and dim when the event began. The audience were directed to seats at a tight cluster of rackety metal cafe tables in the centre of the room, surrounded by empty darkness on all sides. The only light came from the tealight candles in jam jars on the tables, as if at a late night jazz speakeasy.Suddenly a platinum blonde pixie in a black tunic and tights appeared, kicked and twirled savagely through the tables, and promptly disappeared: Karole Armitage, the 65-year-old avant-garde dancer and choreographer known as the “punk ballerina” when she rose to fame in the 1980s.Then there was a chaos of floodlights, and groups of dancers swarmed across the room from all directions, leaping and vogueing. Another door opened, and a slow parade of pastel-clad supermodels began walking solemnly through the chaos, following a perfect line. The juxtaposition of the models’ well-dressed poise against the backdrop of noisy neon pandemonium was a little like watching a troupe of Irving Penn models traverse Tokyo’s Shibuya crossing, or New York’s Times Square, at rush hour.Armitage, who has collaborated with Christian Lacroix and Jean Paul Gaultier in the past, has always choreographed with an eye for fashion. One of her dancers shadow-boxed through the show in buttercup yellow lingerie with long black gloves, another sprinted the length of the room in a duck egg blue pencil skirt and black spike heels.The models, meanwhile, were perfectly turned out in mid-century finery. Gigi Hadid looked exquisite in a soft skirt suit in the creamy off-white of coconut flesh with elegant bracelet-length sleeves, her red beret matched to her lipstick and her kitten heels her sister Bella wore a black sequin column gown, with white patent opera gloves reaching to her armpits, the jewels at her throat as giant-sized as her beehive. In their ice-cream-toned, ultra-feminine nostalgia the clothes were as familiar and comforting as the staging of the show was unsettling and bewildering. This was a masterclass in how to make wearable clothes into theatre.In his youth, Jacobs spent restless decades battling drug addiction and bipolar disorder. At 56, he is sober, happily married – his husband, Charly Defrancesco, watched the show from a seat next to Nicki Minaj – and no longer a city dweller, having decamped to a Frank Lloyd Wright house in Rye, upstate New York. The designer called this collection a portrait of “a past New York I will forever love … mythical and chic with its beauty, promise, sparkle and grit”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2bde0c0c778ed00dbb42ac55c49a7d304304ad20/2_0_10663_6400/master/10663.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=58ec7a6f1f867b2c79f5cd9dfd2c9caf","title":"hothouse flowers tropical prints for women in pictures","story":"Birds of paradise and cheese plant fronds are everywhere this season.

Here are 19 more Korean masterpieces A microbudget special that taps into Korean cinema’s fascination with the world of excessive drinking: sociability, politeness, drunkenness, loneliness. A lovelorn young guy is persuaded to come with his boozy friends for a weekend break to a seaside town, only to find that they haven’t shown up and his misadventures with strangers escalate.Jeong Jae-eun made a stylish and likable debut with this film, talky and Europeanised – a cult classic for Korean film fans. Five young women find that their friendship is under pressure after they leave high school in the provincial town of Incheon. One rich kid moves away to Seoul, causing some resentment and the others left behind reassess their relationships.Kim Bora’s quasi-autobiographical film about a 14-year-old girl and her relationship with her sister, brother and parents who work very long hours in a ricecake shop. She begins to flower under the attention of a kindly teacher and may even be on the verge of finding love.Never was a title more misleading, because there are no pigs and no wells, and even looking for them in a metaphorical sense is tricky. Garrulous, droll, angsty and quirky, this movie introduced us to the world of Korea’s US-trained film-maker Hong Sang-soo, who devised this semi-improvised tale of four people in Seoul.Kim Jee-woon delivers a tasty example of Korean psycho-horror. A middle-aged doctor has an elegant, sharp-tongued second wife, and two daughters who have just returned home from a clinic. Their loathing of their stepmother finds a supernatural echo in strange goings-on in the house.Bong Joon-ho had a superb breakthrough with this true-crime nightmare, based on the real case of a Zodiac-style Korean serial killer who murdered 10 women in Hwaeseong between 1986 and 1991 without being captured. Bong’s film renewed interest in the case, and the killer was finally identified and charged in 2019 after arrest on another crime, but could not be prosecuted for the Hwaeseong murders because the statute of limitations had expired. Bong’s longtime leading man Song Kang-ho (the dopey dad from Parasite) plays the chaotic detective in charge.With this film, Park Chan-ok revealed herself as one of Korean cinema’s smartest and most stylish talents. Like Lee Chang-dong’s Burning, it is set in the tense border zone with North Korea’s DPRK, and it is complex and enigmatic. A young girl has a difficult, ambiguous relationship with her elder sister’s charismatic husband: a teacher and community leader with a dark personal history.Veteran Korean film-maker Im Kwon-taek split the best director prize at Cannes (with Paul Thomas Anderson’s Punch-Drunk Love) for this film, a passionate yet high-minded picture – a costume drama on a grander scale than is now fashionable in Korean cinema. It is about the 19th-century Korean artist Jang Seung-eop, whose life unfolds alongside his country’s domestic upheavals: it is beautifully shot and grippingly told.This was the film that introduced cinephiles and Koreaphiles to the fiercely talented Lee Chang-dong: a back-to-front narrative study of a man who we see at first taking his own life by throwing himself under a train. We see the scenes-from-a-life that led up to this in reverse order, which show a histrionic and not especially sympathetic man.Like his Memories Of Murder, Bong Joon-ho’s Mother is, in some ways, a straightforward psychological suspense thriller, with a lively and satirical sense of how forensics – that supposedly exact science – can go terribly wrong. But this is also a hypnotically strange and gripping study of a middle-aged woman who sets out to get her learning-disabled son off a murder charge.A classic of Korean horror which is also a fierce attack on Korean authoritarianism and conformism — it was at the cusp of the Korean cinema revival this was the film that whetted the Western taste for East Asia’s scary movies, and it went on to spawn four sequels. In a girls’ school, certain teachers are hated and feared for their sadistic discipline and punishments and also for the obsessive way that students are valued only for the way they can pump up the school’s university admission statistics. It triggers bizarre deaths and supernatural happenings. There is a scene in which a human face rushes up from the end of a corridor to the camera that will make you jump out of your seat.Lee Jeong-hyang’s lovely, gentle film showed a kind of Korean cinema that plucks at the heartstrings and plays the sweetest of tunes but which is nonetheless utterly direct and unsentimental. A small and somewhat stroppy boy is taken to live with his very old and mute grandmother in the countryside way outside the big city: we are given to understand there is some kind of crisis in his parents’ marriage and this is the reason his mum has parked him there. From then on, it is almost a silent movie as the relationship between the angry, lonely boy and his enigmatic grandma unfolds.Here is one of Bong Joon-ho’s most crazily inspired creations, produced by Park Chan-wook — a staggeringly futuristic all-star drama with Chris Evans and Tilda Swinton, about a train with a microcosmic class-based society aboard, hundreds of years into a new Ice Age, cutting through the snow and ice. It is a film adored with cult-like devotion by its many fans, perhaps especially because it was bought for distribution by Harvey Weinstein who tried to bully Bong into cutting 25 minutes from the running time, and when Bong refused – and could prove his director’s cut was testing better – Weinstein petulantly restricted the release, which meant that Snowpiercer was not widely seen in cinemas, but the legend lives on.An underrated and deeply strange film from Lee that touches on a persistent, but little-noticed theme in Korean cinema: religion and Christianity. Jeon Do-yeon plays a woman in her 30s whose son is abducted and killed and in her anguish, she turns to religion, throwing herself fervently into this new devotional existence in a desperate attempt to cauterise the unimaginable pain. She even demands to visit the imprisoned killer of her son, but the encounter goes horribly awry, in a way that challenges the whole idea of forgiveness and redemption – it’s an extraordinary “prison visit” scene.Hong Sang-soo reached what many of his admirers believe to be the apotheosis of his amiably talkative, humorously uneventful character studies with this Groundhog Day-type film in which a famous film director (played by Jung Jae-young) comes to a strange town to attend a screening of one of his films, and karmically meets-cute twice over with a beautiful young woman (played by Kim Min-hee). The first time it ends badly with too much drink taken and his reputation as a married womaniser souring their friendship the second time, things seem subtly different and yet it’s not at all clear that this is the “happy” ending that eluded them in the first version or if moral or emotional lessons of any sort are getting learned. This is just life, in all its contingent messiness, getting a do-over, but not necessarily improved.Kim Ki-duk is a director renowned for his extreme and ultraviolent horror movies such as 3-Iron, and his reputation has taken a bad knock with #MeToo accusations of sexual assault that were not proved. But his Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter … And Spring is an atypical film in many ways: gentle, quiet, ruminative, and possessed of a Buddhist belief that time, youth and age are an illusion.A boy lives under the care of an old monk and is punished for tormenting small animals (Kim himself was criticised for animal cruelty in the making of his 2000 film The Isle). Spring turns to summer, the boy grows to manhood and is warned by the elder of submitting to lust, and then the man grows towards the age of his mentor and proceeds to a kind of fraught enlightenment.Lee Chang-dong asserted his claim to real filmic and artistic greatness with this beautiful and mysterious film. Yun Jung-hie plays Mija, a sixtysomething grandmother who looks after her troubled teen grandson who lives with her in her modest apartment. She is suffering from the early signs of dementia, and this terrible news inspires her to take classes in poetry. Before the facility of language deserts her utterly, Mija wishes to write a single poem. And yet this isn’t the only crisis in her life: there is a crisis connected with her grandson, which complicates the film’s tragic quality. Without realising it, Mija is developing the soul of a poet in the shadow of disaster and death. She is making sense of her life: this is the “poetry” that is taking place, day by day, minute by minute.Extreme cinema never got freakier or more extreme than this quite extraordinary revenge horror which went above and beyond anything we had seen before: it claimed the allegiance of an army of superfans, although Spike Lee’s English-language remake was not well judged. Choi Min-sik plays Dae-su, an arrogant and obnoxious man whose nightmare begins on a rainy night in Seoul in the 1980s. Drunk and incapable, he is abducted by an unknown figure and imprisoned in what appears to be a tatty hotel room – for 15 years, fed, clothed, kept alive with horrifying and apparently motiveless malice, as Dae-su screams, rages and pleads. But the future is to hold his release and his terrible vengeance. The film is renowned for a bizarre moment when Dae-su eats a live octopus for the sheer existential defiance.Bong Joon-ho’s upstairs-downstairs satirical masterpiece Parasite, the Palme D’Or and best picture Oscar-winner features a low-achieving family living cheek-by-jowl in a scuzzy, stinky basement flat. The teenage son flukes a plum job as an after-school tutor to a teenage girl who lives in a colossal modernist mansion. Cunningly, he gets his elder sister in as an “art tutor” to the kid brother of this wealthy household, and it isn’t long before mum and dad have scammed jobs there also as chauffeur and housekeeper, all pretending to be not related, brilliantly playing on their rich employers’ smugness, fastidiousness and cocooned naivety. Parasite is about the perennial topic of class and 21st-century servitude, and it is about the fundamental issue of inequality. The film has a crazy and exuberant theatricality, with broad streaks of farce, and also a strong if unexpected element of sympathy. Veteran player Song Kang-ho – who has become the face of Korean cinema — projects such pathos and even gentleness in his muddle-headed need to do the right thing by his family.Park Chan-wook, a veteran of extreme cinema with his “Vengeance” trilogy (Sympathy For Mr Vengeance, Oldboy, Lady Vengeance) in 2016 created a glorious erotic suspense thriller in The Handmaiden, a sumptuously designed period drama based on Sarah Waters’s novel Fingersmith. It is a film to compare with Hitchcock’s Rebecca or Nagisa Oshima’s In The Realm of the Senses. In Japanese-ruled colonial Korea of the 1930s, a con-man posing as a nobleman persuades a pickpocket of his lowlife acquaintance to get a job as a handmaiden to a beautiful, wealthy young woman, who is being exploited by her hideous old father. The plan is that she will assist his sinister plan to seduce this heiress, elope with her and then have her incarcerated in a lunatic asylum – in return for which the “handmaiden” is promised a few jewels. But things go terribly wrong, and there is an unforgettable whiplash plot twist which sends us all the way back to the beginning of the story. The exquisitely beautiful Kim Min-hee is excellent as the heiress with all her gamine innocence, petulance and entitlement, and Kim Tae-ri is superb as the handmaiden herself: smart, worldly, talented in the ways of deceit and yet with an unsuspected streak of romance. It is a classic tale of crime, sex, ambition and love."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09a2016719c6afaf203ac6d3fd33a677ff0fd8ba/70_424_8443_5066/master/8443.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1d6c720d937391cb63dcedb039862788","title":"john boorman you think the holy grail is lost no i have it on my piano","story":"The director of classic Hollywood films including Excalibur, Point Blank and Deliverance lives alone in a giant house in rural Ireland. He talks about his career, growing old – and his obsession with the trees in his gardenLast summer, John Boorman embarked on what may prove to be his final film production. The location was the garden of his big house in Ireland. The cast were the towering trees that stand around it. During the 11-minute  of Tree Poems, Boorman tells us about the sycamore, the willow and the monkey puzzle he used to drape with Christmas lights every year. The director comes shuffling up the gravel drive, leaning on his stick, an old man among giants. When he turns back towards home, he vanishes from the frame.Death, he admits, has been on his mind lately. Dead friends and forgotten films successes and regrets. He turned 87 a few weeks ago, so it is small wonder he spends most of his time walking in nature and peering hard into the rear-view mirror. “I’ve been very fortunate in my life,” he says. “But there’s always the nagging sense that I could have made more, I could have done more. And that’s what sometimes keeps me up at night.”The director has just written a book, Conclusions, in an attempt to exorcise these ghosts, or at least direct them towards some higher purpose. He wanted to write something that was part memoir, part instruction manual a series of observations and life lessons. Except he now worries he didn’t quite bring it off, he says. The book is too scattershot and inconclusive. He jokes that he ought to have called it Confusions instead.It’s the dead of winter when I arrive at the Glebe, his secluded home in the Wicklow mountains. Boorman is bundled in a knitted jumper, his hair platinum as if from the frost. There is a daily allocation of pills on the table, a walker at his elbow and a stack of Oscar screeners (Hustlers, Booksmart, The Irishman) on the coffee table by his knee. When I ask how he is, he briskly lists all his ailments: hearing loss, failing eyesight, neuropathy, the works. “Old age is a series of giving things up. I can’t swim, I can’t run, I can’t drive a car or ride horses. I take a daily walk up the drive and back. Break the journey on a wooden bench.” He laughs shortly. “It usually takes me about an hour.”If Boorman risks pushing himself too hard, that’s surely because he’s a natural-born drill sergeant his own harshest critic. In the case of Conclusions, I think his doubts are unfounded. The book’s a lovely miscellany, loose and limber, juggling film-making tips (“Don’t make the script too good”) with gossipy recollections of 60s and 70s Hollywood. Back then, Boorman could hardly turn a corner without running into the likes of Marlon Brando, Billy Wilder, Akira Kurosawa or Cary Grant. The existential Point Blank (1967) got him noticed the mighty Deliverance (1972) made him a star. The way Boorman tells it, there was no master plan. He bounced from the bedsits of London to the BBC to a lucrative film-making career overseas.The Hollywood years were good while they lasted. But, by and large, he says he preferred independence: less money, more freedom. Boorman was always happier in the mainstream than Nicolas Roeg or Ken Russell, his closest contemporaries. But his work has a similar cockeyed abandon, a similar whiff of pagan mysticism. Films such as Zardoz, Excalibur or The Emerald Forest feel borderline malarial, on the brink of overheating. You watch them nervously, concerned for their safety.He shrugs. “Well, I have a different relationship with different films. When I see Point Blank again I think: ‘How on earth did I get away with that?’ And Deliverance is very compelling. The craftsmanship is good. And as for Zardoz, I don’t know what the hell it is. But I think they’re all bold films, for better or worse.”Then there are the ones that got away. The hits (such as Rocky and Alien) he turned down because the scripts left him cold. Or the passion projects he was forced to abandon. Boorman estimates that he spent more time on the films that didn’t get made than on those that did.In the early 70s, for instance, he corresponded with JRR Tolkien about a screen adaptation of The Lord of the Rings, a full 30 years before Peter Jackson brought it safely home. Boorman wanted to shoot the whole saga as a single three-hour picture. “I saw it as this big dystopian story,” he says. “And in this house, upstairs, we papered the walls with each scene. We’d look at it, stare at it and try to get some sense out of it. And I had all sorts of solutions. I was going to cast nine- or 10-year-old boys as the hobbits. Put them in makeup beards and things. And then dub them with adult voices.”Jesus, I say. It would have been a disaster.“Yeah well,” he chuckles. “It might have been.”The director released his last feature film – the gentle, semiautobiographical Queen and Country – in 2015. Some days he thinks he would like to make another. Mostly he is glad to have put all that bother behind him. He has spent the bulk of his life at cinema’s beck and call, simultaneously loving it and hating it, like Ulysses lashed to the mast of his ship. It’s a blessed relief to be cut down at last.This reminds him of a story. In 1997, he made The General, a superb true-crime drama about the Dublin gangster Martin Cahill. On the eve of production, a doctor told him that he could drop dead at any second, and needed a heart bypass right away. “I’m shooting a film!” Boorman snapped back. “And that’s much more important than life or death.”Happily for him, the diagnosis turned out to be wrong. It was a false negative his heart was clear. Even so, what an idiot, right? “Looking back at it objectively, it was a ridiculous thing to say and do. Your life is at risk, and you go shooting a film? But that’s honestly how I saw it – as something more important than reality. I don’t any more.” He frowns. “I don’t think that I do.”It’s cold in the room Boorman reaches for a blanket. Probably the house has grown too big for his needs. The Glebe is a former rectory, built on the old monastic lands of Glendalough. His neighbour on one side is a 96-year-old hill farmer who still gets up for work every day. His neighbour on the other is Daniel Day-Lewis, recently retired. “Given up,” the director says. “The process made him exhausted. He felt all hollowed out and depressed. So I think in the end, he had just had enough.”Boorman bought the Glebe in auction in 1969 and it went on to become the perfect family home, a base camp for adventure. Conclusions recounts boozy dinners and festive get-togethers. One night, Lee Marvin sat drunk at the head of the table on another, Sean Connery spun tales of childhood poverty back in Scotland. Now Boorman has the entire place to himself. He is twice-orced, and the kids have flown. He looks forward to visitors, but breathes a sigh of relief when they go.“At my age, so many of my friends are dead that I have a feeling of being marooned,” he says. “My generation is nearly gone. So I just have to accept that’s the way things are. One thing after another disappears. You get more and more isolated. And, finally, you die.”He suspects he has become something of a hermit. But that’s not so bad he enjoys his own company. The only time he feels lonely is when he wakes in the night and needs to pee. He’ll creep half-asleep out of bed without turning on any lights to avoid waking his wife, and only twigs that the place is empty when he is picking his way blindly along the upstairs landing.We sit in the living room, variously gazing out at the trees or up at the bookshelves. I ask which possessions in the house are of particular value, and he points out the bronze cast of the hands of his eldest daughter, Telsche, who died of ovarian cancer more than 20 years ago. He also has Excalibur propped in a corner of the room – forged especially for the film by Wilkinson Sword. I pull it from the sheath the blade is heavy and bright. Boorman’s humid account of King Arthur knocked me for six when I saw it as a kid in 1981. Brandishing the sword, I feel like the star of my own private mock-epic.“Oh, and one other thing,” the director says at my back. “You think the holy grail is lost? Well, actually, no. I have it on my piano.”Making films was always an escape for Boorman a distraction from the inevitable. “When you’re shooting a film, you can convince yourself that death does not exist. I suppose that’s true of a lot of other activities. Sex or work or whatever it is. But it’s about being so busy and so focused that all thoughts of death just fall away.”Thinking about it now, he reckons he has always been much braver on set than off it. “Oh definitely,” he says. “I’ve done stuff in films that I wouldn’t have dared to do in normal circumstances. In my life, in my family, in my relationships, I’ve been cowardly. Whereas if I’d been presented with the same kind of problems on a film set, I feel that I would have been very brave and decisive.”We prop the sword back in its corner and retreat to the kitchen for fishcakes and white wine. The director accepts that the sensible solution would be to move out of the house. His daughter, Daisy, has a small flat in London where she would like him to live. But so far he has been resisting. He says the very thought makes him claustrophobic. On top of all that, it would mean saying goodbye to his trees. He suspects that the trees still have something to tell him. He would like to learn how they manage to communicate with one another, or the process by which sap travels up a trunk.Boorman has spent the large part of his life in a romantic entanglement with the movies. He seems to be ending it infatuated by trees. That’s quite the violent change of gears. I can’t imagine there’s any connection there. “Well, you see,” he says. “I think perhaps there is. Because when you’re making a film, you are trying to find the essential truth of it. You’ve got the script and the actors. But what’s underneath that, and where is it going? And all the while, the film is changing and growing around you. You’re trying to hold on to a vision, but at the same time you have to go with the flow. And that’s the way I look at trees. You plant them. Lots of them die. Some of them are eaten by other animals. And some of them survive, grow and become these great giants.”The director nods at the window and the wintry garden outside. “I bought this house 50 years ago,” he says. “So I’ve seen the  of the trees on the land. A lot of the trees that I planted, I’ve now outlived. The rest of them will outlive me.”Conclusions by John Boorman is published by Faber \u0026amp Faber (£20).

People in dark corners of restaurants eat more calories, because they are less embarrassed to order unhealthy food when no one can see them. Give or take the opposable thumbs, we’re all just dogs hiding under duvets and thinking no one can see us. Heavier cutlery makes us appreciate the food more. Classier glassware boosts our opinion of the drink. There’s probably already someone drilling into why a tablecloth would matter so much, what trick it plays on the rocky relationship between eyes and stomach I, however, already know why. It speaks of effort. It’s actually not very much effort, so as a host you’re getting a lot of bang for your buck here. You will look like a person who is taking things pretty seriously, has thought ahead, tried to approximate a restaurant’s sense of occasion – and if your friends don’t appreciate this on some important level, and don’t reflect in their own behaviour how glad you obviously are to have them, then you deserve some new friends. My own tablecloth, incidentally, is among my most prized possessions: a friend from Bolivia got it hand-painted with little dancing people in national dress. It can’t even be handwashed without threat to the tiny people, and nobody in south London would know how to repaint the costume of Bolivia, so when I bring this out for you, I really am saying you’re the most important person in my life.But say you have something against tablecloths or perhaps you’re already using one, and your friends still only give your food six out of 10, and don’t linger long enough at the table. Here are a few other ways to keep them sitting down.In with the bullet: cheese. In my youth I experimented with all the cheeses in the world: vast plates heaving with monte enebro and vacherin, all major genres (sheep, cow, goat) and textures (soft, hard, blue) represented, fancy Bath Olivers, grapes and walnuts cascading over it all like delicious waterfalls. Nobody ever finished the cheese. Often, a cheese would not even be started – especially one that arrived at the table whole, which makes people shy. Because I was too stingy ever to throw it away, all I ever ate was cheese. In the wisdom of my great age, I have realised that it’s all about the message. Nobody has to serve a cheese, so when you do, you’re saying: “I don’t want you to leave. I want you to stay.” You can say that with a single baked camembert, or a thousand cheeses.My Mr and I disagree on the subject of sugar: he thinks it makes everyone hyper, I think this is a myth put about on Mumsnet and it has no effect on behaviour. I’m more or less convinced I’m right, except in the peculiar case of red wine sorbet. You don’t need to serve much you can have it as well as pudding, or instead. All I ask is that you make it yourself, because if you buy it in a supermarket they will have boiled off the alcohol. Some combination of a new temperature, a new way to consume red wine, and (I have to concede) sugar makes everyone come alive. They start singing, unleash rapier wit it is as if everyone has walked out, walked back in and started the night again.I always thought that if you wanted to do a quiz, it would have to be bespoke for the guests, which is very time-consuming. (A friend once did a Mr and Mrs quiz that included the question: “How would you describe your partner’s lovemaking?”, with a multiple-choice answer featuring the word “festive”. Then at the end, you had to rank everyone around the table by intelligence, on the pretext that your answers would be anonymous, but then they weren’t. This evening was the stuff of legend, though granted, it is the Legend of Why Kirsty and John Split Up and We All Hate Each Other Now). Anyway, I was wrong (again!). Mr W got a pub quizmaster’s set from a secret Santa, with really basic questions such as: “Who sang the Big Bang Theory theme tune?”, and everybody loves it. Cannot get enough of it. Sometimes we do it when there are just two of us.Throw in some tall candles in classy colours (grey, always grey, unless turquoise) and your guests will be with you so long that they will be basically hostages.Next week: how to get people to leave."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/296dc222890bfbeace50297cff9b4654e9861c43/0_0_8333_5002/master/8333.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b5734af825966f36d172747c8b427d5","title":"how ultra processed food took over your shopping basket brazil carlos monteiro","story":"It’s cheap, attractive and convenient, and we eat it every day – it’s difficult not to. But is ultra-processed food making us ill and driving the global obesity crisis? Nearly three decades ago, when I was an overweight teenager, I sometimes ate six pieces of sliced white toast in a row, each one slathered in butter or jam. I remember the spongy texture of the bread as I took it from its plastic bag. No matter how much of this supermarket toast I ate, I hardly felt sated. It was like eating without really eating. Other days, I would buy a box of Crunchy Nut Cornflakes or a tube of Pringles: sour cream and onion flavour stackable snack chips, which were an exciting novelty at the time, having only arrived in the UK in 1991. Although the carton was big enough to feed a crowd, I could demolish most of it by myself in a sitting. Each chip, with its salty and powdery sour cream coating, sent me back for another one. I loved the way the chips – curved like roof tiles – would dissolve slightly on my tongue.After one of these binges – because that is what they were – I would speak to myself with self-loathing. “What is wrong with you?” I would say to the tear-stained face in the mirror. I blamed myself for my lack of self-control. But now, all these years later, having mostly lost my taste for sliced bread, sugary cereals and snack chips, I feel I was asking myself the wrong question. It shouldn’t have been “What is wrong with you?” but “What is wrong with this food?”Back in the 90s, there was no word to cover all the items I used to binge on. Some of the things I over-ate – crisps or chocolate or fast-food burgers – could be classified as junk food, but others, such as bread and cereal, were more like household staples. These various foods seemed to have nothing in common except for the fact that I found them very easy to eat a lot of, especially when sad. As I ate my Pringles and my white bread, I felt like a failure for not being able to stop. I had no idea that there would one day be a technical explanation for why I found them so hard to resist. The word is “ultra-processed” and it refers to foods that tend to be low in essential nutrients, high in sugar, oil and salt and liable to be overconsumed.Which foods qualify as ultra-processed? It’s almost easier to say which are not. I got a cup of coffee the other day at a train station cafe and the only snacks for sale that were not ultra-processed were a banana and a packet of nuts. The other options were: a panini made from ultra-processed bread, flavoured crisps, chocolate bars, long-life muffins and sweet wafer biscuits – all ultra-processed.What characterises ultra-processed foods is that they are so altered that it can be hard to recognise the underlying ingredients. These are concoctions of concoctions, engineered from ingredients that are already highly refined, such as cheap vegetable oils, flours, whey proteins and sugars, which are then whipped up into something more appetising with the help of industrial additives such as emulsifiers.Ultra-processed foods (or UPF) now account for more than half of all the calories eaten in the UK and US, and other countries are fast catching up. UPFs are now simply part of the flavour of modern life. These foods are convenient, affordable, highly profitable, strongly flavoured, aggressively marketed – and on sale in supermarkets everywhere. The foods themselves may be familiar, yet the term “ultra-processed” is less so. None of the friends I spoke with while writing this piece could recall ever having heard it in daily conversation. But everyone had a pretty good hunch what it meant. One recognised the concept as described by the US food writer Michael Pollan – “edible foodlike substances”.Some UPFs, such as sliced bread or mass-produced cakes, have been around for many decades, but the percentage of UPFs in the average person’s diet has never been anything like as high as it is today. It would be unusual for most of us to get through the day without consuming at least a few ultra-processed items.You might say that ultra-processed is just a pompous way to describe many of your normal, everyday pleasures. It could be your morning bowl of Cheerios or your evening pot of flavoured yoghurt. It’s savoury snacks and sweet baked goods. It’s chicken nuggets or vegan hotdogs, as the case may be. It’s the doughnut you buy when you are being indulgent, and the premium protein bar you eat at the gym for a quick energy boost. It’s the long-life almond milk in your coffee and the Diet Coke you drink in the afternoon. Consumed in isolation and moderation, each of these products may be perfectly wholesome. With their long shelf life, ultra-processed foods are designed to be microbiologically safe. The question is what happens to our bodies when UPFs become as prevalent as they are at the moment.Evidence now suggests that diets heavy in UPFs can cause overeating and obesity. Consumers may blame themselves for overindulging in these foods, but what if it is in the nature of these products to be overeaten?The biggest departure in the Brazilian guidelines was to treat food processing as the single most important issue in public health. This new set of rules framed unhealthy food less in terms of the nutrients it contains (fats, carbohydrates etc) and more by the degree to which it is processed (preserved, emulsified, sweetened etc). No government diet guidelines had ever categorised foods this way before. One of the first rules in the Brazilian guidelines was to “avoid consumption of ultra-processed products”. They condemned at a stroke not just fast foods or sugary snacks, but also many foods which have been reformulated to seem health-giving, from “lite” margarines to vitamin-fortified breakfast cereals.Why should food processing matter for our health? “Processed food” is a blurry term and for years, the food industry has exploited these blurred lines as a way to defend its additive-laden products. Unless you grow, forage or catch all your own food, almost everything you consume has been processed to some extent. A pint of milk is pasteurised, a pea may be frozen. Cooking is a process. Fermentation is a process. Artisanal, organic kimchi is a processed food, and so is the finest French goat’s cheese. No big deal.But UPFs are different. They are processed in ways that go far beyond cooking or fermentation, and they may also come plastered with health claims. Even a sugary multi-coloured breakfast cereal may state that it is “a good source of fibre” and “made with whole grains”. Bettina Elias Siegel, the author of Kid Food: The Challenge of Feeding Children in a Highly Processed World, says that in the US, people tend to categorise food in a binary way. There is “junk food” and then there is everything else. For Siegel, “ultra-processed” is a helpful tool for showing new parents that “there’s a huge difference between a cooked carrot and a bag of industrially produced, carrot-flavoured veggie puffs” aimed at toddlers, even if those veggie puffs are cynically marketed as “natural”.The concept of UPFs was born in the early years of this millennium when a Brazilian scientist called Carlos Monteiro noticed a paradox. People appeared to be buying less sugar, yet obesity and type 2 diabetes were going up. A team of Brazilian nutrition researchers led by Monteiro, based at the university of Sao Paulo, had been tracking the nation’s diet since the 80s, asking households to record the foods they bought. One of the biggest trends to jump out of the data was that, while the amount of sugar and oil people were buying was going down, their sugar consumption was vastly increasing, because of all of the ready-to-eat sugary products that were now available, from packaged cakes to chocolate breakfast cereal, that were easy to eat in large quantities without thinking about it.To Monteiro, the bag of sugar on the kitchen counter is a healthy sign, not because sugar itself has any goodness in it, but because it belongs to a person who cooks. Monteiro’s data suggested to him that the households who were still buying sugar were also the ones who were still making the old Brazilian dishes such as rice and beans.Monteiro is a doctor by training, and when you talk to him, he still has the idealistic zeal of someone who wants to prevent human suffering. He had started off in the 70s treating poor people in rural villages, and was startled to see how quickly the problems of under-nutrition were replaced by those of tooth decay and obesity, particularly among children. When Monteiro looked at the foods that had increased the most in the Brazilian diet – from cookies and sodas to crackers and savoury snacks – what they had in common was that they were all highly processed. Yet he noticed that many of these commonly eaten foods did not even feature in the standard food pyramids of US nutrition guidelines, which show rows of different whole foods according to how much people consume, with rice and wheat at the bottom, then fruits and vegetables, then fish and dairy and so on. These pyramids are based on the assumption that people are still cooking from scratch, as they did in the 50s. “It is time to demolish the pyramid”, wrote Monteiro in 2011.Once something has been classified, it can be studied. In the 10 years since Monteiro first announced the concept, numerous peer-reviewed studies on UPFs have been published confirming the links he suspected between these foods and higher rates of disease. By giving a collective name to ultra-processed foods for the first time, Monteiro has gone some way to transforming the entire field of public health nutrition.As he sees it, there are four basic kinds of food, graded by the degree to which they are processed. Taken together, these four groups form what Monteiro calls the Nova system (meaning a new star). The first category – group 1 – are the least processed, and includes anything from a bunch of parsley to a carrot, from a steak to a raisin. A pedant will point out that none of these things are strictly unprocessed by the time they are sold: the carrot is washed, the steak is refrigerated, the raisin is dried. To answer these objections, Monteiro renamed this group “unprocessed and minimally processed foods”.The second group is called “processed culinary ingredients”. These include butter and salt, sugar and lard, oil and flour – all used in small quantities with group 1 foods to make them more delicious: a pat of butter melting on broccoli, a sprinkling of salt on a piece of fish, a spoonful of sugar in a bowl of strawberries.Next in the Nova system comes group 3, or “processed foods”. This category consists of foods that have been preserved, pickled, fermented or salted. Examples would be canned tomatoes and pulses, pickles, traditionally made bread (such as sourdough), smoked fish and cured meats. Monteiro notes that when used sparingly, these processed foods can result in “delicious dishes” and nutritionally balanced meals.The final category, group 4, is unlike any of the others. Group 4 foods tend to consist largely of the sugars, oils and starches from group 2, but instead of being used sparingly to make fresh food more delicious, these ingredients are now transformed through colours, emulsifiers, flavourings and other additives to become more palatable. They contain ingredients unfamiliar to domestic kitchens such as soy protein isolate (in cereal bars or shakes with added protein) and “mechanically separated meat” (turkey hotdogs, sausage rolls).Group 4 foods differ from other foods not just in substance, but in use. Because they are aggressively promoted and ready-to-eat, these highly profitable items have vast market advantages over the minimally processed foods in group 1. Monteiro and his colleagues have observed from evidence around the world that these group 4 items are liable to “replace freshly made regular meals and dishes, with snacking any time, anywhere”. For Monteiro, there is no doubt that these ultra-processed foods are implicated in obesity as well as a range of non-communicable diseases such as heart disease and type 2 diabetes.Not everyone in the world of nutrition is convinced by the Nova system of food classification. Some critics of Monteiro have complained that ultra-processed is just another way to describe foods that are sugary or fatty or salty or low in fibre, or all of these at once. If you look at the UPFs that are consumed in the largest quantities, the majority of them take the form of sweet treats or sugary drinks. The question is whether these foods would still be harmful if the levels of sugar and oil could be reduced.The first time the nutrition researcher Kevin Hall heard anyone talk about ultra-processed food, he thought it was “a nonsense definition”. It was 2016 and Hall – who studies how people put on weight at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases at Bethesda, Maryland – was at a conference chatting with a representative from PepsiCo who scornfully mentioned the new Brazilian set of food guidelines and specifically the directive to avoid ultra-processed foods. Hall agreed that this was a silly rule because, as far as he was concerned, obesity had nothing to do with food processing.Anyone can see that some foods are processed to a higher degree than others – an Oreo is not the same as an orange – but Hall knew of no scientific proof that said the degree of processed food in a person’s diet could cause them to gain weight. Hall is a physicist by training and he is a self-confessed “reductionist”. He likes to take things apart and see how they work. He is therefore attracted to the idea that food is nothing more than the sum of its nutrient parts: fats plus carbs plus protein and fibre, and so on. The whole notion of ultra-processed foods annoyed him because it seemed too fuzzy.When Hall started to read through the scientific literature on ultra-processed foods, he noticed that all of the damning evidence against them took the form of correlation rather than absolute proof. Like most studies on the harmful effects of particular foods, these studies fell under the umbrella of epidemiology: the study of patterns of health across populations. Hall – and he is not alone here – finds such studies less than convincing. Correlation is not causation, as the saying goes.Just because people who eat a lot of UPFs are more likely to be obese or suffer from cancer does not mean that obesity and cancer are caused by UPFs, per se. “Typically, it’s people in lower economic brackets who eat a lot of these foods,” Hall said. He thought UPFs were being wrongly blamed for the poor health outcomes of living in poverty.At the end of 2018, Hall and his colleagues became the first scientists to test – in randomised controlled conditions – whether diets high in ultra-processed foods could actually cause overeating and weight gain.For four weeks, 10 men and 10 women agreed to be confined to a clinic under Hall’s care and agreed to eat only what they were given, wearing loose clothes so that they would not notice so much if their weight changed. This might sound like a small study, but carefully controlled trials like this are considered the gold standard for science, and are especially rare in the field of nutrition because of the difficulty and expense of persuading humans to live and eat in laboratory conditions. Barry Popkin, a professor of nutrition at the University of North Carolina, has praised Hall’s study – published in Cell Metabolism – for being “as good a clinical trial as you can get”.For two weeks, Hall’s participants ate mostly ultra-processed meals such as turkey sandwiches with crisps, and for another two weeks they ate mostly unprocessed food such as spinach omelette with sweet potato hash. The researchers worked hard to design both sets of meals to be tasty and familiar to all participants. Day one on the ultra-processed diet included a breakfast of Cheerios with whole milk and a blueberry muffin, a lunch of canned beef ravioli followed by cookies and a pre-cooked TV dinner of steak and mashed potatoes with canned corn and low-fat chocolate milk. Day one on the unprocessed diet started with a breakfast of Greek yoghurt with walnuts, strawberries and bananas, a lunch of spinach, chicken and bulgur salad with grapes to follow, and dinner of roast beef, rice pilaf and vegetables, with peeled oranges to finish. The subjects were told to eat as much or as little as they liked.Hall set up the study to match the two diets as closely as possible for calories, sugar, protein, fibre and fat. This wasn’t easy, because most ultra-processed foods are low in fibre and protein and higher in sugar. To compensate for the lack of fibre, the participants were given diet lemonade laced with soluble fibre to go with their meals during the two weeks on the ultra-processed diet.It turned out that, during the weeks of the ultra-processed diet, the volunteers ate an extra 500 calories a day, equivalent to a whole quarter pounder with cheese. Blood tests showed that the hormones in the body responsible for hunger remained elevated on the ultra-processed diet compared to the unprocessed diet, which confirms the feeling I used to have that however much I ate, these foods didn’t sate my hunger.Hall’s study provided evidence that an ultra-processed diet – with its soft textures and strong flavours – really does cause over-eating and weight gain, regardless of the sugar content. Over just two weeks, the subjects gained an average of 1kg. This is a far more dramatic result than you would expect to see over such a short space of time (especially since the volunteers rated both types of food as equally pleasant).After Hall’s study was published in July 2019, it was impossible to dismiss Monteiro’s proposition that the rise of UPFs increases the risk of obesity. Monteiro told me that as a result of Hall’s study, he and his colleagues in Brazil found they were suddenly being taken seriously.Now that we have evidence of a link between diets high in UPFs and obesity, it seems clear that a healthy diet should be based on fresh, home-cooked food. To help champion home cooking among Brazilians, Monteiro recruited the cookery writer Rita Lobo, whose website Panelinha (“network”) is the most popular food site in Brazil, with 3m hits a month. Lobo said that when she tells people about UPFs, the first reaction is panic and anger. “They say: ‘Oh my God! I’m not going to be able to eat my yoghurt or my cereal bar! What am I going to eat?’” After a while, however, she says that the concept of ultra-processed foods is “almost a relief” to people, because it liberates them from the polarities and restriction created by fad diets or “clean eating’”. People are thrilled, Lobo says, when they realise they can have desserts again, as long as they are freshly made.In Britain and the US, our relationship with ultra-processed food is so extensive and goes back so many decades that these products have become our soul food, a beloved repertoire of dishes. It’s what our mothers fed us. If you want to bond with someone who was a child in 1970s Britain, mention that you have childhood memories of being given Findus Crispy Pancakes and spaghetti hoops followed by Angel Delight for tea. I have noticed that Australian friends have similar conversations about the childhood joys of Tim Tams chocolate biscuits. In the curious coding of the British class system, a taste for industrial branded foods is a way to reassure others that you are OK. What kind of snob would disparage a Creme Egg or fail to recognise the joy of licking cheesy Wotsit dust from your fingers?I am as much of a sucker for this branded food nostalgia as anyone. There is a part of my brain – the part that is still an eight-year-old at a birthday party – that will always feel that Iced Gems (ultra-processed cookies topped with ultra-processed frosting) are pure magic. But I’ve started to feel a creeping unease that our ardent affection for these foods has been mostly manufactured by the food corporations who profit from selling them. For the thousands of people trapped in binge-eating disorder – as I once was – UPFs are false friends.The multinational food industry has a vested interest in rubbishing Monteiro’s ideas about how UPFs are detrimental to our health. And much of the most vociferous criticism of his Nova system has come from sources close to the industry. A 2018 paper co-authored by Melissa Mialon, a French food engineer and public health researcher, identified 32 materials online criticising Nova, most of which were not peer-reviewed. The paper showed that, out of 38 writers critical of Nova, 33 had links to the ultra-processed food industry.For many in the developing world, the prevalence of ultra-processed foods is making it hard for those on a limited budget to feed their children a wholesome diet. Victor Aguayo, chief of nutrition at Unicef, tells me over the phone that, as ultra-processed foods become cheaper and other foods, such as vegetables and fish, become more expensive, the UPFs are taking up a bigger volume of children’s diets. What’s more, the pleasurable textures and aggressive marketing of these foods makes them “appealing and aspirational” both to children and parents, says Aguayo.Soon after the arrival in Nepal of brightly coloured packages that, as Aguayo describes them, “look like food for children: the cookies, the savoury snacks, the cereals”, aid workers started to see an epidemic of “both overweight and micronutrient deficiency” including anaemia among Nepalese children under the age of five.Aguayo says there is an urgent need to change the food environment to make the healthy options the easy, affordable and available ones. Ecuador, Uruguay and Peru have followed Brazil’s example in urging their citizens to steer clear of ultra-processed foods. Uruguay’s dietary guidelines – issued in 2016 – tells Uruguayans to “base your diet on natural foods, and avoid the regular consumption of ultra-processed products”. How easy this will be to do is another matter.In Australia, Canada or the UK, to be told to avoid ultra-processed food – as the Brazilian guidelines do – would mean rejecting half or more of what is for sale as food, including many basic staples that people depend on, such as bread. The vast majority of supermarket loaves count as ultra-processed, regardless of how much they boast of being multiseed, malted or glowing with ancient grains.Earlier this year, Monteiro and his colleagues published a paper titled “Ultra-processed foods: what they are and how to identify them”, offering some rules of thumb. The paper explains that “the practical way to identify if a product is ultra-processed is to check to see if its list of ingredients contains at least one food substance never or rarely used in kitchens, or classes of additives whose function is to make the final product palatable or more appealing (‘cosmetic additives’)”. Tell-tale ingredients include “invert sugar, maltodextrin, dextrose, lactose, soluble or insoluble fibre, hydrogenated or interesterified oil”. Or it may contain additives such as “flavour enhancers, colours, emulsifiers, emulsifying salts, sweeteners, thickeners and anti-foaming, bulking, carbonating, foaming, gelling and glazing agents”.But not everyone has time to search every label for the presence of glazing agents. A website called Open Food Facts, run by mostly French volunteers, has started the herculean labour of creating an open database of packaged foods around the world and listing where they fit into on the Nova system. Froot Loops: Nova 4. Unsalted butter: Nova 2. Sardines in olive oil: Nova 3. Vanilla Alpro yoghurt: Nova 4. Stéphane Gigandet, who runs the site, says that he started analysing food by Nova a year ago and “it is not an easy task”.We still don’t really know what it is about ultra-processed food that generates weight gain. The rate of chewing may be a factor. In Hall’s study, during the weeks on the ultra-processed diet people ate their meals faster, maybe because the foods tended to be softer and easier to chew. On the unprocessed diet, a hormone called PYY, which reduces appetite, was elevated, suggesting that homemade food keeps us fuller for longer. The effect of additives such as artificial sweeteners on the gut microbiome is another theory. Later this year, new research from physicist Albert-László Barabási will reveal more about the way that ultra-processing actually alters food at a molecular level.In a two-part blog on ultra-processed foods in 2018 (Rise of the Ultra Foods) Anthony Warner, a former food industry development chef who tweets and campaigns as Angry Chef, argued that Nova was stoking fear and guilt about food and “adding to the stress of already difficult lives” by making people feel judged for their food choices. But having read Kevin Hall’s study, he wrote an article in May 2019 admitting: “I was wrong about ultra-processed food – it really is making you fat.” Warner said the study convinced him that “eating rate, texture and palatability” of UPFs lead to overeating, and ended with a call for more research.Even if scientists do succeed in pinning down the mechanism or mechanisms by which ultra-processed foods make us gain weight, it’s not clear what policy-makers should do about UPFs, except for giving people the support and resources they need to cook more fresh meals at home. To follow the Brazilian advice entails a total rethink of the food system.For as long as we believed that single nutrients were the main cause of poor diets, industrial foods could be endlessly tweaked to fit with the theory of the day. When fat was seen as the devil, the food industry gave us a panoply of low-fat products. The result of the sugar taxes around the world has been a raft of new artificially sweetened drinks. But if you accept the argument that processing is itself part of the problem, all of this tweaking and reformulation becomes so much meaningless window-dressing.An ultra-processed food can be reformulated in countless ways, but the one thing it can’t be transformed into is an unprocessed food. Hall remains hopeful that there may turn out to be some way to adjust the manufacture of ultra-processed foods to make them less harmful to health. A huge number of people on low incomes, he notes, are relying on these “relatively inexpensive tasty things” for daily sustenance. But he is keenly aware that the problems of nutrition cannot be cured by ever more sophisticated processing. “How do you take an Oreo and make it non-ultra-processed?” he asks. “You can’t!”• This article was amended on 13 February 2020.

But, to me, gin tastes like musty leaf matterLet me confess. I live daily with the fear that, like Hector in Alan Bennett’s The History Boys, I am “not in the swim”. At the great dinner party of life, I’m on the children’s table, a mere spectator of the grown-up fun. This is because, deep breath, I don’t have a favourite gin. Yup, I know. If I were asked at a bar which gin I would like with my tonic, I would only stammer. But that’s only the beginning. The truth is I don’t have a favourite gin, because I hate ALL gin. As far as I’m concerned having a favourite gin would be like choosing a favourite war criminal, only with a greater impact on my life.It’s worse even than the time I admitted to not liking a negroni, that cruel and bitter slap of a cocktail, a taste for which is meant to mark you out as a mature sophisticate. Despite all the hype the negroni remains a niche drink. Even if I don’t want to be part of the negroni-drinking gang, there’s surely another gang over there I can go hang out with.But gin: today, that’s everybody’s drink. It’s like bindweed: bloody everywhere. Tesco has its own brand gin, as do Morrisons and Sainsbury’s. Everybody has an own-brand gin. You probably have one too. Is it named after a character in a Guy Ritchie movie? Something like Copper Head or Lone Wolf or Conker? Many are. But being ubiquitous is not the same as being nice. I dislike the hit of juniper and the dank hit of undergrowth wrenched from a fox-soiled hedgerow. You call it the taste of “botanicals” I call it the taste of “musty leaf matter”.As the number of available gins grew, often marketed by cheery fellas who just happened to wear flat caps every day and keep their woollen trousers up with braces, ready to party like it’s 1869, I became increasingly cynical. Gin production, I decided, was for people who want to enter the horny-handed world of “artisanal food crafting” but can’t be doing with all that filthy countryside business. Gin is something you can “craft” in a city, around the corner from a good coffee shop and a ready supply of Korean chicken wings.Can you smell my cynicism? It’s nothing as compared to what I stank of when I made the big discovery. As a man who writes about food and drink I’m meant to know things but as ever, ignorance springs eternal. Until a year ago I hadn’t quite clocked that often gin is just vodka to which stuff has been added. It is ruined vodka. Some gin producers don’t even make the vodka. They buy it in, then they ruin it. That’s tragic because I adore vodka I love its crispness and its cleanness. It was when I was thinking about this vodka love that I realised the problem. Flowery, juniper-sodden gin is just too interesting, too multidimensional for me. I crave something duller, or at best a blank canvas upon which I can paint my own boozy story.In this, I may be far less alone than I first imagined. As I examined the gin world, I was struck by how much of it is marketed as tasting of something other than gin: there’s quince gin and clementine gin. There’s watermelon flavour and chocolate orange flavour and lemon drizzle cake flavour. There’s Mystical Unicorn gin liqueur from Aldi, which apparently tastes of marshmallow and candy floss, and Parma Violet gin from Asda, which must taste of nightmares. What none of them can taste of is gin. Is it possible that most people don’t actually like standard gin at all? Perhaps they just want to belong to a tribe? If so, then I’m happy to remain an outcast. You’ll find me over in the corner, alone, nursing a vodka."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fde2f2f31b97ddb0870c908553b678354e91ab2b/74_18_1772_1063/master/1772.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=16b1ef01a4753ab227530c1555db6a3f","title":"bobby madley to referee in england two years after sacking","story":"The referee Bobby Madley is to return to English football next season, two years after losing his job as a Premier League official because of an offensive joke.The 34-year-old revealed he had accepted an offer to become a national list referee from this summer, which would qualify him to take charge of matches in Leagues One and Two. Madley will officiate non-league matches for the remainder of this season.“Like any referee I have the desire to perform at my best and to achieve the best I can,” Madley wrote on his blog, therefereesword. “I know how hard that road is to referee at the top but I have the desire and passion to work hard to achieve my potential whatever that may be. I still have dreams that I thought were dead but for me they are now very much alive.”Madley was removed from the Premier League list of referees in August 2018 after a video of him mocking a disabled man was shared with his employer, the PGMOL. Last year he described it as a private joke taken out of context but accepted it was “badly misjudged”.“I have never tried to excuse my actions of 2018,” Madley wrote in his latest post. “I have never looked to blame anyone but myself. I am not proud of my actions in 2018 and I have learned from this and feel I am a better and stronger person for it.“PGMOL dealt with what they considered a discriminatory act in the strongest way. There can be no criticism for that and I have never sought to do anything other than respect the decision and to learn from it as a person. I can only thank them for having the ability to forgive, recognise that one naive moment does not define a person and offer me a second chance to do what I love to do.”Since losing his job Madley has refereed in Norway, where he has been living. He revealed that part of his rehabilitation had been assisted by Terje Hauge, the Norwegian referee who attained notoriety in 2006 when he received death threats for sending off Chelsea’s Asier del Horno  in a Champions League defeat by Barcelona.“Being able to continue refereeing was the one thing that I was able to keep as a constant from my life back in England and helped me to retain a sense of identity,” Madley wrote. “I cannot speak highly enough of the NFF and … Terje Hauge in particular.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce6f98d370b3c4c02f032893fe0f2106e9590638/37_152_3309_1985/master/3309.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cd302b7f576b7f753bc70bc770666168","title":"football tickets being resold on stubhub at huge profit full scale","story":"Premier League clubs, the sports minister and football fans have condemned StubHub, as data emerged that uncovers for the first time the scale of the website’s grip on thousands of tickets to football matches.StubHub was accused of undermining efforts to keep fans safe and helping touts rip off people after a  investigation revealed evidence suggesting the firm makes millions from football tickets, despite a law banning their resale in England and Wales.Liverpool’s home fixture against Crystal Palace on 21 March, at which Jürgen Klopp’s side could clinch the Premier League title, is potentially the most lucrative fixture analysed by the . According to data obtained by the , the value of tickets sold, combined with the list price of those advertised for sale, was approaching €1.5m as of this week.The sports minister, Nigel Adams, said: “The unauthorised reselling of football tickets is a criminal offence and I would like to see any evidence referred to the police. Touting not only rips off fans but puts them in danger of buying fake tickets and in the worst cases can risk their safety.“We have already banned the use of automated ticket bots and we are providing millions to enforcement agencies every year. I will be talking to colleagues across government to see how we can clamp down further on the scourge of ticket touting.”All the clubs involved recommend fans use in-house ticket exchanges systems, which do not charge the same mark-ups as StubHub.A spokesperson for Arsenal said the club had repeatedly written to StubHub demanding that it stop advertising tickets at the Emirates Stadium but to no avail.“It has to be remembered the ultimate losers are our fans who are forced to pay for overpriced tickets by using this platform,” the spokesperson said. “As a club we work continuously to prevent tickets being sold via this type of platform.” Arsenal have cancelled 6,500 memberships over two seasons where fans were found to be reselling.Despite clubs’ efforts to stop industrial-scale touting, analysis of StubHub listings for Premier League and Champions League games and England matches indicate the firm could be earning tens of millions of pounds through the sale of hundreds of thousands of tickets.It is also offering dozens of tickets for Euro 2020, including the final at Wembley, although sales data for the competition is harder to access.The website even offers tips to people selling a ticket on how much to charge, based on demand, as well as advice for those looking to pass on their season ticket. “Your buyer will return your card to you after the event,” sellers are told.Unauthorised resale of football tickets became illegal in England and Wales in 1994 after the Taylor report into the Hillsborough disaster included a ban among recommendations to improve fan safety. While small-time street touting has continued, the scale of the practice online has remained secret until now because resale sites and professional touts with access to genuine sales data have little incentive to highlight the problem.When confronted by the , StubHub claimed most sales were by genuine fans. It said its UK website did not offer football tickets and that StubHub, its international website, was not subject to English and Welsh law. The international site’s servers are thought to be based overseas, meaning the sales technically do not take place in the UK, but in test purchases performed by the , every other aspect of a transaction does.Using UK credit cards and addresses, the  was able to purchase a ticket for Tottenham’s FA Cup tie against Southampton on 5 February and then list it for sale moments later. The site also uses software that detects and displays the user’s location.Malcolm Clarke, the chair of the Football Supporters’ Association, said: “These companies are simply online touts seeking to exploit the loyalty of fans for their own commercial profit.”The ticket information supplied during the test purchase also featured incorrect information regarding the location of the seat. The Competition and Markets Authority has previously warned StubHub that supplying false ticket data is in breach of consumer law because it means customers may end up with different seats from those they were expecting.StubHub said it asked sellers to update ticket information if it is informed it is wrong. was also able to advertise a ticket that indicated the buyer would be sitting with the away fans when the ticket was for the home end.Liverpool, who work with Merseyside police to crack down on touting, warned that putting fans in the wrong end undermined efforts to keep them safe. A spokesperson said unauthorised resale “potentially compromises segregation arrangements as well as undermining our attempts to ensure tickets are distributed as fairly as possible via a loyalty system”.Manchester United, Tottenham and Chelsea, a club which has taken court action against 14 touts, one of whom was jailed, also condemned industrial-scale online resale. Manchester City declined to comment.The Premier League said: “Inidual clubs decide their own official secondary ticket arrangements and any sale of a ticket on unauthorised platforms is illegal.”Separate evidence seen by the  indicates that one person may be behind a large proportion of transactions in English football. Internal StubHub data includes multiple listings with the same “seller ID”. Only StubHub knows who they are but they are responsible for nearly £2m of tickets advertised on one day.In a statement, StubHub said it “works diligently to comply with the law” in the countries where it operates and does not offer football tickets from its StubHub website.StubHub is in the midst of a £3.1bn takeover by its controversial rival Viagogo, which has been criticised by regulators, MPs and campaign groups, including for alleged breaches of consumer law.Both sites were named in a 2018  investigation into football touting, amid concerns about security following a Europa League game at which thousands of FC Köln fans entered the home end at Arsenal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e4aa30945584d39429b8302aa0058aaf5b01bdea/0_109_3450_2070/master/3450.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e7061f2acc60942bd101395e44669bb0","title":"liverpool arsenal womens super league match report","story":"A thumping header from Vivianne Miedema helped a makeshift Arsenal stay in the Women’s Super League title race with a tough 3-2 win at struggling Liverpool.The home team took a surprise lead through Rinsola Babajide early on but Arsenal struck back with two goals in two minutes, from Miedema and Jordan Nobbs, to take the advantage. Arsenal’s backline, though, struggled against the pace of Liverpool’s forwards and they levelled on the stroke of half-time through the winter signing Rachel Furness.With the bit between their teeth it looked like Liverpool would take a valuable point off the champions but Miedema headed home her 16th league goal of the season to deny them a chance to move clear of bottom-placed Bristol City.Liverpool have endured a testing season but with two wins in succession – a first league victory, against Bristol City, and a 8-1 drubbing of Blackburn Rovers in the FA Cup – there was a sense that the Merseyside club could be turning a corner. They may have had just one win from their 12 outings and been level on points with bottom-placed Bristol before kick-off but look more closely at the league table and the potential that exists in Vicky Jepson’s side is clear. They have a superior goal difference to the four clubs above them and Liverpool’s eight previous defeats have been tight.Having not played in 18 days as three of their last four home ties were postponed due to the state of the Prenton Park pitch, the visit of Arsenal was switched from Tranmere’s home to Chester’s Deva Stadium.Arsenal were not without problems of their own. With Kim Little having undergone surgery on a foot injury, Lia Walti still absent and Jill Roord suspended, Joe Montemurro was forced to push Leah Williamson forward into the midfield and to field a bench with just four outfield players on it – two 16-year-olds, one 17-year-old and a returning Jen Beattie.Needing a win to stay in the title race Arsenal began brightly, with Nobbs forcing a save from Anke Preuss within two minutes. But they were wasteful with their chances and, with close to 15 minutes played, a sublime one-touch Furness through ball set Babajide free in a race against Louise Quinn. The Ireland international was no match for the forward’s pace and Babajide slipped the ball low past Pauline Peyraud-Magnin in the Arsenal goal.Babajide continued to cause problems for the Arsenal left-back Leonie Maier but Liverpool seemed to play their way into trouble a little too easily, with a determination to play out from the back struggling under the Gunners’ high press. Two goals in two minutes was the punishment. A Nobbs ball from the right was deflected away but Miedema beat everyone in the middle to push the ball past Anke Preuss. Then, Nobbs was on hand to head in from close range after a pinpoint cross from Lisa Evans on the left.The impressive Thursday night crowd fell silent but on the stroke of half-time they roared back into life as Furness’s first-time finish, after an Evans clearance was headed to her feet, drew them level.After a bruising 2-1 defeat to Manchester City in their previous league outing, which handed the title race advantage to their opponents, this felt like an Arsenal side licking their wounds. Bench options favoured the home team and, when Beth Mead fell to the ground under a heavy challenge from Leighanne Robe, Montemurro was forced to send on Beattie as his squad took another hit.It was also a potential blow to a watching Phil Neville, who is days away from announcing his England squad for the SheBelieves Cup in March as the Lionesses gear up for the Tokyo Olympics.Liverpool brought Rhiannon Roberts on for Kirsty Linnett with half an hour left and there was a fluidity and organisation to their play, something more akin to Arsenal but woefully lacking from the visitors. Arsenal though, have a game-changer in Miedema and a powerful header from the Dutch forward ended the renaissance."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5475ac69861070d7298f385999fbbd2b630ad8a/0_97_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fcaa3f853251fe4be13ea730070d2bf9","title":"enduring love how gen z saved the greetings card","story":"The British have been sending cards since Victorian times – and still send more per head than any other nation. But can their popularity see off the threat of constant texts and emojis?For Rachel Hare, it all started with dental surgery and Bugsy Malone. When she was four years old, the greetings card designer had to go into hospital for an operation, and – because in those days parents weren’t allowed to stay overnight – sobbed as she watched her family walk away. “But they left this massive Bugsy Malone card on my bed – I’ve still got it in a box,” Hare says. “It gives me goosebumps remembering that.”In 1994, Hare founded her luxury card company Belly Button and today her designs are sold in John Lewis and Selfridges, among other independent shops. In 25 years of card-designing, she has seen a lot of change. That “pinkblue boygirl thing” for newborns? On its way out. Valentines are less popular than ever, although the rude variety are reportedly on the rise, while thanks to modern masculinity, Father’s Day has boomed. A couple of years ago prosecco was a common motif now, it is all about gin.“I look at fashion, but combine that with general greetings-card rules – so balloons and presents will always sell,” Hare explains. Every year, she “reinvents the balloons” with a new colour palette, but sometimes she thinks: “Oh my God, how am I gonna redesign another present?” A glance at her stock reveals a keen eye for trends – a figure on one card wears a jumpsuit similar to the one popularised by the hit comedy Fleabag elsewhere, mason jars hang from trees and Scandi chairs are tucked under desks. In a brutal popularity contest, llamas and sausage dogs appear neck-and-neck.Yet it is not just the design of greetings cards that has changed over the past 25 years. Last December, the 52-year-old card retailer Clintons had to be bought out of administration, with 334 stores saved. A month later, Card Factory shares plunged by a quarter after disappointing Christmas sales. In the US, business is no brighter – towards the end of January, the card shop Papyrus filed for bankruptcy. Experts theorise that sales are declining due to the death of the high street, the rise of social media and environmental concerns. Newer retailers also claim that offerings by giants such as Hallmark have become tired and stale. Is it time to send our Deepest Sympathies, or can cards Get Well Soon?Now that younger people can text their mates and tend to live in temporary rented accommodation, it would make sense for them to send fewer cards. Except that they don’t, says Amanda Fergusson, the CEO of the 100-year-old Greeting Card Association. According to the GCA’s 2019 market report, the British public spent £1.7bn on cards in 2018, with generation Z (18- to 24-year-olds) buying more cards than any other age group.“The British send more cards per capita than any other nation,” says Fergusson (who has held on to her first ever Valentine’s card, featuring a Snoopy design, for decades). I meet her at Spring Fair, an industry trade show in Birmingham where business seems to be booming – row after row of sellers showcase cards to potential retailers and brokers. There is an almost impossible amount of variety, from black cards featuring rude stick men (“You hear stories of 80-year-old ladies buying them to impress their grandkids,” says their creator Dominique Miranda) to quaint illustrations with stuck-on miniature wooden plant pots (plastic embellishments are now unpopular because of environmental concerns, explains the designer Laura Sherratt). How can it be that as stores struggle with high-street footfall, and the fate of Clintons seems sealed, so many new designs flood the market? Why are young people buying so many cards, and how did we become a nation of envelope-lickers in the first place?Malcolm Warrington holds some of the answers in his bookcase. Since the 1970s, the 72-year-old from Ruislip has collected nearly 8,000 Victorian greeting cards. He explains that the first commercial Christmas card was commissioned in 1843 by Sir Henry Cole, who sought an easier way to spread seasonal cheer than the letters that were customary at the time. Throughout the 19th century, chromolithography – the process of colour printing using stones – usurped hand-colouring and made mass-production easier. “The printing is fabulous, it’s a really rich colour, the illustrations are done expertly,” Warrington says.Warrington’s collection paints a vivid picture of greetings history. Many of his Victorian Christmas cards aren’t religious, nor do they seem festive at first glance. Animals in suits are a popular motif – in one card, a frog and a stag beetle dance to an insect playing a tambourine in another, a monkey in a fez holding a painter’s palette wishes “A Merry Christmas To You”. The less said about the card where four rats dine on the cooked carcass of a cat, the better.There are also designs for occasions we no longer celebrate with cards, including New Year’s Day and April Fools’ Day. In one new year’s card from the 1880s, cherubs dressed as jockeys ride on the backs of bats and declare: “We come to wish you all a bright new year.” Although it hardly seems possible, some illustrations have even more obscure meanings – one card features a clown riding on the back of another clown, captioned: “Whoa Mare! You’ve earned your little bit of Corn!” Still, with a few stylistic changes, some wouldn’t seem out of place today – an 1890s card of a pug riding a bicycle is strikingly similar to a card available on Etsy for £4.80 today.For its 100th anniversary, the GCA curated an exhibition that offers an insight into card history. A flick through its exhibition booklet shows dramatic changes throughout the decades – in the 1920s, embossed edges were still popular, while the 30s made way for cartoon humour. Embellishments such as feathers and ribbons became mainstream during the war, while rude cards emerged in the 60s. Still, cute animals and angelic children reigned supreme until the 80s and 90s paved the way for naughty poems (RIP Nutty Tart) and captioned cartoons. Today, puns, foiled lettering and swearwords seem to be popular.Crosland both illustrates cards and writes captions – something that wasn’t always common practice. Barbara J Laing is a verse writer from the Wirral who, between 2000 and 2007, wrote poems for the company that became Card Factory. She would write 30 verses for Mother’s Day alone and was initially paid £150 a poem before being put on a retainer. “It’s the first four lines that sell the card,” she says.Laing talks me through the rules of card writing – “No matter how beautiful the poem is, it has to apply to the man in the street.” She says she quickly learned to make her poems more “generic”, explaining that she once had to remove a line about beaches from a Mother’s Day poem “because not everybody’s been to the beach on holiday”. She also wrote a keepsake card – a modern rendition of the religious poem Footprints in the Sand, in which God carries man in times of suffering. “I said if you put this on a card and put it in the shops it will sell millions,” she says – it is still available in Card Factory today.Yet despite Laing’s successful rhymes, poetry cards have undeniably fallen out of favour. Many, if not most, of the cards I see at Spring Fair are text-light and blank inside. Does this mean we are less sentimental, or has the way we express sentiment changed?The industry has also been buoyed by something else that can cynically be called a trend – feminism. Artist Lucy Creed, the founder of Poet and Painter cards, says its bestseller is a striped card that simply says: “A woman’s place is where she says it is.” Cath Tate, who has been designing political cards since the 80s, says her most popular card reads: “Women don’t grow old. They just become more important.” Her daughter Rosie says: “Mum’s business started off really small and we’re now a successful commercial business because those subjects are now mainstream.” (Progress isn’t always linear – another designer hints at struggling to convince card company executives to update their cards with LGBT-friendly designs.)Lest it seem that we are all organically becoming lovely people who pay £3 to cheer up our depressed mates, it is important not to underestimate the influence of the GCA. For the last six years, the organisation has run “Thinking of You” week every September – an initiative to get people to “generating positive feelings” by (surprise, surprise) sending more cards. The GCA may have a warm exterior, but they’re definitely not Blank Inside. The organisation has many hardline historical success stories: during the second world war, they overturned a ban on greeting cards that was implemented to conserve paper, forcing the government to declare that greeting cards were “essential to the war effort” on the grounds of morale. Later, the association prevented the Royal Mail from charging the public extra to send square cards that had previously caused trouble in sorting machines worldwide (many machines are designed to find the long edge of an envelope in order to scan the address).Yet things still aren’t easy for traditional retailers – at the start of the year, Taylor had to reprimand his own siblings for not sending his daughter a birthday card (they left messages on social media instead). “I sent a note out saying: ‘Do you not realise we make our living from selling cards?’… It’s a bit sad that I had to do that,” he says. “People will spend £3 on a coffee but they won’t spend £3 on a card for a loved one.” Fergusson adds that while traditional retailers might be struggling to pay their rent, more and more “destination” shops such as garden centres and spas are stocking cards as an extra. There, they sell for higher prices because of the luxury association.Another way to get people spending is to tout the sustainability credentials of your cards – the envelopes for Hare’s new range are made from recycled coffee cups. Increasingly, greeting cards are sold “naked”, ie without a plastic film, to combat environmental concerns. For some companies, this is another opportunity for innovation – Paul Woodmansterne, the CEO of Woodmansterne cards, explains that last year the company developed a “smart seal” sticker to keep envelopes and cards together in lieu of plastic. Woodmansterne also makes money as a broker – it has a warehouse of cards from smaller publishers across the UK that it delivers to major national retailers. This means a greater variety of cards make it into shops without retailers having to deal with 30 or 40 publishers at a time.Woodmansterne denies that the internet is killing cards. He says digital printing has allowed smaller publishers to break through (previously, lithographic printing meant new designers would have to commit to printing 1,000 of any one design). He also notes that there has been a distinct rise in hand-giving as millennials move from address to address. “We’ve been doing cards since 1987 and we’ve grown in our sales every year,” he says. He argues that the biggest companies – such as Hallmark and UK Greetings (a name you’ll often find on the back of cards in WH Smith) – are struggling because they’re not as innovative as the new, smaller publishers.I leave Spring Fair with 21 cards, 10 of which are plastic-wrapped, but no two the same. There are Trump jokes, insects telling me to “bee kind”, glittery balloons, Mr Men characters, and yes, a couple of near-identical sausage dogs. Of course there is still room for the classics, too – Daniel Prince, the managing director of the UK’s biggest publisher of licensed cards, Danilo, says although people are paying on average 10p less a card, Thomas the Tank Engine, Paw Patrol and Peppa Pig cards are nowhere near falling out of favour. Bugsy Malone may be long gone, but Prince confidently says that Minions are “evergreen”. He hands me a Minion card addressed to “Grandson” – hopefully, by the time I have the opportunity to use it, cards won’t be relics of the past.

There r kids in NE who have no regular meals due to chaotic parents. Should they go hungry?”Trevelyan, a former defence minister, replaced Alok Sharma, who was promoted to business secretary in place of the sacked Andrea Leadsom.More recently, in 2017, Trevelyan tweeted a link to an article by the then development secretary, Priti Patel, saying a “waste of cash on vanity projects in far-flung lands kept me awake at night”.Christian Aid welcomed Trevelyan’s appointment to DfID, saying it hoped she would be “a powerful advocate for its continued poverty focus, and for its independence”.Patrick Watt, head of policy for the charity, said: “We hope that today’s announcement signals a clear commitment to keeping DfID as an independent department, and isn’t a stay of execution.”Mike Noyes, deputy head of aid for ActionAid UK, said: “Whilst we’re pleased that DfID remains independent with its own secretary of state, it’s important that the new minister is given enough time to make a real difference.”An ardent Brexiter, Trevelyan formerly lived in a grade I-listed mansion, Netherwitton Hall, in Morpeth, Northumberland, which is the family home of her then husband, John Trevelyan.

This throws into doubt their credibility as sources.”Two of the former officials, Sam Matthews and Louise Withers-Green, later decided to take legal action against the party for libel.Speaking at a hustings hosted by the Jewish Labour Movement, Starmer said: “I remember that programme well and being shocked by the response that was put out … I remember what I said to Jeremy. I said I’ve never been in an organisation that turns on its staff before, ever. Because what message do you think that sends not just to the ex-staff but current staff who speak out. They will be branded disloyal. I think it was utterly wrong that statement was put out and I said that directly the next morning.”He said as a former director of public prosecutions he abided by the rule that “the leader of the organisation carries the can, stands up for what goes wrong and takes responsibility”. Lisa Nandy, who got the biggest applause from the audience at the hustings for her answers, said: “We’ve got to do more than just settle … they are brave and they were accused of being disloyal. But what is more disloyal than not standing up for our Labour values? I would do more than just settle. I will make the Labour party a place that values and celebrates that sort of action.”Rebecca Long-Bailey also said she would apologise to those staff members and settle the legal action. “I don’t think the party gave the right response to what came up on that programme. As the party of workers and trade unionists we should not under any circumstances have called out or attacked other members of staff. Whether we thought what they said was factually incorrect or not is a completely different matter. I think we should apologise about how we behaved and we should settle any claims that are made.”Emily Thornberry said there had been a “culture of bullying” that had developed towards Labour staff, and criticised the redundancy notices issued to “footsoldiers” in contrast to senior staff who had kept their jobs.Earlier in the hustings, the candidates were challenged about how they had spoken up against antisemitism. Starmer backed up Thornberry’s account that they both urged the leadership to do more to tackle antisemitism.Starmer said: “We spoke up in shadow cabinet. We had a lot of rows. And I want to pay tribute to Emily. She spoke up loud and clear … Sometimes the row went on for the whole of the meeting.”At Wednesday night’s BBC Newsnight’s hustings, Thornberry had said she could not recall Long-Bailey having done the same as a shadow cabinet minister, despite her claims to the contrary.Nandy said she considered her position in Labour as a result of the resignations of Jewish MPs including Louise Ellman and Luciana Berger.The hustings took place as the second stage of the contest draws to a close on Friday – the last day for constituency Labour parties and affiliates to nominate candidates. Starmer, Long-Bailey and Nandy are all through to the next round of membership voting but Thornberry is still a few endorsements short of the 33 parties needed to make the final ballot. All the deputy leadership contenders – Angela Rayner, Dawn Butler, Richard Burgon, Rosena Allin-Khan and Ian Murray – are through to the next round.Long-Bailey will give a major speech in Salford, her constituency, on Friday in which she will seek to turn attention from Labour’s devastating election result to how the party wins next time.In an appeal not to turn away from the radicalism of Corbyn’s policies, she will say she would not blame members for “looking for an easy option to win next time: give up on something here, be less forthright there and we can win, you might hope”. However, she will also warn that “the path of despair is also the path to defeat”.She will say she was “worried after the election defeat that we might suffer a loss of confidence and step back from our principles and our ambitions” but go on to argue that the party must “forge a path to power” and claim that she is the only candidate who has that worked out plan to win the next election. Rayner, the favourite to be deputy leader, also gave a speech on Thursday warning Labour not to abandon its commitment to lifelong learning, saying vocational education must be “the cornerstone of industrial policy”.Speaking at the Unison Women’s Conference, the shadow education secretary will make the case for a system from early years to further and adult education that enables people to “take back control” and provide “practical answers” to the problems people face in the modern economy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c11c7179da3072f07f61aa9021ec5524994833c9/0_86_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=93ec43f1f51b865d06e95b619c09c7b4","title":"labour leadership contenders split over trans group pledge card","story":"Candidates differ on pledge that describes Woman’s Place UK and LGB Alliance as ‘trans-exclusionist hate groups’A controversial pledge card calling on the Labour party to expel “transphobic” members has split the party’s leadership contenders.Lisa Nandy has joined Rebecca Long-Bailey in signing the 12-point pledge card by the Labour Campaign for Trans Rights (LCTR) that also describes some organisations including Woman’s Place UK as “trans-exclusionist hate groups”.Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme Nandy said: “It’s a very tough pledge but it’s important that we are tough.”But Emily Thornberry has spoken out against the pledge card, and Keir Starmer, the frontrunner in the race, has not signed it and on Thursday chose instead to endorse a less contentious 10-point pledge by LGBT Labour.Previously Nandy had tweeted her support for the LCTR while stopping short of endorsing its pledge card. But on Wednesday evening during a Labour leadership debate on Newsnight she joined Rebecca Long-Bailey in announcing she had signed the 12-point pledge.She said: “People who willingly go out to hurt and offend other people have no place in the Labour party … we need to use care and compassion in the language we use to describe other people.”Thornberry said she had refused to sign it. “I have not signed it because I was was worried about it because it talks about hate,” the shadow foreign secretary told Newsnight.Starmer, the fourth contender in the race, did not say whether he backed the pledge but said trans rights should be seen as human rights.Woman’s Place UK – which believes that women need reserved places, separate spaces and distinct services – has said it is “extremely concerned by the scurrilous mischaracterisation” of its campaign.It has yet to respond to Nandy’s specific comments, but put out its own five-point pledge card:The LCTR charter calls on signatories to “organise and fight against transphobic organisations such as Woman’s Place UK, LGB Alliance and other trans-exclusionist hate groups”.It was launched this week with a warning that the party had “failed to act as transphobia has gained ground” within Labour, despite the party’s manifesto supporting trans equality and gender recognition.Nandy said “safe spaces” for women should include trans women.She told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “If you start from the position – as I do – that trans women are women, then the way you resolve that issue is not to pit women against other women, it is to have policies in your hostels that make sure that you don’t admit people who are trying to do harm to people who are already there.”Nandy also said that under Jeremy Corbyn, Labour had become disconnected from the issues that mattered to its voters.She said: “We just barely talked about crime over the last few years and particularly during the general election, and it was extraordinary because in every part of this country this is the thing that is keeping people awake at night, that is destroying lives and destroying communities.”And she accused the home secretary, Priti Patel , of “chasing headlines” by advocating ever-tougher sentences without reforming prisons and said the issue of the criminal justice system should be natural territory for Labour.“The fact that we weren’t talking about it I think shows how deeply disconnected the top of the party has become from our grassroots,” she said.“Labour has to become that party again that understands the issues that really matter to people and speak about them loud and clear.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/258e2aa2b6dda500e28812acaf85d4f473063b57/85_65_1657_994/master/1657.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e7f9e17cc94308cfeae16b1684c87882","title":"tracy brabin off the shoulder dress raises 20000 girlguiding","story":"MP auctioned dress after facing criticism on social media when wearing it in the CommonsAn off-the-shoulder dress worn by Tracy Brabin in the House of Commons has raised more than £20,000 for Girlguiding UK.The Labour frontbencher was forced to defend her attire last week after the dress slipped off her shoulder when she leaned on the despatch box because of a broken ankle.The final bid in the online auction for the dress came seconds before the auction ended at 6.41pm on Thursday, with the winning bidder paying £20,200, plus £3.48 postage.Brabin told PA Media: “It’s extremely humbling to be able to do this for Girlguiding and I am looking forward to attending a meeting tonight and celebrating with the girls.“I want to encourage them to really be proud of who they are, to support each other as girls and to not take any criticism from anyone – particularly boys – as I have found in my experiences with Twitter.”At the time of the criticism, Brabin tweeted that she was not a “slag, hungover, a tart, about to breastfeed, a slapper, drunk, just been banged over a wheelie bin”.More than 180 bids were placed on the dress, which had a starting price of £10 and was originally bought on Asos for £35.Brabin said she listed the dress as a way of standing up for women in the workplace. “I thought I would maybe get £500 for it, which would have been amazing,” she said. “I do not think in three years being an MP anything has made quite as much of an impact as this.”After the auction ended, Brabin said she would be attending a meeting of the 1st Roberttown and Norristhorpe Guides, based in her constituency.Henrietta, a 15-year-old member of Girlguiding’s advocate panel, said: “You could say that I’m foolish for wanting to be an MP. As #shouldergate has shown, female MPs are often vilified for their looks, not their actions.“This demeans girls and our aspirations to be politicians. But Tracy Brabin – and all the people who supported her and Girlguiding by bidding on the dress – have shown that oppression is never acceptable.“Girlguiding helped me persevere against the judgment of my looks. I’m elated that the money raised is going to an organisation that inspires girls and builds our confidence at a time where women’s concerns are dismissed as ‘humbug’. Girlguiding makes the future brighter for girls and young women.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c39db8a050ff090616030ba228a47973b8b5c3e8/301_105_902_541/master/902.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5205ebf52cca5d7fc137bcbe364afdb9","title":"politics live cabinet reshuffle set to get underway live news","story":"Robert Peston interviews Long Bailey, Starmer, Nandy and Thornberry at event in LondonThat’s a wrap. hustings has now finished. Robert Peston concluded the event by asking people in the room to put their hands up if they were Labour supporters and then put their hands up if they actually voted Labour in the last election. Several hands went down.They were then asked if they would vote Labour in the next election following tonight’s hustings and most of the hands shot back up. It was clear from the cheers and applause in the audience following each of Lisa Nandy’s answers that she was the most popular candidate in the room. She has also received a lot of praise on Twitter.A member of the audience has asked whether the candidates would consider themselves to be Zionists. “I believe in the state of Israel so therefore I am a Zionist,” Emily Thornberry says. Keir Starmer says he believes in a two-state solution and says he supports and sympathises with zionists but wouldn’t describe himself as one. Lisa Nandy says: “I believe Jewish people have a right to national self-determination. That makes me a Zionist.”She says she “hates the way the word has been weaponised” and goes on to say she also believes in a two-state solution. Rebecca Long-Bailey is last to answer. “I also agree with a secure Israel and I also agree with a two-state solution.”She says she guesses it does make her a Zionist because she believes Israel should have self-determination.The candidates are talking about how they will stand up to Boris Johnson.Emily Thornberry says: “The idea that the Tory party is the party of the working man is nonsense”.She says she is the one who can stand up to Boris Johnson’s “tosh” because of all her experience at the despatch box.“That’s why I have out myself forward for what is frankly the worst job in the world which is the Labour party leader in opposition,” she says to laughs.The candidates have been asked about how to deal with the rise of populism. Lisa Nandy says the questioning of the Panorama whistleblowers was a typical populist tactic and there is populism at “every level of the Labour Party”.“This is not something that infects the right alone. This is something that infects the left as well,” she says.Rebecca Long-Bailey says Labour should apologise for how it reacted to the BBC’s Panorama documentary about bullying and antisemitism.Asked whether Luciana Berger would be welcomed back into the Labour party, she says what happened to Berger was “absolutely shocking”. “We need to recognise that and start to build bridges and rebuild trust,” she says. Pressed as to whether Berger would be welcomed back, Nandy says she would.On the “culture of bullying”, Emily Thornberry says there needs to be a “root and branch” change at Labour headquarters. Lisa Nandy says she considered her position in the Labour party over antisemitism.She says you can stay in the cabinet and try privately to change things but if nothing changes still, you have to make a stand. Nandy, who seems to have the support of most in the room and has received several loud applauses, talks about being accused of disloyalty for speaking out about antisemitism. She says: “What is more disloyal than not standing up for our Labour values?”I’m now watching the Jewish Labour Movement hustings.The candidates in the Labour leadership race are now answering questions from ITV’s Robert Peston.To recap, the ministers who lost their seats around the cabinet table today include:Here’s a a visual representation of who’s up and who’s down:A few more positions have been filled. Zac Goldsmith will stay on as a minister for the environment and international development, but he will also be minister for the Foreign Office as well.Nigel Adams has also become a joint minister for the Foreign Office and international development, while Liz Sugg will continue in her role as a joint parliamentary under secretary at international development while also taking up the same position in the Foreign Office.Kit Malthouse will stay as a Home Office minister, and Conor Burns will remain an international trade minister.“It is now clear that Boris Johnson is running a government of the few, by the few, for the few.It’s no surprise that the Tories have failed to honour their pledge to rethink the tax loopholes that benefit private schools, and Johnson instead plans yet another giveaway for the super-rich instead. The next Labour government will invest in all schools, and provide a free healthy meal for all primary school pupils by ending the VAT tax break for private schools.”Here’s a breakdown of who makes up the cabinet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17f9be0f959efc37059e923011f64ceeec8a6695/0_519_4090_2454/master/4090.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4758c23b07504ece1d3bd2f3fa278c74","title":"scientists find evidence of ghost population of ancient humans","story":"Traces of unknown ancestor emerged when researchers analysed genomes from west African populationsScientists have found evidence for a mysterious “ghost population” of ancient humans that lived in Africa about half a million years ago and whose genes live on in people today.Traces of the unknown ancestor emerged when researchers analysed genomes from west African populations and found that up to a fifth of their DNA appeared to have come from the missing relatives.Geneticists suspect that the ancestors of modern west Africans interbred with the yet-to-be-discovered archaic humans tens of thousands of years ago, much as ancient Europeans once mated with Neanderthals.“In the west Africans we looked at, all have ancestry from this unknown archaic population,” said Sriram Sankararaman, a computational biologist who led the research at the University of California in Los Angeles.Unlike today, the world was once home to many related species or subspecies of human. And when they stumbled upon one another, mating was not out of the question. As a result, modern Europeans carry a smattering of Neanderthal genes, while indigenous Australians, Polynesians and Melanesians carry genes from Denisovans, another group of archaic humans.Previous studies have hinted that other ancient humans once roamed Africa, but without any fossils or DNA to pore over, researchers have struggled to learn more about them.Arun Durvasula and Sankararaman obtained 405 genomes from four west African populations and used statistical techniques to work out whether an influx of genes from interbreeding was likely to have happened in the distant past. The analysis suggested that it had in every case.The scientists went on to scour the African genomes for chunks of DNA that looked different to modern human genes. This allowed them to pull out sequences that most probably came from an ancient relative. By comparing these with genes from Neanderthals and Denisovans, they concluded that the DNA had to come from an unknown group of archaic humans.The findings are far from definitive, but according to the scientists’ best estimates, the ghost population split from the ancestors of Neanderthals and modern humans between 360,000 and 1m years ago. The group of perhaps 20,000 iniduals then bred with the ancestors of modern west Africans at some point in the past 124,000 years.But other explanations are possible, Sankararaman said. There may have been multiple waves of mating over many thousands of years. Or a number of different populations of so-far-unknown archaic human relatives. “It’s very likely that the true picture is much more complicated,” he said. Details of the work are published in Science Advances.The researchers are now keen to delve into the ancient genes and work out what they do. One possibility is that west Africans retained the DNA because it helped them to survive and breed.“It is always interesting and useful to see researchers applying new methods to try to get a better idea of what ancient populations might have been like,” said John Hawks, an anthropologist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, who was not involved in the study.“It’s an exciting moment because these studies open a window showing us that there is much more than we thought to learn about our ancestors. But actually knowing who those ancestors were, how they interacted, and where they existed is going to take fieldwork to find their fossil and archaeological remains.“We do not know what this African population may have been. It is tempting to speculate. But I’ve got to say it is just too soon to know. We haven’t discovered enough fossils in most of Africa to say we know what was there.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a58339433b9beb6a5ab14ed1194217e63a70f5f4/0_356_1140_684/master/1140.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=df6e564bc97f68ae863db8ff9d7dfebe","title":"not just a space potato nasa unveils astonishing details of most distant object ever visited arrokoth","story":"It’s red, it’s cold, it’s 4bn years old: Nasa data from Arrokoth reveals ‘profound truths’ about the solar systemNasa has unveiled details of the most distant object visited by a spacecraft, in observations that could resolve a decades-long puzzle of how the planets first emerged from the hazy dust of the early solar system.The ultra-red, peanut-shaped object, called Arrokoth, sits located 1bn miles beyond Pluto in the Kuiper belt, a vast donut-shaped region that is home to thousands of dwarf planets and icy objects. Nasa’s New Horizons spacecraft made a flyby on New Year’s Day 2019, but the extreme distance from Earth means the probe is still beaming back data gathered during the brief encounter.Prof Bill McKinnon, a planetary scientist at Washington University in St Louis, who is lead author of the latest work, said the findings made at Arrokoth are so significant that the New Horizons team had been left debating whether they would ultimately be viewed as more important than the probe’s first encounter with Pluto in 2015.“Arrokoth has turned out to be astonishing in terms of what we’ve learned from it,” he said before a presentation at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) this week. “It tells us some profound truths about our solar system. This is not just a space potato. It’s a remarkable world that’s told us a remarkable story.”Arrokoth’s position in the Kuiper belt marks what was once the fringes of the cloud of dust and gas, known as the solar nebula, that surrounded the newly formed sun. In this region, planetary development was arrested at an early stage because of the lower density of material available. Exploring these frozen wastelands allows scientists to peer back in time to an epoch when the seeds of today’s planets were being sown.“This place is very far from the sun – so far that the temperatures are nearly at absolute zero,” said Dr Alan Stern, New Horizons’ principal investigator. “That preserves objects in a kind of stasis or time capsule.”For decades, scientists have wrestled with two competing scenarios for how planetary formation kicked off. In the first, known as hierarchical accretion, small grains and pebbles zipped around occasionally bashing into each other with enough force to stick, making bigger and bigger objects. Gradually, over millions of years, planets accumulated matter though random, forceful collisions.Under a second scenario, known as cloud collapse, certain regions of the nebula had a higher density of particles and these clumps were drawn towards each other, until they spontaneously gravitationally collapsed. Collisions were gentle and the planets were “born big”, with objects tens or hundreds of miles in diameter emerging within hundreds of years.Arrokoth’s appearance and composition provide compelling evidence in support of the cloud collapse theory. “The imagery shows no signs of violence, no fractures, the two lobes don’t looks smashed together,” said Stern, who is based at Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado.Everything about Arrokoth, he said, points towards a gentle coalescence. The object’s two lobes are also uniform in colour and composition, both having ultra-red surfaces containing organic compounds, which implies the fragments were orbiting nearby each other, rather than coming from disparate parts of the nebula. The findings, along with other details of Arrokoth’s appearance and composition, appear in three papers in the journal Science.Prof Andrew Coates, head of planetary science at the Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College London, said: “These results show clear evidence that Arrokoth’s two lobes came together very gently and stuck, at just a brisk human’s walking pace on Earth, rather than in a high speed collision.“Although there is evidence for faster collisions in the inner solar system later, such as when the moon formed from a large object hitting Earth, this work shows that much slower, more dignified interactions were important and common in the earliest history of the solar system.”New Horizons was launched in 2006 and conducted a six-month flyby study of Pluto and its moons in 2015, before firing its engines to swing its trajectory towards Arrokoth (at that time known as Ultima Thule).This summer, the team will conduct a survey with ground-based telescopes to see whether there are any objects in the Kuiper belt within reach of the probe’s limited fuel supplies. McKinnon described this as a “Hail Mary effort” for the mission, adding: “The chances aren’t large but they aren’t zero.”Either way, New Horizons will continue to sail through the Kuiper belt and beyond, with its steadily decaying plutonium fuel expected to keep communication open until the 2030s. “At some point, no matter what we do, the fuel lines will freeze and then it can’t point itself to the Earth,” said McKinnon. “It won’t be able to talk to Earth and we won’t be able to talk to it, although it will be able to talk to itself probably for quite some time.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/656d0d289ae1de0e0e41560728f3a5822ccd1e73/0_50_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=59963121011a8f18a70ae9df0dcf8315","title":"tell us have you been affected by the coronavirus","story":"If you have been affected or have any information or news tips for our journalists, we would like to hear from youThere has been a spike in deaths and new cases of the coronavirus in China after authorities changed the way they calculate the figures.

We will publish our assessment and next steps for online stakes and further protections later this year.”McArthur promised to review online stakes during an evidence session with the increasingly influential all-party parliamentary group on gambling harm.The group was instrumental in garnering cross-party support for similar restrictions on fixed-odds betting terminals that ended with maximum stakes on the controversial machines being cut from £100 to £2.The curbs in effect amounted to a ban on the machines, which were criticised for enticing gambling addicts, because they are uneconomic for high street bookmakers at that level of stake.Thursday’s share price fall was the second time the APPG’s intervention has led to hundreds of millions being shaved off the UK gambling industry’s stock market value.It shed nearly £1.2bn in November after the  revealed MPs had recommended stringent curbs on online casino games worth more than £2bn a year to the industry.The government has said it will review the 2005 Gambling Act, introduced under Tony Blair’s Labour administration, amid growing concern about gambling addiction and transgressions by the industry.There has been greater focus on issues such as the effect on children and vulnerable people of the volume of gambling advertising, the industry’s ties with football and the use of controversial VIP schemes to offer perks to losing players."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc2ead3c049727cf574bbadb3ef1e263b06c9720/28_114_1724_1035/master/1724.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=58c43d357dcd74250f455cda412eea90","title":"chris jordan backs england batsmen to come good in second t20 at durban","story":"• ‘I am confident of chasing pretty much any score,’ he adds• South Africa won first T20 thanks to Lungi Ngidi’s death bowlingChris Jordan could be forgiven for thinking he must prove himself against South Africa to secure a place at the T20 World Cup finals but the England seamer has an alternative perspective.Jordan has missed only one of England’s 28 sprint-format matches since the last T20 World Cup in 2016 and he is their second highest wicket-taker of all time with 56 at an average of 23.71. England have a number of fast-bowling options for the series, with game two at Kingsmead in Durban on Friday and England expected to be unchanged, while the injured Jofra Archer and Pat Brown will doubtless come into the reckoning as the year progresses.However, Jordan believes the culture fostered by England means he does not feel as if he is on trial. “One of the hallmarks of this team is that whoever is playing at the time is trying to keep their standards as high as possible,” he said. “I don’t think that the environment has been created in such a way to feel that pressure for a playing spot. You have that in any team anyway, but I don’t think that is the focus at all. We have a strong squad here and any XI we put out on any given day is strong enough to beat any team so those are the things that we are trying to focus on as much as possible.”The tourists made a false start under the East London floodlights after failing to chase seven in the final over as Lungi Ngidi’s death bowling helped South Africa win the first game of the three-match series. England came unstuck chasing a no-better-than-par 178. Jordan, who took two wickets in two balls, still backs the batsmen as they look to respond at Durban."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f938914f438b6931353e98231afbbbfbb7b3797/145_394_4458_2675/master/4458.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=328a38bca2546cedc5c76a840b66155d","title":"f1 figures pledge safety first over vietnam gp if coronavirus spreads","story":"McLaren’s Zak Brown believes Formula One would be right to once more put its participants first if it had to postpone or cancel the Vietnam Grand Prix as it did on Wednesday with the Chinese GP. The Shanghai race was postponed because of the coronavirus outbreak and although F1 chiefs hope the Hanoi showpiece will take place as scheduled on 5 April, a similar outcome could occur if the threat increases.After the Chinese meeting was called off focus immediately turned to neighbouring Vietnam, which shares a land border with China. Speaking at the launch of his team’s new car, the MCL35, at the team headquarters, Brown, McLaren’s chief executive, insisted personnel safety was paramount and F1 would respect that.“We are going to monitor the situation,” he said. “We would never do anything that puts our people at risk and I don’t believe that F1 would.”The team’s 20-year-old British driver Lando Norris echoed his sentiments. “I am not so happy we can’t go to China because of the coronavirus,” he said. “But safety rises above all other things – money, sponsors and everything. It is a shame but all the decisions that have been made were made for the right reasons.”Norris, who said he has recently driven the Vietnam circuit on a simulator, accepted that if the race had to be pulled it would be correct to do so. “I would love to go there,” he said. “If we don’t get the chance to then obviously I won’t be so happy but that’s how it is.”The Hanoi race is due to be the first time F1 has held a meeting in Vietnam but with the outbreak still spreading it remains in doubt. On Thursday the Vietnamese authorities placed more than 10,000 people in the Son Loi farming region under quarantine after six new cases of the virus were discovered there. Son Loi is approximately 25 miles from Hanoi and this is the first mass quarantine imposed outside China since the outbreak began. Sixteen people have been infected with the virus in Vietnam and it has now claimed more than 1,350 lives worldwide.The threat is being taken very seriously in the country. The overland border crossing with China has been closed, with flights suspended. The government has also cancelled mass gatherings such as festivals across the country. Certain public walking zones in Hanoi where locals and tourists gather have also been closed.Brown maintained that the potential threat was of greater import than F1. “First and foremost it is a terrible situation for the world,” he said. “So hopefully it is resolved because other things such as sport don’t matter when it comes to situations like this.” He also confirmed that the team would not expect their personnel to put themselves at any risk: “We will have to deal with the situation as it unfolds but we would never put any McLaren employee in an uncomfortable situation.”Norris was eager to get to grips with the new car in testing, which begins in Barcelona next Wednesday. Last season he made an accomplished F1 debut, finishing in the points in 11 races, with best finishes of sixth place in Bahrain and Austria, and ending 11th in the drivers’ championship. Alongside Carlos Sainz Jr he helped McLaren take fourth in the championship, their best finish since 2012.“There are a lot of things I had to learn last year but the biggest would be the time and effort you have to put in to improve on things,” Norris said. “To work on problems and limitations and weaknesses for myself. Time and effort of self improvement is one of the biggest things that I take from last year.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5093e361e57cec3e05a917e3bd2747f41cc3487/62_0_1986_1192/master/1986.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=849bd94554237441358b59fbee7a2d47","title":"a little space review gecko mind the gap home manchester","story":"Home, ManchesterThe thin line between loneliness and connection is made manifest in Gecko and Mind the Gap’s surprising showIt’s apt that Gecko’s new collaboration with Mind the Gap has been commissioned by Home in Manchester, as in many ways A Little Space is about what home might mean for us. The title can be read two ways: a space of one’s own, some peace and quiet away from the outside world but also the limits and confinement of our four walls.The show is a tug of war between connection and isolation, company and solitude. Set in an apartment block, the performance moves fluidly between the atomised living spaces, where people exist in distant proximity. For some, home is a sweet escape. For others, it’s a burden that is (literally in one case) carried on the shoulders, weighing them down.The piece has the distinctive look and feel of a Gecko show, from the physicality to the swooping breaths to the inventive use of props, but Mind the Gap add new flavour to a familiar recipe. Devised with the company’s ensemble of learning-disabled artists, A Little Space is textured by the performers’ own experiences of loneliness and disconnection, as well as the occasional joy that can be found in one’s own company.In designer Rhys Jarman’s stripped-back room, enclosed by a cage of copper pipes, different lives overlap and intersect. Hands thrust through floorboards and whispers waft through walls. Furniture and limbs whirl through the space while lamps twinkle and sputter. Chris Swain’s versatile lighting – from eerie grey-green washes to the moveable lightboxes representing the apartment block – serves almost as an additional character, driving the fragmentary narrative forwards.As is to be expected from Gecko, this is visually stunning stuff, dotted with thrilling moments of surprise and ingenuity. There are also welcome flashes of humour: at one stage a man is dragged irresistibly towards the flickering allure of his television screen. But it’s perhaps at its best in those startling moments of connection, when ided lives suddenly – if only briefly – converge."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/34b7d5d8ac0c512a8bead03f22d690590ae4b81b/0_284_2311_1386/master/2311.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cb62658d1addb975a44dc2cf525d87b6","title":"alone in berlin review","story":"Royal and Derngate, NorthamptonModern-day echoes resound in Alistair Beaton’s adaptation of the novel about tiny acts of rebellion in 1940s Germany‘The plan…” says Anna Quangel (Charlotte Emmerson) with all the tact she can muster, “… it feels a bit small.” She doesn’t want to undermine her husband, Otto (played with buttoned-up dignity by Denis Conway), but she has a point. If their situation wasn’t so horrific, his plan would be comically minor.We’re in 1930s Germany and his idea is to resist the Nazi war machine by leaving handwritten slogans on postcards, where they may be discovered by his fellow Berliners. In Hans Fallada’s superb novel, based on a true story and now given a streamlined adaptation by Alistair Beaton, this act of defiance carries weight. Not only is it better than nothing but it has a disproportionately destabilising impact on the authorities. They are bullishly inept, just as the crooks who profiteer from a regime of hatred and suspicion are bumbling opportunists.James Dacre’s compelling production plays it less as black comedy than as expressionist nightmare. Charles Balfour lights the ensemble in stark relief against the false perspective of Jonathan Fensom’s monochrome set, while Jessica Walker acts as a cabaret narrator, singing songs by Orlando Gough that channel the dark irony of Kurt Weill. Anyone excited about David Tennant starring in CP Taylor’s Good this October should not miss this similar study of compromise and survival in times of tyranny.Lest we lull ourselves into believing such dilemmas have been consigned to history, Beaton nudges us into the present. “Nobody minds being lied to any more,” says Otto, prompting a knowing laugh. It reminds us that truth is the first casualty of war and calls on us to do something – anything – in the face of injustice."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/042ceedebfee2b9468bf107ba03bc1201389036a/0_452_4003_2401/master/4003.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9083c4bcccad7c7cb80040ab444ca09e","title":"the bee in me review unicorn theatre london","story":"Unicorn theatre, LondonIn Roland Schimmelpfennig’s play, three actors narrate a day in the life of a young person who uses imagination to escape a precarious existenceFor his first season in charge of the Unicorn, Justin Audibert spun a brilliant web of tales featuring the spider Anansi. After that arachnid trickster comes a bee story, similarly told by a trio of actors nimbly sharing the role of narrator.Written by German playwright Roland Schimmelpfennig and translated by David Tushingham, The Bee in Me is aimed at audiences over eight and isn’t as twee as that title may suggest. It can feel as stark and austere as its opening image: a single bed with white sheets but no one tucked into it. This, we are told, is where you sleep – and the show proceeds to use the second-person voice, with its nameless 10-year-old hero remaining conspicuously absent as we hear about a day in their life. As such, the audience are encouraged to imagine themselves experiencing the child’s life of neglect. But the narrators (Akshay Sharan, Emily Burnett and James Russell-Morley) also capture the internal dialogue of a young person navigating a precarious life.With parents who switch between absent and abusive, the child escapes into entwined dreamworlds: approaching everyday scenarios as if they are levels in a computer game and imagining themselves as a bee, buzzing away from this smoke-stained flat, its dizzy flight mimicked by Jon McLeod’s cascading electronic score. Rachel Bagshaw’s production excels at abruptly contrasting these warm fantasies with harsh reality. One minute, the lights on the walls of Khadija Raza’s set glow to represent nectar the next, it is a cold school morning and the child is late, dressed in dirty uniform and anxiously exiting the flat, making video game-style split-second decisions to bypass a drunkenly slumbering father.You’d expect more humour from a kinetic episode where the bee is swatted about a classroom, or when the child makes a canny escape from a pair of bullying brothers, but there is precious little levity. How could there be when the stakes are this high? When resilience and imagination are what you rely on when the family fridge has beer but no food when your day is defined by cold, hunger and fear and when going to bed isn’t a refuge. Bursting with a final crescendo of hope, this is a demanding and often upsetting hour but essential too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4bfc994074ce84aa2d7d35c37e35a32d75971060/682_471_3484_2091/master/3484.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ba436bddd416f226463a46b12a67e6ae","title":"amazon echo buds review alexa in your ear with bose noise reduction","story":"First Amazon true wireless earbuds offer a lot for the money but need attention in some areasAmazon’s first attempt at a set of true wireless earbuds gets a lot right, with Bose active noise reduction technology and hands-free Alexa.At £119.99, the Echo Buds undercut rivals, some of which cost more than twice as much. Their design is generic: large, kidney-shaped with a glossy touch panel on the outside and a standard silicone eartip on the inside.The eartip supports the earbud with the majority of the rest of the body sitting outside the ear. But the earbuds are large and heavy at 7.6g each, meaning they sit proud of your ear. They started to hurt after 30 minutes.Three sizes of silicone eartips are supplied along with three sizes of wings for securing the earbuds in place if needed, which I didn’t.The touch panel on each supports two gestures on each earbud: double-tap or tap and hold. Each earbud can do different things, choosing from pauseplay, track skip, activation of Alexa or SiriGoogle Assistant, muting the microphones, activating active noise reduction or transparency modes, with or without pausing the music, which is great to have.Taking one earbud out pauses the music too, which resumes when you put it back in. The only control that’s missing is volume, which you will have to adjust on your phone.Activating the controls can be a mixed bag: sometimes they work as intended at other points both gestures can take a few goes to register. You end up tapping harder and harder, which makes loud banging sounds in your ear. It’s also difficult to insert the earbuds without activating some sort of control.The Echo Buds sound good for the money. They produce a decent amount of low end sound that doesn’t butcher the rest of the tones. Mids and highs come through clearly, separation of instruments is good and they have a fairly wide soundscape. Overall, they are an easy listen with a pleasing sound at low to medium volumes, but they do not produce the sort of sparkling audio that lets you hear new notes in your favourite pieces.The Echo Buds have Bose active noise reduction (ANR) technology, which the firm says differs from its active noise cancelling (ANC) system by the level of noise it can deal with.The Echo Buds do a good job of reducing the amount of background noise that leaks into your music. They managed to significantly reduce general road sounds while walking about London and the noise of commutes on trains. They perform slightly better than the Libratone Track Air+ but not quite as well as the AirPods Pro or the Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700.Another nice feature is the ability to pause the music, deactivate noise reduction and activate an ambient listening mode, which uses the microphones to pipe the sounds of the outside world into your ears – great for suddenly halting your music to listen to an announcement.The other big feature is Alexa integration. You can choose to have the Echo Buds listen out for the “Alexa” wake word in the same way an Echo smart speaker might. Or you can manually activate Alexa with a gesture.They work in mostly the same way as many other earbuds with similar functionality. Apple’s AirPods work with Siri in the same way, while many have similar Google Assistant integration.Saying “Alexa” triggers Amazon’s voice assistant, which on the whole behaves the same as it does through an Echo smart speaker, including voice calls to other Echo devices, smart home control, access various skills and answer questions.It can also perform basic actions on your phone, such as playing music from Spotify and adjusting the volume. As a phone-based assistant Alexa is OK but it’s not as good as Google Assistant for general management of your daily tasks (if you use Gmail etc) or Siri for integration into the iPhone.I ended up switching Alexa to a button to invoke, rather than listening out for the wake word. If you don’t want to use Alexa you don’t have to – instead you can use the voice assistant built into your phone.Call quality was good. Recipients said I came through loud and clear, beating many rival earbuds for clarity in quiet environments and dealing relatively well with background noise with just a slight echo. On my end of the call the option for sidetone was welcome but the earbuds let a lot of background noise into the call.The Echo Buds offer nearly five hours of continuous playback with three complete recharges available from the case, making up to about 20 hours of battery life all in. A 15-minute trip in the case is enough to charge the earbuds for about two hours of playback.The earbuds snap into place in the case using magnets and pin connectors. The case is a similar matt black plastic from which Amazon’s Fire tablets are made. It feels a little cheap despite being relatively robust. There’s a microUSB charging port on one side and a button for pairing on the bottom. It would have been better to use USB-C given most smartphones are now charged via the newer connector.The case is fairly big and heavy compared to the best true wireless earbuds released in the last year, coming in at about twice the size of the AirPods Pro or Jabra Elite 75t cases. It’s still pocketable but not as convenient and easy to carry as smaller options. It could fit into only a large money pocket in one particular pair of jeans.Like most true wireless earbuds the Echo Buds and their case contain batteries that should last many years. However, they cannot be replaced, ultimately making them disposable. Amazon offers replacement earbuds outside of warranty for £59.Amazon ticks a lot of boxes with the Echo Buds: they sound good for the money, have noise reduction technology from Bose and don’t break the bank.They also have the option of full Alexa integration, including wake-word support – like a smart speaker in your ears – or you can turn off Amazon’s voice assistant. A four- to-five-hour battery is reasonable but not anywhere near class leading, while the case is of average size and function.The biggest downsides are the size of the earbuds, which stick out quite far and were uncomfortable after extended listening, and controls that were unreliable sometimes. Like most other true wireless earbuds you can’t change the battery, so they are ultimately disposable too.If you can overlook these niggles then the Echo Buds offer a lot of bang for your buck: their cost undercuts rivals while offering good sound and noise reduction.Pros: Bose ANR, good sound, reasonable battery life, good ambient mode, Alexa integration, undercut rivals on price, solid connection, good call quality, can use either earbud independentlyCons: large in the ear, no aptX, controls can be unreliable at times, disposable, case a little bigger than rivals, microUSB charging socket This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

It doesn’t seem to make sense spending that sort of money on outdated memory technology for a 10-year-old laptop.What is the best way to set up Windows 10 so it runs fast on relatively limited memory? Is it worth using a different browser to Chrome? Is Microsoft Office too much of a resource hog?There must be a lot of perfectly good machines awaiting an opportunity for a second life. MattChip costs are driven by production volumes, so obsolete types of memory are no longer in production, or are very expensive to produce. Often, there are alternatives, such as buying second-hand memory modules, and cannibalising laptops sold on eBay for “spares or repair”.In this case, there are very few second-hand modules for sale. When DDR2 was standard, many laptops had 2GB, but very few had the 8GB that would need two 4GB modules.On the bright side, 4GB laptops have been common for most of the past decade, and some people still buy them. It’s better to have 8GB, but 4GB is usable.Microsoft has spent more than a decade making Windows more memory efficient. A laptop that could run Vista well in January 2007 can probably run Windows 10 well today.Of course, Microsoft had ulterior motives. One was to enable PC manufacturers to make cheaper laptops. Another was to enable Windows to run on smartphones and tablets that only had 1GB or 2GB. Probably neither of those is still important thanks to tumbling memory prices and the failure of Windows smartphones.A couple of years ago, Microsoft experimented with a version of Windows 10 called Windows Lean, but it didn’t use less memory. Its main purpose was to fit on tablets and cheap laptops with only 16GB or 32GB of storage. Thankfully, that idea seems to have been abandoned. Nobody should be buying laptops with less than 128GB of SSD, or a bigger hard drive.The simplest speed-up routine is to tell Windows to optimise itself for performance. To do this, type “adjust” in the Start menu’s search box and click “Adjust the appearance and performance of Windows”. This will bring up the Performance Options properties sheet from the Control Panel. Select “Adjust for best performance” and Windows will drop all the fancy graphical effects such as sliding things in and out of view. You can use the Custom settings to retain any features you want to keep, such as “Show window contents while dragging”.Next, run the Control Panel, type “power” into the search box in the top right and select “Choose a power plan”. Most laptops are set to “Balanced”. “Power saver” will reduce performance to extend battery life. “High performance” will deliver the best performance but use more energy.When we were using Windows XP and Vista, geeks could improve on Windows’ use of memory. Those days have more or less gone. Windows 10 makes such good use of memory, its swapfile (pagefile.sys, hidden on your hard drive) and other resources that it is best left to do its thing.In my experience, Windows 10 can use anything from 1.2GB to about 3.5GB or more, depending on how much memory you have. If you have more, it will use more. What happens when it runs out of space? It saves the pages of code it’s not using to the swapfile and reloads them into RAM only when they are needed. That’s one reason why fitting an SSD makes a laptop feel much more responsive: swapfile pages reload much faster.In reality, Windows 10’s memory management is more complicated than that. It distinguishes between many types of memory, depending on whether pages are in use, can be swapped out when necessary, can be overwritten because they are no longer needed, or free. Type resmon into Windows 10’s search box, run the Resource Monitor app, and click the Memory tab for a coloured representation of the RAM used for different purposes, including “hardware reserved”.Sophisticated memory management techniques – including compression – make it hard to know how much memory any particular program is using. Should you include pages that are in RAM but not in use, that are in the swapfile, or use shared resources? Windows provides a lot of common code through dll library files, and if six programs are using the same megabytes of shared code, it’s counted six times instead of once.Microsoft’s Process Explorer provides more details. Double-clicking a program’s name tells you how it’s using memory, how much code is shared, and how much virtual memory (ie swapfile space) it’s using. The Working Set Private number, which excludes shared code and swapfile space, tells you how much real RAM a program is using at the time. Obviously, it can vary. As a general indicator, the Peak Working Set number is probably as good as any.Once your laptop is up and running, a quick check with either utility will tell you if any programs are using more memory than they are worth.The Task Manager has Start-up and Services tabs that tell Windows what to load when it boots. Both are more or less obsolete. It is worth checking for start-up programs and disabling ones you don’t want, but do that from the Apps section of the Settings (cogwheel) app.When we were using clunky old XP and Vista, disabling services could make a big difference, and some of us swore by Black Viper’s guides. Today, I wouldn’t make the effort, and Black Viper stopped providing service configurations with the April 2018 version of Windows 10.If a process or service “goes rogue” – which can include a single browser tab – it’s easier to find it in Process Explorer, right-click it, then suspend, restart or kill it. Task Manager also lets you suspend and kill tasks, which can be handy if malware grabs your browser.Every Windows browser will run in 4GB, but the “lightest” common browser is Microsoft Edge. This is partly because it’s low on features and extensions, and partly because it’s a modern Windows Store app. Store apps can be suspended in the background, though this is hidden away in the Privacy section of the Settings app, under “Background apps”.But Microsoft is now switching to a heavier version of Edge based on open source Chromium code, just like Google Chrome, Opera, Vivaldi, Brave and many others, except Firefox.There’s not much to choose between the Chromium-based browsers: they all consume massive amounts of memory and resources. Opera has generally been the lightest, but “Edgium” could change that. I’ve been using the beta test version and it works well. Also, the code has been de-Googled, which is a plus point for people avoiding Google’s “surveillance capitalism”.Otherwise, the keys to managing browser memory are not to install many extensions and not to open too many tabs. If you can’t help having hundreds, use a “lazy loading” browser. With lazy loading turned on, the browser will only reload or refresh current tabs when you click on them. I once had more than 600 tabs in Firefox and about 300 in Vivaldi, and both still worked perfectly. Alternatively install a tab suspender such as the Great Suspender for Chrome, which unloads dormant tabs but saves the URL so you can go straight back to it if you want. If the browser does slow down, just close and re-open it to free up some memory.The old advice about turning it off and on again has been replaced by “restart your browser”.Have you got a question?

All but two of the deaths have been in China.In addition to the 13,332 extra cases, Chinese authorities on Thursday reported a further 1,820 laboratory-confirmed cases.The WHO is now working hard to try to get further details of when the extra cases of what is now being called Covid-19 occurred, to have a true picture of how the epidemic has been developing in Wuhan and other cities in Hubei.On the positive side, it meant Hubei’s doctors would be able to report cases more quickly because they no longer have to wait for lab confirmation, said Ryan.The political fallout from the outbreak also escalated on Thursday with the firing of Hubei’s party chief, the party chief of Wuhan and the head of China’s Hong Kong and Macau affairs office. Ying Yong, the new party chief of Hubei, came up through the ranks in Zhejiang – where President Xi Jinping, previously served as party secretary – and was also part of anti-corruption campaigns, the president’s signature initiative.“This is clearly Xi’s move,” said Dali Yang, a professor of political science focusing on China at the University of Chicago. “The stakes are high and he needed time to find the right people for the positions to salvage the Hubei, Wuhan situation.” On Wednesday, the state-run China Daily reported that a powerful Beijing official parachuted into Wuhan to supervise the fight against the virus had reprimanded local officials for failing to organise treatment quickly enough for people reporting to hospitals with symptoms.Thursday’s jump in infections may have been another impetus for the purges. “I suspect Xi would have wanted the personnel change to project a sense that he is in control of the situation. The bad numbers undermine that message,” said Sam Crane, who teaches Chinese politics and ancient philosophy at Williams College in the US.Prof Paul Hunter, a coronavirus expert from the University of East Anglia, said cases that in the past would only have been considered suspect would now fell into the confirmed bracket. Many would-be Covid-19 cases that would have been confirmed if lab tests had been done, but the figures would also include some people who had pneumonia not caused by the coronavirus.It is a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. Many of those initially infected either worked or frequently shopped in the Huanan seafood wholesale market in the centre of the Chinese city.New and troubling viruses usually originate in animal hosts. Ebola and flu are other examples – severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (Mers) are both caused by coronaviruses that came from animals.\u0026nbspThe virus causes\u0026nbsppneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. If people are admitted to hospital, they may get support for their lungs and other organs as well as fluids. Recovery will depend on the strength of their immune system. Many of those who have died were already in poor health.China’s national health commission has confirmed human-to-human transmission, and there have been such transmissions elsewhere. As of 12 February there are now 45,182 confirmed cases and 1,115 deaths. There are cases in 28 other countries outside\u0026nbspChina, with deaths recorded in one case in Hong Kong, and one case in the Philippines. The number of people to have contracted the virus overall could be far higher, as people with mild symptoms may not have been detected.The number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK has doubled from four to eight after four more people in Brighton were diagnosed with the infection over the weekend.One of the other four confirmed cases is being treated at the HCID unit at the Royal Free hospital in north London, and the two Chinese nationals who tested positive for Coronavirus in York are being treated at the HCID centre in Newcastle.Unless you have recently travelled to China or been in contact with someone infected with the virus, then you should treat any cough or cold symptoms as normal. The\u0026nbspNHS advises\u0026nbspthat people should call 111 instead of visiting the GP’s surgery as there is a risk they may infect others.Health experts are starting to say it could become a pandemic, but right now it falls short of what the WHO would consider to be one. A pandemic, in WHO terms, is “the worldwide spread of a disease”. Coronavirus cases have been confirmed in about 25 countries outside China, but by no means in all 195 on the WHO’s list.There is no need to panic. The spread of the virus outside China is worrying but not an unexpected development. The WHO has declared the outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern, and says there is a “window of opportunity” to halt the spread of the disease. The key issues are how transmissible this new coronavirus is between people and what proportion become severely ill and end up in hospital. Often viruses that spread easily tend to have a milder impact.“The issue remains how are we going to be able to say what is happening with the trajectory of the outbreak when the cases definitions change midway through the epidemic?” Hunter said. “Will the figures be backdated? Also, what about cases that have a clinical diagnosis but negative lab tests, are they included in the confirmed cases or not?“I have no problem with people using different case definitions but please be consistent or if you do change, run both in parallel for a few days so that no one believes the epidemic has suddenly got a lot worse. I suspect but can’t be certain that the underlying trend is still downwards.”The rest of China is only reporting confirmed cases of Covid-19 infection. So are the 24 countries that have declared cases, which so far number 447 outside of China with two deaths – in the Philippines and Japan. “We are not seeing a dramatic increase outside of China,” said Ryan. The largest cluster was the 218 confirmed cases on the Japanese cruise ship Diamond Princess.Nor, he said, are they seeing any significant shift in the pattern of mortality or severe illness. Those who were severely ill tended to be male and over 40 – and the more severe, the older they are, with the most dangerous cases in the 60s, 70s and 80s, Ryan said.He suggested the best hope in the near future lay in the trials of existing antiviral drugs, which include some that are in use against Aids and HIV. Trials have started in China and it is hoped they will be extended to countries such as Singapore and Japan, both of which have significant numbers of cases. “You can imagine being a frontline clinician at the moment. Knowing which drug works would be a magical gift,” said Ryan.The change in China to include what are known as “probable cases” appeared aimed at heading off complaints about the availability of tests and treatment for residents, as well as questions about whether officials have been underreporting cases.The shortage of the testing kits has meant many sick residents have been unable to seek treatment, with hospital admission contingent on the test result. Health workers have been calling for authorities to broaden the parameters for diagnosing in order to treat more patients. Some have also questioned the reliability of the tests.The crisis has also deepened in Hong Kong, where the education minister announced that schools would remain closed until at least the middle of March. They have been closed since the start of the lunar new year at the end of January.In Vietnam, the authorities announced the lockdown of the commune of Son Loi, a farming region about 25 miles from Hanoi, for 20 days. Checkpoints were set up around the commune and health officials wearing protective suits sprayed disinfectant on vehicles."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e31491232658d60d98f80bd44966b7fa940b9208/0_150_4415_2650/master/4415.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bad97edcada4a8f0080ca89db614a2fe","title":"syria us troops mission qamishli quagmire","story":"Since Trump abruptly ended his pact with the Kurds, the US presence in the country’s north-east has been stuck in a quagmireAmerican battle trucks stuck in the mud, besieged by angry Kurdish villagers, and the Russian army trying to mediate their escape. After more than five years fighting Isis in northern Syria, it wasn’t supposed to end like this.But for US military officials, the scene near the city of Qamishli was a stark reminder of the incongruous end to the war against the terror group and partnership with the ally that had helped them prevail.One man was killed and another injured in the confused incident, which started when a US patrol came under attack near a checkpoint manned by forces loyal to Bashar al-Assad on Wednesday.It was a rare direct clash between US and Syrian government forces, but ever since Donald Trump abruptly ended Washington’s pact with the Kurds last October, what remains of the US presence in north-eastern Syria has had a difficult time.Without a clearly defined mission of its own, after exposing their allies to an attack from the Turks, and yielding control of the province to the Russians, US troops have more or less stayed out of the fray in the eastern deserts – where oilfields, not the menace of global terror, have become their new reason for staying.When US convoys do come to town, even to once-friendly strongholds like Qamishli, a warm welcome is no longer assured. As armoured columns left the city in October, they were pelted with rocks and fruit. The bases they had occupied in the grinding fight against extremists were taken over by Russian forces within hours of their departure, and the Kurdish leaders who had counted on their patronage found themselves dealing with new sheriffs.Five months since the US pullout, Rojava, as the province is known in northern Syria, has settled into a new routine. The power politics of the US presence has been replaced by a different way of doing things. To some Kurdish officials, the conflict in the north-east has become more of a microcosm of the broader Syrian war than ever an ascendant Russia, an uninterested US, Syrian loyalists looking for leverage – and the local Kurds caught between the competing ambitions of Ankara and Moscow.With little to offer any more, a US convoy was always likely to face a cold reception – especially if it wandered into a village that had remained avowedly loyal to the Syrian central government throughout the civil war.The hamlet of Khirbet Ammu, just east of Qamishli, was one such place Syrian flags at its entrance displaying the area’s fealty. The Arab village, along with a network of nearby roads and the city’s airport, had remained a no-go zone for opponents of Bashar al-Assad. Even neighbouring Kurds are hesitant to enter without good reason.Roads in and around Khirbet Ammu are controlled by Russian and Syrian forces and navigating them has become a fraught proposition.Video from the scene shows US troops surrounded by angry locals, shouting: “What do you want from our country? What is your business here?” Replying in English, a soldier tells the shouting man: “Back off!”Other clips show men firing AK-47 rifles and other small arms.American military officials describe the mission as a “routine patrol” and say they were forced to fire on villagers in self-defence.In addition to the US truck stuck in the mud, another had a flat tyre. A US fighter jet over flew the village during the clash. Russian troops were credited with calming things.After Trump’s sudden withdrawal, a strong pushback from his senior aides and Pentagon chiefs succeeded in keeping about 500 troops and armour near Deir Ezzor in far eastern Syria. The stated reason was to safeguard oilfields.“But that was just to get his attention,” said one regional official. “The US president doesn’t understand much else and they had to speak in his language.”Other officials have said keeping a US presence in the region is vital in other ways, especially maintaining some relations with the Kurds – but also to act as a counterweight to Iranian ambitions.Since the US left, a Turkish incursion, led by Arab proxy forces from elsewhere in Syria, has secured two strongholds along the Kurdish border that have raised strident claims of an ethnic re-engineering of the region. Ankara has said it intends to send refugees it has housed throughout the war to live in two zones it has slated for Syrian exiles.Brett McGurk, the former US envoy on Isis who quit over a previous move to withdraw troops – and has remained a strident critic of Trump’s Syria policy ever since – suggested the scene in Khirbet Ammu reflected a deepening quagmire for US troops."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2474cda96bdc704246d2c11126873d181b9a659e/1378_260_4092_2455/master/4092.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=90751fd57fd30f06f54348a2c7a63b14","title":"what is covid 19","story":"The new coronavirus was first encountered in Wuhan in 2019The new coronavirus, now known as Covid-19, was first encountered in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.Like other coronaviruses, it originated in animals and then migrated to humans.

Many of those who have died were already in poor health.Another key unknown, of which scientists should get a clearer idea in the coming weeks, is how contagious Covid-19 is. A crucial difference is that unlike flu, there is no vaccine for the new coronavirus, which means it is more difficult for vulnerable members of the population – elderly people or those with existing respiratory or immune problems – to protect themselves. Hand-washing and avoiding other people if you feel unwell are important. One sensible step is to get the flu vaccine, which will reduce the burden on health services if the outbreak turns into a wider epidemic.The name Covid-19 was announced on 11 February by the World Health Organization. The director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said: “We had to find a name that did not refer to a geographical location, an animal, an inidual or group of people, and which is also pronounceable and related to the disease. Having a name matters to prevent the use of other names that can be inaccurate or stigmatising.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b36c7a1f36b0630427c26eaa1572c1ce409c8a24/58_239_3322_1993/master/3322.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=295a68ad9b42fd5e4c00c99040b58f99","title":"rios world famous school for samba in pictures","story":"Such is the reputation of the Paraíso de Tuiuti samba school in Rio de Janeiro that dancers travel from as far afield as the UK, Russia and Japan to train in the ways of hip-swivelling and hot-stepping.

Photograph: Dylan VaughanA biking enthusiast is set to turn heads as he attempts to cycle in a novel way from Ireland’s top to toe to raise money to help those with sight loss.Duane Phillips has given himself 48 hours to complete the journey from Malin Head to Mizen Head in his colourful velomobile. The trip, to be undertaken from Good Friday to Easter Sunday, seeks to raise funds for NCBI, a charity close to his heart after a friend went blind.Mr Phillips, who is originally from Manchester in the UK, moved to Rathlogin, Co Kilkenny 10 years, at the height of the recession.“I’ve 48 hours to do the trip but aiming to just start and just keep going. In theory I should be able to finish in less than 24 hours but if I come in in under 36 hours I’ll be happy.“My friend Dave, who was also a workmate, went blind a couple of years ago, his eyesight wasn’t the best to begin with then, after a gardening accident, he went completely blind which as you can imagine this seriously impacted on his life.”‘Payback’Mr Phillips said NCBI, Ireland’s national charity for those who deal with sight loss, helped his friend “come to terms with his disability. So as payback for looking after my friend I’m trying to raise a few quid for them during the 600km trip.”Never one to shirk a challenge, he has taken part in many novel challenges, including travelling on a scooter along the Wild Atlantic Way to fundraise for Aoibheann’s Pink Tie charity. For this trip, he is using his blue WAW velomobile.He said the contraption – named after its creator, Frederik Van De Walle – “arrived in late August and I’ve been out training in it every weekend”, causing some amusement on the roads of Kilkenny, Laois and Tipperary.He believes the velomobile is “an ideal short-range commuting vehicle” for Ireland’s congested cities. “Put it in electric assist mode, which requires the minimal effort to crank the velomobile up to 25 kmh, and what you have in reality is a single-seater electric car.”While he is hoping to raise up to €5,000 for the NCBI during the trip, it’s clear this won’t be his last. “My father is 74 years old, an engineer, and still rides round on a Kawasaki 1440 motorbike, and it’s from him that I’ve inherited his adventurous spirit.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4173035.1581628399!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"aodh%C3%A1n %C3%B3 r%C3%ADord%C3%A1in and ged nash in talks over labour leadership","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Ged Nash with  Labour Party leader Brendan Howlin at a pre-election event. Photograph: Alan Betson Labour TDs Aodhán Ó Ríordáin and Ged Nash are understood to be in consultation about which one of them should stand for the leadership of the Labour Party.Sources close to the Tipperary TD Alan Kelly confirmed on Thursday night that he will be a candidate. Mr Kelly is understood to have been in contact with a large number of supporters in recent day with a view to making a bid for the leadership.Mr Ó Ríordáin and Mr Nash are close politically, and party sources said that they would be unlikely to run against each other. The two men were seen having coffee together in Dublin on Thursday.However, there is concern that as both TDs have just been re-elected to the Dail, having lost their seats in 2016, they may need to consolidate their positions in their respective constituencies. Mr Kelly held his seat in 2016 and again at last week’s election. However, despite being one of the party’s most high profile TDs – he was especially prominent during the cervical check controversy – he has sometimes tended to be isolated in the parliamentary party. He failed to secure a nomination from any of his colleagues to run for the leadership when Joan Burton stepped down in 2016, meaning that Brendan Howlin was unopposed for the leadership.But party sources accept that Mr Kelly is likely to be a candidate this time. Even if he does not obtain a nomination from his parliamentary party colleagues, he can be nominated by five constituency councils. Cork East TD Seán Sherlock has ruled himself out of contention. The executive board of the party will meet on Saturday to appoint a returning officer and set the ground rules for the election, a party spokesman said. That will be followed by a meeting of the party’s central council, which will open nominations for the forthcoming Seanad election.HustingsThe contest is expected to take about six weeks, and a series of hustings – assuming there is a contest – will be organised by the party. Other election events are likely to be organised by inidual constituencies. Only party TDs are eligible for the post, and candidates must be nominated by either two TDs (they can nominate themselves) or five constituency councils. All members of the party have a vote.Mr Howlin announced his resignation on Wednesday after another disappointing election for the Labour Party, albeit one in which it managed to win new seats with a younger generation of TDs to replace the loss of seats held by Joan Burton and Jan O’Sullivan.

How can a government emerge from the confusion?The first working week since that game-changing vote is nearing an end. The big three are still coming to terms with the results, along with the smaller parties and independents also caught up in the political conundrum. Everyone is exhausted. An elated Sinn Féin, having even surprised itself with a stellar performance at the ballot box, is still flying on the fumes of success. The smiling Greens and SocDems are also operating on adrenalin. Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael are still traumatised. But one thing never changes in Leinster House – the evergreen mantra of politicians from all parties and none was pressed into action as soon as the weary troops returned to Kildare Street: Nobody wants an election at this point in time. Sinn Féin TDs, having convincingly secured the most votes from an electorate hell-bent on demanding a change in how the country is run and how politics is done, say the people expressly gave them a mandate to govern and, effectively, the keys to Government Buildings. But party realists know the seat numbers don’t add up for them, even with the addition of smaller parties and a rag-tag assortment of independents. One of the other two main parties must come on board.Playing it coolFine Gael has blankly refused and is not for turning. Fianna Fáil has categorically ruled out Sinn Féin too. On Thursday in Leinster House, among the dazed but delighted newbies exploring the complex and the hurt and downcast former deputies wandering the precincts, Fine Gael was gone to ground, Fianna Fáil was sequestered in a basement, windowless room and Sinn Féin’s new, expanded Dáil team was busy stealing a march on them by grabbing all the attention and shouting loudly about an “appetite for change”.In a scenario where the Dáil seat numbers don’t add up to compile a working majority, optics are hugely important. Mary Lou McDonald marshalled her forces (with added Gerry Adams along for a gawk) and led them on their maiden voyage across the plinth following a parliamentary party meeting across the road in Buswells hotel. It seems some of the new TDs were only meeting colleagues for the first time, with a lot of hurried introductions going on. Journalists were allowed into the packed Georgian Room to hear the leader’s speech, although the party press office had clarified the previous evening that the meeting itself was private and a question and answer session with Mary Lou would be facilitated back at Leinster House later on in the afternoon. This is not particularly unusual, despite a Daily Mail journalist getting very hot under the collar over this disgraceful attempt to curtail press freedom. Republican dittyA deep voice rose from a seat along the wall near the top of the room. “The Man from the Daily Mail,” boomed Gerry Adams. This was a reference to a republican ditty of the same name, and of the type which might have been sung by a victorious Sinn Féin TD after an election count until intimations of government curtailed the singing of IRA songs in polite society.The former Sinn Féin leader is still wearing an immobilisation boot following an iPad related accident. Gerry was at home writing with his iPad resting on his leg. He became so absorbed in his task the leg went to sleep and when he stood up his ankle buckled and he broke a bone in his foot. With his PLO scarf, hopalong foot, Bee-Gees hair and sweat shirt emblazoned with the image of Mexican revolutionary Emialiano Zapata, Adams somehow managed to be the centre of attention without being the centre of attention. As always, deputy leader Michelle O’Neill was brought along for the occasion. How the Sinn Féin’s leader in Stormont manages to get anything done up North these days is a mystery. It seems Mary Lou McDonald isn’t allowed to take part in any major public event without poor Michelle (who rarely gets a chance to open her mouth) being dragged along as the Northern Irish mascot. The leader’s Buswell speech was supposed to rally the troops, but it was really designed to cast Fianna Fáil as a bunch of wimps who haven’t the bottle to go into government with Sinn Féin, as the people demanded, because they have no “appetite for change”. Well, Micheál Martin, do you have what it takes? Do you? Is Fianna Fáil up to it? Are you up to it?And should Fianna Fáil not go into coalition with Mary Lou in the end, let the people remember she gave them every chance. . .If this were a sprint, Micheál and his team would have been on the back foot. But this is a long game. Anybody But Sinn FéinBack in Leinster House, while one of the Manx Flag three was out cavorting for the cameras and making entrance after big entrance, Fianna Fáil TDs were queuing up to get out the message that they will talk to anybody about putting a government together, except Sinn Féin.ABSF. Anybody But Sinn Féin. And almost all members the new, slimmed down, parliamentary party, stuck to the line. They met for four hours, downstairs in Leinster House 2000 in a room which, it was hoped by the handlers, might not have a decent mobile phone signal. It didn’t matter, because TDs just had to nip out to the coffee dock where they could tell any number of the hacks hanging around what was going on. It was apparently a very “constructive” meeting and nobody had a bad word to say about the party leader and even John McGuinness, who they all thought would blow a gasket, was very “constructive”.Micheál broke his self-imposed isolation to go on the evening news. “Any government formed has to be sustainable,” he said. Clearly a blatant attempt to woo the Greens. “I wouldn’t rule out another general election, this is going to be so difficult.” The Taoiseach, meanwhile, was out and about doing Taoiseachy things. He arrived in the lobby of Leinster House at teatime to sign the roll to activate his membership of the 33rd Dáil. Leo Varadkar looked very relaxed in his jeans and casual shirt, sipping a can of Diet Coke as he chatted to staff. Former Labour party leader Pat Rabbitte was in on business. He’s loving the intrigue and excitement. “It really is a very unusual situation,” he mused. “Fianna Fáil is trying to get into government and Fine Gael is trying to get into opposition.”The best news and analysis from the campaign trail Full results and counts for the 39 election constituencies.

Photograph: Damien EagersThe Dozens of Senators and TDs who unsuccessfully stood in the general election are entitled to almost €2 million in parachute payments between them, an  analysis has found.The 45 TDs or Senators who were on election tickets but failed to win a seat are eligible for a range of payments – some as a lump sum, others spread over a longer period of time.However, politicians may not draw down the payments they are eligible for, for a variety of reasons. Those eligible for a pension who choose to draw it down cannot take advantage of severance payments. Those who don’t immediately claim their pension can. It’s important to note also that some TDs waive allowances they are entitled to, so their actual payouts may be lower than they are eligible to claim.Almost all Dáil deputies can claim a so-called “termination lump sum”, so long as they have six months’ continuous service as a member of the Houses of the Oireachtas. So, all the unsuccessful candidates, as well as members of the Seanad whose reappointment status is yet to be determined, will be eligible in principle, except for Fianna Fáil’s Malcolm Byrne, who only won his seat in November’s Wexford byelection.They lose the payment if they become a member of the next Oireachtas, if they immediately become an MEP or are appointed by the government to a full-time position. The lump sum is subject to the usual Revenue Commissioners rules on the taxation of severance payments.Monthly paymentsThe second – and often more substantial – element of the payout comes in the form of a series of monthly payments. How much is paid out, and for how long, depends on how long a member has been serving in the Oireachtas.Someone serving\u0026nbsp as a TD\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspfor three years or more who loses their seat is eligible for phased payments over a period of months, initially at 75 per cent of their salary, and dropping to 50 per cent of salary thereafter, if they have been serving long enough.For a basic TD salary of €96,189, the higher payment is worth €6,011 per month. If they are eligible for continued payments due to length of service, this drops to just over €4,007 for the remainder. The most payments anyone can get is 12, six of the higher, and six of the lower amount. Unlike the severance payment, this is subject to tax, PRSI and levies like the USC.\u0026nbspHowever, because of longevity and extra money on offer for roles within the Oireachtas, like chairing committees, acting as a whip, or Leas-Cheann Comhairle, payments can be higher.While some Ministers – including Katherine Zappone, Kevin “Boxer” Moran and Regina Doherty – lost their seats, they are not entitled to higher payments than their TD colleagues. This is because special severance packages for TDs were abolished in 2014. Their payment eligibility is based on a TD salary, rather than their take-home pay, which is topped up by their department. Therefore, long-standing TDs who have roles within the Oireachtas rather than the government are in fact eligible for the highest payments.* This article has been amended to correct a calculation error in the original version.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail Full results and counts for the 39 election constituencies.

I don’t have that authority nor do I seek that authority. But the practice is that people make the donation to the party and resources are used to build the constituency.“I can vouch and verify that that’s the approach I take.”Rumblings about the policy first emerged in 2012, when then TD Sandra McLellan admitted that she was finding it tough to survive on the then industrial wage of €34,000, and a number of TDs complained that other party members were being supportedBut Ms McDonald said, “There’s nobody in Sinn Féin who is elected to any office for big careers or big money”.

Photograph: iStockA 101-year-old Italian man who has been in London since 1966 was asked to get his parents to confirm his identity by the Home Office after he applied to stay in the country post-Brexit. In what appears to be a computer glitch the Home Office thought he was a one-year-old child.Giovanni Palmiero was told that he needed the presence of his mother and father when he made his application for the EU settlement scheme at an advice centre in Islington, London.When the volunteer who helped Palmiero, a great grandfather, scanned his passport into the EU settled status app to share the biometric data with the Home Office, the system misinterpreted his birth year as 2019 instead of 1919.“I immediately noticed that something was wrong because when I scanned in his passport, it imported his biometric data not as 1919 but as 2019. It then skipped the face recognition section which is what it does with under-12s,” said Dimitri Scarlato, who works for Inca – Cgil, an organisation that helps those of Italian descent and an activist with the campaign group, the3million.He was then asked if to put in the residence details of Palmiero’s parents or if they wanted to proceed independently of them.“I was surprised. I phoned the Home Office and it took two calls and a half an hour for them to understand it was the app’s fault not mine,” he added.Mistake acceptedThe Home Office then accepted the mistake and took Palmiero’s identity details over the phone and last Thursday he was told he could resume his application as a 101-year-old.He was then asked to provide proof of residence for five years in the country even though he has been in the UK for 54 years and the Home Office is supposed to be able to access the national insurance and tax records to corroborate five years of continuous tax residency.Mr Palmiero came to the UK in 1966 and “worked at a restaurant in Piccadilly and, up until the age of 94, in a fish and chip shop, until 11 o’clock at night”.He has been married to his 92-year-old wife, Lucia, for 75 years and they have raised four children, have eight grandchildren and 11 great-grandchildren.His son Assuntino told La Repubblica he was relaxed about the mistake: “We went to the nearby Inca-Cgil office, where Dad and Mum, accompanied by my sister and my wife, made a formal request to stay in the UK. But the request is pending because of dad’s age.A Europhile, he was pleased when the UK entered the common market in 1973 but surprised by the result of the referendum.“We have been assured by the consulate that we can always stay – he can’t return to Italy now as he has children and grandchildren here,” he added.Mr Scarlato told Londra Italia they have subsequently received an apology “for the inconvenience” from the Home Office but still had to wait for the settled status for their father, according to Italian press reports. –  "},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons february 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178.First Dates: Valentine\u0026#39s Special, review: even the most cynical will fall in love with this showCabinet reshuffle: Julian Smith \u0026#39sacked over risk of more prosecutions for Troubles veterans\u0026#39Coronavirus latest news: first London coronavirus victim took Uber to hospitalCassette lost on Spanish holiday and washed up on a beach 25 years later is reunited with its ownerHospital, series 5 episode 1 review: a passionate but troubling insight into the NHSComment: Despite SNP turmoil, it isn\u0026#39t going to be easy for the new leader of the Scottish ToriesBoris Johnson brings Treasury to heel sparking Chancellor\u0026#39s resignationSuella Braverman becomes Attorney-General in sign that PM is preparing for battle with judgesSir Geoffrey Boycott was framed by ‘bunny boiler’, claims wife as she pleads with charities and MPs to support his knighthoodMystery surrounding who paid for Boris Johnson\u0026#39s Mustique villa holiday deepensComment: This is Boris’s show – and he wants to pull all the levers of powerCabinet reshuffle: How Sajid Javid lost the battle of power between Number 10 and 11Comment: Post-Brexit Chancellor needs to be unafraid to challenge the TreasuryMichael Bloomberg calls Donald Trump a \u0026#39barking clown\u0026#39 as his presidential bid builds momentumSajid Javid was first British-Asian chancellor but may now be remembered as the second to never deliver a BudgetCabinet reshuffle: Sajid Javid says \u0026#39no self-respecting minister\u0026#39 would accept PM\u0026#39s demands in swipe at successor as Boris wields axeYacht belonging to billionaire American investor investigated for damaging Belize coral reef How cabinet reshuffles work, and what happens when they go wrongSnowman-shaped space rock could have sparked life on Earth, scientists findWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"two medics isolated amid dramatic scenes coronavirus reaches","story":"Two medics were sent into isolation after a woman suffering from Coronavirus arrived at hospital in an Uber cab, sparking frantic scenes as staff across London tried to deal with the growing crisis.The Chinese woman, who was later confirmed to be the capital’s first Coronavirus patient, turned up unannounced at Lewisham Hospital after falling ill on her return from ChinaTwo medical staff who came into contact with her were then sent home for 14 days isolation.The drama came amid heightened tension in the face of the virus’s arrival in London, with a surgery shut, a man escorted into an ambulance by medics in hazmat suits and two people taken to hospital after falling ill (see picture below).The Chinese woman took herself to Lewisham Hospital’s A\u0026ampE department on Sunday afternoon, a few days after arriving at Heathrow, rather than going to the ambulance bay to be met by trained doctors and nurses in hazmat suits.This was contrary to public advice urging people feeling unwell to ring NHS 111 in advance of getting an ambulance or attending hospital in a private vehicle.On arrival the woman, who is in her 20s or 30s, was given a mask and escorted to a dedicated testing area by staff before being taken home by ambulance to await the results.She was then transferred on Wednesday to a specialist centre at Guy’s and St Thomas’ Hospital in London, where she is still receiving treatment.One Lewisham hospital source said: “It has made me realise that coronavirus is at our doorstep already, that the risk is high and very present. I potentially have come into contact with someone who has it, the number of degrees between me and Coronavirus has reduced. We don’t know how long they were in there for - was it five minutes or was it half an hour?”Lewisham hospital, in south London, said that no patients were exposed to the risk of infection.The Uber driver’s account has since been suspended pending monitoring of their condition, though PHE England regard the risk of infection as low given the short period of contact with the woman.The Chinese woman is the ninth person in the UK confirmed to have been infected with Coronavirus, with six in Brighton and two in York.Responding to heightened anxiety among medical staff Ben Travis, chief executive of Lewisham and Greenwich NHS trust, said: “Throughout their care the patient was escorted and did not come into contact with other patients. All staff who had direct contact with the patient have been contacted, including two members of staff who are undergoing active surveillance at home.”Government sources said efforts to trace those with whom the woman had contact were focused on the 48 hours before she arrived at the hospital, as they believe she was asymptomatic - and unlikely to pass on the virus - during her journey home from Heathrow. They also said the woman had only brief contact with NHS staff before the possible threat was spotted, meaning that all contact was limited to less than 15 minutes. In Paddington, west London, paramedics in hazmat suits were filmed escorting a man out of a flat. On Wednesday evening staff wearing full body hazmat protection suits began cleaning communal areas of a 37-storey residential development at Elephant \u0026amp Castle, south London, after two residents who had fallen ill were taken from the building by ambulance.Yen Chen, 21, one of many Chinese students who lives in the One The Elephant development, said: “My roommate stays in his room a lot because he\u0027s worried about the virus.A GP surgery in the north London borough of Islington closed on Thursday as a precaution because of a Coronavirus scare, becoming the ninth to do so in England.The Ritchie Street health centre announced it was closed until at least Friday and patients with symptoms should call NHS 111 (see picture below). Sir Simon Stevens, chief executive of the NHS, said many more people in the UK may need to self-isolate in a bid to stop the spread of Coronavirus.He issued the warning as more than 80 people quarantined at Arrowe Park Hospital on the Wirral, after being flown out of China, were allowed to leave following 14 days isolation.Dentists have warned they will run out of masks by the middle of next week and will not be able to treat patients safely because of shortages caused by the virus.The British Dental Association (BDA) said export of masks from Chinese manufacturers have essentially ceased.Private jet operators have seen demand spike since the start of the outbreak, with wealthy passengers turning to chartered services as commercial flights are grounded.Air Charter Service said some clients have also “tried to avoid infection by flying with their families on private jets” to avoid travelling with a large number of people.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/tax/2018/08/17/TELEMMGLPICT000171854224_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqM37qcIWR9CtrqmiMdQVx7JYz1FdUY_87Dr9Bu-92cbg.jpeg?imwidth=450\"","title":"urban voyeurism one unspoken joys life","story":"Grace Kelly and James Stewart star in Rear Window (1954), Hitchcock\u0026#39s hymn to urban voyeurismWhy is it so hard to muster sympathy for the residents of Neo Bankside? Partly, of course, because everyone hates luxury flats and those who dwell in them.This particular glass and steel protrusion was built in 2015, bafflingly close to Tate Modern’s new extension. A year later the Tate opened a tenth-floor viewing platform, from which it is possible (irresistible) to look directly through the fashionable floor-to-ceiling windows of the Neo Bankside apartments.Lindsay Urquhart, who lives on the 13th floor, says her life has been made a misery by the lack of privacy, the people waving and even taking photographs. Once, when she was walking around the Tate, she overheard another visitor saying that “the rich b*******” who lived in the flats deserved the intrusion.Even the law is unsympathetic. The Court of Appeal ruled this week against the residents who have been fighting to get their side of the Tate viewing platform closed off. The judges concluded that there is no right in English law not to be overlooked from another property.How could there be? Every city in Britain would have to be raised to the ground if it became illegal to overlook another person’s home. Indeed, one of the chief pleasures of urban living is how much opportunity it affords for spying on the neighbours.My father and I used to love walking around our suburban neighbourhood at dusk – that transitional moment when people have turned on their lights but not yet drawn the curtains. This is when you get to see the lives of others most clearly, their windows lit up from within like TV screens. There they are, stirring meditatively at the stove, or chewing a pencil at the kitchen table, or shouting mutely at the kids. Look at their hideous wallpaper! Look how tidy the place is, or how harsh the lighting, or how many books they have, or how few. Look at all these humans, unknown to us yet with lives as complex and mundane as our own.Neo Bankside was built in 2015, bafflingly close to Tate Modern’s new extensionActivities that would be paralysingly boring to watch close up become fascinating through a pane of glass. Staying in New York once, I found I had a perfect view of a couple watching telly in the apartment opposite. Occasionally one would hold out a wine glass for the other to top up, but otherwise they remained supine. I watched them doing nothing for hours. Their unselfconsciousness made it enthralling.Back in London, there’s a woman across the road who does a DVD exercise regime every morning. Her silent calisthenics are vastly more entertaining to watch from my bedroom window than they would be in the gym. With every squat she disappears from view, her ponytail flipping behind her, only to spring back up like a showgirl bursting from a cake.If we were in the same room, I wouldn’t dream of watching her like this. Propriety demands that people – especially strangers – don’t stare at each other. Instead, we adopt a shifting gaze, glancing at each other sideways as we navigate the public space. This is what the Canadian sociologist Erving Goffman called “civil inattention”: a deliberate pretence of disinterest, which enables strangers to coexist comfortably at close quarters.But a window – flimsy and translucent as it is – creates just enough distance for us to hold our gaze. Putting giant windows opposite the world’s most visited modern art gallery well, that’s just an invitation to look.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

This challenge is already testing my limits but I have also found myself on an educational path.Six weeks in,\u0026nbspI have to admit that I do not have a clean shopping slate. I bought socks and thermals — but in my defence, the former were for my husband and the latter for my sister. I am not sure if they were trolling me but both (not being a party to my pledge) in particular asked me to buy these items for them.Okay, I also bought myself a vintage shirt, non-plastic food covers to replace cling film with and cotton face pads to cleanse the face without the need for additional products.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesWhy I’m changing my spending habits to help save the planetApart from the vintage shirt these latter purchases are also part of my new outlook on the things I consume: considering materials used in production the use they have and what happens once they become waste.From trying my best to avoid buying lunch wrapped in plastic to opting for plastic free cosmetics, I am trying to progressively reduce my waste.My phone is 20 months old and previously that would mean I would be ready to buy the new shiny phone with the improved camera. Instead I opted to renew my sim-only contract and stick with the handset I have as it’s functioning perfectly well.\u0026nbspAt the weekend I chose to replace the broken pipe for my 12-year-old vacuum cleaner rather than buy a whole new machine. I never knew that Dyson sells parts for even their older models, which came in very handy.Overall, I am changing my approach to things I own and may or may not need to buy, which is reducing my eco anxiety and saving me money.Created with Sketch.Plastic waste across the world: in pictures Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A father and son on a makeshift boat made from styrofoam paddle through a garbage filled river as they collect plastic bottles that they can sell in junkshops in Manila.

This is also why I am keeping a close eye on the experience of all my fellow pledgers. How can I avoid using plastic further? Can I plan my next holiday by train travel? What local produce can I opt for instead of fruit flown in from thousands of miles away? Can I start growing my own parsley and spring onion (my parents have an annual supply of potatoes from their allotment, maybe I have learnt a thing or two from them)?Modern day consumerism (i.e. capitalism) fuels our desire to have more and more. We are somehow convinced we need all this stuff. The planet is at the desperate point where we need to convince ourselves that we actually do not.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In my 2020 quest for a more sustainable kitchen, I’ve installed a wormery in my back garden. A small move but for me a big one, as I’m still reeling from the time my brother threw a tin of worms at me when I was six years old.\u0026nbspThe worms will feed on kitchen scraps\u0026nbspbits of cabbage, banana peels, and egg shells (no oil, no dairy please) that my 2019.0 version would have tossed into the garbage. They’ll reside in a multi-level des res and churn my waste into compost. But as I feverishly read the instructions, I learn that during the first 24-hours they might ‘wander’ and head for the great outdoors. \u0026nbspI call Ronnie, co-owner of Wormcity Wormery, who calms me down. Yes, there is a potential for wander but adding a handful of our own back garden soil helps ‘welcome’ the worms to their new home. No, it’s not a problem that I’m going away for a week — they need time to get settled and overfeeding is a no-no anyway. I hang up feeling like I’ve had a session with my own worm therapist.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesWhy I’m promising to end all my food wasteIf you’ve got any back garden space, then a wormery is an easy way to reduce your kitchen carbon footprint. You can find them online and at garden shops and it’s an easy-to-assemble box system (more mouths  more food waste  more levels). I chose Wormcity because — aside from the fact that Ronnie doesn’t mind answering my inane questions — their wormeries are made from recycled plastic in England, so helpfully reducing travel miles.\u0026nbspMy composting worms should live for around two to three years. They’re prolific, doubling their numbers every three to four months. Even better, they’re hungry — eating up to half their body weight in food every day. That’s a lot of carrot peelings. It will take around four months for my worms to turn a tray of food scraps into compost but when they do, it will be so nutrient rich (about ten thousand times the bacteria and microbes of normal compost) that I’ll only need a small amount to use as a top dressing.\u0026nbspOf course, recycling is only part of the sustainability push. Many argue that the first rule, the mantra, if you will,\u0026nbspis to reduce. If we reduce the amount we buy in the first place, then we won’t need to recycle so much. We’ll also save money. The United States Department of Agriculture estimates that an average American family of four loses $1,500 a year on uneaten food. Like many, I’ve become a BOGO junkie — buying two bottles of juice when I can only drink one at a time or splashing out on three packets of sweet potato falafel for the price of two, when I know that I’ll be pushed to finish the second, let alone the third, by the time I reach the use-by date. Every time I buy food, the clock is ticking. It might be ticking loudly, like when I buy a packet of chicken thighs, but even if I’m buying something shelf stable like rice or pasta, it’s still ticking.After my January fridge detox, I realised that the more stuff I’ve got in my fridge, the harder it is to find anything. And sadly when I do, it might be too late. During my trawl, I discovered two open bottles of fish sauce, which by anyone’s standards is one too many. I know exactly what happened — I was in a rush, opened up the fridge, did a quick look, didn’t (couldn’t) see any so opened another bottle. Shame on me.\u0026nbspNow I’m shopping with intention, as I call it. Considering my purchases more carefully and using up what I’ve got before I go crazy buying more. I rescued some Jurassic-era carrots from the veg bin but rather than throw them out, I peeled them, gave them a quick turn in salted boiling water and a refresh in cold water. The wrinkled romano pepper that looked like something out of an ad for sunscreen was sliced, seeded, roasted and then blitzed with nuts, lemon zest, olive oil, garlic and some almost-chuckable herbs. I tossed the carrots in my ersatz romesco sauce and they were delicious.\u0026nbspI discovered no less than three containers of parmesan cheese in the dark recesses of my fridge. I combined them so they’re easier to locate and will use the wedge for grating and toss the nobbly rinds into my next batch of minestrone for an umami hit. Containers heading to the freezer are labelled now, with the exception of a mystery one I missed, which I’ve decided is either chilli con carne or bolognaise. Only time and defrosting will tell.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It tells you the best place to store apples, for example, if bananas can be frozen, and how to keep quick-wilting herbs fresher longer. I liked the suggestion to turn an almost-but-not-quite-finished sauce bottle upside down (check that the lid is on tight first) so you don’t waste a drop. I’d add to that my trick to use up the last bits in a jar of mustard. Leave the mustard in the jar, add vinegar, olive oil, salt and pepper and you’ve got a bottle of vinaigrette.Meanwhile, I just checked on my worms. I did a quick head (and yes, a worm does have a head) count and I don’t think they’ve wandered. They better not, they’ve got work to do.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It\u0026nbspsaid it expects to invest more in low carbon businesses and less in oil and gas over time.\u0026nbspHowever, the company will continue to increase its production of fossil fuels over the next decade, while aiming to reduce the carbon intensity of the energy it supplies. That means BP\u0026nbspwill likely still have to offset hundreds of millions of tonnes of emissions each year through schemes such as tree planting. BP has not provided any details about how it will achieve this.“BP is vague on the details of its plan, but it should not rely on using carbon offsetting schemes as a licence to continue polluting,” said\u0026nbspOxfam’s climate policy advisor Kiri Hanks.\u0026nbsp”Poorer countries should not be bribed to grow forests instead of food to enable business as usual in rich nations.”Murray Worthy at Global Witness, an anti-corruption and environmental campaign group, dismissed BP’s announcement.“There is nothing ambitious about a plan that is simply not credible,” he said.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The UK’s largest energy supplier lost 286,000 of customer accounts last year, which is half the rate of 2018 and a quarter of the rate in 2017.British Gas has lost millions of customers to smaller suppliers and cut thousands of jobs during Mr Conn\u0027s tenure.The company also incurred hefty one-off costs in 2019, including a £476m write-down of its exploration and production business thanks to fluctuating fossil fuel prices.The energy price cap came into force at the start of last year, aiming to\u0026nbspcut outgoings for millions of households.But British Gas has been fiercely critical of how it has been implemented, winning a high court fight in November after arguing that the energy watchdog\u0027s changes to the cap\u0027s methodology were unfair.David Barclay, senior investment manager at Brewin Dolphin, said: “Today’s results cap an undoubtedly difficult year for Centrica with drops across the board and an increase in debt.The good news, however, is that management has identified that drastic action is required and is duly taking it to make Centrica a smaller, simpler, and more competitive business. Nevertheless, there is still plenty of work to do and investors will have a keen eye on future updates.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It\u0026nbspsaid it expects to invest more in low carbon businesses and less in oil and gas over time.\u0026nbspHowever, the company will continue to increase its production of fossil fuels over the next decade, while aiming to reduce the carbon intensity of the energy it supplies. That means BP\u0026nbspwill likely still have to offset hundreds of millions of tonnes of emissions each year through schemes such as tree planting. BP has not provided any details about how it will achieve this.“BP is vague on the details of its plan, but it should not rely on using carbon offsetting schemes as a licence to continue polluting,” said\u0026nbspOxfam’s climate policy advisor Kiri Hanks.\u0026nbsp”Poorer countries should not be bribed to grow forests instead of food to enable business as usual in rich nations.”Murray Worthy at Global Witness, an anti-corruption and environmental campaign group, dismissed BP’s announcement.“There is nothing ambitious about a plan that is simply not credible,” he said.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The UK’s largest energy supplier lost 286,000 of customer accounts last year, which is half the rate of 2018 and a quarter of the rate in 2017.British Gas has lost millions of customers to smaller suppliers and cut thousands of jobs during Mr Conn\u0027s tenure.The company also incurred hefty one-off costs in 2019, including a £476m write-down of its exploration and production business thanks to fluctuating fossil fuel prices.The energy price cap came into force at the start of last year, aiming to\u0026nbspcut outgoings for millions of households.But British Gas has been fiercely critical of how it has been implemented, winning a high court fight in November after arguing that the energy watchdog\u0027s changes to the cap\u0027s methodology were unfair.David Barclay, senior investment manager at Brewin Dolphin, said: “Today’s results cap an undoubtedly difficult year for Centrica with drops across the board and an increase in debt.The good news, however, is that management has identified that drastic action is required and is duly taking it to make Centrica a smaller, simpler, and more competitive business. Nevertheless, there is still plenty of work to do and investors will have a keen eye on future updates.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But, at this point in time, contributors are optimistic regarding the outlook for activity over the next 12 months.”Looking ahead, respondents to the survey expect this refreshed optimism to continue with sales anticipated to rise across all UK regions, both in the near term and for the year to come. \u0026nbspGraeme Lusk, of surveyors Walker Fraser Steele in Glasgow, said it was a good time to put a property on the market. “There is still an under supply of quality properties on the market and buyers waiting,” he said.\u0026nbspObservers fear that a long-term lack of supply combined with strong buyer interest and historically low borrowing costs will drive up the prices of homes even further out of the reach of first-time buyers.However official figures on Wednesday showed that the number of homes being both started and completed across the UK rose to their highest levels for 11 years in the 12 months to April last year. However, the 165,730 homes completed and the 202,260 started were well below the government’s target of 300,000 a year.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Of these payments, 27 per cent were for mistaken switches and 73 per cent were for late credit balance refunds.Kwasi Kwarteng, the minister for energy and clean growth,\u0026nbspsaid: “We’ve made it easier than ever for consumers to shop around and record numbers are now switching suppliers to save on their bills.“These tough new standards will ensure switching is as smooth as possible and consumers are always protected.”David Pilling, head of policy and public affairs at the Energy Ombudsman, added: “Switching is now second only to billing as a source of complaints that we handle, so it’s clear that for too many people the process of changing supplier doesn’t go as smoothly as it should.“The introduction of automatic compensation is a welcome intervention by the regulator. It offers consumers access to immediate redress and gives suppliers a financial incentive to get switches right first time.“At the same time we think it’s vital that, as well as paying compensation, energy suppliers look at what went wrong with the switch and make improvements to their processes. It’s in this root-cause analysis and proactive work to raise standards across the sector that we see our role as the ombudsman.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

plans to give pupils vegetarian-only lunches.Families complained about a lack of food choice for students after they said their children were hungry. \u0026nbspOne school has even introduced a meat option after some parents claimed their daughters were coming home “starving” and were going to McDonald’s because they did not want to eat their lunch.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesMeanwhile, other schools are now introducing more child-friendly vegetarian meals at lunchtime to appeal to pupils and reduce food waste after children were avoiding eating quinoa and courgettes.Vegetarian schools are still a relatively rare phenomenon, especially in the state sector, but a growing number of new schools are opting for meat-free lunches to reduce their carbon footprint.Created with Sketch.Environment news in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.18 Davos 2019: David Attenborough issues stark warning about future of

School in Oxford, which opened in September, hit the headlines last year for serving only vegetarian meals at lunchtime after parents claimed their children had come home hungry.\u0026nbspKay Wood, head of the school, introduced the policy to allow students and teachers with different dietary requirements to eat the same meal together, as well as reduce the impact on the environment.“We knew from speaking to a lot of people in the local area and lots of the children that they were very environmentally aware. Young people in general are increasingly interested in sustainability and doing their bit,” she told The Independent.\u0026nbspBut the school will now introduce a different selection of vegetarian meals next term after\u0026nbspchildren and parents raised concerns\u0026nbspabout the\u0026nbspfood options available. \u0026nbspChild-friendly options, such as macaroni and cheese, will be rolled out to encourage more pupils to eat meals after the school found that children were avoiding vegetables like courgettes.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailMs Wood said: “We are recognising that there are some meals that children don’t eat. That is not just bad because they then might be a bit hungry and might not have the nutrition they need, but the knock-on effect is that the food is then being thrown away which is not desirable for the environment.”King’s Leadership Academy Bolton, which also opened in September, is also serving up meat-free lunches to be more eco-conscious, encourage healthy eating and ensure students can all eat one meal together.But the reaction from families has been mixed. “There are some picky eaters out there. But we continue to work hard with our parents and students to provide meals they are really happy with and they want to eat,” David Crosby, head of King’s Leadership Academy Bolton, told The Independent.\u0026nbspThe school is now introducing a soup option, alongside the main vegetarian lunch meal, following feedback.\u0026nbspHow climate-conscious pupils are forcing schools to be eco-friendlyMr Crosby added: “We had couscous and quinoa on the menu at first and the students were not particularly pleased with that. We are now trialling a vegetarian cottage pie and lasagne.\u0026nbsp“We are trying to do everything we can to make sure that the students are eating the food and we are also listening to parents at all times.”Reports suggest that Woolwich Polytechnic School for Girls will no longer only serve vegetarian meals at lunchtime after parents complained that their daughters regularly came home hungry.In a statement given to\u0026nbspNews Shopper, headteacher Subreena Kazmi said the London school is “consistently working very hard to make sure the food is delicious and nutritious” and after working with families it will now be able to offer a meat option at the same price.Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), said: “It is perfectly reasonable for schools to offer vegetarian-only lunches. Any menu needs to be tasty, healthy and nutritious, and this can easily be achieved with vegetarian meals. It is one meal in a day, and there are plenty of other opportunities to eat meat for those who wish to do so.\u0026nbsp“We are likely to see more schools offering vegetarian-only menus on at least some days given rising concern about the environmental impact of eating meat, and demand from children and their families. In fact, the school food standards suggest that schools should encourage all children to have a meat-free day each week.”Rob Percival, head of food and health policy at Soil Association: said: “All schools should be serving less and better meat. There is overwhelming agreement that we need to change our diets to tackle the climate and nature crises, and this includes eating more healthy plant proteins.\u0026nbsp“Schools should be reducing the amount of meat they serve, introducing more plant proteins onto the menu, and using the cost savings to trade up to better quality meat during the rest of the week.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Just over one in 10 (11.4 per cent) were from areas of the UK where few youngsters went\u0026nbspinto higher education in 2018-19 – the same proportion as the year before.Last month, the Office for Students (OfS) told top universities in England to significantly increase places for disadvantaged youngsters as it set out its ambition to halve the “access gap” in five years.Dr Maria Neophytou,\u0026nbspof social mobility charity Impetus, called the target a “worthy ambition” – but said there was a danger that “universities will end up fighting over the same pool of well-qualified young people, while very little is invested in widening that pool”.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But Cat Turhan, a policy analyst at the Russell Group, admitted: “We know there is more work to do in addressing educational inequality.”A Universities UK spokesperson said: “Institutions have set ambitious targets in their access and participation plans – as shown in their commitment to halving the gap in access to undergraduate places between the most and least privileged students by 2025 – but this data makes it clear that challenges and disparities remain in making further progress.\u0026nbsp“We know that more people are applying to university, and the gap between the most advantaged and disadvantaged applicants is at a record low, but there is a shared will in the sector to see gaps narrow further and universities will continue to work to do this.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

They could be alerted to facts people were writing about them and then be provoked into joining up, he suggested.The Facebook boss was aware that the idea could be creepy and could stir up privacy concerns, he noted. But that might be assuaged with suggestions such as keeping them from appearing on search engines.It is not clear how far Mr Zuckerberg\u0027s idea did get, with Levy writing that some staff appeared to have worked on a version of it. It did not arrive in the form suggested in the journal.As Facebook grew, it was suggested that the company was in fact creating separate hidden profiles for people who don\u0027t use the site, so that they could collect up information for advertising even if people hadn\u0027t actually created an account.Mr Zuckerberg was asked about those suggestions in 2018, when he was faced with questions from US politicians. After those hearings, the company confirmed that it did track non-users, which it claimed to do for security reasons as well as ad tracking.Facebook did not respond to a request for comment about the dark profiles.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But, at this point in time, contributors are optimistic regarding the outlook for activity over the next 12 months.”Looking ahead, respondents to the survey expect this refreshed optimism to continue with sales anticipated to rise across all UK regions, both in the near term and for the year to come. \u0026nbspGraeme Lusk, of surveyors Walker Fraser Steele in Glasgow, said it was a good time to put a property on the market. “There is still an under supply of quality properties on the market and buyers waiting,” he said.\u0026nbspObservers fear that a long-term lack of supply combined with strong buyer interest and historically low borrowing costs will drive up the prices of homes even further out of the reach of first-time buyers.However official figures on Wednesday showed that the number of homes being both started and completed across the UK rose to their highest levels for 11 years in the 12 months to April last year.

Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Sometimes quantity really does matter as much as quality. Without a steel fence to keep the gatecrashers away, Glasto was officially free and The Levellers played to what is reported to have been the festival’s largest ever crowd to date, estimated at 300,000. Imagine how many dogs were tied up at the gate.As far as classic Glastonbury talking points go, nothing since Michael Jackson died has come close to Kanye’s 2015 slot. For all his claims to be “the biggest rock star on the planet”, nerves got the better of what was arguably Kanye’s highest-profile show ever. His attempt to echo Jay-Z’s rock-embracing “Wonderwall” from 2008 fell flat when he forgot the words to “Bohemian Rhapsody”, and he had to restart “Black Skinhead”’ after comedian Lee Nelson invaded the stage pretending to be a surprise guest rapper. Nonetheless (look away now, Noel), some class this as another key victory in hip-hop’s Glastonbury takeover.The volume, according to some onlookers, was like listening to a car stereo playing ”Movin’ On Up” underwater three miles away. Yet Primal Scream bringing Screamadelica to the NME Stage in 1992 was more of a collective celebration of music’s most double-visioned zeitgeist. Generation “Loaded” came together as one, and rock and dance cultures mated furiously in the bushes at this peak of the Ecstasy rave explosion.“Don’t touch my car!” Marc Bolan barked at Michael Eavis when the burgeoning festival don – en route to Minehead Butlin’s to replace The Kinks at what was then essentially a farmer’s party taking place on a stage held together with string – tried brushing leaves off his Cadillac. Yet Bolan’s T Rex stormed the inaugural Glastonbury (or the Pilton Pop, Folk \u0026amp Blues Festival as it was known – £1 per ticket and all the milk you could drink). “Bolan played on and on and on as the sun was going down,” Eavis recalled, “all the hits, the full works, and it sounded fantastic.”As many a troubadour will attest, it’s rare to find a crush of 15,000 people stuck outside the Acoustic Tent. But the arrival of local (ish) heroes Portishead bearing the sumptuous jazz lounge trip-hop of their hugely acclaimed debut album Dummy prompted just such polite chaos. The lucky few inside reported a bewitching set of very modern heartache – “Glory Box” and “Sour Times” capping a show of immense grace and emotion. As many tears inside as out.The best sign of encroaching superstardom, they say, is when your John Peel Stage debut is as rammed and rambunctious as Theresa May’s leaving drinks. Arguably the first and finest example was the tsunami of fans descending on the New Tent early on the Saturday evening in 2004, to toast the arrival of Las Vegas indie pop showmen The Killers. The crowds stretched far outside the tent but even the ones on the outskirts bawled along to “Mr Brightside” and “All These Things That I’ve Done”. It was such a “moment” that the band returned to the stage (now the John Peel Stage) for a secret encore in 2017.Dance music had long-since conquered clubland, but its clout as a force to unify a vast festival crowd was unrecognised until Orbital took Glasto ’94 by synthetic storm. Drawing 40,000 ravers to the NME Stage for their headline set with little more than compulsive beats and headlights on their faces, the Hartnoll Brothers dazzled not just the millions watching Glastonbury’s first televised broadcasts on Channel 4, but Eavis himself. So much so, in fact, that he was inspired to open a dedicated Dance Tent the following year. It’s since grown into its own festival-within-a-festival in the Silver Hayes dance village.By 1981, Glastonbury had grown from its Pilton Pop, Folk \u0026amp Blues roots, but not far. It was a CND charity gathering of around 3,000 bikers burning up the site as they waited for Hawkwind to come on. “It was our version of Altamont but without any trouble,” said New Order’s Peter Hook of their “spirited” support slot, but it was also the moment the band emerged from beneath the lingering clouds of Joy Division and proved themselves the silvery scouts of the new electronic age.If Jay could do it, so could Bey. Following her husband’s celebrated 2008 headline slot (and pregnant with their first child at the time), Beyoncé delivered Glastonbury’s ultimate pop experience to date. “Single Ladies (Put a Ring On It)”, “Crazy in Love”, glitzy covers of both “Love to Love You Baby” and “Sex On Fire’, billowing ballads sung while kneeling on white grand pianos… even the bells had whistles on them. All of this was wrapped up with the most bootylicious of Destiny’s Child medleys.The Sunday afternoon legend slot was custom-built for Dolly. From “Jolene” to “I Will Always Love You”, the queen of country charmed the sodden 2014 crowd like no other artist in this affectionate slot before or since, with her between-song yarns about mountain life, a song called “Mud Song” specially written for the occasion and her way of calling the event “Glastonberry”. Kylie’s got her work cut out.By its very nature as a gigantic concave mirror on alternative culture, Glastonbury reflects and exaggerates music’s pivotal moments. Case in point: Happy Mondays roll onto the Pyramid Stage in 1990 – just as Ecstasy is reshaping youth culture into very bendy shapes indeed – and twist the melon of an entire generation with “Step On”, “Wrote For Luck” and “Hallelujah”. Where the Second Summer of Love (1988-1989) was an in-the-know affair, this set made it universally hip to be hairy, lairy, baggy and boggle-eyed.Noel Gallagher wasn’t having it, but Glastonbury 2008 certainly was. Gently mocking Noel’s disgust as rap infiltrated rock’s most revered stage, Jay-Z entered with a ramshackle solo rendition of “Wonderwall”, then all but smashed his acoustic guitar as he burst into “99 Problems”. There followed a veritable firestorm of hip-hop classics – “Izzo (H.O.V.A.)”, “Girls, Girls, Girls”, “Big Pimpin’”, “Hard Knock Life (Ghetto Anthem)” – almost as though Jigga was beating the spirit of Glastonbury into submission before forcing it to wear a Brooklyn Nets shirt. The festival’s mind was opened forever, that night.Most so-called “heritage” acts go through the motions at Glastonbury – a stout chunk of their folky new record and, begrudgingly, a smatter of their old hits. Not Patti Smith. She attacked the Pyramid Stage in 2015 like a white-haired tornado. Ripping strings from her guitar by the fistful and hailing “Freedom!” at the top of her voice, she tore through “Land”, “Gloria” and The Who’s “My Generation” like the age-defying punk pioneer she is. She even found time to present the actual Dalai Lama with a birthday cake onstage and fall on her face, “because I’m a f****** animal!” Amen.Scenes become seismic events when they prove they can dominate an entire Glastonbury festival. Take Sunday 26 June, 1994, when a young, cocksure Liam Gallagher strode onto the NME Stage in a black jumper and shades and demanded of a distinctly mad-ferrit crowd: “Are you lot gonna wake up for some proper songs?” Songs rarely came so “proper” as “Cigarettes and Alcohol”, “Live Forever” and “Fade Away”, which joined “Shakermaker” and “Supersonic” in the wider public domain that day – bombardments from Britpop’s northern armies. The Nineties suddenly had some real fight in them.By the time Pulp and Radiohead had played that same stage, that same day, in a line-up that Johnny Greenwood would describe as ”like the Champions League”, Britpop had officially arrived. To herald this cultural breakout, Blur rolled up in their Parklife charabanc at sundown for a coming-of-age party that saw “Girls \u0026amp Boys”, “End of a Century” and the era-defining title track taken on as generational anthems, at a show as celebratory and momentous as any headline set. It took a year before the News at Ten caught on, but everyone at the NME Stage that day knew that Britpop already owned the decade.Radiohead’s 1997 headline slot is often cast as a battle – against the elements, malfunctioning stage equipment and their own despondency. “Everything broke onstage,” said Ed O’Brien. “It turned into the worst night of our lives. I don’t think we ever wanted to play a concert again.” But it’s better remembered as a battle against the formulaic post-Oasis rock landscape of Ocean Colour Scenes and Stereophonics, into which OK Computer landed like a laser-precision drone attack. “Lucky” rang out like an epic air-raid siren for the end of the century, and Radiohead’s fresh brand of ultramodern melancholia – “No Surprises”, “Karma Police”, “Airbag” – made it feel as though the future had chosen Worthy Farm for its grand unveiling.“I don’t want to sound revolutionary, or wild or dangerous, but hippydom… what does it mean?” So said Morrissey, hearing aid firmly in lughole, backstage at Glastonbury 1984 – shortly before The Smiths were resoundingly booed and bottled by a field full of Santana fans. Hippydom certainly wasn’t a bunch of effete Mancunians flapping around singing wiry pop songs full of wry, poetic teenage ennui such as “Hand in Glove”, “Heaven Knows I’m Miserable Now” and “This Charming Man”. The performance inspired Glastonbury’s first stage invasion, but never would Glasto be defined as a purely “hippy festival” again. With The Smiths came a new subculture and a contemporary inclusiveness that reinvented the festival as a youth culture gathering that was indeed revolutionary, wild and a little bit dangerous.Sometimes all it takes to slip seamlessly into Glastonbury legend is the greatest songbook known to mankind. Sir Paul’s first ever UK festival show – no, really – was the singalong to end them all: “Eleanor Rigby” into “Drive My Car”, “Penny Lane”, “Get Back”, “Band On the Run”, “Back In the USSR”, “Live and Let Die”, “I’ve Got a Feeling”, “Lady Madonna” and a “Hey Jude” you could hear from Dunfermline. That was before the encore. McCartney has been semi-confirmed for 2020 – start refreshing the ticket page now.Bowie’s reputation as an uncompromising art iconoclast preceded him for Glastonbury 2000. We’d seen him headline festivals before, playing hit-free drum’n’bass sets or onslaughts of screeching future metal that sounded like vaguely tuneful slow-motion car crashes. Needless to say, we weren’t exactly expecting “Changes”. Then he came on in a kind of Moroccan bathrobe affair and sang “Changes”. And “Life On Mars?” And “Ashes to Ashes” and “Rebel Rebel” and “Under Pressure” and “Starman” and “All the Young Dudes” and everything else you could possibly want David Bowie to play. You could’ve seen David Bowie live a thousand times, and this would be the set you remembered.When The Stone Roses pulled out of their hotly anticipated Glastonbury headline set in 1995, few in the crowd had any idea who was replacing them until Pulp walked onstage. To say they stepped up is a vast understatement – they went down in history. Jarvis Cocker seemed born to prowl the world’s largest stage, chatting to the biggest crowd of his life like it was a mate down his local Voyeurs Anonymous meeting. The likes of “Babies”, “Disco 2000” and ”Common People” crystallised Britpop’s ascendance in 60 or so scintillating minutes. They even unveiled a new song seemingly penned for the occasion – “Sorted For E’s \u0026amp Wizz” – and encapsulated the bewildering, otherworldly spirit of Glastonbury in 20 words: ”Is this the way they say the future’s meant to feel? Or just 20,000 people standing in a field?” And to think, they asked Rod Stewart to fill in first.Sometimes quantity really does matter as much as quality. Without a steel fence to keep the gatecrashers away, Glasto was officially free and The Levellers played to what is reported to have been the festival’s largest ever crowd to date, estimated at 300,000.

It has since been suggested that they may instead be formed by flowing sand NasaJPLUniversity of ArizonaMorning Aurora: Nasa astronaut Scott Kelly captured this photograph of the green lights of the aurora from the International Space Station in October 2015Researchers have previously looked at elements\u0026nbspfound in meteorites that came down from Mars and concluded that Mars would have grown rapidly after the first 2-4 million years of the Solar System\u0027s existence. But the new study suggests that it would have been smashed with collisions during that earlier history, and the formation might have taken as long as 20 million years.Some 61,000 meteorites have been found on Earth, and about 200 of them are thought to have come here Mars. Those that have been discovered were probably thrown off Mars during collisions in its more recent history.Alien life could have thrived in water on Mars, scientists sayLooking through those rocks, scientists found elements such as\u0026nbsptungsten and platinum, which tend to cling to iron. Such elements tend to find their way from the mantle towards the edges of the planet and into the core at its centre as the planet forms.The discovery of those elements in the rock suggests that Mars was hit by what scientists call\u0026nbspplanetesimals – small objects not big enough to be planets – after its core had been created.Researchers can look at the isotopes of those particular elements and understand at what time planet formation happened.We knew Mars received elements such as platinum and gold from early, large collisions. To investigate this process, we performed smoothed-particle hydrodynamics impact simulations, said\u0026nbspDr. Simone\u0026nbspMarchi, lead author of the new paper, from the Southwest Research Institute.Based on our model, early collisions produce a heterogeneous, marble-cake-like Martian mantle. These results suggest that the prevailing view of Mars formation may be biased by the limited number of meteorites available for study.The pieces of Mars that came down to Earth probably came from a relatively limited number of places on the Red Planet. Researchers now hope that future Mars missions can pick up pieces of the planet and bring them back down to Earth, giving a better understanding of the makeup of elements in Martian rocks and more detail on how the planet formed.To fully understand Mars, we need to understand the role the earliest and most energetic collisions played in its evolution and composition, Marchi concluded.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That meant the one Nintendo PlayStation became perhaps the most rare gaming object in the world.The console has a traditional disc drive, as well as slots for\u0026nbspSuper Famicom and Super Nintendo games. But there are no Nintendo PlayStation games that the buyer will actually be able to play, auctioneers say.Though the CD-ROM drive was not currently working when it was found in 2009, it has since been repaired by Benjamin Heckendorn, a YouTube personality known for his console repair videos, the listing reads. It now has the ability to play music CDs like the commercially produced PlayStation, but there is no proprietary software that\u0027s known to have been made during the prototype\u0027s development.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In 2004, a fungal pathogen outbreak caused a mass die-off. \u0026nbspIn the following years, numbers of snakes and the variety of species plummeted, found researchers from the University of Maryland and Michigan State University.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“Comparing the after with the before, there was a huge shift in the snake community,” said Karen Lips, a professor of biology and co-author of the study.“The community became more homogeneous. The number of species declined, with many species going down in their occurrence rates, while a few species increased.“Body condition of many snakes was also worse right after the frog decline.

The park is protected from habitat loss, development and pollution.The researchers said their findings would be important for conservation studies.“This work emphasises the importance of long-term studies to our understanding of the invisible, cascading effects of species extinctions,” Prof Lips said. “Everything we watched changed after the frogs declined.

Their older supplier will pay if they did not issue a final bill in time.Mary Starks, executive director for consumers and markets at\u0026nbspOfgem, said: “More customers are switching than ever, with a record 6.4 million changing supplier in 2019. But we also know that a minority can still experience problems when they switch.“As part of our commitment to protecting consumers and enabling competition, we are introducing these new standards to give customers further peace of mind, and to challenge suppliers to get it right first time.“Going forward, we will continue working with suppliers and consumer groups to deliver our programme for faster and more reliable switching and ensure these arrangements are fit for the future.”Last year Ofgem introduced new rules requiring energy suppliers to pay out if they fail\u0026nbspto meet minimum standards around spotting and correcting mistaken switches\u0026nbspor refunding credit balances to customers.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Of these payments, 27 per cent were for mistaken switches and 73 per cent were for late credit balance refunds.Kwasi Kwarteng, the minister for energy and clean growth,\u0026nbspsaid: “We’ve made it easier than ever for consumers to shop around and record numbers are now switching suppliers to save on their bills.“These tough new standards will ensure switching is as smooth as possible and consumers are always protected.”David Pilling, head of policy and public affairs at the Energy Ombudsman, added: “Switching is now second only to billing as a source of complaints that we handle, so it’s clear that for too many people the process of changing supplier doesn’t go as smoothly as it should.“The introduction of automatic compensation is a welcome intervention by the regulator. It offers consumers access to immediate redress and gives suppliers a financial incentive to get switches right first time.“At the same time we think it’s vital that, as well as paying compensation, energy suppliers look at what went wrong with the switch and make improvements to their processes. It’s in this root-cause analysis and proactive work to raise standards across the sector that we see our role as the ombudsman.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But first I had to pay a fee of £100 for it, said Mr Lala, who has lived in Britain since he was 14 and naturalised.\u0026nbspThe British national had previously gone to the UK embassy in the city to seek help, only to be told his British passport – the only one he has ever owned – was no longer valid and have it confiscated from him, leaving him stateless for weeks.100-year-old man told parents must confirm identity for settled status‘Cruelty’ as Jamaicans driven to charter flight despite court rulingHome Office charter flight to Jamaica leaves UK despite court rulingHome Office leaves modern slavery victim ‘in limbo’ for five years‘Home Office is destroying their lives’: Father-of-two to be deportedBritish man blocked from entering UK after holidayAsked as he waited for his train home whether he had been provided an explanation by the Home Office, Mr Lala told The Independent: No, I\u0027m still waiting for that.The department did not notify Mr Lala his passport had been cancelled before he left the country, instead sending a letter to an address he had never lived it. It then did not stop him leaving the country, only preventing him from getting back in when he tried to board a flight home from Brussels.The Independent contacted the UK embassy in Belgium for comment but was told they could not comment on specific cases. The Home Office has said it does not comment on specific cases, and was also approached for further comment as Mr Lala returned home.The Home Office\u0027s original state rationale for cancelling the passport was that Mr Lala\u0027s naturalisation application was made on the basis that he was born in 1986 in Serbia, but that the department believes he was born in 1985 in Albania.

Otherwise, the most well-known candidates will have an unfair advantage.“I hope every candidate for leader and deputy will agree – as well as their supporters. This needs to be a fair contest, and delaying the start of the ballot will ensure its integrity.”Ms Allin-Khan pointed out that candidates were being asked to pay £5,000 each to tap into the membership lists and contact the race’s voters themselves.Created with Sketch.Who could replace Corbyn as Labour leader?

But providing it does so through democratic means only, that should not upset many people.After all, it is up to the people of Northern Ireland, through a referendum, to decide whether they want to remain part of the UK or to join Ireland.Sinn Fein can, however, be relied upon to be even more hostile than Leo Varadkar — up until now Ireland’s leader — towards Britain in trade negotiations with the EU.If the party can score some kind of victory by opposing UK proposals, it will do so, making it more likely we will have no trade deal by December .Sinn Fein has used Brexit to its advantage, trying to drive a wedge between Britain and those in Northern Ireland who traditionally want to stay part of the Union.By negotiating a deal which puts some kind of border down the Irish Sea, Boris Johnson’s government has helped Sinn Fein’s cause. Former Irish leader Bertie Aern claimed yesterday that a referendum on a united Ireland will now come before the end of the decade.“I think a border poll is inevitable,” he said. “I think it’s probably five years off at least but the Sinn Fein position is it should be held within five years.”It is easy to see a scenario in which Northern Ireland votes to leave the UK and join Ireland, followed by a Scottish vote for independence.I am not sure where that would leave Boris’s plans for a Belfast to Stranraer bridge, which of course would have been paid for mostly by English taxpayers.All this said, however, there is little to suggest that those who voted for Sinn Fein on Sunday were motivated by concerns over Brexit or by a desire for a united Ireland.Strip away its dubious past and Sinn Fein is now a party of the Corbynite Left — it wants far greater social programmes, all funded by the wealthy.This could have serious consequences in a country whose economic success is founded on low taxes, especially company taxes. Ireland’s corporation tax rate is just . per cent, compared with  per cent in the UK. That has helped it become a magnet for investment.In terms of GDP per head, Ireland was poorer than the UK  years ago, but now it is signicantly richer.But whatSinn Fein was able to do what Jeremy Corbyn promised to do and soak the rich We might no longer have a Celtic Tiger on our doorstep, but a Celtic Sloth. The likes of Amazon and Google, which have established big presences in Ireland for tax purposes, might want to sht operations to Britain instead.Leo Varadkar had hoped he would be rewarded at the ballot box for holding a tough line in Brexit negotiations, but Ireland’s housing crisis seems to have been a far stronger concern.Ireland, even more so than Britain, has suffered from property booms and busts over the past two decades.Many young people have been priced out of the housing market and are struggling to even rent. Sinn Fein did well because it promised a three-year rent freeze and , new homes.These pledges helped the party — which has dominated Republican politics in Northern Ireland — come out of the margins south of the border and break the duopoly of the two main partiesIt won . per cent of the vote, while Fianna Fail, a socially conservative party, won  per cent, and Fine Gael, the more economically and socially liberal party of Leo Varadkar, won just  per cent.If Ireland had Britain’s first-past-the-post system, it would have been a landslide — Sinn Fein topped the poll in  of the country’s  constituencies.But given Ireland’s system of multi-member constituencies, it is far from guaranteed that Sinn Fein will even be in government at all.Before the election, Fianna Fail and Fine Gael both said they would not go into government with Sinn Fein. They could go into coalition with each other.In fact, Fianna Fail was already propping up Fine Gael in a confidence and supply arrangement. But with Sinn Fein topping the poll, this might prove a more dficult position to hold.Sinn Fein says it is exploring trying to put together a government without either of the main parties.But despite winning the biggest share of the vote, Ireland’s political establishment may yet succeed in keeping it out of power — and away from messing up the Irish economy. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Especially with inflation at only . per cent. But no.They’ve voted themselves an inflation-busting . per cent instead — so they’ll now get £ just for showing up.A few Lords and Ladies have experience and ability, we admit. The rest shuffle in for the warmth and the cash.The truth is the House of Lords is an antiquated insult to our democracy, a dumping ground for political failures and discredited cronies, where almost no one is too odious . . . though it still draws the line at Bercow, obviously.A courageous Government with a big majority would take it on and reinvent it as a mainly elected second chamber — with a small handful of unelected peers chosen for specic expertise.How about it, Boris THE decision on whether to proceed with the HS high-speed rail project was bound to upset plenty of people whichever way it went.So perhaps it is no surprise that Boris Johnson has tried to appease both its supporters and opponents by pressing ahead with the bulk of the £billion project, while putting two of its northern spurs on pause.But the PM is shrewd enough to realise that the places losing out — Crewe to Manchester and the West Midlands to Leeds — are the very areas that he must keep on sidehis -seat majority is not to be a one-off.Boris’s alternative transport plans for them, with improved bus and cycle links just a start, must not let them down.Otherwise the snub could see Labour rebuild its “red wall” of voters as quickly as he demolished it.THE Cabinet reshuffle this week must be bold. It will define Boris’s premiership.There are obviously talented contenders for bigger jobs: among them Michael Gove, Rishi Sunak and Victoria Atkins.But this is not the moment for the PM to reward other time-servers whose turn has come. Boris must not overlook fresh faces from the  and  intakes and, while it is probably too early for December’s newcomers, why not,they have the talent This Government already has a place in history simply by forcing Brexit through on January .With dynamic, imaginative, bright and brave ministers it can be truly radical too. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

No mention of economics.So what knowledge, pray tell, could he possibly impart to a room full of high-flyers connected to Wall Street banking giant JP Morgan, particularly when the rumoured fee was million Well, after a brief speech by his we Meghan at the “Alternative Investment Summit” in Miami, Harry was brought on stage as the headline act and, once again, dug deep to mine the deeply painful memory of his mother’s death.Fair enough when he’s using his experience to highlight the work of a mental health charity and help others.But is it really a suitable subject for a big-bucks event where he’s simply being wheeled out like the latest must-see arrival at a freak show As the new royal escapee on the block, his kudos is currently high.But in the law of ever diminishing s, how long before the American big-hitters tire of his well-trodden trope about “one’s mental health” and move on to the next big thing Not long, I’d wager.Then, Harry and Meghan will really start to feel the bite of their brave new world of “financial independence” and that’s when they will become more of a potential liability for The Queen than they already are.As part of the Royal Family, Harry was largely protected from the potential pitfalls of mingling with unvetted people whose activities might later jump up and bite him.Though, admittedly, it didn’t stop Prince Andrew from getting bogged down in the swamp of Jeffrey Epstein’s questionable lestyle.But outside of The Firm The risks are even greater and, given Harry’s obvious naivety and his we’s towering ambition to be a change-maker, they are sitting ducks for any unscrupulous wolves in sheep’s clothing.This appearance at a corporate shindig shouts loud and clear that they are now “royals for sale”.But ultimately, the cost to the reputation of the monarchy could be irreparable.MARGOT ROBBIE’S husband Tom Ackerley was caught casting a wary eye as she enjoyed a hug with her former co-star Leonardo DiCaprio on the Oscars red carpet.He shouldn’t worry.At , she’s far too old for him.JONTY BRAVERY is “scarily intelligent” and built like a rugby player.He is also mentally ill and currently awaiting sentencing for throwing a six-year-old boy over a ft drop at London’s Tate Modern art gallery.He is being detained at a top security hospital, but before the incident he lived in a flat in West London where a team of six carers worked around the clock to make sure he was never left alone.One of them told a court he was, “one of the most challenging mental patients I’ve ever encountered”, ­particularly given his size, aggression and relentless determination to try to escape from them.As we know, something went terribly wrong on the day he was able to grab the poor boy, who is still in hospital.But it doesn’t detract from the fact that whatever his carers are paid to deal   with such a powerful, high-octane charge, it isn’t enough.I couldn’t wouldn’t do it.How about you A COURT has rejected jihadi bride Shamima Begum’s bid to win back her British citizenship.Judges at the Special Immigration Appeals Commission concluded that, despite being  when she ran away to join IS in Syria, it was her own choice and she is no longer Britain’s responsibility.Whatever your view of Ms Begum’s plightthis decision is surely the right one in hopefully serving as a deterrent to any other young people who might be thinking of doing the same.WHILE Hollywood’s glitterati were enjoying the post-Oscars parties, spare a thought for poor Emily Ratajkowski, who was woken in the early hours by a fire alarm at her hotel.As you can see, she was forced to leave her room with only a couple of towels to protect her modesty.What  Oh, apparently this is the dress she wore to the Oscars.Sorry about that.Yep. The same Boris Johnson — now PM — whose senior aides have just tried to ban certain journalists from an official government briefing.Go figure.VISITORS to the ancient, and usually peaceful, site of Glastonbury Tor have complained that their peace is being shattered by a “selfish” busker and his persistent bongo playing.I sympathise. Le’s precious silences are a rarity these days and the preoccupation with having music as a backdrop in everything from restaurants to toilets drives me to distraction. Particularly when most of it isn’t even good.Years ago, we had secured a wonderful people-watching seat in a Parisian cafe when an accordion player suddenly appeared on the pavement nearby.We endured a couple of songs but when it became clear he wasn’t moving, The Bloke asked how much he earned a night and was told: “About  euros.”Pressing a note into his hand, he said: “Here’s the same to p*** off to another location.”Which he duly did.So perhaps the Somerset bongo player is wilfully angling for a similar outcome.LAST year I applied for “veried fan status”, set my alarm and, after several nail-biting minutes, managed to secure two vastly expensive tickets to see Madonna’s Madame X show at the London Palladium for February , .Then, a couple of weeks ago, Her ­Madgeness announced that, owing to injury, she would be cancelling two shows of her -night run – and guess what . . .  Amazing how you can go off someone.TURNS out that the American woman who killed British teenager Harry Dunn by driving on the wrong side of the road is a former CIA spy.So what We already know she’s called Anne Sacoolas, we know where she lives in the US and we’ve even seen photos of her filling her car with petrol.So it’s not asany secret cover would be blown by her ing to Britain to answer accident-related questions in a British court.It changes nothing.“WE should be talking about what politicians do, rather than what they’re wearing,” says Shadow Culture Secretary Tracy Brabin piously after the online furore surrounding her outfit choice while addressing the Commons.In that case, best not wear an off-the-shoulder number better suited to a disco.SKY Sports presenter Jacquie Beltrao tweeted a photo of her -year-old son’s messy bedroom with a shout out of: “Can anyone compete with that ”Yep.We’ve had three Olympic-standard mess-pots in our house and one is still in residence.The rules have always been that no food is to be left lying around.Everything   I consider it their space, their problem and, most importantly, something I can simply close the door on and pretend it doesn’t exist.My daughters’ maths tests were beyond my capability by Year . Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And those are the problems in the north of our country.Leeds and Manchester, for example, are only -odd miles apart. And yet the train service between these two great northern cities is woeful.The North East is stuck out on a limb, with truly rotten local services and long journey times between cities.Take my neck of the woods, Teesside — a vast area of , people. Two hours almost to travel the  miles to Leeds. More than an hour — sometimes one hour  minutes — to reach Newcastle,  miles away.No wonder people use their cars, instead. And the first stage of HS won’t come near to sorting that out.The people in the North who dutully marched over to vote for the Tories last December know that HS is not really for them.They need new lines and new infrastructure to link up the big cities and the new hi-tech industrial hubs — Merseyside, Manchester, Leeds, Teesside and Tyneside. That will take considerable investment.The money spent on HS could have more usefully been erted to new, speedy, rail links between our northern cities.Don’t think that we, up here, don’t know. We’re not stupid. We voted Conservative for a whole bunch of reasons — but those votes were only loaned. They are not for the Tories in perpetuity.Unless we get that kind of investment, Boris, you might find that Red Wall being built again.IT seems that Chinese people in London are getting sick of being abused on account of the coronavirus.People shouting at them stuff like: “We’d all be OKyou lot didn’t eat dead bats!” And so on.The same thing is happening in Paris. One poor Asian bloke was walking around with a placard that read: “I am NOT a virus.”I think we need to reach out with a bit of affection. If you see a Chinese bloke on the Tube give him a big hug. Unless he’s coughing a lot.THE Prime Minister’s chief adviser, the excellent Dominic Cummings, has suggested that the cabinet be replaced by the kids’ cartoon characters, PJ Masks.For once, he is wrong. I can see the attraction, obviously. But I thinkyou wanted a really dynamic cabinet, Wonder Pets! are the way to go.And Ming-Ming Duckling should be Chancellor of the Exchequer.PRINCE Harry,he’s still a Prince, was flown by private jet to give a speech to one of the richest companies in the world, JP Morgan.He won’t tell ushe was paid for it or not. He’s now supposedly on the verge of a deal with investment bank Goldman Sachs. They made plenty of money out of the banking crisis in , which saw ordinary people properly stuffed.He talks like a leftie and acts like the most venal, money-grabbing capitalist. And all the while being ferried to and from in the most environmentally unfriendly manner possible.Anyway,you’ve got time to spare, watch a -second video clip of US comic Kyle Dunnigan pretending to be Meghan Markle. It’s the funniest thing I’ve seen for years.APPARENTLY we human beings spend , hours of our miserably short lives regretting stuff we’ve done in the past. And mulling it over.That’s almost a year spent tearing your hair out. About whether it was right to have done your we’s sister when the missus was away on a work trip.And I bet it’s only people guilty of little misdemeanours who fret the most.I can’t know for sure, but I would guess that Hitler didn’t spend , hours thinking: “Hmmm. I wonderit was right to have invaded Poland ”I suppose we eat ourselves up with worry because it might stop us doing the same thing again. But it doesn’t, does it SO the we tells me in no uncertain terms to buy no presents for Valentine’s Day. Fair enough, I think. whole thing’s a con.Then, two days ago, she askedI’ve ordered her Valentine’s Day flowers yet.I’m like, “Whaaaa ” It transpires that flowers are not “presents”.Dunno what other gt she was expecting. Better get a card, too, I suppose.The ones that sell best are those with really filthy messages. So I’ve decided to make my own.The verse will read: “Roses are redAnd Margate’s in ThanetI’ve got a todgerThe size of a planet.”Hope she likes it.I’M really enjoying Dominic Sandbrook’s history of the s on BBC.I can’t say I liked the decade much at the time. The music was crap, for a start, and so were the hairstyles. Sandbrook brings it all back to le.That strange time before everyone was online all day and night and when mobile phones were the size of a shed door.It will be remembered as an age when the Tories had a huge majority, Labour was utterly unelectable and rich people in the city made more and more money.

Likewise, Cleve had been unable to call his family.And Sigrid slammed: Bell Canada are making themselves look like they are doing something positive and they are not.Sure, they put a lot of money into these awareness campaigns but its extremely hypocritical.Bell Canada runs the phones at a string of jails across the country, and has been widely criticised for making calls for prisoners too expensive.Campaigners say it cuts inmates off from crucial counselling sessions and means they are unable to afford vital chats with family members.The coroner at Mr Geddes inquest even spoke publicly to call for an overhaul of the phone systems to make it easier for inmates to make outgoing phone calls.Meanwhile, the company has promoted the Lets Talk campaign urging people to support mental health and to communicate with each other.And grieving Sigrid described her brothers inability to talk to his family before his death as a complete disaster.She said the last time she had spoken to Cleve was a few days before he was imprisoned, with the pair having lunch together.She said: He was one of my best friends, he was beautul.Before he got sick, he was the apple of everybodys eye. He was the best brother that anybody could wish for.Harry and Meghan had last month gushed they were so happy to be backing Bell Lets talk campaign, which vows to donate five Canadian cents towards mental health initiatives.Encouraging their m fans to get involved, they said: Please share, please talk and be part of the solution.They also shared an emoji of the Canadian flag - perhaps highlighting their newfound patriotism.The woke pair have regularly spoken out about mental health awareness, even telling ITV presenter Tom Bradby in the documentary of their African tour that they too had struggled with the pressures of royal le.But it appears Bell Canada is yet to make changes - sparking huge backlash from prisoner rights activists.A spokesperson for the prisoners rights group said: In , Cleve Geddes committed suicide in an Ottawa prison after trying to reach out during a mental health crisis. He was unable to contact his support system via phone.It’s no secret that prisons take a toll on mental health.Many people in prisons live with mental health challenges or develop them due to prison conditions.So why does Bell, a company that promotes itself through mental health initiatives, contribute to these conditions and make it so much harder for those in prison to get help What use is Bell Lets Talk DayBell is making things worse the other  days of the year The spokesperson added: If you want to show us you truly care about talking about mental health, you can start by ending this inaccessible phone contract. Otherwise, it’s clear to all of us that what you actually care about is profit.The Toronto Prisoners Rights Project also slammed Bell Let’s Talk for limiting inmates from accessing much-needed counselling – and stinging them with high phone charges.Calls cost at least  a call for local calls , and up to for a -minute long distance call. Prisoners can also only call landlines, not mobile phones.Bell told the Sun Online that the terms of its current contract were specied by the government in .They said: The rates for operated assisted calls in Ontario correctional facilities are the same as Bell’s public rates. The contract expires in June and we’ve submitted a new proposal in response to the government’s request.They said the Lets Talk Day saw ,,.more Bell funding for Canadian mental health.They added: Millions of people in Canada and around the world joined in to support yesterday’s record-setting Bell Let’s Talk Day, including many notable supporters such as the Sussexes, Prime Minister Trudeau and other leaders and influencers.No one sending a message of support on Bell Let’s Talk Day is paid for their participation.

They employ more people than large companies and are responsible for  per cent of recent job creation.”The eldest of three children, Sunak studied Philosophy, Politics and Economics at Oxford.He went on to work at investment bank Goldman Sachs before setting up hedge fund Theleme Partners  years ago.In  he stood for election in Richmond, North Yorks, after the constituency’s previous MP, former Tory leader William Hague, retired.It was the safest Conservative seat in the country and his victory was assured.Former Brexit minister David Jones MP told The Sun: “He is very bright. There was no doubt from the start that he was destined for high office.”After being elected, Sunak moved to a -acre property with its own lake and boathouse in an idyllic small village near Northallerton.It was there he has held lavish summer parties, with champagne and canapes served by unormed staff.Though he earned several million from his investment fund, much of his huge wealth comes through we Akshata’s family.She is the daughter of self-made Indian tech billionaire N.R. Narayana Murthy, co-founder of firm Infosys.Akshata, whose shares in the company are worth around £million, also runs a fashion label.The couple married in  and have two daughters, Krishna and Anoushka.Former PM Theresa May made Sunak a housing under-secretary in January .Her successor Boris promoted him to Chief Secretary to the Treasury last July.William Hague described Sunak as “exceptional”, and ex-Chancellor Sajid Javid once tweeted: “The force is strong with young Sunak.”Now Sunak has taken Javid’s job, which is good news for Brexit-supporting Tories, because while Javid backed Remain during the referendum, Sunak was always a Leaver.Clwyd West MP David Jones, who was on the advisory board of pressure group Leave Means Leave, said: “Boris recognises that there is going to be tough negotiation with the EU.“He realises he’s going to need the Treasury behind him in that.“The Prime Minister now has a strong ally in the Treasury.”Sunak backed Brexit as he felt excessive EU regulations were shackling the nation’s small businesses.He said: “EU red tape is holding them back.“From working in my mum’s tiny chemist shop to my experience building large businesses, I have seen how we should support free enterprise and innovation to ensure Britain has a stronger future.”Sunak, whose grandparents were born in India and emigrated to Britain in the s, also felt it was wrong to give EU citizens easy access to the UK when it was often denied to nationalities outside of the Brussels bloc.Describing himself as a British Indian whose hobbies include “keeping fit, cricket, football and movies”, he said: “I come from a family of immigrants. I am grateful to Britain for giving my family the opportunity to settle here and forge a better le.“I am proud of our country’s generous approach to welcoming hardworking and ambitious immigrants and believe it is in our interests to continue doing so.”GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Dogged by questions over who funded his £k Caribbean holiday, the Prime Minister chucked controversial big-hitters Esther McVey, Julian Smith and Andrea Leadsom out of his Cabinet. But his bid to reshape his team span out of control with the bombshell resignation of Chancellor Sajid Javid. The Prime Minister said he had to fire all his special advisers and replace them with Number  special advisers to make it one team, a source said. No self-respecting minister would accept those terms. Despite Mr Javidaposs resignation - or because of it - the PM has now tightened his grip. His plan to have one set of advisors is going ahead and he now has an ultra-loyal chancellor, Rishi Sunak. Mr Johnson sacked Geoffrey Cox as Attorney General and replaced him with Suella Braverman - who weeks ago warned the government must take back control from activist judges. And he chose as Development Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan who has questioned the virtues of foreign aid. Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith got the chop weeks after he was celebrated for restoring power-sharing in Northern Ireland. Environment Secretary Theresa Villiers also lost her job just weeks after clinging onto her seat at the election. They were followed out the door by Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom and Housing Minister Esther McVey - whose departure leaves the Tories with their th Housing Minister in  years. But the PM refused to sacked Jacob Rees-Mogg - despite outrage when the Commons Leader appeared to suggest Grenfell families lacked the common sense to flee a fire in their block. Meanwhile Oliver Dowden replaced Nicky Morgan as Culture Secretary after she was widely expected to leave the government. But she will now enjoy a seat in the Lords for le.

The Chancellor was replaced by No-loyal junior Rishi Sunak in a huge Downing Street power grab after he issued the bombshell announcement. It followed furious rows over policy and control with the PMaposs top team, including No aide Dominic Cummings. Mr Javid had been set to keep his job - but he quit as Chancellor this lunchtime when Number  ordered him to sack his team of aides, a source close to the former minister said. In a shock move just  days before the Budget, Mr Javid announced no self-respecting minister could accept the condition being imposed. It is thought to be the first time a Chancellor has resigned in protest for  years after Nigel Lawson quit under Margaret Thatcher in . The first Home Secretary and Chancellor from an ethnic minority, the multi-millionaire was also the first Chancellor to quote both Captain Jean Luc Picard and Taylor Swt in speeches. The son of a bus driver, he was elected MP for Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, in  and was quickly identied a a rising star. The former City banker sat on the work and Pensions Select Committee, then the powerful Public Accounts Committee. His resignation makes Mr Javid the shortest-serving Chancellor for  years - and the last one only left the job because he died. Mr Javid, who comes from a Muslim background but does not practise any religion, was particularly close to Chancellor George Osborne and was appointed a Treasury Minister in September . He was elevated to the Cabinet as Culture Secretary in April of that year and became Business Secretary in May  after the Toriesapos shock election outright victory. He had a picture of Margaret Thatcher hanging on his wall at University. Nicky Morgan RESIGNED as Culture Secretary    Nicky Morgan stood down as an MP ahead of the December election citing pressures on her family. But she was offered a peerage and became Baroness Morgan of Cotes allowing her to stay on as Culture Secretary. She was accused of hypocrisy for not seeking re-election but then accepting elevation to the House of Lords meaning she can claim a daily allowance which is shortly to rise to £. She accepted the role as Culture Secretary when Boris Johnson became PM despite previously promising that she would not serve in a Boris Johnson Cabinet after he accused Theresa May of strapping the UK to a suicide vest over the Brexit deal she agreed with Brussels. Since she ed in the role she has had to field dficult questions over the future of the BBC and the licence fee after the government announced a review into whether it should remain a criminal offence not to pay the charge. PROMOTED Rishi Sunak PROMOTED to Chancellor of the Exchequer    Married to the daughter of a billionaire and educated at an megabucks private school, Rishi Sunak has been appointed as Chancellor after Sajid Javid resigned over rows with Boris Johnsonaposs team. The -year-old is a relative newcomer to politics - having been elected as MP for Richmond in Yorkshire in . He previously served as Chief Secretary to the Treasury, the second in command to the Chancellor. He backed Leave at the referendum and voted for Theresa May’s Brexit deal. Sunak was seen as a competent media performer and succeeded in doggedly sticking to the line. He played a key role in the December election by representing the government in the televised debates. Born in Southampton to a GP father and pharmacist mother, he is the eldest of three siblings. Sunak’s grandparents were born in Punjab, India and emigrated to the UK from East Africa in the s. He went to illustrious private school Winchester College before studying Philosophy, Politics and Economics at Oxford and then gaining an MBA from Stanford University where he was a Fulbright scholar. It was there he met his future we Akshata Murthy, the daughter of Indian billionaire and co-founder of Infosys, N. R. Narayana Murthy. The pair went on to marry in August  and have two daughters. Alok Sharma PROMOTED to Business Secretary and climate summit chief  The MP for Reading West joined the Cabinet as International Development Secretary last year. Now heaposs the Business Secretary - and replaces Claire OaposNeill as head of the COP  climate summit in Glasgow. Ms OaposNeill blasted Boris Johnson for not getting climate change after she was sacked as the summitaposs President. The married dad-of-two, , attended the private Reading Blue Coat school and the University of Salford before qualying as a Deloitte chartered accountant. He spent  years in banking including investment banking before joining Parliament in . He was made a Foreign Office minister in  followed by the Communities Department and Department for Work and Pensions. While at DWP he faced shouts of apospathetic!apos when he tried to deny Universal Credit was forcing people to food banks - something his boss Amber Rudd later admitted. He also admitted the DWP dropped the ball when a scathing internal report on the benefit was published almost  months late. He voted Remain in the  EU referendum. Anne-Marie Trevelyan PROMOTED to International Development Secretary    The -year-old arch Brexiteer backed Boris Johnson for the leadership after becoming MP for Berwick-upon-Tweed in . Despite being in charge of the foreign aid budget she is an aid cash sceptic - repeatedly tweeting criticism of the way it is spent. In  she replied to a tweet saying “no one in Africa should go hungry” by saying: “Nor in the UK. There r kids in NE who have no regular meals due to chaotic parents. Should they go hungry”. She also tweeted a  article by fellow right-winger Priti Patel which said: “Waste of cash on vanity projects in far-flung lands kept me awake at night.” As Armed Forces minister she was once spotted in khaki at a Commons bar. Elsewhere she wants to lt the ban on fox hunting, despite support from the vast majority of the public.

In the Conservative leadership contest last year, she initially backed foreign secretary Dominic Raab before throwing her weight behind Boris Johnson.

In December he rejected claims by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn that Mr Johnsonaposs Brexit withdrawal deal would lead to a trade border in the Irish Sea. SACKED Esther McVey SACKED as Housing Minister  The Tories have now churned through TEN Housing Ministers in less than  years after Esther McVey was sacked in the Cabinet reshuffle. Ms McVey was appointed Housing Secretary only seven months ago after she quit as Work and Pensions Secretary - claiming a £, payoff in the process. She was given the job by Boris Johnson after being knocked out of the  Tory leadership race in last place. The MP - reviled for defending the hated Bedroom Tax - was Employment Minister under welfare-slashing Tory Iain Duncan Smith before losing her seat in . She then ed as Work and Pensions Secretary in January  having won George Osborneaposs safe seat of Tatton. As welfare chief she admitted some people will be worse off under six-in-one benefit Universal Credit. She admitted failings in the policy but boasted she brought more money in - and refused to apologise. Andrea Leadsom SACKED as Business Secretary  Andrea Leadsom appeared to deliver a veiled barb as she was sacked in Boris Johnsonaposs cabinet reshuffle. The outgoing Business Secretary said she wouldto the backbenches and work to ensure everyone is treated with dignity and respect. It was a reference to her previous job as Commons Leader from , where she campaigned to reform Parliamentaposs procedures on bullying and harassment and clashed with Speaker John Bercow. She - and her supporters - believed she did well in making it easier for staff to speak out. But she was met with a shrug after moving to the Business Department last July. And she stood up to Boris Johnson in Cabinet meetings - a trait not beloved of the new regime. Ms Leadsom stood against Theresa May for the Tory leadership in  but had to quit the race after a furore over her ill-judged remarks about motherhood. Julian Smith SACKED as Northern Ireland Secretary  Boris Johnson sacked his Northern Ireland Secretary just weeks after he achieved a massive breakthrough in getting Stormont back up and running. The former Chief Whip under Theresa May had been regarded by many as a success despite his icy manner and controversial reign in the whipaposs office, where he failed miserably to unite the party over Brexit. He tweeted: Serving the people of Northern Ireland has been the biggest privilege.  I am extremely grateful to @BorisJohnson for giving me the chance to serve this amazing part of our country. The warmth  support from people across NI has been incredible. Thank you so much. Geoffrey Cox SACKED as Attorney General  The countryaposs top lawyer, known as aposTory Gandalfapos because of his luxurious, booming voice, was spotted emerging from the PMaposs Commons Office looking glum after he was sacked. Formerly the Commonsapos highest paid MP following a y career as a barrister and QC, there have been reports Mr Johnson was toMr Cox to the backbenches because he believes heaposs not a team player. But it was rumoured he could be offered the job of leading Mr Johnsonaposs aposrevengeapos plot against judges, laying out reforms to the process of judicial review after the Supreme Court embarrassed the PM over Brexit. The release of Geoffrey Coxaposs legal opinions on Brexit was a thorn in the side of both Theresa May and Mr Johnson as they struggled to secure Britainaposs departure from the EU. While he was a backbencher, Mr Cox hit headlines after a string of expenses controversies. He was forced to apologise after neglecting to declare £, of outside earnings as a QC. He blamed a member of staff for failing to register hundreds of hours of work on top of his MPaposs salary. And he sparked fury while he was the highest paid MP for submitting an unsuccessful expenses claim for p to cover a pint of milk. He later successfully claimed £ for a fridge in which to keep his milk.

Boris Johnson and Dominic Cummings have purged the frontbench of dissenting voices, replacing them with poodles and proxies. The Prime Minister has used the shake-up to tighten Downing Street’s control. Promotions have not been made on merit but on who is more likely to do No’s bidding. Competent ministers such as Julian Smith, who oversaw theof power sharing as Northern Ireland Secretary, have been sacked. Sajid Javid resigned as Chancellor rather than submit to Downing Street’s demands. Johnson is only interested in accumulating as much power as possible and removing anybody who seeks to hold him in check. We have seen this regime try to muzzle political reporters and intimidate the BBC. The next chapter in this war on dissent will attempt to neuter the power of the courts. The reshuffle will lead to worse government by an administration that resents being held to account.

Katrina Fell, , was tragically found dead by a dog walker on a riverbank near Waddington bridge in Lancashire at .am on Friday, November  last year. Her mother told the hearing she felt her daughter may have had some kind of psychotic episode due to the drugs she was taking and the substances mixed with the cocaine when she decided to take her own le.Katrina, from Waddington, near Clitheroe, was described as a beautul, fun and caring daughter by mum Angela Allen who spoke at the inquest held in Blackburn today, Lancs.Live reports.The court heard she had been out the night before, leaving her friendaposs flat the next morning. Mrs Allen told the court that her daughteraposs suicide was completely aposout of the blueapos and she believed thatshe hadnapost taken cocaine the night before, she wouldnapost have been suicidal. She was clear that her suicide was not down to mental health issues and implied that an emotional low following cocaine use could have brought on thoughts of suicide.  Kat wouldnapost have done it because she couldnapost cope with le, said Mrs Allen.  The only thing I can think of is that she had some kind of psychotic episode due to the drugs she was taking and the substances mixed with the cocaine.  I canapost imagine that from her leaving the house she was thinking of doing it.  It definitely wasnapost planned. It was completely out of the blue. She was fun, just kind and caring, loving, she lit up a room, you always knew when Kat was in the room, said Mrs Allen. I couldnapost have been prouder of her as a mother, she was beautul. She was the most loving and caring person, she would have been so unhappy to know what she had done to us. Katrinaaposs mother told the court repeatedly that her daughter had aposmildapos mental health problems and had shown no indication of self harm or suicide. The inquest heard her daughter had apossome anxietyapos and had been feeling down in the past few months but had told the doctor that she had a good support network and was keen to deal with the issues through exercise and healthy eating. Her mother also mentioned a aposcry for helpapos from back in  when Katrina was in Australia but claims that this was not part of a long term mental health problem. Mrs Allen said: She sometimes felt a bit down, but would pick herself back up. She did go to the doctors two weeks before, that was encouraged by me. She spoke to the doctor and her boyfriend, she said she would sort it out herself with a good diet and exercise. She was the happiest she had been for a long time. There were no signicant issues we could think of at all.Mrs Allen told the court that her daughter had been open about her drug taking in the past but was not aware of how often or how much her daughter was consuming cocaine. Katie Mary Jackson, who spoke at the inquest, confirmed that Katrina had taken cocaine but claimed that there had been no arguments within the group and that Katrina was in a good mood. She said: Kat was fine, she was the happiest Iaposve seen her in a long time. It was an all round happy night, we were having deep conversation with our friends.  But Jay Nelson, who also spoke at the court, confirmed that Katrina had freaked out at around .am and had to be calmed down before she left the flat. She later called a taxi and asked him to drop her at Waddington bridge where she exited and made her way to a nearby wooded area near the riverbank. She was found by a dog walker at around .am and airlted to Blackburn hospital. Katrina was pronounced dead at .am. Assistant coroner Mark Williams concluded that Katrina had taken her own le.  There is only one conclusion can take come to, he told Katrinaaposs family. That is that Katrina took her own le, I donapost see it as a cry for help because it was done in a remote location where no one was likely to find her. Toxicology reports confirmed that Katrina had taken cocaine and alcohol before she died.

It features a girl firing a slingshot of flowers in a possible nod to Valentineaposs Day. The owner of the house has described his delight at finding out that the potential Banksy artwork had appeared on his property - and on his birthday. Edwin Simons, , said: Iaposm shocked, absolutely shocked. How do we protect it  Thataposs all there is in my mind. I donapost want it vandalised. We want to protect it. I will never take it down -I can protect it. I donapost know what Iaposm going to do. We need someone with some knowledge about it. Iaposve always been fascinated by Banksy. I think heaposs brilliant, absolutely brilliant - and heaposs more brilliant now! We never thought this would happen to us. I think it needs to be covered in anti-vandal paint. But I donapost know how you would protect the flowers. We need to get some advice. Landlord Edwin, from Longwell Green, Bristol, has owned the property - currently valued at around £, - for  years. It is ided into three flats, with the Valentineaposs Day-inspired artwork on the exterior of the buildingaposs left side.  He said: The price [of the house] doesnapost come into it for me - itaposs just brightened my day. It looks like itaposs a Banksy. We might have to put a frame over it I donapost know how we will protect it otherwise. Itaposs a good birthday present. Itaposs brought me out of the dumps. If thereaposs anyone who can help us - the dooraposs open!  Daughter Kelly Woodruff, , said: Itaposs just incredible. Itaposs so exciting that itaposs happened on Dadaposs birthday - itaposs a real present. Itaposs not bad being  and getting a Banksy! Weaposd crysomeone vandalised it - we love it. Weaposve got another property in Easton - Banksy come and do some others for us!  When askedhe was Banksy, Edwin added: No, I wish I was - I wouldnapost owe the money I owe! The new piece of street art apparently created by Banksy appeared in his home city of Bristol. Residents in the Barton Hill area of the city woke up to the artwork on the side of the house this morning. It seems to show a young girl firing a slingshot of flowers - possibly in relation to Valentineaposs Day. But the mysterious artist has yet to claim ownership - although the piece bears all of his hallmarks.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailTwo baby girls have become the first identical twins in Britain to be diagnosed with an incurable brain condition that killed Coleen Rooneyaposs sister. Kaite and Pete Sampsonaposs daughters, Amelia and Ruby, have Rett Syndrome - a brutal and incurable genetic disorder affecting brain development - and may not make it into adulthood. They were diagnosed after they displayed worrying characteristics of the syndrome leaving their parents heartbroken. It claimed the le of Wayne Rooney’s we’s sister Rosie McLoughin who died aged  in . And now new mum Katie said the thought of not seeing her daughters grow up is gut wrenching. The -year-old said: “We were utterly heartbroken. “When they were diagnosed I just screamed and cried and said to my husband ‘Why is this happening to us ” “I can’t even explain how we felt on the day. “It is horrible to think they are some of the only twins in the world to be unlucky enough to have it. “They may not make it. “I have heard cases where kids have lost their le aged nine so we don’t know how long we will have them.”  And even more harrowing is the fact that both only got it because they are girls as the condition barely exists among males. Rett Syndrome, which affects just one in , girls annually, strips kids of the ability to walk and talk - eventhey have already learned to do so. It is rarely seen in boys and some sufferers can reach their s but added complications like epilepsy dramatically decrease le expectancy. Amelia was diagnosed first in November before her sister was diagnosed just two months later. Charity Rett UK said it is “very unusual” for identical twins to both have the degenerative illness. Katie and her husband Pete, , have wanted kids since they started dating seven years ago.  They tied the knot in  and Katie became pregnant shortly after. Katie recalled: “I cried out with happiness when I was told we were having twins. “My husband just said ‘oh my god’ and we were absolutely thrilled. “Pete had this massive grin and we were both so excited.” The little ones were born on September , , but the parents soon noticed abnormalities in Amelia. She was floppy, struggled to hold her head up and was much more delayed than her sister Ruby.  And in June of last year she had her first of many seizures - a common characteristic of Rett sufferers and Amelia now has them daily. Scans in October revealed Amelia’s oxygen levels were deteriorating. She spent  days in Birmingham Children’s Hospital and ended up in intensive care. Katie said: “I started talking to the neurologist about Amelia’s future with seizures and she basically said she might not make it to adulthood. “My husband wasn’t here and I had to tell him over the phone that our daughter may not make it.” A month later it was confirmed Amelia had Rett Syndrome.  Because it is a genetic disease their other daughter - who was showing no signs of sickness - was also tested. The results came back in January and revealed the worst. Ruby was also diagnosed with Rett Syndrome and could now deteriorate at any time. She has not yet shown any signs of regression but it is likely to happen from when she is  months old - just one month away. The parents have now learned to look after Amelia - who requires constant treatment - from home.Former IT consultant Amelia is now a full-time carer to the girls and is reliant on Universal Credit after ditching her job. Pete is grafting extra shts as a road planner to put food on the table. They are keen to find out what the future may hold for their girls and knew Coleen’s family had suffered the same devastating blow. Rosie was chief bridesmaid at Coleen and Wayne’s Italian wedding in . Coleen idolised her adopted younger sister and was devastated after her death seven years ago. The we of England’s all time goalscorer was holidaying in Barbados when her sister’s condition deteriorated. She flew home to be by Rosie’s side in her final days. Rosie was just  when she died and last month Coleen wrote on Instagram on the anniversary: “Forever in our thoughts. Love you Rosie.”The syndrome means children lose the ability to live independent lives and they need constant help with communicating, breathing and eating. Katie is now fundraising for two eye gaze pads to allow her precious daughters to one day be able to communicate. The technology - which can cost up to £, each - uses a computer mouse which you can control with your eyes. Katie, of Birmingham, said: “Because Rett affects their hands they can’tand won’t be able to learn sign language. “It will be a way for them to talk to us.  “I don’t want to assume things for them, I want them to be able to tell us what they want. “Everybody should have a voice.” Rett Syndrome currently has no cure but Katie said she will never stop fighting until one is found. Despite a dficult start to parenthood Katie already has memories she will cherish forever. She said: “Amelia had her first giggle on Christmas Day which was beautul. “We rarely get a smile out of her let alone a giggle. I prompted it by tickling her and she never usually reacts.  “But she loves her cuddles and is a happy little girl. “Ruby is really cheeky. She smiles, eats everything and grabs for everything and she is very outgoing already and knows her own mind. “The twins are really close. Amelia doesn’t overly respond to her but Ruby is always reaching out trying to touch her. “She absolutely adores her sister.” A spokesperson for Rett UK said: “It certainly is very unusual to have twins with the disorder and clearly very dficult for the family to comprehend and deal with. “There are several twins, non-identical, where one is affected.  “Rett syndrome is a particularly distressing disorder because parents are lulled into a  sense of security, thinking they have perfectly ‘normal’ children and then slowly and insipidly they start to lose key skills walking, talking and feeding themselves. “This is referred to as the regression. This normally happens in the second year of le but in those that are more severely affected it can happen much earlier. “But that is just the start of it really. There are multiple comorbidities that occur with Rett syndrome – and they start to emerge after the regression – typically epilepsy, breathing problems, scoliosis, dystonia, gut and bowel problems to name just a few.

Peter Dodds stuck a kne into Scott Pattersonaposs chest following a row, robbing five children of their father and ensuring that his newborn baby, Olivia, will never know her dad. The -year-old was found guilty of murder at Newcastle Crown Court and will serve a minimum of  years behind bars for -year-old Mr Pattersonaposs murder. The Uxbridge, west London man had  previous convictions and was under the influence of cocaine, cannabis and alcohol at the time of the attack.  He had rowed with Mr Patterson at the Percy Arms pub in Blyth, Northumberland, before a further confrontation at a mutual friendaposs house. His grieving partner told how the children canapost understand how their dad could die so young. Danielle Sanderson read out a statement from the witness box setting out how the senseless killing had impacted so many lives. “It’s so dficult to put into words how this has affected me and my family, she said. ”I find it dficult to show my emotions in public and I may appear like a person holding it together, but this is far from the reality. ”The only word I can use is devastated. I’m not the same person I was before. We were a family unit who did everything together. “My daughter, Olivia, was only three weeks old when her dad was taken away from her.  ”She will never know her dad. How is that fair  Danielle explained how her children could not understand what had happened to their father. “They all have questions about what happened to their dad, she said. They ask why did this happen to our dad when he was so young. “I can’t even answer their questions because I can’t comprehend it myself. “Every night they take me to the back door to look up at the stars and say goodnight to their dad, this is heartbreaking. “Myra, nine, and Layla, six, like to write little notes and put them on the fridge. ”This weekend they wrote: ‘To dad, wish you could come back, everyone misses you. I wish my dad was alive, Brogan, Mya, Thomas, Danielle, Ava and Olivia we miss you please come back, I want you back’.” Danielle and Scott were out on town for the first time since Olivia was born when tragedy struck last August.  Dodds, who had consumed drink and drugs and had become paranoid people were talking about him, initially became angry in the pub. Danielle was one of a number of people who told him to calm down because he was frightening children. He took umbrage at the suggestion and asked to fight Scott, who brushed off the offer and didnapost engage with him. Hours later when the couple ended up, by chance, at the same house as him, Dodds apologised for his earlier behaviour, only to reignite the argument. He pulled a kne out and cut Danielleaposs thumb. When Scott stuck up for her, Dodds reached around Danielle to plunge a kne cm into his chest. Danielle tried to save her partner but the kne had gone through his lung, heart and two major arteries. She told the court: “Every day is a struggle, even just doing simple day to day tasks feel completely dferent. ”Scott and I did everything together. I feel anxious when I’m out. I just can’t see my future without Scott in it. ”Even going back to work is so hard, some days I just can’t bring myself to talk to anyone, I want to sit and cry and sometimes feel like it won’t ever stop. “I dream about Scott, he is always in my thoughts.  In the wake of the killing Danielle took her children to the Kne Angel, a metal statue in Newtown, Powys designed to educate people about the impact of kne crime. She added: “I don’t even think Peter realises what damage he has done. “He apologised to me in the magistrates’ court but I don’t accept his apology, it won’t bring Scott back. “I can’t even begin to understand why anyone would ever pick up a kne. “As a family, we went to see the aposkne angelapos and it just brings home how many people’s lives are devastated by kne crime.  “I hope that I can start to grieve properly now, I feel like my mind has stopped me doing this. “What I witnessed that night will stay with me forever, I am only grateful that at the moment Scott passed he was with someone who loved him so much.” The court heard Dodds, who had been working in London, was home for the weekend and had been taking cocaine and drinking alcohol on Saturday August . Without going to bed he did the same on the Sunday. By the evening of the second day he was increasingly paranoid and looking for trouble, Judge Paul Sloan QC said during sentencing.  Referring to Scott, Judge Sloan added: ”As you have acknowledged, he had done nothing at all to justy that attack. ”He was an entirely innocent victim who was merely standing by his partner. “No sentence I’m permitted by law to impose could ever begin to ease the pain and suffering you have caused, could ever begin to redress the loss your actions have occasioned.” The court heard Dodds has  previous convictions, including for attempted robbery, having a bladed article, aggravated burglary, battery, affray, possessing cocaine and obstructing a railway.

Rosemarie Riley, , battled the elements on Tuesday to head to Asda for a few essentials including tea, bread and dog food. It was only when she got home to her husband John that they realised she had paid £. for the small shop. The gran-of-eight popped to the shop without her glasses and had unknowingly slipped a -pack of Durex Thin Feel condoms into her basket, believing the box contained her favourite brand of tea. With her husband John branding her a apossilly mareapos, red-faced Rosemarie asked her granddaughter Gemma Riley tothe condoms and get her £ back - leaving the -year-old aposhowlingapos with laughter.  Cleaner Gemma, from Lancashire, posted the hilarious mix-up on Facebook, racking up more than , like, comments and shares.She wrote: Sooo nanaposs gone and bought these from Asda thinking they were teabags - and her wonderful granddaughter has the job of ing them. So please,anyone sees me ing these, donapost judge. I know Valentineaposs is around the corner but I have no use for them and they cost her £. All she wants is her Yorkshire teabags. On another note, my day has just got a lot more embarrassing but goddamn hilarious at the same time.  Happy Tuesday. She will be wearing her glasses next time she goes shopping as we are worried what she might come back with. Rosemarie was surprised the woman serving her hadnapost said anything, but assumed aposshe must have thought I was a bit raunchyapos. I was mortied, my husband was more upset because Iaposd spent £ on them, she said. I just threw everything onto the conveyor belt and shoved them in the bag, I didnapost think. I suppose the lady should have said aposhave you made a mistake apos My husband normally does all the shopping but heaposs not very well. I donapost care, I just grab whateveraposs there, Iaposm a terrible shopper.  Mum-of-one Gemma took one for the team and headed back to the store that evening, hiding the item to be ed in her bag before surreptitiously approaching the customer service desk to explain what had happened. She said: My nan said they were actually on the aisle where the teabags were - so either someone popped them back, or sheaposs got mixed up, Iaposm not too sure. I said apossheaposs picked these up instead of the teabags, is there any chance I can get the teabags andthese apos The lady was laughing her head off. I was too and then I ran out there as quickly as I could.  I said to my nan aposI thought you were in for a good timeapos. Iaposve not stopped laughing, and itaposs brought many people to tears. I saw the box on the side and asked her aposhow come youaposve bought these apos She said aposI went to the Asda without my glasses and I picked them up thinking they were teabagsapos.

after failing to get any work since she left school at  - despite applying for  jobs a dayShareCommentsByAnn DixonLorraine King:,  FEB NewsSarah Duffin has never had a job since she left school  years ago \" to FREE daily email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters. Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailAn unemployed woman who has been on the dole since she left school  years ago is desperate for a job Sarah Duffin just wants to be given a chance and even applied for up to  jobs in one day. If any job came up, Miss Duffin says she would take it, but it is her dream to set up a business selling jam, curds and her own home grown produce.After failing to land a job since she left school at  with no qualications, the -year-old has known nothing  but signing on the dole, reports Hull Live. But she is begging for employment and claims she will work anywhere, anytime as anything just to get her foot on the job ladder. She said: Itaposs so disheartening and I donapost know what Iaposd do without my mum as she is my rock and otherwise Iaposd just give in.Have you been affected by this story  Email webnews@mirrorIaposve done courses on employability skills, health and safety, catering and food hygiene, English, maths, IT and Iaposve done so many dferent types of volunteering, including at charity shops, but none of it has got me anywhere. The other day I applied for  jobs in a day and didnapost get a single interview. Even though Sarah has attended many courses, she claims that she cannot find work because she has no practical experience, despite sending off hundreds of job applications each week. Just this month, Miss Duffin told Hull Live that her her ambitions to work in catering are being hampered by being forced to attend employability sessions and apply for cleaning roles, instead of volunteering in a kitchen to gain experience.  Despite the Department of Work and Pensions authorising her volunteer placement, and allaying her fears of being sanctioned should she not attend the employability sessions run by Standguide, Sarah has hit yet another brick wall by missing out on the opportunity. Because of all the faffing about with me trying to volunteer at St Margaretaposs Welcome Centre in Longhill as a kitchen assistant volunteer, whilst at the same time fighting the DWP to let me attend, Iaposve missed out on the opportunity and now Iaposm back to square one all over again, she said. I had a spark of hope when I thought I could do my volunteering, but now Iaposm lonely, down, desperate and suicidal all over again. All I want is to work and be given a chance. Iaposll work anywhere, anytime as anything and Iaposm reliable and trustworthy and just want someone to set me on.  Every two weeks, Miss Duffin gets £ every two weeks on benefits which she says she struggles to survive on, and previously told Hull Live she had been left unable to get help to get a job because of her age. She has put herself forward for education courses at ious institutions but, as these are mainly aimed at  to -year-olds, has been unable to gain a place. Despite applying for hundreds of jobs, Miss Duffin has been left with many unanswered applications, or has been turned down after going for interviews. On top of her jobseeking woes, the situation at home is also tough for Miss Duffin, who has never been able to get her own place and independence due to her finances.

Holly Valentine, , lives in LA but often travels around the world with work so decided to join the dating app as a way to meet people while exploring new cities. She signed up for the paid for version of the site, which allows you to see people in anywhere in the world, and uploaded a number of cute snaps. While she often shares saucy photos on her Instagram page, she insists all the photos on her dating profile were clean because sheaposs shy when it comes to dating. But Holly claims that within just a few hours of signing up with was inundated with messages from matches insisting her account was fake. She was soon locked out of the app, and when she tried to redownload it and sign in it wouldnapost work. She said: I travel a lot so I wanted to date and meet new people when I was traveling and in town, so I bought the most expensive package that they offer that lets you set your location to anywhere. It’s like  which for an app is expensive! I used clean pictures, did everything I was supposed to, swiped right on a couple people, I got some matches and then started binge watching Game of Thrones. Then after a couple hours I went back on saw a couple previews of messages and then got locked out of the app.The previews that I did see were “you’re probably not real”, “why would a girl like you be on tinder”, “why won’t you answer! ! ” “I didn’t even get to meet anyone or even really use the app. She contacted Tinder to find out what was going on and says she was given a full refund but no explanation. Holly wanted to try out the popular app as sheaposs shy when it comes to dating. She says she often gets marriage proposals on her Instagram account, along with strange requests from men who tell her to reach out to their wives and bosses at workthey fail to obey her She said: “I have a lot of respect for people with fetishes so it takes a lot to weird me out, but the one I am always shocked by is when guys want me to ‘ruin them’ and reach out to their wives or girlfriends or even jobsthey don’t obey me. “I’ve done it once and I could never do it again. Most of the time the requests are pretty normal though.” Despite her provocative appearance, Holly insisted she has always been a genuine “girl next door” and has a nerdy side she is not afraid to show.  She said: “Iaposm all natural, very fit, blonde, girl next door looking. I do have a nerdy side and I’m not afraid to show it but depending on the wardrobe or makeup I can go from looking like an all natural college girl or a bombshell. “I’m extremely real and people know that the first second. When people meet me in real le the first thing they say is ‘you’re exactly the same in real le’. “A lot of people are going for the ‘girl next door’ vibe but that’s just who I am.” Holly keeps herself busy preparing and uploading content on her sites throughout the week, waking up as early as am every morning for photoshoots, YouTube collaborations and planning brand strategies with her team. She said: “Half the week I’m shooting waking up at am, doing hair and makeup, shooting stuff for Instagram and my subscription s and then I’m usually answering emails and then taking photos for my company’s Instagram.  Sometimes I’ll do YouTube as well or collaborate with other models or influencers. The rest of the week I am at my office working with the branding team. Sometimes my Instagram actually comes into the mix there as wellwe are trying to promote something or reach out to contacts I’ve made from doing Instagram as an influencer.” Sheaposs also a member of the private social media app OnlyFans, where she posts private content to fans on a subscription basis - and is now one of the siteaposs top earners.  Holly insisted she uses the money earned from OnlyFans to help her business take off, reinvesting the funds back into her company branding. She said: “I had never done anything like that and I was really curious but I was working in an office every day and just didn’t think I could do it. Then I met a girl who did it and I just kind of went for it.

It has now emerged that a -year-old boy is suspected of being the father after Russian police became involved in the case.

We used to be jealous of what other clubs were doing before but we’re now probably one of the frontrunners.“We’re doing a lot of things other teams are aspiring to do. Because of the money and finance put in, it certainly makes your job a lot easier and helps a long way.“When you’re attracting young players to join the club, you want the kids to come into an elite environment rather than what it was before.“We weren’t bad before but there was no finance to do it properly. Andy Goldie is driving it on and we’ve managed to get to Elite status which is brilliant.“Restructuring the whole thing has meant new faces have come in with new ideas.“It’s about evolving all the time, you can’t just sit and accept it because that’s what was happening  or  years ago.”That said, Bow still believes attitude is what will help players get to where they want to be, citing former United man and Liverpool star Andy Robertson as an example.“That’s one of the biggest things I see with kids that are talented,” he added.“It’s how you install it into them to give that extra %. When you come out the other end of an academy, that’s the bit that will help you.“You need to be disciplined. Even since I played, and it’s changed a lot since then, football’s been like that.“You can’t go out every night, you’ve got to practice things and get the basics right first before you work on your game.“We’re wanting to give them the whole package by putting all the fragments together and glue them so we get better players at the end of the day. vw, px\"  “I’m a great believer in always getting to where you want to go.“You could stay here, play in the first team and,you’re good enough, you could always move.“We’ve had one recently with Banksy .“Andy Robertson is a fine example, to have came from Queen’s Park then come up here.“From us he probably could’ve gone straight to a Liverpool or a higher team but he went to Hull and earned his stripes.“Sometimes they want to accelerate it and get from down at E right up to A straight away, rather than working their way up.“That’s the way it goes sometimes and I’ve seen others like wee Gauldy .“I’d have put my mortgage on wee Gauldy being a success at Sporting eventually but, unfortunately for him, things turn out dferent ways.“He’s still playing in Portugal, of course, but he was the one I thought would’ve kicked on.“If I’d looked at Andy and Gauldy back then I’d have probably said Gauldy was the better player. It says a lot about Andy’s character as well and his real drive and determination.”Not everyone can be Andy Robertson, though, Bowman concedes.“I always think the Dutch are a brilliant example because even when players leave the likes of PSV and Ajax, they’ll go where.#Whereas, sometimes in Scotland they’ll drop out of academies and then football altogether.“We’d like to see those boys progress and keep playing as well. That’s a big part of my job, too.“I hope that when they come in full-time with us, they’ll aspire to be players at one level or another.“They’ve just got to show what they’re about. If you want to give that extra , , % to get there it will help you in the end.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/thecourier/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2020/02/Queen-of-the-South-v-Dundee-371x564.jpg ","title":"dens boss james mcpake looking for home run","story":"Boss James McPake was delighted to see Dundee put together their most complete home performance of the season against Partick – now he wants more.The Dark Blues dominated the - victory over the Jags from start to finish on Saturday.Home form was a question mark says the Dens gaffer – they’d won only five of their previous  home league matches and only one by more than the odd goal – and he’s pleased they’ve set the standard for future performances with four home matches coming up in the next six fixtures.James said: “We were really positive in the way we approached that game.“I said to the players before that the point at Morton the week before only becomes a half-decent pointwe beat Partick.“That’s a tough place to go but we should have won down there.“The positive signs were there and it showed on Saturday.“I’m particularly happy it showed at home because that’s been a question mark this season.“Even when we have won at Dens Park, it’s never been as controlled as that.“But it is only once – it needs to continue.”James had to shuffle his pack at the weekend due to injuries as he brought in Josh Meekings alongside Jordon Forster and Christophe Berra to make up a back three.And they stood up to everything thrown at them, earning their clean sheet.“Christophe was excellent again, you see the level he has played at,” added James.“I don’t think he got out of second gear, not because he’s not fit but because he’s that good a defender and knows where to be.“His game knowledge is so good that he never looks rushed, he never looks panicked – I was the opposite, my game knowledge and positioning was terrible!“I was delighted for Jordon and Josh, too.“It’s been a tough run at times in the season but, for my senior players in particular, they showed exactly what they want at this football club.“They stood up to be counted.”Dundee’s next game isn’t until next Saturday when they travel to Dumfries to face eighth-placed Queen of the South."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/01/5e32aa8eca4016.34594020.jpg ","title":"james mcpake weve not scored enough set pieces","story":"James McPake wants his Dundee side to become set-piece masters to help them grab the coveted second spot in the Championship.The Dens Park gaffer was delighted to see his team open the scoring last weekend against Partick directly from a corner, something he says hasn’t happened nearly enough.James said: “We’ve not scored enough from set-pieces and we have been working on that.“With three at the back like against Partick, we are a bigger side.“With Christophe Berra, Josh Meekings and Jordon Forster they have three big men to pick up and we have more targets.“We haven’t scored enough from set-plays for the size we are and the time we spend working on that.”Defensively, James was delighted to see the Dark Blues earn just their second clean sheet since the end of October. vw, px\"  “Our three centre-backs cruised it,” he added.“Christophe didn’t get out of second gear.

your experience is.“Making the wraps was actually really good fun, having something to do.“I make them every day but I think hers were better looking than mine.”The visit was aimed at giving Kate an insight into the work the charity does in Aberdeen – and at five other Scottish bases – as it aims to end homelessness the country.Matt added: “It’s completely doable and people like the Duchess of Cambridge coming to help publicise our message is one of the most effective ways of creating a cultural sht for us, so it means the world.”Kate spoke to staff and customers about their experiences of homelessness and how tough times in their early years shaped their lives, as well as the stigma they have faced.She said: “This isn’t about a second chance, it’s about finding a first chance.“Sometimes it’s the simple things, like the idea of listening to people.“It’s the kindness of communities like this that really make a dference.”Social Bite co-founder Alice Thompson and chief

All have end-stage organ failure, be it kidney, liver, lung or heart, and require a le-saving transplant.Organs for transplant usually come from bodies of people who agreed to donate before death. But as this does not produce enough organs, both Scotland and England plan to bring in an #opt out# system, meaning that on death a person#s agreement to organ donation is assumed unless they had actively opted out.Live donation is an alternative to awaiting a cadaveric organ. As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem. So she offered half of her liver in exchange for a kidney for her mother. Another donor was eventually identied who wanted to donate half her liver to her sister with liver failure but was rejected because her liver was too small. But she was cleared for kidney donation. So on the day of the swap four operations took place and two needy people received le-giving new organs.Although not presently being considered in the UK, with the ethical issues sorted, this multi-swap procedure opens the way for extended chains of donors and many more lives saved.*Torres et al Am J transplant. :-."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column january 10 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCouncillors wil be put in an unenviable position when they finally decidewhere the axe will fall on council services.But exactly how much Argyll and Bute will have to spend will not be known until the daffodils are beginning to pop through the ground.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community.

We did not have the new kitchen then. The hotel has always cooked the turkeys for us but cooking big pots of potatoes and vegetables was quite a job with just the gas rings. Back then, we had ice-cream and jelly for dessert.#Jean added: #It was all good fun and we had loads of laughs.#Elma continued: #We used to have sales to raise money for the dinner. Santa was on the stage and Jean’s children were his elves. They were only little then.#We modelled the clothes and the older women loved the bargains. We thought they were old, but they were probably the age we are now,# Elma said laughing. #We would shout #Roll up, roll up# to get them to come and see what we had on offer.#After a warm welcome from compère Martin Jefferies and a prayer of thanks for the food, the five-course meal was expertly served by members of the organising committee and their youthful helpers.A raffle, again free of charge, saw a large number of guests receive prizes and no-one was left disappointed as the remainder of the guests received selection boxes.Tarbert’s seniors showed they know how to party as dancers left their seats and enthusiastically took to the floor as soon as the musical entertainment began.A stunned Margaret Henderson was named #Citizen of the Year#, confessing she never expected to win the award.For more than  years, Margaret has collected money to support the Tarbert Sea Food Festival and Music Festival.

A wee van and a motorbike were behind them at the time and they let them pass and they disappeared down the twisty road at an incrediblespeed.They reached Tighnabruaich at about  o#clock and saw Fulmar in the water, but when they stopped to speak to Johnny Malcolm and Donald Turner they were told she was not in the water more than # an hour and still not fully rigged. They were quite right but George Smith said they were busy getting Psyche ready for launchingbut they would be out first thing in the morning to bend on the sails and finish off the rigging.They got their storesin the yard and with these and their luggage went aboard in two trips. Things were soon put sufficiently enough in order to allow them to get to bed and after watching Psyche go down the slip they were soon in their bunks. It was a beautully clear evening but distinctly cold.Next morning they were up at sevenand about eight the yard men came out and finished up their jobs. Jimmy Smith fixed up the slipping clutch and suggested we do away with the present gear lever fancy arrangement which was not strong enough for its work. This the Skipper agreed to though it meant a less handy working but it did away with the pin and shield that broke up the dog-house seat, they being replaced by a removable hatch cover. It certainly made sitting in the dog-house more comfortable.The Skipper went ashore to the village for meat and some curtain hooks while Archie watered ship and the other two continued cleaning and clearing up aboard.At quarter to twelve they were away under full sail and in brilliant sunshine but with a cold north-westerly they ran to Ardlamont then beat up to Tarbert, being passed just outside Tarbert as an aeroplane flew close overhead, by Blink. They noticed a huge oil tanker doing trials just off Arran.They were anchored off the herring pier before  o#clock and they had supper-cum-lunch then went ashore. The Pilot to visit a friend, the others to get milk in the village then to walk to the end of the road on Loch Fyne. On their way they spoke to an enthusiastic English pair, working in their garden, who wanted to know off which yacht they had come.During the evening Arcturus and Tunnag came in and one or two motor boats. Zaidie was in when they arrived and Leonora was anchored across Loch Fyne in Buck Bay.All aboard, Margaret and Archie went off to the islet in the harbour to get some roots for their new garden then soon afterwards all turned in, for though it was a glorious looking evening it was perishingly cold and the stove, lit as soon as they anchored, had been very welcome.On Sunday they were again up early and found a dull overcast day. The Pilot, ashore for water, heard a poor weather forecastfrom a fishing board. On the strength of this they hurried breakfast and by  o’clock were away with a south-westerly breeze.The Skipper gave the first beacon a rap with the boom-end as they ran out of the harbour. The beat down to Ardlamontand thee ran the engine for five minutes to get out of a nasty lop. The sun came out for about five minutes but by the time they had reached the Carry Buoythe rain had started and it got heavier and heavier.The wind strengthened with the rain and they moved up very fast into Tighnabruaich Bay then up to Loch Riddon to anchor off the pier at Ormidale. As they passed Tighnabruaich they saw Torridon was on Fulmar’s mooring and they watched her crew panicking to get off before Fulmar arrived. They wondered what the Torridons said when they saw Fulmar pass on through and realised that they could have stayed where they were. As they passed Glen Caladh the new Jansi of Kames passed under a not very healthy-sounding engine.They had lunch and the stove was lit then Margaret and Archie went ashore to visit friends and when they came back they brought with them a big sack of coal . The late afternoon and evening were spent below talking and listening to the rain hammering on the deck.Monday morning it was dry but blowing hard. They got the anchor early and motored to the moorings. The sails were hoisted to dry them and St Roma came close by to make their number and at one time a big school of thrasher whales went through the Kyles heading east and at a great speed.About noon they went ashore for a visit to the hotel and for a run round the Ardlamont road . Back aboard they had lunch and soon after packed up and came home."},{"url":null,"title":"the cinema on wheels returns","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe screen machine will be rolling back into Mid Argyll at the end of the month.Bringing with it a host of movies for film fans the Screen Machine will be in Campbeltown Road car park in Tarbert from Wednesday January  to Thursday January  and Lochgilphead Resource Centre car park from Friday January  to Sunday February .Musical fantasy film Cats, based on the Andrew Lloyd Webber stage musical, features an ensemble cast including James Corden, Judi Dench, Jason Derulo, Idris Elba, Jenner Hudson, Ian McKellen, Taylor Swt, Rebel Wilson, and Francesca Hayward.Also known as Star Wars: Episode IX, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is an epic space-opera film.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"hair raising happenings at the co op","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Co-op staff are on a fundraising mission which they hope will raise awareness and help overcome stigma around mental illness.Trusting her hairdresser Nicky MacDougall, from Casa in Ardrishaig, Tina Holloway will have her hair shaved off to raise funds for the Scottish Association for Mental Health .Explaining why she decided to take on the challenge, Tina said: #I didn#t really think before I opened my mouth.

After the session, as the children were heading for lunch, a girl from the class came up and said: ldquoI think the moral in that tale is that we should be kind, but that itrsquos often not easy to do.It was a traditional tale in which the tables are turned on a selfish rich man who had shown no compassion, but then hoped for kindness when he was the one in need. In the brief discussion with this young person, we agreed that itrsquos easier to show kindness to someone who we believe truly deserves it.She told me: ldquoI think the woman in the story did the right thing butIrsquom being honest,it had been me I donrsquot knowIrsquod have been able to be kind like her, because Irsquod have wanted revenge. Thatrsquos the problem, I think, we always think about revenge first. It can make us feel better for a short while but really makes things worse, well at least not better anyway. I try to be kind, sometimes it isnrsquot easy, but I try. Kindness is like a seed we have to plant.I shouldnrsquot have been bowled over by this, for I know a -year-old can have wisdom that many so called grown-ups have forgotten. But I was deeply impressed by her reflection on the storyrsquos message, and her honesty and integrity.This conversation also revealed the power of stories to raise moral dilemmas and human issues without finger pointing or being preachy.And she is right, it can often be very dficult to be kind. The world seems so full of stress, selfishness, anger and intolerance that there seems little space for kindness, except towards those we love and care about. On top of that, it seems increasingly dficult to survive, keep a roof above our heads and pay the bills. Kindness begins at home and often there is little energy, emotion or resources left to think or care about others we arenrsquot responsible for.There can even be a real fear thatwe show lsquotoo muchrsquo kindness we risk becoming a doormat, being used or treated unfairly. We can sometimes watch a child being kind to another and it not being reciprocated, and the temptation then is to suggest kindness isnrsquot shown next time.ldquoWe need to teach people a lesson, is often the mantra which derails our instinct to be kind another way of saying we want revenge. And letrsquos be honest: cruel, uncaring and selfish people can take advantage of someonersquos kindness and revenge does often make us feel better, in the short term anyway.But is the answer to allow unkind behaviour to frame the way we want to live and be treated  Do we respond to unkindness with more unkindness in   So consequently, cruelty with more cruelty, intolerance with more intolerance, selfishness with yet more selfishness  Doesnrsquot this mean that we allow lsquothe lessonrsquo to be that kindness doesnrsquot pay  As Gandhi is famously reported to have said: ldquoAn eye for an eye only ends up making the whole world blind.The truth is, kindness is not weakness but strength. It often isnrsquot easy and takes great courage. It doesnrsquot mean that people should not face consequences for their actions, or that people should be asked to forgive the unforgivable. But it does mean not allowing the unkindness of others to define how we are. We should not allow such acts to clip our butterfly wings.What do I mean by this  There is a theory called the lsquobutterfly effectrsquo. In this theory, it is said that the flapping of a butterflyrsquos wings could cause a chain reaction in which a hurricane could be caused on the other side of the planet. It is not meant to be taken literally, but to show that a very small act, although seemingly insignicant in itself, can have huge, unforeseen repercussions.In this way, kindness is a butterfly. Small acts of kindness may have a huge effect that touches people beyond the knowledge of the person who displayed the kindness. Acts of cruelty and hate also have the same power but all the more reason to flutter the wings of kindness so the wind more likely blows in the right direction.In this way, our behaviour is a butterfly. The way we flap its wings can have huge unforeseeable consequences, either for good or bad, both for ourselves and others. When we are kind, we actually makes ourselves happier too.So to make a real dference, we need only do tiny acts that are easily within our power, and as often as we can. A smile, a moment you truly listen to someone, a helping hand, holding the door open, trying to understand how someone feels, making a cup of tea, not meeting anger with anger, trying not to gain revenge but a change of heart and so on.This is what will truly make up the index of a healthy and happy society. And all of us can be players in this, and beneficiaries of our own kindness.David W Orr, a professor of environmental studies and politics, has said: ldquoThe plain fact is that the planet does not need more successful people. But it does desperately need more peacemakers, healers, restorers, storytellers and lovers of every kind.Great words, but that -year-old school girl already got this.

You can walk faster than the traffic.ldquoBut between am and am, and between pm and am, huge agricultural vehicles and HGVs actually hit  miles plus per hour through the town and our buildings shake, they physically shake.Mr Barrett was keen to see something done to slow vehicles down on the busy street.He said: ldquoIrsquom suggesting that some type of traffic calming is very necessary to preserve the fabric of the historic buildings.However, the idea of large vehicles doing more than  miles per hour on Market Street was refuted by Rab Moran.The community councillor, who was an HGV driver for about  years, said: ldquoI used to be an HGV driver and there is no way an articulated lorry or anything  for that matter clatters along Market Street at  miles per hour.ldquoYou sometimes donrsquot get up to  miles per hour going along there.Mr Moran stressed that it was a rural community and there were occasions where farm machinery needed to use the roads.Fellow community councillor Chris McEwan said there were issues with putting in traffic calming measures, such as speed humps.He said: ldquoSpeed humps are going to be absolutely useless to anything over a normal car size.ldquoThey are designed so ambulances can carry over.ldquoThey would not slow down trucks or anything .A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council confirmed that the issue was being investigated.She said: ldquoWe are aware of Mr Barrettrsquos concerns and have advised that the council is currently looking at measures concerning traffic movement in and around Haddington.ldquoThese plans may include consideration of traffic calming options to reduce speeds in certain areas."},{"url":null,"title":"met-office-name-storms-names-ruled","story":"After a mild start to the year, we have been battered by heavy rain and severe gales.But who comes up with the names for storms and whats next Why do the Met Office name storms The Met Office first decided to givestorms a namein  with the first one named Abigail in November .The hope was that naming severe storms wouldmake people more aware of them and how dangerous they can be.And it makes iteasier to follow the progress of a storm on the TV, radio, or on social media,it has a name.Can I suggest a storm name Every summer the Met Office andMet Eacuteireann askpeople to send in their ideas for future storm names.Look out for their #NameOurStorms campaign on social media around July this year for the chance for your name to be included.A new list of names will be compiled jointly between Met Eacuteireann,the Met Office and KNMIin September for the following   storm season.What are the storm names for this year Weve already had:Dennis is set to arrive this weekend and then weve got:Names alternate between male and female and run from A-Z based on some of the more popular names suggested to the Met Office as well as reflecting the ersity of Britain, Ireland and the Netherlands.To ensure the Met Office is in line with the US National Hurricane Centre naming conventions, names which begin with the letters Q, U, X, Y and Z are not included.Are there any names the Met Office has ruled out Among the names suggested to the Met Office, officials have rejected anything that isnt a proper name.That includes:Apocalypse, Baldrick, Big Boss, Gnasher, Hot Brew, root ripper, Stormageddon, Ssswetcaroline, Vader, Voldermort and branch wobbler.Other rejected names included Hammer, Hades,Forkbeard, Megatron andIn A Teacup."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-advice-issued-queen-margaret-university","story":"An email sent to all students and staff says that the inidual has been told to stay at home for  days as a ldquoprecautionary measure.More than , people have died from coronavirus after it was first reported late last year.The QMU inidual has not been identied and it is not knownthey are a staff member or student at the university, based in Musselburgh.The email also states that ldquothere is no particular need for concern and the university is ldquofollowing standard NHS advice.The email reads: ldquoYou will be aware of the coronavirus from media reports, and from previous communications issued by the university, and the requirement that people ing to the UK from mainland China and other specied countries should follow ing travellersrsquo advice.ldquoIn line with the travellersrsquo advice, we have been advised that a member of the QMU community, who has recently ed from travel in Thailand, has developed flu-like symptoms, and has therefore, as a precautionary measure,been advised to remain at home for a period of  days.

Any time I think back to my childhood, she was there. Not inside cooking and cleaning, but out in the sunshine with us, teaching us how to swim, picking brambles, and chatting to anyone who would listen.She would brighten up your day. I remember her sitting beside my bed calming me down when I was particularly anxious until I got to sleep.She never followed a recipe, was a terrible cook, an astounding jam maker and an amazing baker. She would laugh until she cried, make a tea bag last over  cups and several hours and swim in Lough Foyle every month of the year. For years after leaving home I would talk to her regularly on the phone and she would always know what to say when I needed reassurance.About ten years ago, my dad started to mention little things that were worrying him. She said that she couldnrsquot wind up our electric clock and found it hard to follow simple conversations on TV shows. This progressed to more problematic issues, like putting the electric kettle on the gas stove to heat the water, forgetting how to use the washing machine and not being able to find her way back home from her swim,  minutesrsquo walk away.After several consultations, which initially didnrsquot find any issues , a diagnosis of vascular dementia was finally confirmed. Our cousin, who is a GP, recognised the signs and encouraged us to follow up until we had a clear diagnosis.The first few years were very hard. We were all learning how to deal with repeated questions and she was getting frustrated at forgetting how to do things and losing her independence. Looking back, she was probably very frightened, and for the first time in our lives she would be argumentative and sometimes rude. This was not the mammy we remembered and it was a steep learning curve.Even more dficult was Dadrsquos adjustment to being a carer. He had been brought up in a devout Catholic family to believe that le was supposed to be hard and that lsquoin sickness and in healthrsquo meant that he had to do it all. He did a fantastic job cooking, cleaning and supporting mammy at home but he found it so dficult to lose his bright, caring and sunny we bit by bit and sank into depression.It was a horrible time, with Dadrsquos depression becoming so bad that we were afraid he would take his own le. Thankfully, after some very frank conversations, he started a prescription of antidepressants, which improved the situation almost instantly.Although we slowly managed to get care at home to help out, the situation finally got so bad that mammy was admitted into hospital with a severe infection and it was clear that she would need -hour nursing care from then on.We were lucky that my family had enough savings to privately pay for care in a specialised dementia nursing home. Others arenrsquot so fortunate and I have heard heartbreaking stories from friends of poor care provision and long waiting times.Mammy was very well looked after at the home and enjoyed the social interaction and opportunities to chat to everyone that passed. The staff loved her and I often bumped into strangers visiting her because she was such delightful company, eventhey didnrsquot know her.We made her a memory book and she loved hearing the stories about our lives and looking at the pictures. Dad visited every day and used to sing songs and pray with her. She never forgot songs and poems and could sing and recite better than I could.The hardest thing for me was when my mammy no longer recognised me. I was grateful that she always knew I was someone close to herbut it wasnrsquot the same.After three years in the nursing home, mammy stopped eating and drinking and ended up in hospital again with an infection but her body was exhausted and she was ready to go. I thought I had done all my grieving over the years she had dementia but the physical pain when she died was intolerable.Although she lost her memories and understanding, she had kept the twinkle in her eye and the ability to connect with those around her. My mammy was the best mammy and I miss her so much.Caroline WilsonThe Herald is backing a campaign by Alzheimer Scotland to ensure all patients with advanced dementia have access to free, -hour health care in the final years of their lives."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-comedy-festival-host-first-dementia-friendly-gig-elderly-described-stand-up-inaccessible","story":"Lynsey Neilson, Dementia Development Manager of Glasgowrsquos Golden Generation, which provides a range of services for older people, asked clients and families what they would like to see added to the programme.Many elderly people said they had enjoyed comedy but felt it was ldquonot always accessible for older people, particularly those with dementia or restricted mobility.Gigs tend to be held at night, in dimly lit and licensed basement clubs or venues without lts, while Lynsey who does stand-up ldquoas a hobby said routines that feature a lot of audience interaction or swearing may not be suitable for someone with dementia while reactions to certain types of humours might be unpredictable.The free but ticketed gig, which is now sold out, will be held during the day in the Fred Paton Centre, run by the charity in Glasgowrsquos West End.Sets will be kept to a maximum of seven minutes with frequent breaks and the family-friendly comedy wonrsquot feature any swearing or crowd participation.

And we avoid talking about borders - specically the looming issue of a hard border with England - because thatrsquos dficult.It seems that this nation prefers dealing with the petty party political point scoring stuff, not the big hard issues that really matter to society, and the future of this country and its democracy.With bridges, firstly wersquove got the whole embarrassment of the Queensferry Crossing - the pound.bn bridge that was never meant to close - being shut because of ice building up on cables and then falling on cars.Itrsquos being used as a stick to beat the SNP with. Fair enough, use the stick, the bridge should have been built better. Although, what infrastructure project in Scotland has ever gone according to plan  The Scottish Parliament  Edinburghrsquos trams And for many folk itrsquos pretty dficult to get het up about weather closing a bridge in Scotland, of all places.Then wersquove got Boris Johnsonrsquos proposed bridge between Scotland and Northern Ireland. We all know the idea is mad. Itrsquos never going to happen.But inevitably, in Scotland , the issue has become symbolic of which side of the constitutional ide a voter sits on. Pro-indy  The NI-Scotland bridge is a wicked intrusion and or unionist ploy by Westminster. Pro-union  Just give it a chance. Therersquos no such thing as a bad idea.Actually, there is.What this country really should be focusing on this week isnrsquot bridges but borders, after comments by the First Minister in Brussels. In a gnomic discussion about the future relationship between the European Union and Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon was asked about the prospect of a border between Scotland and England in the event of independence.Her delphic answer was that an independent Scotland inside Europe would have to ldquomitigate any border with England. Itrsquos hard to interpret this in any other way than a warning, an admission, a hint, even, that a border is coming in the event of independence.Why is the nation not engaged in full debate over borders  Why are we talking about bridges After being asked about a border with England, the FM was quoted as saying: ldquoItrsquos not independence that threatens borders - itrsquos Brexit that does that, and itrsquos the approach to Brexit that is being taken. Irsquoll continue to argue for the relationship to be as close as possible.ldquoBut obviously, when we see where the UK EU relationship ends up, then the Scottish Government can work out how we can mitigate that in a Scottish sense.Therersquos a lot that the FM is saying in a few words. Shersquos right when she states that Brexit, and Johnsonrsquos vision of Brexit, will bring borders. But wonrsquot independence risk the same - with a possible border between England and Scotland  It feels a  dichotomy to pretend otherwise in a post-Brexit world.Sturgeon says shersquoll continue to argue for a close relationship with the EU after Brexit. Personally, that cheers a pro-European like me. However, the fact that the FM knows shersquoll have to argue for such a close relationship implies that the looming prospect of post-Brexit borders presents real dficulties when it comes to co-operation between countries. In fact, forget lsquoimpliesrsquo, everyone knows that Brexit means Borders and Borders mean distance between nations.Would the same be true post-independence when it comes to the relationship between England and Scotland Then the FM gets around to answering the question posed about a possible border. She states that once the UK-EU orce is done, and the nature of the future relationship between Britain and Europe is clearer, then Scotland will try to lsquomitigatersquo the issue of any border with England.So a border is inevitable Sturgeon is about the only leader - scrub that - only politician for whom Irsquove much respect left. I rate her intellect and character. Shersquos got dignity and is a great political performer. However, shersquos not being clear enough with the Scottish people when it comes to any future border.This issue needs real honesty. But once again we see the interests of the SNP outweighing the interests of the public and the country. Talking about borders doesnrsquot win votes. But the Scottish people - especially Undecideds - need proper discussion and debate so they can fully consider the issue of independence.Independence supporters need fine detail too. Perhaps, all Yes voters like me will be unfazed at with the prospect of a border. But perhaps we wonrsquot. We canrsquot make up our minds until we have a frank discussion.Of course, we donrsquot yet know the full shape of the UKrsquos relationship with the EU, and therefore therersquos a lack of clarity around the shape of any future relationship between Scotland and England.However, thatrsquos absolutely no reason to hold off on having serious adult discussions around issues like borders, future trade deals with England, or the armed forces in a post-independence Scotland.At the very least, itrsquos good to be prepared.Irsquove suggested before that separating the Yes movement from the SNP is in the best interests of independence, because then big dficult issues like borders can be worried over without party political concerns coming first. That means the public hear the case for independence without the distorting filter of the SNP.If the Yes movement is serious about achieving independence then it needs to start talking honestly about borders, armies and negotiations. These issues are ugly and dficult but not one No voter will be persuaded to vote Yes unless theyrsquore tackled truthfully.Both sides of the constitutional ide need to lt their eyes up a little too. Itrsquos a bit unambitious of a nation to obsess over a bridge closed in winter, or a fantasy bridge over the Irish Sea, when we should be raising our eyes and looking to the future - eventhat future is dficult, and eventhat future does mean discussing uncomfortable matters like borders.Neil Mackay is Scotlandrsquos Columnist of the Year"},{"url":null,"title":"brian-beacom-make-men-not-good-look","story":"I can also recall wearing her brown trousersto a job interview.

But today, our courts exercise a form of political power.The Liberal Democrats insisted Ms Braverman was ldquounfit to serve as Attorney General.Daisy Cooper, the partyrsquos Justice spokeswoman, said: ldquoLiberal Democrats will not allow this dangerous, authoritarian Conservative Government to undermine the rule of law and erode inidual rights and freedoms.One key appointment was Alok Sharma, the International Development Secretary, who was promoted to Business Secretary but will also take on the role of Minister for the COP climate summit in Glasgow.With controversy shrouding the preparations for the UN-sponsored event, not least the wrangling between London and Edinburgh over policing costs, one of Mr Sharmarsquos early tasks will be to pour diplomatic oil on raging political waters.It is expected that one of his first tasks will be to travel to Scotland for a meeting with Nicola Sturgeon to try to repair relations and end the damaging stand-off between the two governments.In other reshuffle moves:*the little known Amanda Milling replaced James Cleverly as Minister without Portfolio and the Conservative Party Chairman, attending Cabinet*Stephen Barclay, the former Brexit Secretary, became Chief Secretary to the Treasury*Oliver Dowden, the Cabinet Office Minister, was promoted to the role of Culture Secretary, replacing Baroness Morgan*George Eustice, the Farming Minister, moved upwards to replace Theresa Villiers as Environment Secretary*Anne-Marie Trevelyan, the Armed Forces Minister, was promoted to Cabinet as the International Development Secretary*Penny Mordaunt, the former Defence Secretary, ed to the frontline as Paymaster General.As expected Dominic Raab and Priti Patel retained their respective high offices of state at the Foreign Office and Home Office while those also keeping their Cabinet posts include Matt Hancock at Health, Ben Wallace at Defence and Grant Shapps at Transport.Michael Gove will continue his key strategic role at the Cabinet Office while Liz Truss stays on as Trade Secretary. However, the EU trade talks negotiations will be carried out by top official David Frost reporting directly to the PM.Alister Jack retained his position as Scottish Secretary and said: ldquoIrsquom honoured to have been reappointed as Scottish Secretary by the Prime Minister.ldquoI look forward to helping to deliver a bright future for Scotland, and to continue to stand up for the majority of Scots who voted in  to remain part of a strong United Kingdom."},{"url":null,"title":"case for change at insch station","story":"The Regional Transport Partnership for the North East of Scotland, Nestrans, has written to Transport Scotland for approval to undertake further work on accessibility issues at Insch Rail Station.At their board meeting next week, members of the partnership will hear that an ‘Initial Appraisal: Case for Change’ report has been submitted to Transport Scotland, evidencing the longstanding issues at the station.The -page report follows the study undertaken last year which engaged with several stakeholders, including a public consultation event in October.Chair of Nestrans, Councillor Sandra Macdonald said: “We know from the survey engagement that a wide range of people are affected by the access arrangements at the station. Wider improvements to the local network will result in more and better services between Inverness and Aberdeen, which mobility impaired users will not be able to use to their full advantage.“Not only is there a strong desire within the community for future improvements to be made, the consultation has suggested that the station would be used more frequentlyaccessibility was improved.”Although many stations across Scotland suffer from accessibility issues, Insch presents a unique case in that users would have to travel at least km to reach an alternative partly accessible station, or travel to Dyce for a fully accessible station. In that regard, Insch is considered one of the least accessible stations in Scotland.A number of options have been generated to improve accessibility at Insch.Transport Scotland has been asked to approve the Initial appraisal report, before the options identied are taken forward for more detailed consideration.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Louisa McKay, who runs King Edward-based Field Yoga\"  Get healthy at yoga and vegan workshopviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"This Land Rover Discovery TDV Commercial Auto sold for #,\"  Vehicles are in demand at Thainstone viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"get healthy at yoga and vegan workshop","story":"A yoga teacher and a vegan chef have teamed up to offer a retreat and workshop in Turrf promoting a healthy lestyle and the benefits of a plant-based diet.The event at the Baden Powell Centre has been organised by Louisa McKay, who runs King Edward-based Field Yoga, and Debbie Thornton, who runs Little Buddha Beauty and Bakes from Pitmedden.It will combine a long yoga practice with a plant-based cooking workshop.Those attending will start the day by sampling a green juice of spinach, cucumber, apples and lime before practicing an hour and a half of Yin Yoga to ‘open up the body and mind’.Yin is a relaxing and calming form of yoga that promotes healthy mobility and range of motion and is said to be hugely beneficial in balancing a hectic and stressful modern lestyle.At the end of the yoga practice, the group will make ‘Buddha bowls’, tapenade and chocolate mousse for lunch under the guidance of Debbie from Little Buddha.

However, Steve’s natural talent and drive quickly meant that they were expanding and moved into Inverurie.Not long after the move Steve and Jim amicably parted ways leaving Steve as the sole proprietor of IK. Branching out and running the business on his own, Steve was never one to shy away from risks.As well as his ability to grab an opportunity with both hands, a critical aspect of Steve, and therefore, IK Motor’s success, is his commitment to going the extra mile for the customer.Steve commented: “Ultimately, it’s all about giving the customer a good deal, and letting them know that they can always count on us to come through for them. Our interest in the customer doesn’t end when they purchase a vehicle, we make sure they get good service afterwards.” This commitment to customers extends to the wider community at large, with Steve always making the effort to give back and ensure that Inverurie shares in IK’s success. He said: “In Inverurie there is a particularly strong sense of community. Even though it’s expanded considerably, that sense of cohesion is still there, and we love to be a part of that.“Every year we try and do what we can to give something back. On our th anniversary we raised over £, for CLAN. Last August, we organised a ball at Meldrum house and raised over £, for Macmillan Cancer Support.”“We support local football teams and local sports in general, but I can’t take sole credit for what we do, without the support of my family, friends, the business, and the people in and around the town it wouldn’t be possible.” data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Storm Ciara damage.\"  Storm Ciara:  of the most shocking photos of the damage flooding left in its wake viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Looking to the future, Steve shows no signs of slowing down having recently entered the property development sector and is near completion of a new build facility for international supplier screw fix, with a number of other projects in the pipeline."},{"url":null,"title":"kemnay incidents on the rise","story":"Assaults, kne offences and thefts have all increased in Kemnay in recent months.New figures presented by Police Scotland to the village’s community council also show a small rise in the number of drug offences as well as careless and drink-driving since November.In its report, officers also said they had to deal with four incidents relating to threatening and abusive behaviour, a racially aggravated incident and an instance of fraud.Scottish Conservative Aberdeenshire West MSP Alexander Burnett praised the work of the police in ensuring crime in Kemnay was kept to a minimum.Commenting he said: “Officers in Kemnay deserve great praise for dealing with such incidents in the village at a time when the SNP Government is failing Police Scotland with cuts leading to fewer frontline personnel.“Residents can be rest assured officers are continuing to clamp down on a iety of incidents in the village ranging from assaults to dangerous driving.”“Everything must be done to ensure the already stretched police service is able to serve the public to the best of its ability and I would urge anyone who thinks they have seen a crime of any sort to contact police immediately.”Inspector Gareth Hannan, of Inverurie community policing team, said: “Officers will continue to take a robust approach balancing education with enforcement to ensure the relatively small minority who are responsible for committing offences and antisocial behaviour with vehicles are held accountable for their actions.“We will be working with partners and making use of antisocial behaviour legislation.“Residents in the areas affected by antisocial driving are encouraged to contact police on  at the time to report incidents in order for us to take positive action.”data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Louisa McKay, who runs King Edward-based Field Yoga\"  Get healthy at yoga and vegan workshop viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"tesco scraps tinned multipacks in stores","story":"Tesco stores in Ellon and Inverurie will replace plastic-wrapped multipacks with plastic-free multibuys on tinned food eliminating  tonnes of plastic from the environment.Tesco has announced it will become the first UK retailer to remove plastic-wrapped multipacks from all Tesco stores and replace them with plastic-free multibuys.This will see  million pieces of plastic eliminated.

Daniel Bingham, senior pets buyer for Wilko, offered some advice on helping wild birds thrive during the colder season.He said: “Birds feed every day and don’t store energy well, so one or two bad days in cold weather or without food can be very dangerous for them.“Put out a good selection of food in feeders or on tables to attract birds to your garden — things like fat balls are nutritious and high in energy — perfect to help them maintain weight and stay fuelled.“Put some soft food down for the songbirds who can’t reach the feeders. Suet blocks and pellets work particularly well, as they give the birds a great energy boost and plenty of calories.“Don’t forget to provide fresh water. Ponds, puddles and other water sources may freeze over, making them inaccessible to birds. Birds can be timid so you’ll need to be patient build up trust by sharing plenty of treats and you could soon be rewarded with the perfect wild bird shot”.The Wilko wild bird competition runs until March . All photographs should be taken in a garden or outdoor setting and must have been taken by you.Entries can be emailed to wildbirdcompetition@wearebrazenprcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Unless that changes, Orkney will be left with the oldest fleet and the highest fares in the country — and that can only be described as blatant discrimination.”In a response to Councillor Stockan, the minister for energy, connectivity and the islands, Paul Wheelhouse, says Orkney Islands Council is “wholly responsible for the inter-island ferry services which they provide.”He says minsters understand the “signicant financial challenges that can fall on inidual local authorities with responsibility for ferries” and that the Government has “made clear our commitment to Orkney’s internal ferry services” with additional funding of £. million in total over the past two years.Councillor Stockan said: “I am extremely disappointed that the First Minister has chosen not to respond to our considerable concerns directly, or to meet with me to discuss an issue of fundamental importance to our community.“I can only describe the Government’s current position as irrefutable discrimination against the people of Orkney. The additional funding we received over the last two years was welcome, but fell far short of what is needed to fully fund our internal ferry service.“I call on the Government to address this when the budget is published this week — and I have asked the other parties at Holyrood to offer us their full support in securing full and fair funding for Orkney.“The running and replacement costs of Western Isles ferries are fully subsidised by the Government. It is only right and proper that we in Orkney should be treated in the same way.”In the letter, Councillor Stockan also criticises the Government for its continued failure to introduce Road Equivalent Tarf on routes linking Orkney to the Scottish Mainland.“The roll-out of RET began on West of Scotland ferry routes more than a decade ago, reducing fares for local people and visitors alike,” he added.“It is our firm belief that there is no impediment preventing RET being introduced on Orkney routes, and that any further delay is unfair and will result in signicant prejudice against local ferry users.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He played in bands in London, rubbing shoulders with the Rolling Stones, Eric Clapton and his jamming buddy, Ritchie Blackmore, who went on to form the legendary rock bands Deep Purple and Rainbow.He even jammed at a party with Cream bassist and vocalist, Jack Bruce.A visit from Screaming Lord Sutch, who wanted him to go to Germany with him as a bass playermade Jim think again about a career in rock music.His first passion was always art, and comic book art was his favourite genre.He declined Lord Sutch’s offer and after a few years ed to his beloved Orkney. Here he continued drawing for TV comics before working for AD. He was then head-hunted by the American giants, DC Comics and Marvel Comics.Sadly, Jim suffered with Parkinson’s Disease for over  years and passed away on December , .Despite the diagnosis he continued drawing, painting and writing original sci-fi stories for many years.This celebration of his le and art is dferent from other recent exhibitions, as it contains his le story, original artwork and artefacts relating to him.It also features many Orkney related pieces, rather than just sci-fi heroes like Judge Dredd and Batman.Local characters from the th century hang alongside paintings showing the story of St Magnus, wartime Hoy and illustrations from books, like The Bard of Ballarat and Willick o’ Pirliebraes.Jim’s we, Wendy, said: “I am delighted that the Orkney Museum is having an exhibition of my late husband Jim’s work.“The fact that a young boy from the small Orkney island of Hoy should become world famous in his chosen field of comic book illustration is an achievement in itself, but there were many other aspects to Jim’s le.“This exhibition gives an insight into his early le in Hoy, as well, as his time in the RAF and the excitement of being in the London music scene during the ‘swinging sixties’.“I think it is a true reflection of the times he lived in and I hope it will interest the folk who see it.”The Orkney Museum is open Monday to Saturday, .am-.pm, .pm-pm.

Since then, using successive budgets, ministers have singled out HIE for deep cuts while increasing support for economic development where in Scotland. On the face of it, this is just centralisation by another name.“The consequences of this ill-judged decision should not be underestimated. With Brexit already posing a real threat to economic development across the region, including here in Orkney, it makes no sense for this SNP government to compound those dficulties by further slashing HIE’s funding.”Shetland MSP Beatrice Wishart added: “HIE have shown that locally-based support can make all the dference for rural enterprises. There can be no good reason to backtrack on that principle through cuts to their funding.“The solution to local challenges can’t always be found in the central belt. HIE must be properly supported to continue their role in providing an alternative.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He has urged the Scottish Government to take the issue of fly-tipping more seriously, highlighting the environmental and social impacts of the incidents.Speaking later, Mr Halcro Johnston said: “Rural communities, like many across the Highlands and Islands, are particularly vulnerable to the utterly irresponsible and, of course, criminal activity of fly-tipping.“Incidents can cause real distress, as well as serious environmental concerns, for those communities blighted by fly-tipping. And the problem is often compounded when the waste which is dumped is not removed and then attracts even more incidents.“While fly-tipping is often carried out by a small number of offenders, too few of those responsible are being brought to justice. With both Police Scotland and local council budgets squeezed, that undoubtedly impacts on efforts to identy and prosecute offenders, as well as hampering efforts to clean up blighted areas.“The importance of a clean and attractive environment to the health and well-being of local residents is often overlooked. Many are rightly proud of their local communities and are left angry at those who fly-tip, as well as frustrated at efforts to combat it.“The Scottish Government needs to ensure there is a greater emphasis on tacking the scourge of fly-tipping, bringing to book those responsible for it, and making sure Police Scotland and local councils are properly resourced to do so”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

In , Tavish Scott and I voted to support the budget.“Since then, however, the SNP has sought to backslide on this commitment and short change the communities in Orkney and Shetland. This year, that amounts to a shortfall of £m.“It is not good enough for SNP Ministers to claim they are open to negotiationthey so brazenly fail to honour the commitments they have made in previous negotiations. What trust can anyone have in the promises they make “Derek Mackay may have had to fall on his sword but the commitments he made to fair ferry funding for the Northern Isles was one made on behalf of the government as a whole. It is one that must now be delivered: no s and no buts.”Ms Wishart added: “The principle of fair ferry funding was not only accepted by this SNP government, it also reflected the will of the parliament.“Any responsible Government budgets for basic leline services needed across the country.

But today, our courts exercise a form of political power.She also said that while the Human Rights Act was ldquonoble in its intentions, ldquothe concept of lsquofundamentalrsquo human rights has been stretched beyond recognition.She said she was not ldquolambasting the judiciary or launching a ldquodiatribe against human rights but arguing that the ldquodelicate relationship between law and politics is off-balance, adding: ldquoI donrsquot challenge the quality of our judges, but I do question their trespass into inherently political terrain for which a legal answer is wholly insufficient.The article followed comments she made in December on Newsnight, where she said she hoped legal reforms would restore the principle of ldquojudicial deference, adding: ldquoWhich means that our courts and our judges generally stay out of politics. vw,vw,px, px\"Simon Davis, president of the Law Society of England and Wales, congratulated both Justice Secretary Robert Buckland on his reappointment and Ms Braverman on joining the Cabinet, adding: ldquoWe look forward to working with them to ensure that the rule of law is upheld in this country, that justice is available to all and that our strengths as a jurisdiction are maintained: an independent judiciary, a talented legal profession and laws which uphold business and human rights.Caroline Goodwin, chairman of the Criminal Bar Association, said the organisation looked forward to working with Ms Braverman, adding: ldquoA government that stands up for the rule of law acts in the best interests of the people ndash Parliament included.But Liberal Democrat justice spokeswoman Daisy Cooper described the appointment as an ldquoassault on the rule of law and accused Ms Braverman of being ldquointent on weakening our courts, adding: ldquoSuella Braverman clearly believes that Tory ministers should be above the law. That makes her unfit to serve as Attorney General.On Thursday Mr Cox suggested MPs and peers could scrutinise the appointment of judges to the Supreme Court but insisted the Government has ldquono desire to see politically appointed judges.But his idea appeared to be at odds with Mr Buckland who last week said he did not want to see a system of judges ldquobeing put in front of select committees and asked about their political past or views.The Tories pledged at the general election to examine the relationship between the Government, Parliament and the courts, and vowed to set up a Constitution, Democracy  Rights Commission within a year to come up with proposals to restore trust in democracy.The Conservative manesto promised to examine the judicial reviewprocess to ensure it is ldquonot abused for political reasons and pledged to ldquoupdate the Human Rights Act.Rishi Sunak: ChancellorAlok Sharma: Business SecretaryGeorge Eustice: Environment, Food and Rural Affairs SecretaryOliver Dowden: Culture SecretaryBrandon Lewis: Northern Ireland Secretary:Suella Braverman: Attorney GeneralThe seeds of the Governmentrsquos battle with the courts were sown during the Brexit rows, when campaigner Gina Miller successfully challenged the Government over then prime minister Theresa Mayrsquos right to trigger Article  without a vote in Parliament.The Supreme Court ruling in  that Mr Johnsonrsquos decision to suspend Parliament was unlawful fuelled Tory suspicions about judicial activism.Earlier this week the Government appeared to step up its battle with the judiciary following the Court of Appeal decision to prevent the deportation of  foreign offenders to Jamaica.Downing Street said it ldquobitterly regretted the courtrsquos decision and Government sources said the row over the deportation flight showed why an examination of JR was needed.Dominic Cummings, one of the Prime Ministerrsquos closest aides, reportedly said there must be ldquourgent action on the farce that judicial review has become following the courtrsquos decision.Amanda Pinto QC, chairman of the Bar Council, praised Mr Cox as a ldquostaunch supporter of the rule of law and a ldquogreat supporter of the Bar, adding: ldquoWe congratulate Suella Braverman and look forward to working with her and Robert Buckland on ensuring access to justice and protecting the rule of law.Ms Braverman said: ldquoOne of my first priorities is to continue the Governmentrsquos work in rebuilding confidence in our justice system, particularly with victims.copy -.

He attended St Mary’s Primary School in Portglenone and St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena.Speaking about his early involvement in music, he said: My parents didn’t play but they sent all of us to music and dancing for years and drove us to lessons and events every night of the week, I owe them a lot for that. They had a keen interest and were very supportive.I was sent to the local Comhaltas Ceoltoacuteiriacute Eacuteireannbranch in Portglenone when I was around .I started tin whistle classes with the late John Kennedy first, then progressed onto the button accordion with Tommy Doherty.My parents then started taking us to The Crosskey’s Inn every week for sessions and I also joined the Comahltas branch there too.That place had a huge effect on me, there were great musicians there of all ages and they really helped cultivate my interest growing up. I still go there when I can.As part of the Crosskeys Comhaltas we won many All-Irelands. We had a great gang at the time along with dedicated parents that were also passionate about the music.Going to the Fleadhs was as much about socialising with other kids in music as it was competing. We got up to all sorts of ilment that I won’t get into here!I started on the tin whistle, moved to button accordion then started to teach myself guitar when I was . I quickly became obsessed with the guitar.Its such a versatile instrument and one that you can literally play or learn any style of music on.From playing the guitar I was able to give a few other stringed instruments a go - bouzouki, tenor guitar, bass, electric guitar.Its not a big stretch to adapt the same skills on guitar over to other instruments, and its nice to have dferent colours available, especially when writing.Sometimes I write on the piano - because I’m not great at playing piano, you’re forced to think dferently and that can work in your favour.In terms of my influences, for the accordion it would be Mairtin OConnor or Dermot Byrne. For the guitar, its harder to narrow it down, but three that stand out are Arty Mc Glynn, Steve Cooney and John Doyle. My own style is probably some hybrid mix of those three.I have worked with Grammy nominated fiddler Liz Carroll, folk singer Karan Casey, Duke Special, Liam O’Maonlaiand Bela Fleck.I am involved with ‘Ulaid’ with John Mc Sherry and Donal O’Connor, and Scottish group ‘Fiddlers Bid’. As a guitar player I regularly work with a lot of other traditional bands including Lunasa, Flook, Buille, and the Mairtin O’Connor Band.BEOGABeoga was formed while Seaacuten was a pupil at St Louis Grammar School.He continued: At St Louis, I was involved with the Traditional Group the whole time I was there.Frank Cassidy directed it and was always very encouraging. We competed in ‘Slogadh’ competitionsand had great craic travelling around to the dferent competitions.Beoga was formed around this time and the teachers were very understanding about me missing days here and there to play gigs.I used to go to the States for these long weekends and be catching up on school work on the plane home.Whilst at St Louis I never actually studied music as an option. I didn’t have a classical background and for some reason never thought it would be a viable career option!Whilst studying for my A levels, I started to become really obsessed with music and decided that was it - I couldn’t even think about doing anything .Up until that point I was looking at careers in IT. I heard about a new course in University of Limerick offering a degree in Irish music, that didn’t require A level music, you just had to go for an interview and perform.I got in anyway and I met Niamh there. We were in the same class and became big pals and she ended up joining the band.She’s an amazing fiddle player and singer and I’m lucky to have found her!ED SHEERANBeoga have been together for around  years and they have been afforded the opportunity to travel the world doing what they love.Seaacuten said: We’ve toured a lot around Europe and North America but have also been lucky to tour in more exotic places like Japan, Australia and Russia. We’re travelling a bit less now, thankfully, but at one stage I was definitely seeing more of the band than my own family.One of the biggest audiences the band have performed to was a , strong crowd at the Glastonbury festival in  alongside Ed Sheeran.Sheeran, whose grandparents hail from the Emerald Isle, is well-known for his love of Irish traditional and folk music, even recording a version of The Parting Glass.He has said that one of his earliest musical memories is listening to the Irish Heartbeat album by Van Morrison and The Chieftains and he is also a fan of The Bothy Band and Planxty. Close friend of the band, Foy Vance, shares the same record label as Sheeran and had been supporting him on tour. They had listened to a few of Beogas tunes on the road, and Ed reached out to the band to help with his album.Seaacuten explained: We went to over to his house in Suffolk for a couple of days. It was all very relaxed, he made everyone feel completely at ease.The weather was amazing so we were outside in the garden a lot. We played on four tracks and two made it to the album so we’re delighted.One of them, ‘Galway Girl’, came about just jamming in the garden outside the studio. He was completely sound, we stayed in his house and had a few beers and even played a game of football at one stage.Working with Ed has presented a lot of new opportunities to play and write with other artists.Our friend Foy Vance was the guy responsible for introducing us to Ed. We’ve written a good few songs with Foy now and will hopefully keep creating more with him, he’s an amazing singer and an even more amazing songwriter and is finally being recognised as such.We’ve also worked with Johnny McDaid on the songwriting and production side of things, although he’s been crazy busy since Snow Patrol started touring again.Just recently we’ve been writing a bit with Cormac Neeson from ‘The Answer’. The collaborations are really exciting to me, you just don’t know whats going to come out of a writing session but that buzz of finishing the day with a song is a real high.Seaacuten believes there is a great local traditional music scene stating: I think traditional music is stronger than ever.He encourages all age groups to get involved and give it a try, commenting: If I had any advice, it would be to not to get too worked up about competitions and instead focus more on the social side of the music.While competitions can be good to focus on something, it can put a lot of unnecessary pressure on kids.In his rare free time, Seaacuten has a purpose built recording studio in Portglenone called Bannview Studios.He has been recording for about  years and recently moved into his current space about five years ago.He said:I regularly engineer and produce other artists here, so that keeps me busy outside of the bands schedule.Beoga will be releasing a new album in the Spring. It will include singles released over the last few months along with some new songs and instrumentals that the group have been working on over the last year.Beogas latest release is called ‘Make a Mark’ and features Co. Down singer Ryan Mc Mullan.

As per usual, Id tucked into the usual holiday grub and you can guess the result. The shirt wouldnt even button and I knew that something had to be done, he says.But you cant blame excess weight on one season of being jolly and, looking back through his le experience, Stewart can trace how he piled on the pounds.Now , the Ahoghill man weighs in at six feet three inches and  stone lbs. Back in June last year he was  stone lbs and , he freely admits, probably set to put on even more weight.However, it wasnt always that way.Stewart attended Fourtowns Primary and Cullybackey College and, while he was taller than the average pupil - I was a big lanky stick - it was not until the age of  that he seemed to sprout up to his current height.And when he turned , Stewart entered the world of work as an apprentice joiner under the tutelage of Alan Darraghand Robert Greer. Its a trade he still works in and takes great pride in to this day.But it also exposed him to the traditional eating culture which was - and is - part and parcel of that trade.On an average day you could start early with a -piece fry, probably washed down with a big bottle of fizzy drink. “Youd be scoffing a chocolate bar or crisps at am and then it was lunchtime - by that time I’d eaten the guts of  calories! I never really ate much for lunch but I knew other boys on sites who would be getting tucked into a sausage supper with gravy over it. By the middle of the afternoon you might want another bar of chocolate - just to tide you over to teatime, he laughs.And what did tea consist of in the young McDonalds household Nothing fancy, just what youd expect in any local home. But I have to admit I would have finished off a big plate! Dont even mention the evening time when you might knock more biscuits and mineral into you.”On a rough calculation, Stewart could have been touching the terying heights of  calories a day- a good  more than the recommended daily allowance for a man involved in an ‘active job’. Like all fit young men Stewart was of the mistaken belief that he could eat whatever he wanted, whenever he felt like it. And that problem only got worse when he passed his test at the age of . Growing up, everyone around our place was very active. We played football in the morning, breaktime and football in the evening. We were always on the go. We walked or ran everywhere - then I got a car and that was a big downfall,” he explains. It became all too easy to jump in the car and scoot into town for a takeaway meal and for Stewart, the top choice was a ‘Number ’ from Harryville’s Papa’s Kitchen. “Loved it far too much,” he says. “My favourite takeaway grub of all time. I could have eaten them to a band playing!”Having a car gave Stewart the lazy option and he exploited it to the hilt. “I wouldn’t have walked theof myself,” he admits. “You don’t half pile on the weight when you get behind the wheel. That should be stamped on your driving licence!”Throughout his le, Stewart had been a keen footballer and his frame and height made him ideal for goalkeeping.“I kept goal for Ahoghill Thistle for years,” he says. But surely the rigours of football training helped him keep fit and trim “I’d say I train harder now than I did when I was in my s and doing nets,” he laughs. “The outfield boys worked a lot harder than I did at training so while it did keep me relatively active it was never making up for the energy drinks, chocolate, crisps and general junk food I was eating,” he explains. In , Stewart took over the managerial role at Thistle and, more importantly, he managed to convince we Julie to marry him. Stewart’s sneaky takeaway trips were curtailed but, like all young couples, he and Julie enjoyed a nice dinner for two. “Only problem is I could have eaten for both of us,” laughs Stewart. “If you had set me down a big sirloin with chips and lashings of pepper sauce I’d have gorbed it in a couple of minutes!“Combine that with a starter and a big desert washed down with fizzy drinks - I really loved food.”It was when children came along that the Ahoghill man began to consider his lestyle more seriously.“The boys are six and three now and just full of energy. Just keeping up with them takes some doing,” he says.“I’d started to feel podgy and I have to admit I was fed up trying to get clothes to fit me. “It can be a blow to your self esteem when you can’t wear the clothes you want. It wasn’t that I was massive for my height, it was just the slow and steady gain in weight. I knew I had to do something about it,” But knowing and doing are two dferent things and Stewart was still at the stage where the diet would always start tomorrow. “You’d be thinking about going away on holiday and saying to yourself that it was time to cut down and get in shape - but it never happened. I’m sure that is the same with most people,” he says.  But it was the festive gt that wouldn’t fit that really set Stewart on the road to a healthier lestyle. “It didn’t happen overnight,” he says. “I would start and then slide back. It wasn’t until June of last year that I joined the Slimming World class in Ahoghill. Elizabeth Cooke was a great motivator along with all the other people in the class. “I changed my eating habits by cutting out the junk food and the fizzy drinks. I also realised that I had to work on portion control. When you start to see results it gives you the push to keep going but it does take willpower - especially when you walk into any shop and the sweets , crisps and minerals are cheaper to buy in a multi-pack than they are as a single item. “In the Council we are committed to providing opportunities for our people to live a healthier lestyle but that can only start at home with people eating in moderation and keeping themselves active. The sugars we consume are killing our society through illnesses like diabetes and heart disease. That’s what I’ve come to learn since I started on my personal programme.“If I had advice to give I would tell any younger person to change their eating habits earlier rather than later. As you get older, the process just gets tougher.” So what are the main components in Stewart’s current diet “I eat a lot of rice, chicken and fresh fruit - where I would have eaten crisps or biscuits as a snack in the past I would now eat a raw carrot or a handful of grapes. “I suppose the motto should be ‘eat less and move more’!” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_2743005.jpg--.jpg?1581589767000\n","title":"st louis grammar is first school in ni to achieve 100 a level pass rate","story":"ST Louis Grammar School, Ballymena, has become the first school in Northern Ireland to have achieved a % pass rate in the number of A*-C A-Level grades.The results were published in last weeks The Irish News grammar school league tables, which the school has topped for the past three years.Two other Ballymena schools also made the cut in the league table, which details schools with the highest percentage of pupils achieving three or more A-Levels at grades A*-C.Cambridge House Grammar School was placed at number  with a .% pass rate while Ballymena Academy was placed at number  with a .% pass rate.St Louis Grammar School has cemented its status as one of the top performing schools in Northern Ireland.It promotes excellence, endeavour and empowerment among its , pupilship, aged from -.The school had % of pupils achieving top marks - up from .% and .% per cent in the previous two years.The school had  students in the year group and all scored at least three A*-C in A-levels or equivalent qualications.Principal of St Louis, Mr Sean Rafferty, commented: “To say we as a school are delighted with last year’s public examination results would be an understatement.The whole St Louis Grammar school community is thrilled and the outstanding results really reflect both the positivity and the spirit of team work that we encourage at all times inside the class room and beyond.As a school we pride ourselves on ensuring our students gain successful outcomes at GCSE GCE and this year once again we have surpassed those internal challenging targets with the  % figure.To have every student in sixth form leave St Louis with an exceptionally strong academic profile is a really huge advantage for them whether students decide to pursue high demand courses at university or follow the higher national apprenticeship route.Attaining these excellent results across such a large cohort of students in our Uand across a wide curricular offer, really reflects our academic strengths as a school.

However, a letter’s been sent to the family home asking her to “contact a monumental sculptor” to “make this memorial safe”.A family member – who prefers not to be identied – told us about her upset when she opened the letter.“It was a bit of shock, to be honest,” she said. “Everyone can make mistakes, but this is one that could so easily have been avoided with a bit of sensitivity and professionalism. City Hall keeps records of deaths, so obviously nobody bothered to do any cross-checking. And it would be a very simple matter for the workers inspecting the headstones to take a note of who’s in the plot as an extra precaution. Manynot most of the graves in the cemetery are family plots and somebody should have taken that into consideration before this process started. It’s just a lack of thought and care, in my opinion, and it was totally avoidable.“I would ask them now just to do what they can to make sure their process is tightened up to make sure this sort of thing doesn’t happen to any more families. I’m sure it’s happened before and it will certainly happen again unless the system is improved.”Like many local authorities across the north and in Britain, Belfast City Council is in the midst of a memorial inspection programme launched in  after an eight-year-old boy was killed by a falling headstone in Scotland the previous year.In the letter to the local family, the City Hall Director of City Service said while the Council does “not wish to cause any further upset” to bereaved families, it must “make sure” its cemeteries are “safe places” for workers and visitors.In a statement to the Andersonstown News, A Belfast City Council spokeswoman said: “We are sincerely sorry for the upset and hurt caused to the family. As part of our memorial safety inspection started in , we have written to around , deed holders. Some of the information we hold may not have been updated by relatives or family members, hence this administrative error has occurred. We recognise this will have been very upsetting for those receiving the letter and apologise for the error.”But the family member rejected any suggestion that families should be required to update information about their loved ones for the Council. All deaths in the city are legally required to be registered with Belfast City Council, which also holds burial records for the City Cemetery.“The death was registered with City Hall,” she said. “They have the information at their fingertips and that is enough. The simple fact of the matter is that they made no effort to access that information and are just sending out letters willy-nilly to deed-holders, most of whom are going to be older people. It’s very unfair of the Council to try and turn this around like that. This is too sensitive a matter to be treated in such a slipshod manner.”Askedupdating the Council’s records after the statutory death registration process was the responsibility of the deceased’s family, a Council spokeswoman said: “While we make every effort to ensure the information we have is accurate and up to date, which can be challenging given the passage of time, on this occasion details were missed. We will review the process of writing to deed holders to ensure further checks are in place to try to prevent any similar errors or upset for another family.We sincerely apologise for the error.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"familys fitting tribute to danielle","story":"THE family of a Glengormley woman who died just weeks before she was due to begin a new le-extending cystic fibrosis drug have raised over £, in her memory.Danielle McFalldied at Antrim Area Hospital in October after a week in intensive care.She was diagnosed with the disease aged just six weeks and after being diagnosed with epilepsy at the age of  she developed cirrhosis of the liver.Danielle was due to start the new drug, Orkambi, which can improve lung , after a deal was struck with US drug manufacturer Vertex.However, Danielle became ill on October , soon after the announcement was made, and died on October .In her memory, her family decided they wanted to do something and recently held a fundraiser for the Cystic Fibrosis Trust in Cltonville Golf Club.Speaking to the North Belfast News, Danielle’s mother Angela explained: “She fought long and hard all her le and we all really miss her.“We wanted to do something in her memory but had never done anything like this before.“It was a daunting task to organise something from nothing but we sat down and got sponsors who donated vouchers and prizes for a ballot.“As we got closer to the event, we worried more and more about whether it would be a success.“It was a freezing night in January and we were worried that people wouldn’t come out but thanks to a combination of hard work and incredible generosity, we raised far more money than we ever expected to.“We put on a buffet, had great music from DJ Gerry and a ballot draw.“We had vouchers for make-up salons and barbers, loads of drinks hampers, tickets to the Belfast Giants and the Game of Thrones Giant’s Causeway tour and the main prize, which was a gigantic perfume and make-up hamper from Medicare in Northcott.”Danielle’s family managed to raise an amazing £. for the Cystic Fibrosis Trust and Belfast International Airport have pledged an additional £ to the total raised.“It was a really fun-filled night and as a family, we would like to thank all who helped make it possible.“We’re overwhelmed by the result and are glad that out efforts paid off as fantastically as they did.

The parties may not have agreed with everything he said, but they all respected him.He didn#t have a hard act to follow. The hapless Karen Bradley was unanimously regarded as a disaster.Smith learnt from her mistakes. He employed two twenty-something special advisers, Ross Easton and Lilah Howson-Smith.Whereas Bradley dealt with the media from a defensive position, team Smith adopted a positive and proactive approach from the get-go.If he was trying to get hold of a politician, he would stun civil servants by putting on his coat and setting off to find them, rather than waiting for officials to make the phone calls. On other occasions, he would head down for lunch to the canteen in Parliament Buildings where MLAs and journalists ate, which was almost unheard of for a secretary of state.He first met former Irish foreign affairs minister Simon Coveney at a very formal event in Hillsborough Castle surrounded by officials from both sides.As business concluded, he turned to Coveney and asked Will we go to the pub  and they sauntered down to the Hillside in the village.From that ice-breaking moment, the two men built a strong relationship which paved the way for New Decade, New Approach.Smith may have lacked ministerial experience when he came here, but his time as Commons chief whip meant he possessed the crucial skill of building relationships and deals. Managing -plus MPs helped him handle Northern Ireland#s recalcitrant politicians.Smith was a pragmatist, not an ideologue. He was no DUP stooge despite that party#s confidence-and-supply agreement with the Tories being in place when he was appointed last July.He had been instrumental in helping abortion and same-sex marriage amendments through the House of Commons last summer.Smith spent more time in Northern Ireland than many of his predecessors. His we and daughter would stay with him in the flat in Hillsborough Castle. Weekends included visiting the Clip #n Climb adventure centre in Dundonald.Government sources dismiss speculation that plans in New Decade, New Approach to address legacy within the next  days - unpopular with many Tories - sealed Smith#s fate.Instead, they point to a Brexit-related tweet which was interpreted as a put-down of Dominic Cummings in October.Aside from restoring devolution, Smith will be remembered most for his work in helping victims of historical institutional abuse. He fast-tracked legislation to compensate them and held a reception for them in Hillsborough Castle last month. Victim Margaret McGuckin said: I never met anybody like him. My experience means a lack of trust for the authorities is inbred in me. We were let down by so many other officials and secretaries of state.Within minutes of meeting Julian Smith, I knew he was a good one. You always feel these Government people are looking down on you. With him, I felt we were on the same level, or even that he looked up to us a bit. I called him Mr Darcy because he reminded me of that character in the Bridget Jones movies.He was warm, sincere and a wee bit shy.

Around , people regularly attend.Other measures taken to address the financial crisis include the closure of popular tourist destination Waterworld, with a predicted annual saving of £,. Car parking charges are also set to be introduced at ious locations across the borough.The council is also considering moving from fortnightly to monthly black bin collections, worth an estimated £, saving annually.Speaking after Thursday night’s meeting, Ulster Unionist Deputy Group Leader Richard Holmes said: “This has been one of the most dficult rates setting processes we have been through.“Tough decisions have had to be taken to reduce costs and raise additional income, which we know will not be popular. But we must ensure council services continue to be delivered.“Causeway Coast and Glens has signicant debt of £m — but is by no means the most indebted council in Northern Ireland. “Reserves are within guidelines and even after this signicant rates increase we still have one of the lowest rates increases since the  council amalgamation across Northern Ireland.”Glens Independent Councillor Padraig McShane said a “rates strike of this magnitude is deeply regrettable”.“It has attached incredibly high risk when factored alongside our prudential indicators. With the irresponsible striking of this rate without a forensic audit showed council had a lot to hide from the rate payers. “The council’s overall debt is now beyond £m — a rise of £m.

The Stormont Assembly is the only devolved legislature she has never addressed.The veteran unionist said  was a date which should be celebrated.What better way to do that than have Her Majesty address the Assembly, he said.Why is there such a reluctance to dodge an invitation for Her to address the Northern Ireland Assembly  Mr Allister queried.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseJim Allister FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp“Once again Northern Ireland is being treated as a semi-detached part of the UK with the fact that this question went unanswered for a full month testament again to the unworkablity of the system.“There is nothing hypothetical about the centenary of Northern Ireland.

In the last three-and-a-half years there have been five dferent Secretaries of State. During the Conservatives# near-decade in power the averageof tenure for the Northern Ireland Secretary has been less than  months. That#s on a par with the time in post afforded a football manager. Don#t sell the house in East Anglia, Brandon.No doubt the Secretary of State is looking forward to substituting Great Yarmouth for Glengormley. But what does he know about Northern Ireland  Knowledge of the place has never been a pre-requisite, of course. Briefly on Thursday, though, Lewis# Wikipedia page declared him a Larne fan. Who knew  One assumes his first public appearance will be leading the singing in the away end at Dungannon Swts tonight.As a former councillor who later became a Local Government Minister, Lewis has always been keen on cutting out waste and inefficiency in elected authorities. Good luck with Stormont, Mr Lewis.The new Secretary of State has consistently voted against more money for local councils. He has hardly displayed much more enthusiasm for devolution either. With the notable exception of policing, Lewis has tended to oppose devolving further powers to the Welsh Assembly and has opposed any of the devolved administrations having the authority to amend EU law where it has been retained as UK legislation.Lewis has a big in-tray. The right-wing of the party of which he used to be chairman will be pressing him to stop investigations and prosecutions arising from the conduct of British soldiers during the Troubles. Yet Julian Smith pledged full implementation of the  Stormont House Agreement within  days of the New Decade, New Approach relaunch of the Assembly and Executive last month.The  Agreement offers a balance of information, inquiry and, where there is adequate evidence, prosecutions irrespective of perpetrator. That#s a long way from the amnesties effectively desired by some vocal Conservatives.The new postholder will be under pressure to implement all that was promised when Stormont was resurrected. That means rows about money, arguments on tricky language issues and pressure from Sinn Fein - possibly in government in both jurisdictions on the island - for a border poll. There#s also the small matter of Brexit and a Prime Minister either unaware or in denial of the consequences of the deal he has signed with the EU for trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.Lewis does not even have the luxury afforded most previous office holders that he is at least following failure. Unusually, his predecessor was quite successful in the role. Yet Julian Smith#s tenure as Northern Ireland Secretary was the second shortest ever. Only Frances Pym had a briefer spell in charge. His four months in - were even more fleeting than the Sunningdale power-sharing agreement over which he briefly presided.There is a danger of overstating Julian Smith#s role. Compared to his hapless predecessor Karen Bradley, he was always going to appear a combination of Kissinger and Einstein. The restoration of Stormont owed far more to a Westminster general election result that offered a clear #Get back to work# message to the DUP and Sinn Fein than it did the political genius of Smith.That said, Smith#s appointment appeared a good one, back in the days before Dominic Cummings decided the composition of the entire Cabinet. The warm tributes to him on Thursday across the ide and north and south of the border were heartfelt. Smith offered a combination of clarity, firmness, intelligence and interpersonal skills lacking in several earlier incumbents.Smith was never on the same page as the Prime Minister. For starters, Smith displayed a good knowledge of Northern Ireland. Unlike Boris Johnson, he offered coherent answers to dficult questions of detail. And the sacked minister was fully aware of the potentially destabilising impacts of Brexit. Smith could give speeches that were cleverly crafted but nonetheless thinly veiled in their criticisms of his leader.He had been on both resignation and sacking-watch, but with the restoration of Stormont it seemed he might be given time to develop what he had helped deliver.Instead, Brandon Lewis now must handle tricky issues of security , strengthening the economy and securing the institutions.There are plenty of risks it might go badly for Lewis. Andit goes well and he commands respect  He might get six months in the job.Jon Tonge is Professor of Politics at the University of LiverpoolPlease log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.RegisterAlready have an account Log in Belfast   Related ContentNorthern IrelandNew Northern Ireland Secretary#s vow: #There will be no border down Irish Sea#New Secretary of State Brandon Lewis has previously pledged that there will not be a border down the Irish Sea. with Boris Johnson, Michelle OrsquoNeill and Arlene Foster at Stormont last month\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news dd .ece AUTOCROP wh --_new__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news dd .ece AUTOCROP wh --_new__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news dd .ece AUTOCROP wh --_new__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news dd .ece AUTOCROP wh --_new__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news dd .ece AUTOCROP wh --_new__I.JPG w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   with Boris Johnson, Michelle OrsquoNeill and Arlene Foster at Stormont last month\"NewsOpinionSuzanne Breen:Julian Smith earned respect of all shades of political opinion hereDays before the deal was reached to restore power-sharing at Stormont, Julian Smith vented his frustration at the lack of progress paralysing the negotiations.

He was a pleasure to work with and I hope to be able to build on his great work going forward.— Rishi SunakFebruary , Downing Street refused to guarantee that next month’s Budget would go ahead as scheduled, with a spokesman saying only that “extensive preparations have already been carried out for the Budget and they will continue at pace”.Mr Javid’s departure came after:– Julian Smith was unceremoniously dumped as Northern Ireland secretary– Andrea Leadsom was sacked as business secretary– Theresa Villiers lost her job as environment secretary– Geoffrey Cox was sacked as attorney general– Esther McVey lost her job as housing ministerAlong with the ministerial exits, the reshuffle – which Downing Street insiders had predicted would be “conventional” before the row with Mr Javid – included promotions for MPs who are highly rated by Number .Alok Sharma was promoted from international development to become the new Business Secretary and he will also be minister for the COP UN climate summit, which is due to take place in Glasgow in November.Anne-Marie Trevelyan joins the Cabinet as International Development Secretary, having previously been a defence minister.Oliver Dowden has become a full Cabinet member as Culture Secretary, having previously attended the meetings as paymaster general.George Eustice was promoted to Environment Secretary from his previous role in the same department.Brandon Lewis was appointed as Northern Ireland Secretary.Former Brexit minister Suella Braverman s to the Government as Attorney General.Ex-Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay replaces Mr Sunak as Treasury Chief Secretary.Rishi Sunak: ChancellorAlok Sharma: Business SecretaryGeorge Eustice: Environment, Food and Rural Affairs SecretaryOliver Dowden: Culture SecretaryBrandon Lewis: Northern Ireland SecretarySuella Braverman: Attorney GeneralAmanda Milling was made Conservative Party chairman – a role in which she will attend Cabinet as a minister without portfolio.Former defence secretary Penny Mordaunt willto Government as Paymaster General in the Cabinet Office.Most of the key players, including Home Secretary Priti Patel, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab and Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Michael Gove, retained their positions.Sajid Javid resigned as chancellorJulian Smith was sacked as Northern Ireland secretaryAndrea Leadsom was sacked as business secretaryTheresa Villiers lost her job as environment secretaryGeoffrey Cox was sacked as attorney generalEsther McVey lost her job as housing ministerUntil Mr Javid’s exit, the most surprising move by the Prime Minister had been the sacking of Mr Smith just weeks after brokering the deal that restored the power-sharing administration at Stormont.Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said Mr Smith was “one of Britain’s finest politicians of our time”.Speculation about Mr Smith’s position centred on the terms of the Stormont deal, amid Tory concerns it could pave the way for prosecutions of British soldiers.But allies of the axed minister said it was “absolute crap” to suggest Mr Johnson and Number  had not been kept informed of the process and details of the deal.Although female ministers were axed in the reshuffle, Downing Street indicated there would not be a reduction in the number of women around the Cabinet table.Former culture secretary Baroness Morgan had already said she was leaving her role, while Mrs Leadsom, Ms Villiers and Ms McVey were all sacked.PA,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadChancellor Sajid Javid quits Boris Johnson governmentBoris Johnson’s declaration about Mustique holiday ‘correct’Coronavirus: Woman diagnosed in London went to AE in an UberJavid quits as Chancellor over row with JohnsonEx-chancellor Sajid Javid blasts PM’s conditions for staying in Cabinet,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleTravelSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I don’t know how high the Tower Museum is but it’s a fair height when you’re up there looking down at it.”“The Air Ambulance is a charity and relies on donations to keep the service running - or flying, I should say - and there are a number of events that happen throughout the province.Air Ambulance NI partners with the NI Ambulance Service and provides the HEMS for Northern Ireland.It aims to reach a call-out within  minutes and, since July , has had over , taskings.In order to maintain the service, Air Ambulance NI must raise around pound million per year, something Jason says requires constant attention.“It costs about pound million per year to keep the ambulance running,” he said.“The helicopter means we can deliver critical care interventions to patients that they wouldn’t get unless they were in a hospital department. We bring the hospital department to the patient and deliver those interventions that have the potential to save le.”Jason is also a paramedic for the Motorcycle Union of Irelandand has delivered critical care at a number of road racing events. It is something about which the Eglinton man is fiercely passionate about.“Growing up, one thing that was always my passion has been road racing, he said. I absolutely loved it and still do.“In , I walked away from a career in engineering and joined the Ambulance Service and once I was qualied as a paramedic an opportunity came up to join the medical team.“It was a no brainer because I love motorbike racing, I love being a paramedic and this gave me a chance to combine the two.”The Air Ambulance has come to be associated with road racing since the late John Hynes publicly advocated for its introduction and Jason says its impact since has been vital to the provision of critical care in Northern Ireland.The  year-old: “Since the HEMS service came into Northern Ireland it has made a huge dference. It has increased the level of care and lessened the ‘postcode lottery’ effect of delivering critical care.”To register for the abseil, visit the Air Ambulance website at www.airambulanceni.org or call the charity on   .Registration costs pound and each participant is tasked with raising at least pound to help the team continueto provide this vital service. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Creator, Tony McCourt, , said a similar Facebook page exists for the Brandywell area so he felt it was only right to set one up for Creggan.  Within a day it had , members and less than a week later it has amassed over ,. Built in the s, Creggan is one of Derry’s best-known estates. It has been home to an abundance of artistic and sporting talent, including Olympic athletes, a Eurovision winner, a Top Ten rock band and international footballers. googletag.cmd.push In the late s and early s, Creggan became a byword for political resistance all over the world. On the Memories of Creggan Facebook page, people have been sharing cherished photos of relatives, historically signicant portraits of the Troubles, images of friends playing on the street, tales of famed characters from the estate, all sorts of myths and legends true and untrue, and everything in between. Former Creggan residents who have emigrated all over the world, including those from America and Australia, have joined the page to reminisce and share old tales from their childhood. “Everybody is enjoying it,” Tony explained, “they’re all sharing old memories.” googletag.cmd.push Friends contacted Tony to tell him that they can’t get their mothers off the page, one of the ladies is -years-old and is “loving all the old photos so much”. He added: “They’ve said they’re getting no housework done and no wains are being watched because they’re all too busy on the page. People are talking about their schooldays and friends who haven’t been in touch for many years are reconnecting.”  Memories Tony spent most of his childhood in Creggan and lived there until he got married at the age of . His brother, Peggy, still lives in Creggan and Tony has happy memories of “great neighbours and friends”. “The page brings back good memories. Nobody had anything but everybody shared what they had with each other.” The Troubles were never far from peoples’ minds, and people had their own troubles, but Tony prefers to recall the joyful times. “There was a lot of heartbreak at that time. But I like to remember all the positive experiences I had growing up. Playing football in the street all day when there were barely any cars around. “I remember the first TV on the street, it was the Kennedy’s and we used to go in to watch the FA Cup final. I also remember watching Popeye and the Lone Ranger. “I had a bad leg at one time and I remember a friend of mines carrying me to Grianan Fort and back again.” Moving forward, Tony would simply like to see people use the page in a positive way. “There are no real rules, we’re just asking people to keep it clean and to refrain from any insults. “Everyone is finding it funny going through all the old photos and that’s what it’s all about.” With that said Tony was off to the attic to unearth a few more boxes of photographic treasures from his boyhood.  ‘Heroes’ Peggy McCourt has lived in Creggan Heights for sixty-two years, asked what the estate means to him, he proclaimed: “Creggan means community.” He explained: “It was tight-knit no one had very much but what they had they shared be it a cup of milk to a drop of sugar, or can you lend me ma three slices of bread. “We all grew up in the Creggan, most of the families came from the Springtown Camp so hardship was a way of le but they made sure their wains were fed and watered, even going without themselves. “Then came the civil rights movement, then a full-blown war on the streets but again the Creggan community rallied around those who were affected by the conflict. “So many young people were first interned just because they were Catholic, many were arrested, put though interrogation centres and ended up in prison.” Peggy continued: “The hunger strikes took their toll on many families but no matter what went on Creggan grew into the best estate in Derry – in the world. “Growing up was hard at the time we lost so many friends and family members but it was a fun place to grow up, friendships formed that still last to this day. The friends I had sixty odd years ago are as strong as when we first met.  “No video games, all street games, football, rounders, even cricket, hopscotch, all these plus many more sitting out till  or  telling ghost stories, then you ran home the living day lights scared out of you. “Creggan is more than a council estate, its a way of le, its in your blood, we don’t even have to look anywhere for heroes, Creggan is full of them they are called ma’s and da’s.”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Born and raised in Derry until the age of , I always had a calling for adventure and opportunity, and it was at this stage in my le I took a huge leap of faith and went in chase of the American Dream. A little Irish girl lost in the big city of New York awaiting my immigration papers is where I learned so many le lessons and character building. At the age of  I stumbled upon a movie The Secret which would eventually change my le and my direction. googletag.cmd.push This movie for me was a beginning, an awakeningyou will. I had opened my eyes to a whole new world of self-belief, ambitions and possibilities. At the age of  I opened my first business which was a Health Care Call Centre. Alongside this I worked for a healthcare administration business which was family run and set up by my mother in New York. Whilst I found great business acumen and skillset in my work, it took its toll on me. The corporate pace and stress fuelled environment was not my fit so I sold my shares in the family business and sold my own business. googletag.cmd.push This was an important and pivotal moment for me in my le where I would embark on a journey of self-discovery and promise. From the beginning of le as I know it until now, I have never known fulfilment like being a mom. Being we to my husband, Dr Frank Dos Santos, and mother to our gorgeous and amazing children and brought me happiness like no other and for this I am eternally blessed and grateful. The le we share together is precious and I value this every day. There came a point for me personally, where I had reached that feeling of fulfilment and happiness and these feelings are what I embrace and evoke everyday in le. Drawing on my previous experiences and knowledge of The Secret as well as the process of le which had led me to this point, spurred me on to find my true passion in le. Helping others. I thought, whatI can pass on these feelings that I’m feeling  WhatI can help others to feel joy, hope and happiness whatever their environment or circumstance  So, in , alongside my business partner Chiara I set up a company Joy In The Workplace whose sole aim was to bring and implement productivity and joy into the workplace. This was my fit. The gratication and sense of fulfilment in helping others became a part of me. I knew I could do this, loved doing it and I did not want to stop here. I knew that feeling of being in a corporate environment and feeling stressed, overworked and unfulfilled and being able to approach and work with iniduals and groups who were in the same position and offer them a road to productivity and happiness in their role was le changing. I wanted to do more. In the Secret Bob Proctor was the clear definitive practitioner for me. I got in touch with the Proctor Gallagher Institute and trained in becoming a PGI Consultant The programmes set by Bob Proctor and Sandy Gallagher are some of the most effective and efficient I have ever seen and I was thrilled to become a part of it and be able to offer coaching to clients in both the U.S and Ireland. I recently was promoted within this company to Senior Coach and Account Executive which now enables me to offer some of the most elite personal development programmes PGI has to offer. Working alongside these esteemed colleagues has been a huge ambition of mine and I have learned so many invaluable skills and ideologies that I cannot wait to share with more and more clients whether personal or in a group setting. As my journey to date describes, I have achieved some great things and I am still achieving and believing every day. But there has been for quite some time, a feeling of wanting to offer something back home. I often would hear stories in the news, and reports from my hometown Derry in Ireland of the suicide epidemic which has been playing on my mind for quite some time. It is with such sadness and despair that I have felt the strong urge to help in some way. Derry is such a beautul town steeped in wonderful facts of history and monument but there is a huge cry for help and I simply cannot and will not ignore this. In understanding these facts, I have purchased a building in the city and will be hosting mindset workshops for both adults and children in the near future. It is never too early to implement positivity and to teach the importance of le and its value. In addition to this my foundation for suicide prevention is well underway as I have been working constructively with a team of like minded professionals from the city in order to structure and further develop and implement this project which I know in my heart will instil a new light of positivity and hope for those going through tough times and needing some guidance. My connection to Derry has been growing as of lately and I have found myself travelling back and forward trying to help in ious ways. Myself alongside Catrina Crillyhave set up “Bee Me LTD” which is the first children’s personal development company of its kind. We will be launching a child friendly app and host Bee Me Camps which will have a fun and friendly environment where children will learn about self-image, empowerment, positivity and how thoughts create things. We’re excited about this project and cannot wait to see it develop. My journey has come with its teachings, its blessings and its le changing moments and I for one would not change any of it. I am at this point in my le where I am seeing my dreams come to reality. I am helping others to see THEIR dreams and make them a reality. My work is not work for me anymore, it is my passion and I feel incredibly lucky to wake up everyday to the le I have and to be able to share my teachings that will help my clients achieve the le they too want. It is my pleasure and my honour. The world is ours and we can think it into whatever we want it to be. And together, we are making it happen.

The group are calling for participants to take part in the recording, which will take place from Monday th to Thursday th February from am to pm each day. Former shirt factory workers will gather in groups of four in the Inner City Trust on Bishop Street, recording one hour sessions per group. There will be sixteen sessions recorded over the four days, with the audio pulled together into one podcast of memories, laughter and catching up. Also, on Friday, February , from am to pm there will be a sing-a-long session in the Guildhall’s Whittaker Suite, led by Roy Arbuckle, where a group of  participants will join together to perform some of the old time favourites that the workers would have sung in the shirt factories. googletag.cmd.push This session will also be recorded and used as part of the podcast series. Ruth McPhillips, Museum Events and Engagement Officer, said that the podcast will be a perfect opportunity to build on the legacy of the factory workers, which included the highly successful recent Herstory event. “Through the podcast, the Tower Museum and Inner City Trust will build on foundations already laid in celebrating the great traditions of the shirt factory industry in Derry and throughout the District and, in particular, the ladies who have been the backbone of our society for many years,” Ruth said. “This project is a small tribute to the generations of factory workers who spent their lives on the factory floor - putting the world to rights, banging on the bars, making the toast – and making history! googletag.cmd.push “We are celebrating this iconic, ground-breaking industry, sharing in the stories and documenting the memories for generations to come. “We are looking to speak to people who have stories and memories from their shirt factory days. Whilst the first episode will be aired on International Women’s Day, which will take place on Sunday th March, we are keen to speak to both men and women who worked in the shirt factories.” Helen Quigley, Inner City Trust, said preserving the stories of the factory workers is extremely important. “We are delighted to be working in collaboration with Derry  Strabane District Council to deliver the International Women’s Day : Factory Girls Podcast. “This will act as a tribute to the generations of factory girlswho over the years contributed so much to the city’s economy and could truly be said to have built a great sense of community,” Helen said. “Factory girls were the backbone of the city. Not only did they signicantly contribute to the wider local economy, they were often the sole breadwinners in the family. “Lelong relationships were forged on the factory floor that endured over the years and beyond the walls of the factories. It was not unusual for grandmothers, mothers and daughters of the same families to continue the shirt factory tradition. “It is no exaggeration to say that they held the city together in bleak economic times, providing stability and protection for their families and the wider community. “I’m delighted that we are able to help preserve these stories and memories through the use of the podcasting facilities at the Garden of Reflection.” To register your interest in taking part in the interviews and conversations sessions, please email ruth.mcphillips@derrystrabane. com or call    . Please note, Monday and Tuesdays sessions have been filled. If you would only like to take part in the sing-a-long session, you can email tower.reception@derrystrabane. com, call into the Tower Museum or ring    .

The group are calling for participants to take part in the recording, which will take place from Monday th to Thursday th February from am to pm each day. Former shirt factory workers will gather in groups of four in the Inner City Trust on Bishop Street, recording one hour sessions per group. There will be sixteen sessions recorded over the four days, with the audio pulled together into one podcast of memories, laughter and catching up. Also, on Friday, February , from am to pm there will be a sing-a-long session in the Guildhall’s Whittaker Suite, led by Roy Arbuckle, where a group of  participants will join together to perform some of the old time favourites that the workers would have sung in the shirt factories. googletag.cmd.push This session will also be recorded and used as part of the podcast series. Ruth McPhillips, Museum Events and Engagement Officer, said that the podcast will be a perfect opportunity to build on the legacy of the factory workers, which included the highly successful recent Herstory event. “Through the podcast, the Tower Museum and Inner City Trust will build on foundations already laid in celebrating the great traditions of the shirt factory industry in Derry and throughout the District and, in particular, the ladies who have been the backbone of our society for many years,” Ruth said. “This project is a small tribute to the generations of factory workers who spent their lives on the factory floor - putting the world to rights, banging on the bars, making the toast – and making history! googletag.cmd.push “We are celebrating this iconic, ground-breaking industry, sharing in the stories and documenting the memories for generations to come. “We are looking to speak to people who have stories and memories from their shirt factory days. Whilst the first episode will be aired on International Women’s Day, which will take place on Sunday th March, we are keen to speak to both men and women who worked in the shirt factories.” Helen Quigley, Inner City Trust, said preserving the stories of the factory workers is extremely important. “We are delighted to be working in collaboration with Derry  Strabane District Council to deliver the International Women’s Day : Factory Girls Podcast. “This will act as a tribute to the generations of factory girlswho over the years contributed so much to the city’s economy and could truly be said to have built a great sense of community,” Helen said. “Factory girls were the backbone of the city. Not only did they signicantly contribute to the wider local economy, they were often the sole breadwinners in the family. “Lelong relationships were forged on the factory floor that endured over the years and beyond the walls of the factories. It was not unusual for grandmothers, mothers and daughters of the same families to continue the shirt factory tradition. “It is no exaggeration to say that they held the city together in bleak economic times, providing stability and protection for their families and the wider community. “I’m delighted that we are able to help preserve these stories and memories through the use of the podcasting facilities at the Garden of Reflection.” To register your interest in taking part in the interviews and conversations sessions, please email ruth.mcphillips@derrystrabane. com or call    . Please note, Monday and Tuesdays sessions have been filled. If you would only like to take part in the sing-a-long session, you can email tower.reception@derrystrabane. com, call into the Tower Museum or ring    .

Next week he will be making another Brandywell debut, and after scoring twice in a centre-forward role against Finn Harps recently, he is ready to play in whatever role is needed as Devine shapes his new look attack. “Anywhere he wants me to play Ill give %. Im a versatile player,” he said. “I can create goals and I can score them so as long as I can get myself in the starting eleven then Im willing to play anywhere.

I definitely want to be a part of it and thats my target to make that happen.”It has been a long and hard-working pre-season for Figueira and his team mates but with Dundalk now looming large, he believes the players are in the best shape possible to face the league champions on day one of the new season.“Were taking things day by day and were working really hard, honestly, really hard, possibly the hardest pre-season Ive done in my career,” he stated. “We are looking forward to it.

But I am committed to working to find solutions that deliver better for our communities and improve lives across Northern Ireland.ldquoI will be assessing the pressures across my department reflecting on my priorities, the commitments in the lsquoNew Decade: New Approachrsquo document and the budget made available for the period ahead.Ms Mallon said that as a result, it is therefore ldquotoo early to comment on specic schemes such as the Ballynahinch bypass.Designed to alleviate chronic town centre congestion in Ballynahinch and along the main approach roads to the town, major new roundabouts are proposed at the Belfast Road junction with the Saintfield Road and at the Newcastle Road junction with the Downpatrick Road.Overtaking lanes stretching almost  metres are proposed at either end of the by-pass where major new roundabouts are to be constructed, with the scheme also including a shared footpath and cycle lane.During last weekrsquos meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Council, there was across-the-board political support for a motion seeking a meeting with Ms Mallon and seniors roads engineers to discuss the Ballynahinch scheme.It was tabled by Rowallane councillor Billy Walker, who is keen to see work starting on the near two-mile scheme to link the Newcastle and Saintfield roads.He said the scheme has been shovel ready for some time and is hoping the Department for Infrastructure will allocate funding to allow construction work, which is expected to take in excess of  months to complete, to begin.Cllr Walker argued that the Newry, Mourne and Down area has missed out on signicant roads funding for decades, with many major schemes constructed in other parts of the Province.He added: ldquoThe time has come for this council to demand its fair share of infrastructure funding. I have been a councillor for over  years and the bypass issue has been raised during every one of them.Slieve Croob councillor Cathy Mason described Ballynahinch as the ldquogateway to the wider South Down area through which all traffic must pass, including HGVs.

Local authority officials hope that work on the much-needed project can start within four years.News of the new leisure centre plan, exclusively revealed in the Recorder last October, is being discussed by senior council officials and local politicians and recently topped the agenda during a special workshop examining the way forward.Among the proposals being examined are building a new complex at the rear of the current Newcastle Centre, which enjoys protected status. This would also result in the current outdoor Tropicana swimming pool being bulldozed.Local politicians were recently presented with an update on progress on a new leisure proposal, with council officials confirming this week that a review of ious feasibility studies and their findings is being considered by the organisation.While the local authority said that it is not yet in a position to confirm any plans or timelines in relation to the Newcastle Centre or indeed the Tropicana, it insists any new-build will not encroach on the promenade at the rear.Most signicantly, the council has confirmed that any commissioning of a full economic appraisal and business case would involve consultations, including public meetings, as part of the process.Council officials say that they are ldquoacutely aware of the need for improved leisure provision in Newcastle and are keen to address criticism that on wet days in the resort, there is little provision for both residents and tourists.While redeveloping the existing Newcastle Centre, which forms part of the Annesley Buildings, is one option moving forward, there are suggestions that given the age of the building, the scale of the work involved an the constraints of the site, a new-build at the rear would be more most cost-effective.One of the key issues the council will have to address is how it intends to replace the Tropicana , as widely expected, it will be bulldozed. There are those pushing for an indoor water facility which would be available all year round.Council officials are also keen to ensure that the redevelopment of the Main Street site is in keeping with a part of the resort where millions of pounds have been invested over recent years. Serious consideration will also have to be given to on-site car parking, included adequate disabled provision.In addition, council officials say that they recognise that as one of Northern Irelandrsquos premier tourist resorts, Newcastle does not have a modern indoor leisure facility which has been its Achilles heel for some considerable time.Two sites were previously identied for a new leisure centre in the resort, with sports pitches at Donard Park the preferred option.However, councillors subsequently switched attention to the former St. Maryrsquos Girlsrsquo Primary School campus at Shanslieve Drive. Despite a number of attempts to secure the site and hopes that a deal could be agreed with local church officials, it was bought by supermarket giant Lidl to develop a new store and dedicated base for the Mourne Mountain Rescue Team.Councillors are keen for the local authority to take the lead and ensure that Newcastle boasts an ultra-modern community and leisure facility.They say that the provision of a new centre for residents and visitors is long overdue and that a resort the size of Newcastle should and must have adequate leisure provision. Some councillors are keen to see a family fun pool in the proposed new-build.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokeswoman confirmed that several feasibility studies and strategic reports have been compiled in relation to the Newcastle Centre.She also confirmed that a recent review of the feasibility studies and their findings has been completed and is being considered by the local authority.ldquoUntil further scoping works are carried out, the council cannot confirm any plans or timelines in relation to the Newcastle Centre or the Tropicana, said the spokeswoman.She added: ldquoHowever, encroaching on to the promenade is not anticipated.

We may not have always agreedbut his dedication to the role was incredible. Best wishes to him and his family. Always welcome in Fermanagh.”Taoiseach Leo Varadkar hailed Mr Smith as “one of Britain’s finest politicians of our time”.Irish premier Mr Varadkar also said: “In eight months as Secretary of State, Julian you helped to restore powersharing in Stormont, secured an agreement with us to avoid a hard border, plus marriage equality.There has been some speculation that Downing Street reportedly felt left out of the loop by Mr Smith over the terms of the deal he was negotiating last month in the lead up to the restoration of the assembly.And there are concerns in Tory circles that the agreement includes an investigation into alleged crimes by soldiers during the Troubles.But those close to Mr Smith insisted that Number  and the Prime Minister had been kept fully informed about the terms of the Stormont arrangement.“There was a write-round of Cabinet ministers,” a source told the Press Association, pointing out that Mr Smith travelled back from Belfast on January  to personally brief Mr Johnson.There had been a series of memos sent back and forth between Mr Smith’s team and Number  and it was “absolute crap” to suggest they had been blindsided, they said.SDLP leader Colum Eastwood had harsh words for the PM, calling the sacking a “strategic error” by the Conservative leader.Thanking Mr Smith for his work since being appointed last July, he said: “It defies belief that, after the successful restoration of power-sharing following a three-year collapse, Julian Smith’s reward is a Cabinet Office P.“It tells you all you need to know about Boris Johnson’s attitude to the north that he would sack the most successful secretary of state in a decade.

It does helpyou have some level of continuity in terms of the person you are dealing with. We had very intensive contact with Julian Smith in the re-establishment of the powersharing government and there are very many outstanding issues, not least on the issue of legacy where the British system has dragged its feet.”Margaret McGuckin of the Survivors and Victims of Institutional Abusedescribed Mr Smith – who supported a bill that fast tracked compensation for abuse survivors through the Commons – a “father figure” to her support group.“We watched him speaking in the House of Commons and I was in tears. He was in tears with us. That man felt our pain and it showed that day in Westminster. He cried our tears.“And for me who has to put on that mask every day just to get through le, my heart was bursting with joy and pain to believe that there was a man, an authority figure, who kept his word,” she said.Ms McGuckin added: “We were at our wits end because former Secretaries of State chose to do nothing and our own government in Northern Ireland left us hanging – and that was three years after the Hart Inquiry. It was heartbreaking for all of us and so many of our people passed away in that time.“Then along came Julian Smith and we thought we would be in for the same thing. This was a man with a warm heart and a caring attitude. Even his demeanour was something dferent. I can say that as someone who was always against authority because of what was done to us by authority figures as abuse victims.“But I felt that this was a man we could trust – and I don’t say that lightly.”\"\" for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from Belfast News LetterSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bMVAic sc-bAeIUo dEhRfb\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

The UKrsquos withdrawal from the EU will begin later this month and we have a Conservative Government in Westminster until at least .Regardless of the numbers in the Commons, the Labour Party still has to stand up for those we represent. I am confident that my colleague, Stephen Doughty MP will continue to do that.The Labour Party will now move to elect a new Leader and Deputy Leader, a chance to reunite the Party and hold the Prime Minister to account for his actions.I am truly glad to see that several MPs from across the Party have put their names forward to stand for both positions. This offers the membership and the country a broader choice.I am yet to decide who I will back in the forthcoming election but I know that I want to see a vision from each of the candidates. For me, that vision needs to be a realistic reflection of our last decade out of government in Westminster, but also a strategy for reconnecting with our voters and securing a Labour government which can deliver for those who need us most.Finally, I want to thank the staff across the NHS and wider public services for their hard work under increasing pressures, particularly during the winter period.Our public services work hard all year round and many take the sacrice of working over the Christmas and New Year period for which I, and many others, are extremely grateful.As everyou would like to speak with me, you can call my office on    or write to me at Vaughan.Gething@assembly.wales or Office of Vaughan Gething AM, Room C, National Assembly for Wales, CF NA. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

His second vegan recipe book, Dirty Vegan: Another Bite, was released last month alongside a tie-in BBC cookery programme.Last Friday, Matt Pritchard visited the Penarth Pier Pavilion to discuss his latest culinary enterprise and prepare a vegan dish with Mel Grfin of Grfin Books.Pritchard has not lost his mad-dash style and performative vigour. He relished his new role as he prepared for the talk: ldquoI enjoy it, man. Itrsquos better than shoving a drumstick up your arse on stage, he said.Originally from Cardf, Pritchard studied cooking at college but dedicated himself to professional skating when he was sponsored at .ldquoDirty Sanchez was great. It was just  years of mayhem.ldquoWe were getting paid to travel around the world.

In , the BBC aired the first series of Dirty Vegan.ldquoIf yoursquod told me  years ago that Irsquod be sitting here with you now and talking about vegan cooking books, I would I have laughed in your face, he said.Pritchard said that he was forced to leave Twitter last year because of abuse from online trolls and members of the Welsh farming community.Why were people so hostile ldquoBecause of guilt. Anger does it. Cognitive dissonance. Theyrsquore too lazy to change or they donrsquot want to believe it.ldquoBut the evidence is there. What I care about is the evidence and the animals.\"I donrsquot want to kill something that doesnrsquot want to be killed. If you eat steak, how can you say you care for all animals In his characteristic salt-of-the earth way, Pritchard hopes to entertain audiences with his new series whilst gently educating them about the benefits of vegan cooking.ldquoYou know, therersquos   arguing about Brexit. Therersquos   arguing about meat and veganism.ldquoWersquore all arguing amongst ourselves like lunatics. This show is just there for people to enjoy. ldquoTherersquos a bit of fun in it.

Who they are will have a real influence on Welsh Labourrsquos prospects in  and beyond. We are the most successful part of the UK Labour family over the last decade in terms of winning elections and running a national government. However, that cannot be taken for granted. An unpopular UK leader could make our task much harder next May.The first and most important attribute the next UK leader must have is the ability to fulfil the mission of our party - to become a party of government again across the UK, not just a party of protest. I want someone who can implement our labour values in government, not just talk about them.That requires some honesty about why we took such a beating at the general election, together with the willingness and strength to do something about it. Offering more of the same would be a betrayal of people who need a UK Labour government and will condemn the UK [or what is left of it] to a further decade of the Tories.We didnrsquot get hammered in  for one reason alone - there were a number of them. Agreeing to the election in the first place when we plainly were not prepared. Agreeing to an election certain to be dominated by Brexit. Our vacillation on Brexit when people wanted certainty and leadership. The factional infighting. The demonisation of the last UK Labour government, asthat would encourage people to vote for us. I grew up with  Tory years in power and I know that things really did get better following Labourrsquos victory in .An overloaded manesto with some popular policies but without a key central message. A costed manesto that then had a huge extra spending pledge added to it, meaning that people didnrsquot believe that we were serious or credible one even the policies they liked. A staggeringly inept UK campaign that wasted the amazing dedication of our volunteers, prepared to go out in the cold and rain to campaign. Our abject failure on anti-Semitism. This and much more.Many people recognised that Boris Johnson is a dishonest man who is completely out of touch with most peoplersquos lives. Lots of people still voted for him or refused to vote Labour because they could not trust and support us. Our own people - long term Labour voters - struggled to support us. Our leader was undeniably part of the reason why. Blaming our defeat solely on the mainstream media or whichever side of the Brexit ide we favour isnt honest and will not help us to win in the future.I donrsquot much care whether someone claims they are from the left, soft left, centre or old right of the Labour Party. We all have a stake in our party and the countries of the UK. These are serious times and we need a serious figure who can nail the Tories and the clown in number ten.Irsquove been interested in what Lisa Nandy has to say and believe that Lisa and many other figures have a key role to play in rebuilding our party ndash first as a credible opposition, then as a credible alternative government at the next UK General Election.However, I think the person best placed to win the argument, and even more importantly to help us win an election, is Keir Starmer. Itrsquos not the protesting, or the taking part that counts. Itrsquos the winning and the decisions you get to make in government that can change peoplesrsquo lives and change the country for the better. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He acted to prosecute MPs who had abused expenses and Murdoch journalists in the phone-hacking scandal when he was Director of Public Prosecutions.We need to win back these voters that we lost in the last general election. It was heart-breaking on election night, to see Labour lose places like Wrexham and Bridgend.The UK Labour Party must get back to being a party that votersrsquo can trust. That means we cannot just have a ldquoone more heave approach. We need someone who can speak to the whole of our country, not just one region or subset of voters, with the values and vision to win. Keir fits the bill. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Natural Resources Wales and the Welsh Assembly should not ignore the issue this time around.Responding to public concerns about the new plans, a spokesman for the Welsh Government said: ldquoIf EDF Energy submits a formal application, Natural Resources Wales will carry out a thorough assessment of the proposed activity before making a determination, having regard to the need to protect the environment and human health, as required by the Marine and Coastal Access Act .ldquoI know many constituents are very worried, said Stephen Doughty MP for Cardf South and Penarth.ldquoWe shouldnrsquot be a dumping ground for others, and I will continue to raise concerns on behalf of residents and report back any information I receive.To comment on the proposed sample plan, visit NRWrsquos consultation page before Wednesday, March  at: naturalresources.wales permits-and-permissions permit-applications-consultations-and-decisions current-consultations-marine-licence-applicantions hinkley-point-c-sediment-sampling-plan-sp  langen article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

But today, our courts exercise a form of political power.She also said that while the Human Rights Act was ldquonoble in its intentions, ldquothe concept of lsquofundamentalrsquo human rights has been stretched beyond recognition.She said she was not ldquolambasting the judiciary or launching a ldquodiatribe against human rights but arguing that the ldquodelicate relationship between law and politics is off-balance, adding: ldquoI donrsquot challenge the quality of our judges, but I do question their trespass into inherently political terrain for which a legal answer is wholly insufficient.The article followed comments she made in December on Newsnight, where she said she hoped legal reforms would restore the principle of ldquojudicial deference, adding: ldquoWhich means that our courts and our judges generally stay out of politics. vw,vw,px, px\"Simon Davis, president of the Law Society of England and Wales, congratulated both Justice Secretary Robert Buckland on his reappointment and Ms Braverman on joining the Cabinet, adding: ldquoWe look forward to working with them to ensure that the rule of law is upheld in this country, that justice is available to all and that our strengths as a jurisdiction are maintained: an independent judiciary, a talented legal profession and laws which uphold business and human rights.Caroline Goodwin, chairman of the Criminal Bar Association, said the organisation looked forward to working with Ms Braverman, adding: ldquoA government that stands up for the rule of law acts in the best interests of the people ndash Parliament included.But Liberal Democrat justice spokeswoman Daisy Cooper described the appointment as an ldquoassault on the rule of law and accused Ms Braverman of being ldquointent on weakening our courts, adding: ldquoSuella Braverman clearly believes that Tory ministers should be above the law. That makes her unfit to serve as Attorney General.On Thursday Mr Cox suggested MPs and peers could scrutinise the appointment of judges to the Supreme Court but insisted the Government has ldquono desire to see politically appointed judges.But his idea appeared to be at odds with Mr Buckland who last week said he did not want to see a system of judges ldquobeing put in front of select committees and asked about their political past or views.The Tories pledged at the general election to examine the relationship between the Government, Parliament and the courts, and vowed to set up a Constitution, Democracy  Rights Commission within a year to come up with proposals to restore trust in democracy.The Conservative manesto promised to examine the judicial reviewprocess to ensure it is ldquonot abused for political reasons and pledged to ldquoupdate the Human Rights Act.Rishi Sunak: ChancellorAlok Sharma: Business SecretaryGeorge Eustice: Environment, Food and Rural Affairs SecretaryOliver Dowden: Culture SecretaryBrandon Lewis: Northern Ireland Secretary:Suella Braverman: Attorney GeneralThe seeds of the Governmentrsquos battle with the courts were sown during the Brexit rows, when campaigner Gina Miller successfully challenged the Government over then prime minister Theresa Mayrsquos right to trigger Article  without a vote in Parliament.The Supreme Court ruling in  that Mr Johnsonrsquos decision to suspend Parliament was unlawful fuelled Tory suspicions about judicial activism.Earlier this week the Government appeared to step up its battle with the judiciary following the Court of Appeal decision to prevent the deportation of  foreign offenders to Jamaica.Downing Street said it ldquobitterly regretted the courtrsquos decision and Government sources said the row over the deportation flight showed why an examination of JR was needed.Dominic Cummings, one of the Prime Ministerrsquos closest aides, reportedly said there must be ldquourgent action on the farce that judicial review has become following the courtrsquos decision.Amanda Pinto QC, chairman of the Bar Council, praised Mr Cox as a ldquostaunch supporter of the rule of law and a ldquogreat supporter of the Bar, adding: ldquoWe congratulate Suella Braverman and look forward to working with her and Robert Buckland on ensuring access to justice and protecting the rule of law.Ms Braverman said: ldquoOne of my first priorities is to continue the Governmentrsquos work in rebuilding confidence in our justice system, particularly with victims..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Barrister who told judges to stay out of politics appointed Attorney General article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_MM-Photo-1.jpg","title":"manufacturing month ni to showcase strength of sector","story":"Posted on Tuesday  January  by Ulster Business Economy Minister Diane Doods with Manufacturing NIs Stephen Kelly Northern Ireland’s burgeoning manufacturing sector will be showcased as part of a major initiative to highlight the strength and excellence of the industry here.

The revamp is part of the Department of Finance’s Reval – which is a reassessment of the rates system which businesses pay. While still a draft schedule of values, each council will also have to apply its own regional rate, based on the new proposed figures.“The Cathedral Quarter isn’t just about eating and drinking,” Gareth Neill, BID manager, Destination CQ told Ulster Business.“We have a vibrant ecosystem of arts and culture and fantastic built heritage that makes this area stand out, hospitality plays an integral part to the quality of le in this part of Belfast – for a city to be striving to attract new residents, increase our tourism offer these are crucial to the city’s success. “We are concerned about that the potential knock-on effects to the affected business owners and there’s a very real possibility it will have an impact on the price of a pint to the people who come to socialise in Cathedral Quarter. The knock-on effect of outdated methodology for calculation of rates on licensed premiseshas a potentially crippling effect on jobs and character of this area.”A spokesman for Land  Property Services said: “In Northern Ireland, nearly % of pubs will have no change or a decrease in their Net Annual Value .“Any business rate payer who thinks their new valuation may be incorrect, can contact LPS to arrange an informal review and supply any relevant information before the new valuation list comes into force on  April .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mip1.jpg","title":"mipim taking belfast to the world","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Joe ONeill and Suzanne Wylie Belfast Harbour boss Joe O’Neill will help lead a private and public sector delegation to MIPIM – the world’s biggest commercial property event – as chairman of the taskforce. He chats to John Mulgrew about the big announcements, fighting off the competition and attracting a global giant to Northern Ireland For Joe O’Neill and the wider delegation heading to potentially warmer climates, the proposition of selling the city and wider region to major investors has gotten easier.In the five years since Belfast ed to MIPIM – an event which sees tens of thousands descend on Cannes in France for four days of real estate and development – the private and public team, and taskforce, have developed a “strong ” in which to sell the city and Northern Ireland, with hopes of attracting a big name insurance or tech firm on the list.“MIPIM is a great  for the promotion of city-wide initiatives, and demonstrating to investors and to occupiers the growth potential in the city, and the opportunities for them and that the key stakeholders are all aligned behind an appropriate growth agenda,” Joe says.“You see dferent sizes and scales of stands out there – you see some really ambitious stands and proposed developments, so Belfast has to see it’s entry point into that. Belfast first and foremost will be competing against peer group cities within the UK… but then it is a worldwide show, so you will be competing against other cities.”Belfast is leading a major delegation this year, and will also be joined by representatives from other Northern Ireland councils, including those that are part of the Belfast Region City Deal, such as Mid  East Antrim. That deal is also going to be a focus for announcements and development, during the event.This year’s delegation will be led by a host of top private sector developers in Northern Ireland, alongside Belfast City Council and organisations such as Belfast Harbour. That includes Bywater, Wirefox, Titanic Quarter, Tribeca, McAleer  Rushe and Graham Group, along with the two universities and others working within related fields from law, professional services and the supply chain.For Joe and the delegation, MIPIM represents an opportunity to announce some of Belfast and Northern Ireland’s wider major new infrastructure and commercial plans. Previous visits have included the announcement of major offices schemes, hotels and apartment developments.“We will have a series of announcements – some of those announcements will be new, and some will be progress, and demonstrating to investors or occupiers that progress has been madeit’s a multi-year scheme, to show we are delivering.“… we have new projects coming through the pipeline in ious sectors. This year we are looking at launching schemes around digital innovation. That aligns with one of the themes in the Belfast Region City Deal, for the city and councils in the deal. We have a particular focus on cyber-security as an investment and operating location – particular those from the US.”Joe says that would be in addition to the already well-established cyber-security development at Catalyst in the Titanic Quarter, and that new names are coming in to the marketplace creating a “cluster” around the sector, and setting up Belfast and beyond as a new global hub.“We are looking at announcing some details around the Belfast-Dublin-London corridor,” Joe says.“As an economic corridor, or triangle. Post-Brexit, there are clear synergies in developing a proposition where companies can avail of the three locationsthey are looking at a global footprint, and see advantages to locations in three cities.”The issue of increasing connectivity between Belfast and Dublin also remains high on the list – improving the speed and frequency, and making developers aware of the new Belfast Transport Hub, which will transform the city’s rail and bus connectivity when complete.For Belfast Harbour, it’s also bringing the expansion of its already successful film studios to MIPIM, amid further plans to grow and develop the hub to attract big names and become the largest of its kind outside London.“We will be revealing more of our expansion plans, which is being supported by NI Screen,” Joe said. Some of those delivering their own presentations to potential investors will include the Harbour, Belfast City Council, Catalyst and the universities. “We are out looking around, when we are there, at what dferent cities are doing – seeing whether something works well, and looking at our competitive advantage in that area.”As for the strengths and attraction for potential investors, Joe says: “Skills, talent and technology are very much at the fore. Agility as a small region and to be able to respond, and seeing that team Belfast is there and that we are aligned with a particular project. It doesn’t have to be taken back home and introduced to someone .“There is the emergence of Belfast as an attractive city – investment opening up, and people are always looking at new markets. “Part of the initial roll-out when I took on the chair of MIPIM, the role was to go around to ask those who were on board previously to ask about it,it had changed. Everyone noticed and recognised considerablechange over the last four years. “We were pioneering and establishing ourselves four years ago, now they felt we were very much a concerted and effective operating team… the collective was a powerful message, and having  or lunches involving all of the stakeholders at one time. It’s a really strong  to take on the next chapter.”So, for Joe and the rest of the MIPIM delegation, what would be considered a major goal or success on the back of the visit to the commercial property show in March  “A particular focus this year is to attract key institutional investors – the big insurance companies for example. That’s a chicken and egg situation… you need to have product, to have product you have to show that you have occupiers and a steady revenue stream. “What we have been able to say to the investment market is ‘we have product and we now have sustainable occupation coming through… now it feels like the right time for you as an investor, to come in, and to support further investment’.”Asked whether replicating the successes of our neighbours in Dublin in attracting tech giants such as Apple, Facebook and Google is also on the cards, Joe says: “Something like that, or a major investor. For them to do that – a technology or an investment company – they need to see that the public, private and third-tier sectors are all collaborating together to make an effective market, and I think we are good at doing that now.”And the timing couldn’t be better for the delegation – now able to go in with a clear mandate and message with the restoration of the Executive and ato day-to-day power-sharing politics.“The positive thing for us is with the government and secondly, somearound Brexit… it takes those two challenging issues off the table.” πView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/johnm1.jpg","title":"companies must act quickly on new ir legislation reforms","story":"Posted on Monday February  by Ulster Business At the start of this year the government launched a review into the changes to IR legislation which will affect medium and large private sector organisations and have far-reaching impacts on the way they engage with non-permanent workers, writes John Moore, managing director, Hays NI.The timeframe between the review and the reforms coming into effect in April is shorter than many would have liked but with the reforms now on the horizon, companies need to act, particularly those in sectors such as technology, construction and finance where use of contractors operating as personal services companiesis common. At a basic level, the reforms to IR legislation sht the responsibility of determining the tax status of personal services company workers to the company that engages them where previously they could self-certy. The original rules required the freelance contractor to determine their tax status, but HMRC believed non-compliance was common.Now,a person’s assignment falls outside of IR legislation, they are deemed to be self-employed, so gross payment will be made to the PSC. Butthe assignment falls inside of IR, the professional should be treated as an employee, applying PAYE and NIC deductions from their payment. In simple terms, the tax arrangements for contractors are changing so that they won’t get such a good dealthey can’t demonstrate their work is out of scope and employers will have to pay more for using and keeping what were previously non-payroll workers.This will have a big effect on how people choose to work and who they choose to work for, not to mention how organisations plan and budget. An organisation’s policy towards contractors will affect how attractive they are to freelancers. But on the other side we’ve already seen some risk averse companies adopt a blanket ban on freelancers just to be safe – meaning they are missing out on skilled professionals they need to deliver projects.In Northern Ireland, as where, it’s likely the IR reforms will hit technology hardest, but the effects could be wide ranging across roles in construction, project management and finance.We’ve heard anecdotal evidence of IT contractors leaving the big banks and starting to view early stage tech companies with less than  employees more favourably because they fall outside the scope of the legislation. When similar legislation was introduced in the public sector in , hundreds of highly skilled contractors left roles to join organisations who were prepared, often leading to projects being scrapped. Now the private sector is catching up, preparation is key and anyone who hasn’t done a review of what it means for their capacity should do so urgently. A Hays survey showed % of private sector firms expect cost increases when IR reforms come into effect, % expect to lose key talent and % think it will be harder to bring in non-permanent workers. A third of organisations surveyed were completely unaware of the reforms – a big concern given how tight the labour market is.So, first you need to determine whether assignments are inside or outside of IR. You need to have full visibility of all workers your organisation engages who are paid via agencies and consultancies as well as knowledge of how they are paid. You will also need to have the expertise to determine the tax status of each assignment. When you know that you can then start communicating with freelance workers, renegotiating working arrangements, standardising onboarding procedures and decidingany specialist skills need to be brought in house to get projects over the line.If you expect to use a high volume of temporary workers in , outsourcing your temporary worker provision through a managed services programme could be an option, as an expert would carry out accurate assessments for every temporary worker placed with you.Whatever stage you are at, don’t ignore IR. It’s coming and you need to understand it.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20200109_-3489_web.jpg","title":"nie networks keeping the lights on and a focus on the future of power","story":"Posted on Thursday February  by Ulster Business Paul Stapleton, managing director of NIE Networks, sits down with Ulster Business to chat about the future of energy here, huge investment across Northern Ireland and the responsibility of keeping the lights on for almost two million people In the last three decades, Paul Stapleton has already seen signicant sweeping changes across the energy industry, and is now helping lead the charge towards a carbon neutral economy with an ever-increasing focus on green power.He is now at the helm of NIE Networks – an organisation responsible for the electricity network here, delivering reliable power to , businesses, homes and farms right across Northern Ireland.“Our role is to provide a safe and reliable network – keeping the lights on  ,  days a year,” Paul told Ulster Business.And part of that responsibility and ability to ensure strong and reliable electricity flow is an investment of around £m each year, working towards a  ‘net zero’ carbon emissions target and embracing the key changes and evolution in power here.“Many dferent players need to work together to ensure the electricity system of the future can achieve what it needs to achieve in terms of zero carbon and remaining economically efficient, and reliable, at the same time,” he says.“We are the custodians of the electricity network – everything between where power is generated and up to and including the meter in your home or business.“Our network is connected to , customers – that’s every home, every farm, every business, and every organisation in NI. It’s a regulated utility business, and commercially, everything is regulated by the Utility Regulator.”Paul’s been in the energy industry for his entire working le. The Limerick man joined ESB in  where he held a number of senior management positions, before taking up his current role in May .He’s taken over NIE Networks as it’s hitting record performance targets, with those likely to improve further still this year.“The network is in as good as condition as it ever was, and we are giving a good service in terms of continuity of supply. “In , we achieved a ‘customer minutes lost’ average of  minutes, which is the lowest in our history. But we will continue to look at improving further. Where faults do occur, % are fixed within three hours and % within less than  hours. “We operate in business cycles around regulatory price controls. We are now just over two years into a six year price control. “There has been some downsizing, cost-reduction and efficiencies, while we are gearing up to deliver a signicant capital investment programme. We are investing more than £m a year in upgrading, refurbishing and maintaining the network.“The focus in present terms is about delivering for today and looking to enhance our services to customers.”But it’s the future of NIE Networks, power generation, and a new Strategic Energy Framework, which will become the focus for Paul and his team in the coming years.“A lot of my focus is about planning for the future, as well as the day-to-day,” he says. “The longer term horizon is now looking out to ,” he says. “The UK Government has enshrined in legislation the target that the economy will be entirely carbon neutral.”For Northern Ireland, it’s already broken recent records in terms of the move towards green energy. “There is a huge amount to be done and it’s a very challenging target,” he says.“It’s a huge change and transition. But I think all the scientic evidence regarding climate change suggests it has to be done, and maybe has to be done sooner.“The headline target was that we would hit % from renewable sources by . We actually achieved that target and are now at %. That is very signicant progress. It puts us ahead of GB and the Republic of Ireland.”NIE Networks has invested around £m in the network to facilitate this generation. In the last few years the number of power generators connecting to the network has grown to ,, whereas two decades ago it was reliant on the three main power stations here.“The bigger challenge is how do we use that green energy to displace carbon  That brings in transport and heat, and that’s something where the electricity sector will play an important role.“As we all start adopting electric vehicles, as I think we all will in the next decade, we have to make sure people have the ability to charge them, at home and in public spaces. It’s our role to connect the chargers and to make sure we have a network which has the capability to meet the demands.”But Paul says there’s signicant positivity out there, with a younger generation in Northern Ireland and throughout the world embracing the small everyday changes that have to be made in order to tackle an international problem.“We are in the policy framing stage and  is going to be key. There is a call for evidence now from the Department for the Economy to inform the development of a new Energy Strategy for Northern Ireland and I would encourage anyone who has any interest in energy or climate change to contribute into that.“Hopefully that will lead to the development of clear policy initiatives, targets and measures for Northern Ireland and that will set the context for the market to respond.“I think there is economic opportunity for Northern Ireland, but there will be some downsides. We need to minimise the downsides and maximise the opportunities.”NIE Networks is currently examining its role in the future energy market in Northern Ireland. That includes looking at how it can make the distribution network more open and accessible in order to allow burgeoning technologies, such as battery storage, heat pumps and electric vehicles, to be introduced and operate in a sustainable way.“We see our role as evolving. Historically, we were somewhat passive – we provided an infrastructure which shipped electricity from A to B. Now, we need to be much more proactive and we are part of an overall system.”That includes a role in balancing when green energy is available and when it is required and in high demand on the distribution system. “All of that needs a more connected and dynamic distribution system – rather than just being seen as a physical infrastructure,” Paul says.“We need private investment and developers who are willing to invest in new solutions, whether it’s wind, solar, electric vehicle charging or heat delivery. All of those need policy directions, but they also need a network to connect to, so we have a major role to enable all of that.”Paul says most businesses and iniduals now know that they “have to get on this journey” in order to play their part in tackling climate change, reducing their carbon emissions and improving energy efficiency.With Brexit, there have been concerns over the future of the all-island energy market. But Paul is confident that it will be secured, despite the UK’s exit from the EU. “That continuing is really important for businesses in Northern Ireland. Currently, all sides in the Brexit debate seem comfortable that the Single Electricity Marketwill continue, so we don’t see any specic threat around that.”As part of NIE Networks’ Northern Ireland-wide investment in infrastructure – of around £m a year – it has recently completed a £, investment in the Cathedral Quarter area of Belfast – where our interview took place – which is home to many of its best known pubs and restaurants. “That gives us a more resilient and reliable supply, as well as capacity for the future,” Paul says. Some of the other latest investments include projects in Enniskillen in advance of a new public realm scheme, along with another in Newry.“Right across Northern Ireland we are continuing to invest,” Paul says. “There is a lot going on. There’s a lot to do today, challenges, to keep efficient supply for the economy, but equally we need to plan for the future.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
