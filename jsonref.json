But he found life hard.‘My uncle was already in Britain and he told us to come over he sponsored us to come to the UK. He said it’d be a better life,’ Raj says.         ‘My uncle was already in Britain and he told us to come over he sponsored us to come to the UK. He said it’d be a better life,’ Raj (pictured) saysIn 1987, Ashok, his wife, Lalitaben, and his three sons came to England. Raj recalls the moment he arrived as a teenager, speaking no English. ‘London was very beautiful and very clean. It was so different from our village in India, where we only had electricity for a couple of hours a day.’From the day he arrived in Thatcher’s Britain, Ashok worked as a grocer, initially with his brother in a corner shop in Tottenham, North London, before saving enough to open his own: Lena Stores in Islington, which he took over in 1998.Yes, the customers came to Lena Stores for groceries, but mostly for Old Mr Patel, who would dispense free lollipops to children and gossip to their parents and grandparents.The shop itself is tiny, about a quarter the size of a typical Tesco Express. The freezer cabinet filled with Magnum ice creams, bags of peas and (very good value) £1 garlic bread baguettes, has a handle held together with gaffer tape.The lino floor is scuffed. The superglue is stacked next to the Patak’s vindaloo sauce, and the balls of garden twine are shoved into a cardboard box along with large nail brushes, a shower mat and some 13-amp, three-way mains adapters.But amid this chaos lies a staggering array of food, drink and household essentials. It is a microcosm of all that is best — and surviving still — in Britain’s high streets.Not the Britain of self-service tills and chains selling vapid coffee.No, the Britain of quirky independent shops, run by dedicated, hard-working families who choose to open their doors and serve their customers — even when they are grieving.Napoleon may have meant it as an insult, but Britain still is a nation of shopkeepers — just. Nearly one in ten people in Britain works for a shop and the retail sector makes up five per cent of the British economy.         In 1987, Ashok, his wife, Lalitaben (pictured together), and his three sons came to EnglandOf course, most of our groceries are bought from one of the big four supermarkets: Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Asda and Morrisons. But there are thriving corner shops, despite all predictions they would be killed off by internet shopping and the march of the supermarkets.Of the 46,388 convenience stores in Britain, about 33,000, or nearly three-quarters, are independent, according to the Association of Convenience Stores (ACS). That number has fallen in the past few years, but not dramatically so.‘About 15 years ago, all the prophecies were that there would be no more independents left. That’s definitely not happened,’ says James Lowman, ACS chief executive.True, more and more convenience shops are now owned by a big supermarket chain. ‘But it’s a very slow move,’ Lowman adds. ‘The best shops in Britain are still run by independent shopkeepers, who are close to their customers.’And few were closer to their customers than Ashok Patel. After he died — he was fully diagnosed with cancer only last month — a tribute was posted on a local online message board and it triggered an outpouring of grief that was immediate and heartfelt, giving lie to the idea that there is no sense of community in inner-city London.The residents felt they had lost not just a local shopkeeper but a pillar of the community.One, Emily Grazebrook, said: ‘When I first moved to the area ten years ago, my husband and I had very little money, as we had put it all down as a deposit for a flat.‘I went into Lena and asked if they would take a cheque for some groceries. Ashok and Raj welcomed me to the neighbourhood and told me to put my cheque book away — I could pay them when money came in the following week. I was so moved by their kindness.’         When I told my children that he had died, they were genuinely upset. ‘We know 99 per cent of the children who come in here,’ Raj tells meThat struck a chord with me. If I ever nipped out to get some vital missing ingredient and then found I’d forgotten my wallet, Old Mr Patel always told me I could pay him later. He never kept a tally of all the credit he trusted that you’d remember — which I would sometimes do, with a pang of embarrassment, only days later.When we moved into the street, my eldest child was just six, my youngest not born.But all four of my children have taken their first crucial steps to independence by being sent to the end of the road to buy cereal or a loaf of bread, knowing Mr Patel would help them find the item and count out the correct change. They were always safe there.When I told my children that he had died, they were genuinely upset. ‘We know 99 per cent of the children who come in here,’ Raj tells me. ‘And we have seen so many grow up. When they first arrive, we can’t see them from this side of the counter.’Toddlers barely able to peer above the rack of Kit Kats and Lion bars, but soon old enough to buy stationery or their first can of beer before going off to university.‘Many of the naughty teenagers who have caused trouble grow up and come in later to apologise to us,’ he adds. But there was one incident when the youths were more than just naughty: they were dangerously violent.One December morning in 2012, three men, aged 25, 22 and 18, entered the shop, drunk, wielding knives and intent on stealing alcohol and anything else they could get their hands on. Ashok Patel was manning the shop on his own that day and he kept a baseball bat under the counter. ‘When the boys came, he fought back,’ recalls Raj. ‘I always said if he was ever threatened, he should just hand over the cash. It’s not worth it. But he always got so angry. He said: “I’ve been working long hours, seven days a week, I’m not going to give away my money.”’ And he didn’t.Then 63, he fought the three thugs, whom the judge later declared, when they were sentenced, ‘deliberately set out to commit a robbery on a vulnerable person’. At first, Ashok was successful, pushing them out the door. Then he slipped and the three youths returned, with one stabbing him in the head, another using the baseball bat to attack him.‘The blade was this close to his brain,’ his son says, holding his thumb and finger half an inch apart. He was left in a pool of his own blood, while the three stepped over him to steal beer, milk tokens and £220 in cash.Remarkably, Old Mr Patel was back behind the counter within a month, with his arm in a sling and his head bandaged like Mr Bump. He’d gladly show his scar to any customer.‘He was a very strong man,’ says his son. He certainly was.‘He just loved working in a shop,’ adds Raj sadly. ‘He loved meeting people and being part of the community.’The number of Gujarati shopkeepers in Britain is falling markedly — mostly because their children and grandchildren have little desire for the long hours and meagre rewards. Raj’s children, Keya, 24, and Jaimini, 22, both went to Brunel University. One is now a businesswoman, the younger training to be an accountant.‘My father was very proud of them,’ says Raj. ‘I’ve asked if they want to take on the shop, but they don’t want to.’It is easy to romanticise this first generation of immigrant shopkeepers, who worked all hours to make a better life for their families. But they are as much a part of Britain’s story as the coal miners, wheelwrights and lamp-lighters of previous generations.The majority of us no longer attend a parish church or a local butcher at whose counter we can gossip, but most still have a corner shop. If you’re lucky, it will be run by someone like Mr Patel.Only when they are gone will we understand how these shops and shopkeepers have helped weave the fabric of this country together. Run by families who kept the shutters up and the lights on, rather than cause an inconvenience. "},{"url":null,"title":"Brexit deal sight talks stretch night","story":"Share this articleBrexit ‘will be delayed until next year’ even if deal is reached tonight | News | The Times"},{"url":null,"title":"Prince Andrew talk FBI oath friendship Jeffrey Epstein lawyer says","story":"Share this articlePrince Andrew must talk to the FBI about Jeffrey Epstein abuse, lawyer demands - Mirror Online"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c7f2ed3fa2d8776d6f4e07898437b4a3d5ae661a/20_13_2119_1271/master/2119.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8c8cdfc917f1e5d9500dce78d461c02","title":"buy a classic sport photograph kelly holmes eye popping celebration","story":"The fifth of a new  Print Shop series featuring classic sports images from the likes of Gerry Cranham, Mark Leech and  Tom Jenkins – yours to own for just £55 including free delivery Those eyes!

But now the revered museum is rebalancing its walls – massively boosting work by women and artists of colourIn his Poetics, Aristotle argued that poetry was a more scientific and serious genre than history. This was because, he said, history is concerned only with inidual and particular events. Poetry, on the other hand, is concerned with what might happen: that is, deep and general truths. In the newly revamped Museum of Modern Art in New York, which reopens on 21 October, the march of history, at least as it has been understood by MoMA in recent decades, is out and poetry is in.This lucid, but necessarily sealed-off, worldview has now been replaced with the kind of thematic approach familiar to British audiences from two decades of Tate Modern hangs. While still arranged according to a broad chronology, beginning with the 1880s on the fifth floor and descending to the present on the second, MoMA’s inidual rooms are organised around ideas, with titles such as War Within, War Without, Inner and Outer Space, and True Stories.The view of art history on show here is no longer one of straight lines and linear progressions, but one much more like the complex ripples set in motion by pebbles thrown into a pond. No longer will MoMA claim to tell a single story of modern and contemporary art. Every six months, the hang will substantially change.Some might say MoMA is letting itself off the hook: no definitive statements are made and everything is allowed to hover provisionally until the next remix. Lowry argues it is returning to the museum’s founding principles. The great first director, Alfred H Barr Jr, wrote: “Nothing that the visitors will see in the exhibition galleries, neither the works of art, nor the lighting fixtures, nor even the partitions, is at present permanent.”Barr understood, said Lowry, “that the museum was to be a work in progress, changing and evolving as the world of contemporary art changed and evolved”. The museum’s glaciation of its displays came later, in the 1960s and 70s, he said. Nevertheless, even in the brave indeterminate future, there will remain a few constants. Some works – Monet’s Water Lilies, Picasso’s Les Demoiselles d’Avignon – will always be there. “We’d have a revolution if we took down the Water Lilies,” said Ann Temkin, chief curator of painting and sculpture, at a museum preview.Underlying the new mix-it-up approach is the argument that teleological art history – seeing the present as the logical culmination of the past – lacks contingency, fails to take into account the idea that once upon a time Cézanne, say, was just a bloke making strange paintings in the south of France, not an art history colossus whose work had a mind-blowing market value. So the new hang is not a “bang, bang, bang” of famous masterpiece after famous masterpiece, as Temkin phrased it. While we spoke, we were sitting with our backs to Cézanne’s The Bather, newly cleaned, with zingy blue details revealed of its background of rocks and water. To our right were Van Gogh’s Starry Night and Henri Rousseau’s The Dream. So far, so “bang, bang, bang”.But in a case in front of us was a selection of exquisite, earth-toned ceramics by American George Ohr, the self-styled “mad potter of Biloxi”. You could argue that these modest pots made in obscurity in Mississippi are irrelevant to the masterpieces of French post-impressionism. The point, according to Temkin, is to try to bring us back to around 1890 – when Van Gogh was painting in an asylum, Rousseau was collecting taxes, and no one knew what would be inscribed into the canon and what wouldn’t. Above all, she explained, the connections are visual. Gesturing at the warm-brown ceramics, she said: “You could almost make a Cézanne out of those colours.”Repudiating the Book of Genesis approach involves breaking up the patriarchal parade of white, male artists. So in a room titled Stamp, Scavenge, Crush – which centres on art using discarded or reused materials from the late 1940s to the early 60s, and features Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg and Cy Twombly – are also a photographic work by the African American Romare Bearden and a bedsheet printed by Ruth Asawa in 1948 with a stamp to create a dense, graphic pattern. (This rebalancing has meant enlarging the collection – a process enabled by MoMA’s considerable resources and the tradition of American philanthropy along with its ability to sell off works in order to buy new ones. (British national museums’ constitutions prevent them from doing this.) Selling a Léger meant, Temkin explained, that the museum could purchase several works by “pioneering female modernists”. One, The Moon (1928), by Brazilian painter Tarsila do Amaral, acquired earlier this year, now holds court alongside Picasso, Brâncuși and Eileen Gray. Donations include the extraordinarily extensive and coherent Cisneros collection of Latin American art, which for the time being will be shown as a kind of museum-within-a-museum. A wall of shimmeringly delicate wire sculptures by the Venezuelan Gego are a particular joy.The labels beside works, specifically their date of acquisition, tell a story in themselves about recent innovations at MoMA. A wooden sculpture by Lebanon’s Saloua Raouda Choucair entered the collection last year. A set of works by Polish artist Edward Krasiński came in 2015. Ibrahim el-Salahi’s Prison Notebook, illustrated with ink drawings, made after he was wrongfully imprisoned in Sudan in 1975, was acquired in 2017. Despite its fragility and scale, it holds its own in a room themed around the conflicts of the 1970s opposite Philip Guston’s magisterial painting Deluge II, made at the same time. A dangling, curvaceous hemp sculpture by Indian artist Mrinalini Mukherjee was also acquired in 2017. Perhaps my eyes are drawn to familiar things, or perhaps it is just that curators in London and New York breathe the same air, but it strikes me that these last are all artists foregrounded by Tate Modern in current displays or recent exhibitions. At any rate, the message is loud and clear: the world is a big place, bigger than Manhattan and Paris – and great art is being made all around it.These themed rooms frequently draw on items from several of the institution’s mighty departments, creating a mix of, for example, photography, film, publications and painting. So for example, in the room with Asawa’s bedsheet there is a film of Merce Cunningham’s dance work Antic Meet – like a lot of film in the galleries, simply projected on to a wall, offered as part of the mix. One of the most rewarding moments in the current hang is a modest, unobtrusive room devoted to Frank O’Hara – from his manuscripts and early editions of books to artworks made by a host of greats to illustrate his work, and Larry Rivers’s portrait of the poet.All this has meant delving deep into the collection. Lowry said the museum had, to his eyes, become almost like two institutions in recent years – one that visitors had access to, and the other in store, where there was a much more varied and erse set of art. A work by the Indian painter VS Gaitonde, for example, was purchased in 1963, and languished unseen for years – now, though, it’s sharing wall space with Rothko. There is an entire case of radical zines and leaflets mailed to the museum in the early 1980s from Brazil – these items, from the Movimento de Arte Pornò, were unsought by the institution but dutifully catalogued and preserved.Some things, on the other hand, have been permanently banished from the galleries. Like Tate before it, MoMA will no longer bandy around terms such as cubism, post-impressionism, abstract expressionism, or conceptualism in its labels. “We were trying to imagine what we would say if we had a group of friends over to dinner who aren’t in the art world,” Lowry told me. “What would we want them to know? What would they need to know in order to have an interesting conversation?” It is certainly not, he argued, a “dumbing down”.The results of this particular innovation are, at this point, mixed – after all, you can eradicate art-world lingo and still bypass lucidity. Sometimes, refusing the actual word seems like a round-in-the-hat game – in which participants pull a name out of a hat and describe it, without using the name itself. The introductory text of one room, titled Readymade in Paris and New York, seems, for example, to be a more or less a hat-game description of the word dada. Indeed, hanging beside it is Richard Boix’s drawing of members of the New York dada group (Man Ray, Duchamp, Katherine Dreier and others), with the word DADA writ large on it. But since the room introduction doesn’t tell you what dada is, you’d be none the wiser if you didn’t already know.All of these changes have been a long time coming. Back at the turn of the millennium, soon after Lowry was appointed, the museum experimented with a series of thematic displays called MoMA 2000. Some critics loved them some utterly rejected them. Lowry denies the museum rowed back after the mixed reception, but, rather, the displays marked the beginning of a process that has culminated in this month’s reopening, one that involved great institutional change. “It required over time a new generation of curators who came with fresh and new ideas and for whom interdisciplinarity was something natural. And we had to expand on training our vision,” he said. Over the last decade, research groups on Asian, Latin American and African art have been formed at the museum. Curators have travelled more. The great MoMA tanker has gradually turned.Unsealing the edges of modern and contemporary art in this way has, said Temkin, been “liberating, exhilarating. One thing I’ve been insisting on is changing the way people speak about gaps in the collection. It feels so wrong because it assumes there is a complete puzzle, and if we just find every single puzzle piece, one day it will be solved and complete. Right now, we are saying, ‘No, we don’t know – there is no way of knowing some complete art history.’”The museum, once a place of such authority, is now letting that authority go, admitting the impossibility of a fully coherent narrative, embracing the fact that it cannot tell the viewer everything. Strangely, its sleek and efficient spaces, so four-square, pale and elegant, renewed and enlarged at a cost of $450m (£356m), seem slightly at odds with this new intellectual porousness, despite architect Elizabeth Diller’s efforts to make it more friendly and open. It remains an intensely decorous, formal, demure museum (and it is $25 for a ticket, though the ground-floor displays, which currently include a room of paintings by Kenya-born Michael Armitage, can be visited for free). Perhaps a longing for unruliness was why I was so happy to see the holes punched out of the walls, revealing the grubby plywood sheets and dust balls lurking behind them, in a display devoted to the multidisciplinary performance artist Pope.L.The most striking example of MoMA’s new approach – as well as a relatively rare abjuration of broad chronology – is placing Picasso’s Demoiselles d’Avignon beside a visceral painting, by African American artist Faith Ringgold, documenting the 1965 Los Angeles race riots. (The 1967 work, American People Series #20: Die, was seen at Tate Modern in the 2017 exhibition Soul of a Nation.) The formal consonances between the works, made 60 years apart, are clear. MoMA’s contention is that the Picasso might illuminate the Ringgold – but also that the Ringgold might illuminate the Picasso. History, in other words, might not be working in only one direction. Which is where poetry comes in. Or, depending on your perspective and taste, the chaos."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d54df609fd806505425143b2d260157c4490dfd1/0_9_3425_2055/master/3425.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=629ccf3bbb5dfe65ea8716398c7247c3","title":"david lachapelles lavazza 2020 calendar in pictures","story":"The photographer best known for his surreal celebrity portraits has teamed up with Lavazza to create their 2020 calendar.

Leaving aside the music for the moment, Elton’s public and maybe even private persona can be ided into two phases: first there was the raging drugs monster, as extravagantly talented as he was costumed. Now that he’s sober, there’s the more conservatively dressed, happily married elder statesman of British pop, a proper establishment figure, albeit one who’s still unafraid to pick fights with everyone from Keith Richards (“a monkey with arthritis”) to Madonna (“looks like a fairground stripper”). Both eras have yielded a steady crop of outstanding Elton anecdotes, often retold by Elton himself, who, possessing the kind of self-knowledge few of his fame and wealth retain, tells his stories better than anyone else. Probably the most infamous of all is the one about the time he’d been up for several days (this, clearly, was from the pre-sobriety era) when he decided something really needed to be sorted out. No, not his devastating drug addiction or his lack of sleep – the problem was the weather. So he called a chap in his office and told him to sort it out: “It’s far too windy here, can you do something about it?”Such is the wealth of material he has to choose from, this story gets only a passing mention in his outrageously enjoyable autobiography: “This is obviously the ideal moment to state once and for all that this story is a complete urban myth. Unfortunately, I can’t tell you that, because the story is completely true,” he writes, with a self-deprecating shrug. And then he moves on to the next tale, which might be about the night he and John Lennon refused to answer the door to Andy Warhol because, as Lennon hissed to Elton: “Do you want him coming in here taking photos when you’ve got icicles of coke hanging out of your nose?” Or it might be about the time Richard Gere and Sylvester Stallone nearly came to blows over Princess Diana at one of his dinner parties. That he has celebrity anecdotes to burn is not a surprise. But the self-mocking tone is more unexpected from a musician so grand that at his 2014 wedding party he had one table dedicated solely to the Beatles and their families. Yet while his extraordinary talent justified his personal excesses, it is his self-awareness that has counterbalanced the narcissism and made him such a likable figure. This is, after all, the man who allowed his husband, David Furnish, to make a documentary about him and call it Tantrums and Tiaras.Elton has his own ghostwriter, of course – the “auto” in “celebrity autobiography” is always a loose concept – in the form of Alexis Petridis, this paper’s pop critic. Petridis has a journalist’s eye for the comically absurd, such as Elton’s predilection for sexual voyeurism competing with his innate tidiness (“They’d end up having sex on the snooker table with me shouting, ‘Make sure you don’t come on the baize!’ which tended to puncture the atmosphere a bit”), and he makes sure there is a laugh out loud moment on pretty much every other page. This gives a pacy originality to what could have been a by-the-numbers celebrity tale: the miserable suburban childhood, the early musical failures, the sudden meteoric success, the sex, drugs and dodgy financial advisers, the eventual redemption through marriage, parenthood and activism. The book could also have easily tipped into self-parody, with Elton as a musical Zelig figure, witnessing, in turn, the death of 1960s pop, the emergence of 70s rock, the brief burst of punk, the rise of 90s hip-hop and rap. Alongside all this is the glorious triumph of the gay rights movement in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, handily embodied by Elton himself, a pop star who once barely understood his own sexuality, but can now bring his two sons with Furnish, born by a surrogate, up on stage with him in Las Vegas, and has raised almost half a billion dollars for Aids charities. But Petridis wisely keeps the focus on the personal over the sweeping cultural: Elton’s immediate reaction to the Sex Pistols, for example, was not any cliched shock of the new, but rather delight in Johnny Rotten slagging off his friend and rival, Rod Stewart, on TV.But credit really must go to Elton, whose extremely amusing voice very much drives the book. The most acclaimed celebrity memoirs of the past two decades have been thoughtful disquisitions on the weirdness of fame itself – Rupert Everett’s autobiographies, and Feel, Chris Heath’s book about Robbie Williams. Me is not like that, and the most Elton has to say about fame is it’s a lot of fun, but probably not very good for you. His book is closer in spirit to David Niven’s memoirs with their litany of namedrops – although Niven, as far as I know, never wrote a line like “I sat around, wanking, in a dressing gown covered in my own puke.”Me is its own original thing because Elton makes fun of no one more than himself. He is utterly, astonishingly, hilariously self-lacerating. A half-hearted suicide attempt at the height of his fame could have been played for drama instead Elton merely asks: “Why was I behaving like such a twat?” He sums up the experience of writing songs for The Lion King, which ultimately won him an Oscar, as: “I was now writing a song about a warthog that farted a lot.” And yes, Elton was also mystified by the hysteria over the version of “Candle in the Wind” he wrote for Diana’s funeral.One subject he has strikingly little interest in is his creation of a catalogue of music that is now a licence to print money. He is very sweet about his friendship with his longterm lyricist, Bernie Taupin, but the process of how they write their songs is dealt with in a single paragraph, which concludes: “I can’t explain it and I don’t want to explain it.” And yet there’s no doubt his talent is miraculous. Some of his songs took as long to write as they do to listen to in one morning he knocked off “Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters”, “Amy” and “Rocket Man” before breakfast.Elton has never come across as an especially warm celebrity: too sharp tongued, too ridiculous. Neither quality is played down in his memoir. And yet his clear-eyed honesty and his ear for the comic line make him a deeply appealing memoirist. By the end of the book I felt only regret that I am unlikely to get an invitation to join him on his yacht, where I could listen to him recall the time he asked Yoko Ono what happened to that herd of cattle she and John Lennon once bought: “Yoko shrugged and said, ‘Oh, I got rid of them. All that mooing.’”• Me is published by Macmillan (£25). To order a copy go to bookshop or call 020-3176 3837. Free UK p\u0026ampp over £15, online orders only.

On the other side of the road is a field littered with assorted machinery.“There used to be an oil depot there, but now it’s closed,” she says. “They say it’s going to become a museum and a park.” The mother of four circles back towards the empty plot behind the station: “And this one is Dubai now.”For decades La Gare, Addis Ababa’s 101-year-old central railway station, had slumbered, gathering cobwebs in the shadow of the many high-rises that have sprung up in the Ethiopian capital in recent years. But lately it has been transformed.Today, above the Romanesque arches, the name of an Abu Dhabi-based property firm, Eagle Hills, glitters in gold. Company flags flutter along the road leading to the police-patrolled entrance. The iconic station hotel, Buffet de la Gare, which was bulldozed last month, is a heap of rubble next door. Woinshet’s home is also being demolished.Under Ethiopia’s charismatic prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, who was recently awarded the Nobel peace prize after forging a peace deal with Eritrea shortly after his appointment in April last year, and his lieutenant in the capital, deputy mayor Takele Uma, Addis Ababa is undergoing its most radical facelift in a generation, with the old station as the centrepiece.The station will anchor a vast development project, also called La Gare, in the heart of the city comprising malls, offices, five-star hotels, more than 4,000 luxury apartments and a surrounding park, as well as, in theory, low-cost housing for the district’s current residents.Covering 36 hectares (89 acres), and with a price tag of $1.8bn (£1.4bn), Eagle Hills’ project was the largest and most expensive of its kind in the country’s history when it was announced last year. It is now already about to be surpassed: according to Takele, a Chinese company is investing $3bn in a 37-hectare, upmarket complex in Addis Ababa’s Gotera district. And more projects are coming, he claims, citing potential interest from European, American and Turkish investors.Earlier this year, Abiy hinted at recasting the capital’s skyline – currently a hodgepodge of drab Soviet-style tower blocks and cheap Chinese new-builds – as something closer to the gleaming megalopolises of the Gulf.“If you can change Addis, definitely you can change Ethiopia,” he told the Financial Times, adding that on his very first day as prime minister he had ordered a shiny, modernist makeover of his own office.For years Addis Ababa has resembled a building site – creaking under concrete skeletons and belching Isuzu lorries – but now, according to the mayor, the watchwords are “greenery” and “renovation”.“After we took office we said, look, instead of building new buildings, instead of starting new construction, let’s start by renovating and maintaining the existing city infrastructure,” says Takele, who says 448 public schools and 13 public hospitals are being refurbished.But there is much more to this wave of construction than that. Last week the palace of Emperor Menelik II, who founded the city in the late 19th century, was opened to the public as a museum, park and, soon, zoo – a pet project that the prime minister outlined in a 40-minute documentary broadcast on state television last month. Around the corner will be a new $58m national library, which Takele says will have a 3,500-seat capacity.And in February, the prime minister’s office unveiled futuristic plans to turn 31 hectares of filthy, litter-strewn river banks into public parks, bicycle paths and waterside terraces complete with outdoor cafes and restaurants. Though a more modest rehabilitation scheme had been in the pipeline for several years, this turbocharged version, known as Beautifying Sheger after the city’s nickname, was billed as Abiy’s personal initiative. It is projected to cost $1bn over three years, and work on the first 12km by a Chinese firm has already begun.Across the road from city hall – which is also undergoing a $54m renovation – ground has been broken for the Adwa centre: a $156m public entertainment complex designed to celebrate Ethiopia’s 1896 defeat of the Italians. Adwa, which will include a museum, library, meeting hall and cinema, is being built on some of the 600 hectares of disused land authorities have reclaimed from investors since 2018.One enormous plot of this kind, situated near the Sheraton hotel – and which, like the Adwa land, belonged to Saudi-Ethiopian businessman Mohammed Hussein al-Amoudi – is being turned into a public park. Another park, with mountain trails and horse-riding, is planned for nearby Mount Entoto, and will cost $51m.The figures are eye-watering, and have provoked criticism in some quarters. “The scale of the projects is a bit scary when you consider the scale of the urban problems we have,” says the architect Bisrat Kifle.“Of course it’s important to clean our rivers – but the problem is priorities,” agrees Ezana Haddis, an urban planner at the University of Manchester. “We need to do it incrementally, and not on this scale.”In the case of Beautifying Sheger, China pledged to foot a quarter of the bill. Some of the rest will be paid for by Abiy’s “Dine for Sheger” campaign, a lavish fundraising dinner held in May at Menelik Palace for which guests paid $175,000 each to attend.As for other projects, Takele says the costs will be covered by the city budget, and points out that his administration is also working on a Rapid Bus Transit system as well as ambitious plans to overhaul the capital’s water supply by building two dams outside the city, to be funded by the World Bank and China’s Exim Bank. The private sector will be harnessed to build a new overpass system, helping ease traffic, and also to deliver low-cost housing on 1,000 hectares of land in the inner city, he says.He also claims that, unlike under his predecessors, nobody will be left homeless or even relocated to social housing on the edge of the city. “Now the plan is to build housing in the centre of the city, so they have access to everything.” He says the first phase of development at La Gare will be new homes for those, like Woinshet, whose old neighbourhood is being demolished.The government has also taken a minority share in both La Gare and the Gotera project, which Takele says means revenue for the administration long into the future. “It’s a new model of development,” he says.Abiy, for his part, has argued that Beautifying Sheger is “not development, it is an investment”, and said it will lead to an increase in the value of urban land from which the state, as ultimate owner of all land in Ethiopia, will benefit.Not everyone is convinced. Ezana argues that “these kind of projects are high-end projects” that will aggravate social segregation, despite the government’s promises to rehouse everyone on site.“Very few people in Addis could afford to live in these flats. So developers or someone else will buy them out,” he says. “They’ll be displaced by market forces.”Meanwhile, Slieshi Degefa of the River Basins \u0026amp Green Areas Agency has said that up to 10,000 residents could be relocated as part of efforts to clean the rivers and surrounding areas. Several residents complained that they had been told their homes would be demolished and they were uncertain about their future.“We are not happy at all,” says Mekbib, whose neighbourhood of 450 houses near the palace is to be cleared for a park. “They didn’t consult us. Two months ago they just arrived with a form to be filled in within two days. It was a total shock.”And then there are those who feel that, even if the government’s intentions are positive, the lack of consultation with professionals is worrying. Biruk Terrefe, aPhD candidate at Oxford University’s Department of International Development, argues that “the roll-out of big infrastructure that essentially still ignores existing plans ... and blindsides city administration officials sets a dangerous precedent”. In this sense, he says, the administration is acting much like past Ethiopian regimes – despite the new rhetoric.La Gare, for instance, came out of nowhere, catching almost all architects, policymakers and city planners by surprise. The deal seems to have been struck at the highest diplomatic level, between Abiy and the Emirati rulers, as part of a package of investment geared towards easing Ethiopia’s hard currency shortage. Even the city’s planning office was kept in the dark.The architect Nahom Tekle describes it as a “blank slate intervention” that ignores the city’s existing urban fabric. The old station sits at the southern end of Addis Ababa’s only historic avenue, with a view all the way to city hall on a hilltop in the distance. La Gare will obstruct this entirely.“How dare someone block this historic vista and view?” Nahom asks. “This is the only landmark urban space the city has.”Takele’s confidence, however, is undimmed. For him and the prime minister, it seems, gentrifying Addis Ababa is an endeavour that, like previous state megaprojects, Ethiopians should rally behind as a symbol of national pride.“The name Addis Ababa means ‘new flower’, and we need to make it live up to the name,” he says. “I’m sure one day this will be one of the best cities in Africa, and in the world – but we need to start now.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9914dd1aae0bd06ce32293f28d3fe8c7052a88b1/0_424_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0c12816b8ac6a6b9663470dc318c5c03","title":"china hong kong xi jinping","story":"A crackdown could alienate the mainland’s middle class and damage Xi Jinping’s standingTwo decades ago, many scholars began predicting that as China’s creation of wealth continued to speed ahead, the country would cross a threshold. Once a substantial new middle class had been created, they reasoned, politics would tip decisively in a more participatory, possibly even democratic, direction.But while robust economic growth continued, the first decade of this century came and went with no severe challenge to China’s authoritarian model. And under China’s present leader, Xi Jinping, who took office in 2013, it has only become more entrenched: last year he changed the longstanding rules of succession to allow himself to remain in charge for life.Now, however, this long-expected revolt of the middle class has arrived – not from China itself, but from Hong Kong. And more than any other problem China faces, the ongoing crisis in the city could determine Xi’s standing and his country’s direction over the next few years.A new Hong Kong extradition law is proposed, which would allow people to be transferred to mainland China for a variety of crimes. Residents fear it could lead to politically motivated extraditions into China\u0027s much harsher judicial system.Large public demonstrations start as thousands march in the streets to protest against the extradition bill.Hong Kong lawmakers scuffle in parliament during a row over the law.Hong Kong\u0027s leader, Carrie Lam, introduces concessions to the extradition bill, including limiting the scope of extraditable offences, but critics say they are not enough.The scale of protests continues to increase as more than half a million people take to the streets. Police use rubber bullets and teargas against the biggest protests Hong Kong has seen for decades.Lam says the proposed extradition law has been postponed indefinitely.The protests continue as demonstrators storm the Legislative Council, destroying pictures, daubing graffiti on the walls and flying the old flag of Hong Kong emblazoned with the British union flag. The protests coincide with the 22nd anniversary of the handover of Hong Kong from the UK back to China.Armed men in white T-shirts thought to be supporting the Chinese government attack passengers and passers-by in Yuen Long metro station, while nearby police take no action.44 protesters are charged with rioting, which further antagonises the anti-extradition bill movement.By now the protest movement has coalesced around five key demands: complete withdrawal of the proposed extradition bill, withdrawal of the use of the word riot in relation to the protests, unconditional release of arrested protesters and charges against them dropped, an independent inquiry into police behaviour and the implementation of genuine universal suffrage.The mass protests enter their fifteenth week, with police resorting to teargas and water cannon against the demonstrators, and a wave of doxxing using digital techniques to unmask police and protesters as a new front in the battle.Police shoot a protester with live ammunition for the first time, as demonstrations continue on the day marking the 70th anniversary of the declaration of the People\u0027s Republic of China.The first charges are brought against protesters for covering their faces, after authorities bring in new laws banning face masks in order to make it easier to identify or detain protesters.Hong Kong officials spark outrage in the city as it revealed that nearly a third of protesters arrested since June have been children. Seven hundred and 50 out of the 2,379 people arrested\u0026nbsp were under 18, and 104 were under 16.The problem of open-ended civil unrest in Hong Kong, which has been punctuated by rising acts of violence and vandalism carried out by a distinct but hardline minority, is a reflection of China’s new assertiveness under Xi – an assertiveness that marks a break with the caution of the post-Mao era. It can be seen in Xi’s signature undertaking, the Belt and Road Initiative – an infrastructure building project with global ambitions. Or, most recently, the flaunting of new weapons systems during the military parade commemorating the 70th anniversary of Communist party rule – a declaration of China’s intention to rival American military power more openly than at any time in the recent past.Under Xi, China has been intervening much more directly in the governance of Hong Kong. The most notable example of this was the abduction to China of Hong Kong booksellers who traded in titles critical of Beijing or historical accounts that undermined Chinese orthodoxy. Beijing has also given quiet but clear support to a variety of restrictions on the city’s democracy that have strongly eroded Hong Kong’s sense of generous if limited legal and political autonomy – a notion captured by Beijing’s own slogan for the city’s dispensation, “one country, two systems”.Most notably, these have included the banning of pro-democracy political candidates and the proposal in February by Hong Kong’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, of the measure that sparked the ongoing protests: a law that would allow for the extradition of criminal suspects from Hong Kong to mainland China. Public approval of Lam has plummeted since then, and her position hasn’t been helped by her acknowledgment that many of her options are determined by Beijing. This has effectively meant refusing concessions on the protesters’ main demands – such as for direct election of the city’s leaders and an independent investigation of violent abuses by the police – and only recently grudgingly offering to formally withdraw the extradition proposal. Notably, she has also said that Beijing will not allow her to step down, another of the demonstrators’ key demands.This blocking of any path forward that would permit more self-determination under Chinese sovereignty – as promised when Britain handed Hong Kong back to the mainland in 1997 – has led to a marked radicalisation of Hong Kong’s population this year, and created a revolt of the middle class. The peaceful demonstrations that have regularly drawn hundreds of thousands of residents into the streets since the summer have included many older people, as well as plenty of residents from other segments of the population long assumed to be conservative or at least acquiescent, whether civil servants or business people.The situation might have unfolded far more gently had the city been handled with more suppleness or tolerance. But the central logic of power under Xi’s leadership has always been to push for more control, both domestically and within the region. The drive to impose tighter reins on Hong Kong now risks all kinds of unwanted damage. This only begins with the radicalisation of the Hong Kong population, and harm to the city’s economy and reputation as a dependable business mecca.Just in the past fortnight, the effects of the crisis in Hong Kong spread in an unanticipated way to the US. When an executive for an NBA team expressed support on Twitter for the Hong Kong protesters, Chinese companies immediately cut their ties to the American basketball league in lockstep. In a country where most people know little about China, this was the first time that many became aware of the lengths to which Beijing will go to censor speech and impose conformity.From here, Beijing’s choices in Hong Kong will not grow easier. The ultimate option, of course, is to mount a police or military intervention from the mainland in order to put down the protests. But at what cost? Hong Kong would lose forever its status as a global, cosmopolitan city, a goose that lays golden eggs for China. Since Deng Xiaoping introduced capitalism to China, Hong Kong has served as a critical business and investment portal for the country: a place where foreign companies feel it is safer for them to be based because of the independent judicial system and a banking structure that allows the free conversion of currencies and unlimited international transfers. As China has grown vastly richer it has become less dependent on Hong Kong for such purposes, but lots of investment into China still passes through the city.A takeover of Hong Kong by force would also destroy Beijing’s proposition – tattered as it may already be – that Taiwan should accept unification with China on the basis of one country, two systems. Recent events in Hong Kong have already strongly lifted the election prospects for the governing party in Taiwan, whose leader Tsai Ing-wen favours continued defiance of Beijing.Most unpredictable, though, is how this will play in China itself. A catastrophic crackdown in Hong Kong could go very badly for Xi, a leader who has tried to project an aura of resolve and near infallibility. Today Beijing trumpets that its 1.4 billion people stand united in their opposition to Hong Kong’s democracy movement. But that is a claim only sustainable in an environment of suffocating media control in China.If mass arrests or tanks were used to crush a protest movement aimed at securing democratic concessions, members of China’s own large and growing middle class would begin to see this not just as a defeat for Hong Kong, but as a loss for their own society as well.• Howard W French is an academic and author.

It just encourages people to blame themselves for deep structural unfairnessThe term “impostor syndrome” has enjoyed a lot of airtime in recent years, yet it’s always troubled me. One person who I’m sure has never suffered from it is Boris Johnson. Between fortifying racists and humiliating our country on a daily basis, I’ll admit that there aren’t many positives to be taken from his shambolic premiership. But one thing it has done is finally shatter any illusion that many of today’s politicians – and by extension business leaders, media executives and even lawyers – are there on merit. I’ve got a radical idea that instead of focusing on the symptoms of poor mental health, as we so often do, we should begin to look at some of the causes, starting with the assumption that those in power got there entirely under their own steam, and that millions still struggle to make ends meet because of their own personal failings.Watching a leader such as Johnson bumble his way from one disaster to the next should make us all deeply sceptical about this idea of social mobility. Not only does the concept necessarily create losers, but it also neglects to mention the elusive, middle-class “club” mentality that underscores so many success stories. Decoding the language, styles and tastes of the upper classes creates a huge amount of uncredited and unremunerated labour even for those who do climb the ladder and manage to work the system to their advantage. And once they do achieve success, the sense that they are impostors, and that their success is somehow undeserved, seldom goes away.The seemingly medical nature of the term “impostor syndrome” is also problematic, suggesting a psychological shortcoming on the part of those who suffer from it. But far from being the product of a pathology, what seems more likely is that impostor syndrome is a rather natural reaction of anyone from a working-class, disadvantaged or minority background to the various biases they face on a daily basis.What far-reaching and harmful message are we sending out when we paint the natural reaction of working-class and marginalised people as evidence of some kind of “syndrome”? Some will say it’s only a word, not a medical diagnosis, but it represents an attempt to inidualise a structural issue, and to place the burden of responsibility at the door of the undervalued, or excluded. This only adds to the list of things that working-class and marginalised people already have to contend with in the continuing struggle to achieve any kind of self-esteem.When we think about “impostor syndrome”, there are several underlying biases we should address: the unquestioned deference towards the displays of confidence taught by private schooling, not to mention the painting of confidence-verging-on-egoism as “normal” and “sane”, while everyone else is painted as deficient. But every month I see fresh takes in the media on how to overcome the feeling of being an impostor, by ironing out tendencies that erge from the prescribed, middle-class standards of professionalism, and embodying that same “confidence” taught by private schooling.It takes a huge amount of confidence to care for the elderly, to conduct yourself in front of a room full of screaming children, or to drive a bus on the streets of London. Yet the pervasive definition of confidence – the one that we’re told to perfect, if we want a white-collar job – precludes these notions. It’s about oratory, debating style and being able to push through your agenda at the expense of any kind of careful thinking, or discussion. How many instances of sociopathy have we collectively permitted as a result of this way of thinking?In a society that is drunk on market logic, that sense of impostordom may just be the guiding light you need to see things clearly. However, while it may go against the ideas peddled by most self-help and management books, I would suggest we don’t internalise the structural shame imposed by the corporate workplace, as well as by certain seats of learning and certain social circles. It’s important for all of us to remain vigilant to the many ways in which it dehumanises us and strips us of our identity.With class very much back on the public agenda, it’s time to consider some of the quieter but no less harmful permutations of a deeply classist society – starting with the idea that the issue is in our minds, and not a deeply entrenched system of bias and discrimination. That’s where the problem really lies.• Nathalie Olah is the author of Steal As Much As You Can"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dcaddbddb9f280021e6636ce75b38cb775ccee3f/189_0_3122_1874/master/3122.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3786c8af7e92c0ad7aef68f690f857de","title":"who won the democratic debate our panelists verdict","story":"Elizabeth Warren fielded the most attacks given her frontrunner status - but did she win the night?Tuesday’s crammed stage meant real debate was impossible and, with the exception of a few heated disagreements, it was basically a conga line of predictable soundbites. Indeed, by the end of the night Anderson Cooper gave up any attempt at real substance and rounded things off with a question about “your most unexpected friend”. Think I had that as a homework assignment when I was 12.Perhaps the clearest takeaway of the night is that Elizabeth Warren is now the frontrunner. She spent the evening on the defensive as the rest of the candidates took swipes at her. While she displayed extraordinary restraint in the face of some excruciating mansplaining (Beto O’Rourke calling her “punitive” felt like a politer version of “nasty woman”) it wasn’t her strongest performance. She made it too easy for Republicans to call her evasive when it comes to healthcare costs. Warren needs to find a better way to explain that Medicare for All is the most equitable solution, even if taxes are raised.I don’t know what meds Bernie Sanders is on, but I’d like some myself. It’s hard to believe he recently had a heart attack he was bursting with energy, and challenging other Dems to find the guts to stand up to the insurance companies. While Bernie Sanders was on fire Joe Biden seemed rattled his performance was “expedentially” worse.Now that Warren is ahead of Joe Biden in the polls, as the former vice-president continues his campaign to make each and every American voter deeply uncomfortable, she was the expected new target on the debate stage. The question was, are her opponents going to say something new, innovate their language and their positions, and create a new vision for America and a broken Democratic party, or are they just going to say the same old things in a louder voice. Guess which one they all chose!If only the positions they took and the punches they threw at Warren made any sense. Here was Kamala Harris adamantly insisting Warren take the bold position of ... deleting Trump’s Twitter account. Here was Gabbard glitching in her new fascist Stepford mode, repeating the term “regime change war” with regards to American intervention in Syria more than 10 times in a few minutes. Here was Klobuchar freaking out about Russia, at least half a dozen scandals behind the times.These things are an endurance test, for us the voters as we crawl to the first primaries and to these candidates. Warren easily shrugged off her attackers, dooming them to languish in the shallow end of the polls until they run out of other people’s money. None of this makes me feel like we have any idea of how actually to defeat Trump. But it was very nice to see Bernie Sanders healthy, smiling and still calling for revolution.Elizabeth Warren won the night. She was targeted as an emerging frontrunner, but held her own. When Kamala Harris demanded that Warren ask Twitter to shut down Donald Trump’s account, she focused on breaking up big tech instead. When Pete Buttigieg claimed that she was evasive about raising taxes on the middle class, she answered carefully about lowering medical costs instead of increasing taxes.Bernie was a strong second. People counted him out after a heart attack, yet he debated tonight with clarity, humor and more affection that previously seen on national stages. Using the war in Iraq and the bailout, he vigorously reminded Joe Biden that the former vice-president accomplished more than just the Violence Against Women Act while in office, which silenced Biden.Harris started out quoting Maya Angelou, saying that when people show you who they are the first time, believe them. The irony is that Kamala constantly defends her prosecution record that came down on poor black people in California. Maybe the tides have turned: she called for an end to mass incarceration while calling for a new war on drugs … for pharmaceutical company employees.Julián Castro was the only person to bring up police violence and Atatiana Jefferson’s murder. Cory Booker made his signature moves: kumbuya interventions and stories about the housing projects that he lived in to develop talking points for political debates. Biden offered little more than some version of “I can beat Trump. Come on guys, remember Obama?”The biggest loser was the length of the debate. Three hours is too long, and Americans are ready for less presidential hopefuls on stage.Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders did nothing to hurt themselves. Nobody attacked Biden on stage – the attack ads during debate breaks were vicious toward Biden. Warren was the target for blows tonight over Medicare for All. They said she was “vague” about taxing to pay for it. Is that the best they could bring? She brushed them off as blanching for billionaires and shrinking from the moment.Sanders was the highlight talking about the healthcare industry driving little people bankrupt: “I would like to see the Democratic party have the guts to stand up,” he declared, full of vim and vigor after a heart attack.Pete Buttigieg is running just behind those three, is popular in Iowa and could make a move before the first-in-the-nation caucuses. He showed depth on the Middle East, talked straight on how the rust belt got left behind and voted for Trump, and sounded smart and grounded. Klobuchar stayed in the conversationElizabeth Warren dominated Tuesday’s debate but the senator did herself no favors. Warren dodged the issue of who will foot the bill for turning the US healthcare system on its head.Pressed on whether her version of Medicare for All would lead to a tax hike on Americans making less than $250,000, Warren refused to give a straight answer. The question isn’t disappearing. Prediction: Warren’s performance will be the stuff of Republican attack ads if she emerges as Trump’s challenger.It was left to Joe Biden to crystalize the challenge facing America: “We have an erratic, crazy president who knows not a damn thing about foreign policy and operates out of fear for his own reelection.”Biden also showed respect for our institutions as he declined to back a court-packing scheme. Revolutions are exhausting, the wheel turns. At times, Biden seemed ill at ease but on what counts most he said it best."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4dd24af614a8d67ae37a9739b03d0b3af29bc399/0_0_5791_3475/master/5791.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=705591045d8a4f9769814b416beb4346","title":"ontarios wild beauty and rugged adventure is all in the outdoors","story":"With vast and beautiful wilderness areas, and a staggering quarter of a million lakes, Ontario is the perfect place to experience outdoor relaxation and adventure“It is wonderful to feel the grandness of Canada in the raw,” wrote Emily Carr, an icon of 20th-century Canadian art, whose vibrant landscape works charted the colours and shapes of the country more evocatively than any before – or since.To speak of this grandness in the raw is to speak of Ontario, the country’s most populous province. Long before the 14 million who now call Ontario home got here, the place was shaped forever by glacial erosion that gouged and quarried so much of the land that falls within the province’s boundaries.The result left Ontario with upwards of 250,000 lakes, and while the province boasts Canada’s largest city in Toronto and its capital city in Ottawa, it is away from the urban centres that it truly offers itself as a paradise for nature lovers.Ontario is a place for all comers and all seasons. Adventure arrives adrenaline soaked or at a much slower pace … with plenty of options in between. And the best of those options usually come on, or at least very near, a body of water.In the rustic cabins and cottages that hug every one of those quarter of a million lakes, kitschy slogan wall hangings are ubiquitous, but the advice they offer is nothing if not accurate: “Life is better at the lake.”Head downstream from Lake Ontario to the mouth of the mighty St Lawrence River and you’ll reach 1,000 Islands, an archipelago of more than 1,800 islands that straddle the Canadian and US border. Cruise the islands from Kingston, Gananoque or Rockport all the way up the St Lawrence to take in stunning seasonal views. And yes, these same islands are forever commemorated in a condiment – the eponymous salad dressing originates from these parts.But of course there’s a lot more to do in 1,000 Islands than just cruise around. There is a plethora of outdoor activities of varying levels of intensity, available for everyone to partake in. Alongside the obligatory boating, swimming and paddling, try cycling the 1,000 Islands Parkway Trail in summer – a glorious, winding 24-mile stretch skirting the coves and bays between Gananoque and Brockville. Meanwhile, the cooler months bring with them a whole array of new activities, from hiking the Marble Rock conservation area to high-octane snowmobile runs through the island backcountry.Less than two-and-a-half hours east from the hustle of Toronto, Prince Edward County is an idyllic escape on Lake Ontario. Technically an island, it juts out into the eastern corner of the lake near the head of the St Lawrence River. A permanent home for almost 25,000 people, the county opens its arms to visitors who come for its mix of natural beauty, endless action options and one of the most happening artisanal food and drink scenes in Canada.Sandbanks provincial park is the undoubted star of the county, a sprawling natural expanse that connects three beaches and ranks as the world’s largest freshwater sand bar and dune system. Hiking trails crisscross the park and the pristine waters are perfect for a dip in summer. But don’t be afraid to take things up a notch nearby (especially when the breeze picks up) with some kiteboarding and sailing lessons under the expert tutelage of the AirTime Kiteboarding team. Canoe and kayak rental options abound too.No matter what you’ve been getting up to, it’s not difficult to work up an appetite in the county. The best way to do so might well be by first quenching your thirst on two wheels. Cycle-and-sip tours of the island’s up-and-coming wineries are outrageously good fun. But don’t miss out on the brewery scene either (the area is renowned for its ciders), with Midtown and Parsons being the pick of the bunch.Picton, the island’s main hub is full of excellent dining and drinking options such as Hartley’s Tavern and 555 Brewing Co, but perhaps the biggest name around is the Drake Devonshire, located in the nearby waterfront town of Wellington. Billing itself as the ultra-hip country sister to its iconic downtown Toronto original, the Drake Devonshire delivers just as consistently as its urban sibling when it comes to the kitchen. Splurge and stay overnight at one of its unique rooms where every artsy detail is obsessed over. The Drake team also recently opened a more cost-conscious – but still cool – option next door with their Motor Inn.Meanwhile, the nearby Muskoka region – or as Ontarians call it, “cottage country” – is both a relaxation and outdoor adventure hub.The region is, like so many others in Ontario, famous for its lakes – and there’s no shortage of action to be had out on the water or hugging the shoreline. There are plenty of great options for canoeing, kayaking and stand-up paddleboarding, as well as angling and boating trips and tours aplenty. But for a truly wild thrill, try flyboarding, the newest adrenaline rush available on water. Think of a flyboard as a water-powered jetpack for your feet. It sucks the water from the wake of a boat or jetski through an 18-metre hose and propels you high up over the lake. If it sounds unbelievable, just try it for yourself in Muskoka.Back on dry land, step up your adventure settings with a visit to Muskoka Zip Lines and Aerial Park. Clamber over rope bridges and obstacles in the treetop aerial adventure course, or take the zip line canopy tour crisscrossing the park for a fast and fun high-altitude thrill over seven connected zip lines. For those inclined to keep their feet a bit closer to solid ground, take a horseback trail ride with Winding Fences Farm across the beautiful open terrain in the pastures surrounding the town of Windermere.Those looking for an all-frills, all-inclusive experience will find it at the JW Marriott The Rosseau Muskoka. Not only is this luxury resort and spa considered one of Canada’s finest, but its outdoor adventure options include stand-up paddleboarding, canoeing and kayaking from its exclusive lakeside beach, as well as a spectacular new 180-metre zipline that runs across the Five Bridges Trail on the resort’s grounds.Ontario’s adrenaline hotspot – the Blue Mountain resort, which not only boasts the province’s best winter sports but an amazing variety of activities the other nine months of the year – sits on the shores of another of the Great Lakes, Lake Huron. In the summer months, just 10 minutes from the resort is a private beach on the shores of Georgian Bay, where visitors can surf, and rent boats, canoes, kayaks and paddleboards, alongside other fun, family friendly activities on shore, from the Timber Challenge High Ropes Course to the Ridge Runner Mountain Coaster. Of course, when you’re ready to take things down a gear or two, the resort’s pedestrian-friendly village has a fantastic offering of restaurants, bars and pubs, as well as a great entertainment programme featuring live music and other events such as Movies Under the Stars.There’s also the perfect excuse to seriously chill at the Scandinave Spa Blue Mountain. Located in a tranquil forest, the spa has a strict “no electronic devices” policy to ensure maximum unwind time. But when you’re basking in thermal and Nordic waterfalls, hot baths and Finnish and infrared saunas, why would you want to be thinking about the outside world anyway?While no trip to Ontario could be considered complete without at least one trek through Algonquin provincial park in search of that blessed moose, or (from a distance) bear sighting, during the summer months fun on the water takes centre stage. Algonquin is home to dozens of lakes and small tributaries, and while some of them are only accessible through the backcountry, Algonquin Outfitters offers a number of excursions, from wildlife spotting day trips to canoeing. You could also try Parkbus, a fantastic and sustainable transport service that ensures city dwellers and tourists can fully connect with nature. Stops in Algonquin include paddlers’ paradise, Lake Opeongo and the serene Pog Lake.Of course it’s not just about the resort towns and big name outdoor destinations, there are plenty of adventures to be had throughout cottage country – with ample options to hike, get out on the water or just generally unwind. From Haliburton to Huntsville and south to Gravenhurst, there are local gems with water access for lazy morning kayaking and nearby trails for afternoon hikes. And for those who really want to get away from it all, Cabinscape offers tiny custom-made, ecologically friendly cabins perched in the wilderness of southern Ontario – and some of the options are so off-grid that they’re hike-in access only.But much like the wider province itself, it’s the far-off corners that reveal Ontario’s true character – a little rugged, a little wild, altogether unforgettable.Start planning your visit to Ontario this winter with Canadian Affair"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f578aaef55d9adb75bc8d9d18d48f2a6f96556e/0_67_5413_3248/master/5413.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c819b898d4c035d3d3c77e168b339902","title":"oxford professor dirk obbink ancient bible fragments hobby lobby","story":"Dirk Obbink allegedly sold artefacts to US chain Hobby Lobby without permissionAn Oxford University professor has been accused of selling ancient Bible fragments to a controversial US company that has been involved in several high-profile scandals related to its aggressive purchases of biblical artefacts.Dirk Obbink, one of the world’s most celebrated classics professors, has been named after an investigation by staff associated with Oxford’s Oxyrhynchus Papyri project.He is accused of selling without permission a number of ancient fragments to the US arts and crafts chain Hobby Lobby. Its owners, the Green family, are prominent Christian evangelicals and, under the guidance of the Hobby Lobby president, Steve Green, were behind the founding of Washington’s $400m Museum of the Bible in 2017.A statement published by the Egypt Exploration Society, which manages the Papyri project, claimed it was told by the Museum of the Bible that 11 fragments were sold to it by Obbink in two batches in 2010.The society and the university confirmed Obbink was under investigation. He continues to be employed at Oxford.  has contacted him for comment.The lecturer in papyrology and Greek literature has previously denied some of the allegations, telling the Daily Beast in 2018 that the claim he sold a fragment of the first chapter of the gospel of Mark to Hobby Lobby was not true.In its statement, the Egypt Exploration Society, which owns the collection and conducted the investigation, said the issue had contributed to Obbink’s removal as general editor of the Oxyrhynchus Papyri project “because of unsatisfactory discharge of his editorial duties, but also because of concerns, which he did not allay, about his alleged involvement in the marketing of ancient texts”.The statement said file records relating to the missing fragments had also been removed. “These texts were taken without authorisation from the EES, and in most of the 13 cases the catalogue card and photograph are also missing.”The statement follows intensive investigations after reports in the Daily Beast this year speculated about the possibility that Obbink had sold a highly prized fragment – if it is real – of the gospel of Mark to Hobby Lobby and the Green family.Commenting after the statement on Monday, Nongbri said: “The sale of the manuscripts and the attempt to cover it up by removing records is almost unbelievable. But the first thing to note are the words ‘so far’. We don’t yet know the full extent of this. More items may well have been sold to Hobby Lobby.”The Green family and Steve Green have been embroiled in multiple scandals over the long-running programme of purchasing biblical fragments for the Museum of the Bible. According to the Egypt Exploration Society, its investigations have revealed that 13 pieces in the museum’s collection are in fact the rightful property of the nonprofit society.In a statement, the Museum of the Bible said the antiquities were “sold illegally” by a “known expert”, adding that of the 13 items identified, only four were the property of the museum, with the remainder belonging to Hobby Lobby as part of the Green collection.The Green family has assembled what it describes as one of the largest collections of biblical antiquities in the world, many of which are on display in the Museum of the Bible.However, the Greens and the museum have been dogged by controversy over the provenance of some of its acquisitions. In June 2017, Hobby Lobby Stores was ordered to pay a $3m fine for illegally importing thousands of ancient Iraqi artefacts that were falsely labelled and shipped to the company through the United Arab Emirates and Israel.Commenting after that case Hobby Lobby said it “did not fully appreciate the complexities of the acquisitions process” and relied on dealers who did not understand how to properly ship the items.In a second high-profile controversy, the Green family and the Museum of the Bible were forced to remove five document fragments – described as part of the Dead Sea Scrolls – when they were identified as modern forgeries after reporting by the  and other media organisations."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/554f9c8e448ee31bb42c2ebaf91308d977278a6a/6_0_1760_1056/master/1760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c95da73b1eec7296d154c0e18f3d1a88","title":"barbaric tests on monkeys lead to calls for closure of german lab","story":"Shocking footage shows conditions ‘clearly breach’ EU standards on animal welfare, say campaignersAn animal testing laboratory in Germany that subjected monkeys to “barbaric” treatment and kept unwell dogs in squalid conditions is under investigation amid calls for its closure.Undercover footage at the Laboratory of Pharmacology and Toxicology (LPT) near Hamburg published by Cruelty Free International and Soko Tierschutz shows technicians with metal prongs grabbing macaque monkeys by the neck. The monkeys are restrained by braces during testing. The footage also shows primates being handled “violently” by technicians: in one incident a monkey has its head smacked against a door frame.Some of the monkeys appeared to be kept alone in metal cages measuring less than a cubic metre and are seen spinning in circles, indicating high levels of distress. They were reportedly forced to stand for long periods. Dogs are pictured laying in what seemed to be their own blood and faeces, with one beagle in a cage appearing to be bleeding. Staff also appeared to mishandle cats.The footage provoked an angry response from campaigners who said that suffering was clearly not being kept to a minimum, as required by law in many countries.Kate Willett, of Humane Society International, said the use of restraints was “barbaric” and described the conditions animals were kept in as “appalling”.“The technicians are treating the animals violently,” she said. “This kind of treatment is ethically insupportable and quite possibly illegal. Each country develops its own animal care guidelines, but dogs housed in these appalling conditions would not be up to the standards of the US or the UK, and it has serious ramifications for the quality of the scientific results.”Any data collected from the animals would be “virtually useless”, she said, since their physiology would be altered by the stresses they were experiencing.“It’s time for this type of testing to be relegated to the history bin,” she added. “There are new, non-animal methodologies available for safety testing so to see this type of abuse going on in in the name of science in the 21st century is unforgivable.”Since 2015, nine inspections have taken place at the facility, seven of which were unannounced. One unannounced visit took place on 8 October when evidence of the abuse was reported to authorities, and another a week later.Inspectors observed that 44 monkeys were kept “in far too small cages” and reported “long-term harm and considerable suffering”. However, the monkeys were not used in tests during the inspections.The facility was fined €300 (£260) on one occasion because it introduced new dogs without permission, according to the Süddeutsche Zeitung newspaper, which broke the story. LPT said last Thursday that the authorities had never objected to its “animal husbandry”, according to the paper.Cruelty Free International said the conditions “clearly breach” minimum EU animal welfare requirements and called for the closure of the facility.“By failing to adopt methods that could reduce the suffering and stress experienced by the monkeys, dogs and cats, LPT are falling short of the 3Rs (replacement, reduction and refinement) mandatory under EU and German legislation,” a spokesperson said.“This cannot be tolerated, and we are calling for this laboratory to be closed and a full investigation by the German authorities.”Soko, a charity campaigning for animal rights, said the footage demonstrated a “horrendous mixture of suffering and cruelty” and that the practices breached German and EU legislation.“It is unthinkable that this should be happening in a country that has animal protection in its constitution,” said Soko’s Friedrich Mülln. “We call on the German government to take immediate action to close LPT and to end these cruel and outdated poisoning tests.”In July the European commission said there were “numerous failings” in German domestic law regarding the minimisation of the number of animals used in experiments and called on the country to “correctly enact” EU directives.Cruelty Free International said the beagles at the laboratory were bred in the US and exported to Germany. They are understood to have been supplied by one of the major global suppliers of dogs. The primates were bred in China.The breeding industry that supplies laboratories around the world has faced growing scrutiny as countries have moved to ban animal testing for cosmetic products and other uses. In 2005 it was estimated that about 115m animals had been used in laboratory experiments that year. Most are killed afterwards. In the UK, there are two facilities where the typically docile beagles that are used for research are bred. They are owned by US group Marshall Bioresources.Although the use of primates and dogs in research is more carefully regulated than it used to be, they are still used regularly. More than 60,000 dogs and 70,000 primates were used in the US alone in 2016.LPT, which operates the testing facility in Mienenbüttel, near Hamburg, where the company has its headquarters, is one of the largest private laboratories in Germany and employs 175 people. On its website, it claims to work in accordance with national and international guidelines. An animal rights activist who worked there for several months earlier this year recorded the footage.The facility, which among other functions performs toxicity tests on behalf of pharmaceutical companies to measure safe doses of medication for humans, has long faced protests from animal rights activists. A demonstration is planned locally on Saturday in response to the revelations. Germany’s agriculture minister, Julia Klöckner, told the Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung last year that the government was committed to adapting German laws to ensure compliance with EU directives and lowering the numbers of animals used. “I want the number of experiments on animals to be continuously reduced,” Klöckner said. “Animals are fellow creatures and they deserve our sympathy.”In 2014 an undercover investigation at a neuroscience facility in Tübingen owned by the Max Planck Society revealed the “brutal” conditions in which animals were kept and spelled the end for the institute’s controversial monkey brain experiments.In response to the latest scandal, the local authority said that criminal charges had been lodged with the state prosecutor due to suspected unlawful activity.A spokesperson said: “The veterinary office responded promptly, after we were informed of the video footage, which indicates significant maladministration in the LPT facility, and carried out a comprehensive and unannounced inspection.“For this reason, the Harburg district has filed criminal charges with the prosecutor. We regret that animals have suffered as a result of noncompliant husbandry conditions and will consistently remedy all identified grievances … with all legally available means.”They added: “The challenge for the competent authorities is to examine what is and is not allowed under current legislation on animal testing and animal husbandry.” A former federal agriculture minister, Renate Künast von den Grünen, a current Bundestag member, told Süddeutsche Zeitung last Friday: “The expertise of those who carry out animal experiments is currently not sufficiently regulated.”LPT did not respond to a request for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5be196b54a2962e1a8382a662080fe76138855ce/941_125_4415_2650/master/4415.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1fb17ea7300c37fb8721d7ef5d5caa18","title":"wildlife photographer of the year 2019 winners in pictures","story":"Hailing from the Chinese province of Qinghai, Yongqing Bao has won the prestigious wildlife photographer of the year 2019 title for his image The Moment, which frames the standoff between a Tibetan fox and a marmot.

It’s not. Floral patterns on a dark background is not so much a fashion trend as a fashion takeover. It is a look that is absolutely everywhere – so much so, that you have probably stopped noticing it. It is in my wardrobe and – as a glance around the  office confirms – in a whole lot of other wardrobes too. The formula is simple: flowers of any variety bloom against a dark-coloured background. Perhaps on a blouse, possibly a trousersuit or an evening gown, but most likely on a dress or a skirt.Without much fuss or fanfare, dark floral has lodged itself into modern life. Like the Breton stripe a decade before it, it has become style shorthand for looking current. And for looking good, but not looking as if you thought about it too much. Alessandro Michele’s super-maximalist aesthetic at Gucci has amped up the resting pulse rate of fashion, so you need a bit of print and colour for an outfit to feel really contemporary. On the other hand, the mood music of the #MeToo era doesn’t lend itself to a bunting-and-cupcakes vibe, so viewing the traditional femininity of the floral print through a darker lens feels right. And as fashion moves towards a more sustainable, less fast-moving model, a print that is a bit summery (because, flowers) and at the same time autumnal in its colours also feels right for now.Erdem Moralioglu has been making winter florals look super-chic for most of his career. For his autumn 2009 collection, he embroidered tiny, intensely coloured chrysanthemums and violets on to black dresses. Explaining how his colour scheme had taken a moody turn that season, he said at the time that the muse he had previously imagined “running free and romantic in the meadows” had now “visited nightclubs and gone home on the bus”. Ten years later, he is still into a moody bloom: this season’s Reese dress, £520, has tightly furled peonies and sprigs of cherry blossom against a black background.“I’ve always been fascinated by women and all things that imply femininity,” he says. “Flowers are an extension of that – beautiful, complex, sometimes dangerous. I like the contrast of a delicate floral print on a dark base, with little secrets hidden in the artwork. There is something wonderful about things that can be both pretty and dark at the same time.”“Glasual” – glamorous and casual – is the new smart-casual. Smart-casual looks a bit meh these days, while glasual fits the dressier, look-at-me vibe of the Instagram era. The winter floral is instantly, effortlessly glasual. It is ideal for day-to-night wear where animal print can feel a bit too much of a stretch first thing in the morning, florals have a long history as daywear. Fast-forward to cocktail hour and the moody, jewels-on-black-velvet colour combination brings just enough edge.The dark floral dress is fashion with a little “f” rather than a big one, but it is also A Bit French. It started with London-based designers – Alexander McQueen, as well as Erdem – but is now all over Paris, too. It is on the catwalk at Christian Dior and Dries Van Noten, and all over the streets of Paris. Every chic Parisienne’s current favourite haute high-street label, Sézane – tagline “French everybody can speak” – is selling a Penelope dress, £135, with tiny bright flowers on black.“Small flowers on a dark pattern is a timeless pattern,” says brand founder Morgane Sézalory. “It is not a specific trend but something that really goes through the time. During fall and winter, it is always a staple to have in your wardrobe. The print works really well on a midi or long dress with a pair of boots.”“While summer florals exude pretty femininity, there is something more edgy and dramatic about winter florals,” she says. “They are also incredibly versatile – great to style with dark separates and knitwear and more subtle than a flirty summer print. I smarten mine up with an oversized coat and boots, or dress down with some trainers and wear in the office every day.”The dark floral is Anna Wintour at Wimbledon. It is Michelle Obama at a state dinner. It is Janelle Monáe on the red carpet. It is the beauty of flowers as painted in oil by the Dutch masters, rather than in postcard watercolours. It is smart but not stuffy, womanly rather than girlish. Dark florals are not just a trend, because they show no sign of wilting. These are the flowers that never die.

The unseeded Arsenal, who are England’s other team in the tournament and who could have faced the holders Lyon, were handed the kinder tie against Slavia Prague.It has been a tough year for Duggan, who joined Barcelona alongside the star of the Netherlands’ Euro 2017 campaign Lieke Martens to help usher in a new era of investment in Catalonia. She left Barça this summer after a season which the club ended empty handed, having lost a Copa de la Reina semi-final against Atlético and finished six points behind Atléti in the league.A somewhat surprising Champions League run, helped by a kind draw, to a first final was tempered by a bruising 4-1 defeat to Lyon. While Duggan was hardworking but fairly anonymous at one end of the pitch, a 16-minute hat-trick from Ada Hegerberg up the other end, after Dszenifer Marozsán’s early opener, stole the show and crushed Barça.Duggan was distraught that night. Tearstained and struggling to stay composed, she said: “It’s disappointing. As a footballer I want to come here and win, I don’t want to just be here for the occasion. I’m really sad, that’s understandable right now but I’m sure I’ll look back on it in the future and realise we created history.”Looking to put the defeat behind her she left for France with England, but her World Cup campaign was hampered from the off when she picked up a thigh strain in the first training session in the French Riviera. The forward supposedly shook off that knock but did not look her usual self when out on the left wing, with the toll of a long season also undoubtedly playing its part.But a new season brings a new journey. Duggan, having scored in Barcelona’s 2-0 defeat of Atléti in front of a league record 60,739 fans last campaign, switched to the league winners this summer.A rollercoaster start to the season, however, has showed that this is not the same Atlético Madrid side that outclassed Manchester City in the round of 32 last season. In their second league game of the season, for example, they suffered a humiliating and shocking 6-1 defeat to Barcelona.A 90th-minute goal from Virginia Torrecilla ensured a 3-2 victory in Serbia against Spartak Subotica in the Champions League round of 32 first leg before a tense second game ended 1-1 to set up the meeting with City.The team are third in the league, only a point behind Barça and second-placed Deportivo de la Coruña, and it is not quite time to panic in Madrid, but with the manager José Luis Sánchez Vera departing – for personal, rather than performance-related, reasons according to the club – Atléti are going through a difficult period. The fairly unknown Pablo López, who has managed men’s teams in Segunda B and the third and fourth isions, has stepped in until the end of the season.The trip to the north west of England will be his second game in charge, having started with a 1-0 win at Levante on Saturday. The game on Wednesday could not have offered a bigger test of his nascent tenure.City are flying in all competitions. Nick Cushing’s team are unbeaten and have only conceded once in seven games. Revenge for last season’s frustrating Champions League exit, beaten 2-0 at home after drawing 1-1 in Madrid, will be on their minds too. In Duggan, though, Atlético perhaps have the key to unlocking City if they can take advantage of her knowledge of the opposition manager and pick her brains on how to handle the 11 City players that she has played with internationally."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/977a0143586f65fae156eed1f1dee1b757b8f035/0_174_4407_2644/master/4407.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c38ffe24f0c87346dd75b65da26fdb48","title":"england players stronger sofia experience gareth southgate","story":"England’s firm but dignified handling of shameful scenes in Bulgaria was character-building in the extremeJadon Sancho walked towards the tunnel of the Vasil Levski Stadium in the bitter and slightly surreal aftermath of England’s Euro 2020 qualifying win over Bulgaria – a match in which the football had seemed almost incidental. Ten yards in front of him were two of his black teammates, Tyrone Mings and Marcus Rashford, and a group of Bulgarian children were shouting for their shirts.Mings and Rashford had been targeted for abhorrent racial abuse from a section of the home support, with the former saying he first heard the monkey chants when he went out for the warm-up, and they kept on walking, eyes fixed on the exit door a little way away. That is when they heard the noises, yet another round of them, from the so-called grown-ups in the vicinity. It is inconceivable Sancho did not hear them.A couple of steps later, it was the turn of Sancho . “Jadon, Jadon,” the local kids yelled. They wanted his shirt. Sancho, who had come on as a 73rd-minute substitute, sized up the situation, the most jarring juxtaposition of innocence and ignorance, and made the decision. He peeled off his shirt, strolled over and handed it to one of the youngsters.It was a simple gesture, one that recognised the joy a footballer can bring to a child, but it also chimed with one of the themes of a bleak occasion from an England perspective: defiance in the face of disgusting provocation collective strength in adversity.It was a night of shame for Bulgaria, whose football union has now been charged over the racist behaviour of the country’s fans – when the right-minded majority in the wonderful city of Sofia cringed at the dunderheads. They included the journalists who tutted and scoffed during Greg Clarke’s post-match press conference, when the Football Association chairman outlined his outrage at what he had seen and heard. “Exaggeration,” one of them shouted.The counterpoint would come from Ivelin Popov, the Bulgaria captain, who had remonstrated with home fans at half-time, urging them to calm down. “I don’t want it to be like this, it’s not good for us, the federation and our country,” Popov said. “What happened was terrible. It must stop. It doesn’t matter your colour, we are all the same, we are one very big family in football. Only if we are together can we stop these bad things.”Before the game it had not been difficult to spot the group of about 50 trouble-makers. They were dressed almost entirely in black and grouped together in a well-stewarded section by one of the corner flags. They were ejected just before half-time. Why let them in at all? That said, there were pockets of the similarly unenlightened in other areas.England’s black players had heard monkey taunts on their previous visit to this stadium – for a European Championship qualifier in 2011 – and the punishment from Uefa was a £34,230 fine. Those sort of measures simply have not worked and nor, on Monday’s evidence, have partial stadium closures. The stadium had 5,000 seats cordoned off for England’s visit because of the actions of their supporters in the June qualifiers against the Czech Republic and Kosovo.Gareth Southgate had noted in the aftermath of last Friday’s shock defeat against the Czechs in Prague that his squad faced “an interesting few days because we have not had a result or a performance like that”. Many of the younger players had not experienced the backlash which always accompanies an England misstep. It is ferocious and the first idea, according to Southgate, had been to “repair the confidence of the whole group”. That was hard enough.In addition, the manager and the squad had to prepare for the possibility of racial abuse because it had happened to them in Montenegro last March. Back then they had not been properly briefed they were not abreast of Uefa’s protocols. This time they were and it meant carrying further emotional baggage.The weight on Southgate has been immense and the one-time rather reluctant accepter of the England manager’s job has added a fresh layer to his responsibilities he has become one of the country’s most high-profile ambassadors. “The job is a remarkable one in terms of the breadth of what you have to deal with,” he said. “I can’t think of too much that’s like it. We’ve had to go through an incredible amount in 72 hours – football, non-football, everything else.”As usual, his delivery has been note perfect. He did not want to get into what he thought Uefa ought to do in order to combat racism more effectively but he did accept it had to try something different. “It was as big an operation as there has been in Sofia and the sad reality is that we weren’t able to stop incidents happening,” Southgate said. “Something clearly within the investigation has got to take that next step.”Southgate admitted that with 10 minutes of the first half to play and the monkey chants continuing despite an appeal over the PA for them to stop, he was “not confident we would be finishing the game”. There would be two stoppages in play, as England drew attention to the racism but no walk-off, no abandonment. Southgate and his players made their statements by staying on and through the quality of their football and their dignity.“The players’ response, their focus, the way they played though the stoppages and back into it, were remarkable,” Southgate said. “Bizarrely, I think they’ve gained strength from the experience.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b793ac86b8563ea512c9975d0b36a65ee4ac88ec/0_10_2300_1379/master/2300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c79392fe26307caa75385f9db7371fdf","title":"expel teams from tournaments over racism urges kick it out chief bulgaria england","story":"Boris Johnson has joined demands by anti-racism campaigners for Uefa to take strong action after the racist chanting that marred England’s Euro 2020 qualifier against Bulgaria on Monday night.European football’s governing body has opened disciplinary proceedings against the Bulgarian Football Union (BFU) for racist behaviour of its supporters after the incidents at the Vasil Levski Stadium in Sofia, in which some home fans made monkey noises at Tyrone Mings, Raheem Sterling and Marcus Rashford in the 6-0 victory for Gareth Southgate’s side.The BFU was also charged over Nazi salutes by fans and the throwing of objects from the stands, while they and the English Football Association (FA) were both charged over the disruption of national anthems. The FA also faces a separate charge of having insufficient travelling stewards.The match was halted twice during the first half under Uefa’s anti-racism protocols after Mings and Southgate alerted officials about the abuse, with television pictures at half-time also showing several fans using Nazi salutes. Their actions were condemned by the anti-­discrimination groups Kick It Out and Fare, while the FA chairman, Greg Clarke – who is also vice-president of Uefa – called for the authorities to now show “zero tolerance”. The sports minister, Nigel Adams, has ­written to the Uefa president, Aleksander Čeferin, offering support and asking him to take “urgent action” after the prime minister’s spokesman said the incidents were a “stain on football”.“The England players and management showed tremendous dignity and the prime minister commends the players who were targeted for this ­despicable abuse for their response,” he added. “We support the FA’s calls for an urgent investigation with tough penalties to follow.”A section of the stadium was closed for Monday’s game after Uefa imposed sanctions over racist incidents during Bulgaria’s qualifiers against Kosovo and the Czech Republic in June.The punishment will also apply in the home game against the Czech Republic next month. The next step would be to implement a full stadium closure, as was the case with Montenegro after England’s players endured similar racial abuse during the qualifier in Podgorica in March, although Uefa’s disciplinary panel is allowed to go much further and has the power to expel a country from a tournament.However, Bulgaria is expected to argue that those responsible for the problems were in the minority and dealt with by stadium stewards.A group of about 50 people, who are understood to have been members of club side Lokomotiv Plov’s “ultras” group Lauta Army, were asked to leave at half-time. Čeferin has defended Uefa’s punishments for racism as “among the toughest in sport” and called on for a “war” on ­discrimination but added that it would require the help of governments and the whole “football family” to tackle the problem.“Believe me, Uefa is committed to doing everything it can to eliminate this disease from football,” he said. “We cannot afford to be content with this. We must always strive to strengthen our resolve.“More broadly, the football family– everyone from administrators to players, coaches and fans – needs to work with governments and NGOs to wage war on the racists and to ­marginalise their abhorrent views to the fringes of society.” He added: “Football associations themselves cannot solve this problem. Governments to0 need to do more.”But Kick It Out demanded that Uefa should consider a points ­deduction or tournament expulsion. “The fines from Uefa we don’t think are enough,” chief executive, Roisin Wood, said on the Today programme. “There have to be serious steps now, and that should include looking at expulsion or not letting people enter ­tournaments, because there has to be a clear message. This is 2019. These are ­professional players going out to play. You would never expect to get this in your workplace so why should ­professional players get it in theirs?”Gianni Infantino, president of Fifa, the world game’s governing body, said he wanted “all football governing ­bodies to join us and think together of new, stronger and more effective ways to eradicate racism in football”.He added: “As a starting point, I ­suggest that all competition organisers enact regulations which envisage life bans from stadiums for those who are found guilty of racist behaviour at a football match. Fifa can then enforce such bans at a worldwide level.”Borislav Mihaylov, the BFU’s president, has resigned after the prime minister, Boyko Borissov, demanded that he stepped down following his comments before the match last week. The former Reading goalkeeper had urged Uefa to take action against ­England after the Chelsea striker, Tammy Abraham, said ­Southgate’s side would walk off the pitch if they heard racist chanting.That reaction was applauded by the Manchester City and England forward Sterling, who was also on the receiving end of racist abuse in Montenegro. “A good move credits to you M. Borissov,” Sterling wrote on Twitter. But the Bulgaria goalkeeper, Plamen Iliev, saw it differently after the match, claiming the home supporters had “behaved well” and that England’s players had “overreacted a bit”.Yet the Aston Villa defender Mings, who was making his first international appearance on Monday, admitted he had spoken out because he felt a duty to report the abuse.“It didn’t affect my feelings,” he said. “I think I’m quite lucky in that way because I don’t feel like it is a personal assault. I feel sorry for the people who have those views. But I also have a duty to represent people that don’t have a voice. It was important that it was bigger than me, bigger than what I felt.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/732c6ae332725589320fe72a817bca55cb94aa95/0_77_2500_1501/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c0ad35396cf794599a91895323515f7a","title":"north south korea world cup qualifier","story":"Long-time foes North and South Korea played a World Cup qualifier on Tuesday, their first football match in the North in 30 years, but no fans were allowed in the stands and Pyongyang refused to broadcast the game live. There were also no goals.The last time the two sides met in a World Cup qualifier was in Seoul 10 years ago, when the North lost 1-0 before accusing South Korea of poisoning their players’ food ahead of the match.Reclusive North Korea and the rich, democratic South are technically still at war because their 1950-53 civil conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty.National anthems of both sides were played before the match kicked off at the Kim Il Sung Stadium and the flags of the two countries were on display, the South’s Korea Football Association said.Two earlier qualifiers that had been scheduled for North Korea had to be switched to Shanghai after Pyongyang refused to raise the South’s flag or play its anthem. North Korea had promised to provide footage of the match on DVD, the South’s unification ministry said.“We would need time for technical checks but despite some delays our people will be able to watch the game,” a ministry official said on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue.North Korea’s official KCNA news agency issued a brief report early on Wednesday, saying the qualifier ended in a 0-0 draw after a series of “attacks and counterattacks”.Two players on each side received yellow cards, the KFA said.Fifa president Gianni Infantino was at the match and said in a statement that he was “disappointed to see there were no fans in the stands”.“We were surprised by this and by several issues related to its live broadcast and problems with visas and access for foreign journalists,” he said, adding that, for Fifa, freedom of the press and freedom of speech were paramount.Last year saw a flurry of sports diplomacy between the two Koreas, which fielded a joint ice hockey team and marched together at the opening ceremony of the 2018 Winter Olympics in South Korea.That set the stage for a series of summits between North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and the South’s Moon Jae-in. The two Koreas even talked about a joint bid to host the 2032 Summer Olympics.But relations have since cooled over stalled negotiations over North Korea’s nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles.In addition to the TV blackout and empty stands, South Korean media were also blocked, with only some 30 KFA staff with limited communications allowed to relay information about the game, Seoul officials said.South Korea’s squad, including Tottenham Hotspur striker Son Heung-min, arrived in Pyongyang on Monday via Beijing instead of a shorter route across the DMZ between the two Koreas, after months of no response from Pyongyang.“There have always been at least some South Korean fans, so it will be our first time to play without any,” defender Kim Min-jae said before leaving for Beijing on Monday. “But we can overcome and play well.”One South Korean user of the South’s Naver web portal said: “How do we co-host the Olympics when we can’t even watch one single qualifier?”Another said: “Best if we win, but it’s also fine to lose. I just hope our players return safely.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a09535a5849a60941ed8512a0e412e52b1cdd368/264_83_1175_705/master/1175.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f028253c65572ccb0bb9534930bfb7d2","title":"buy a classic david squires cartoon from our collection","story":"Our cartoonist looks back at 25 of his favourite strips from down the years, all of which are now available at our  Print Shop, a link to each can be found by clicking on the title of each caption below"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/86b06f6357c0e3e2a47aa62627755037d1475e00/0_0_3329_1997/master/3329.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1b9b01c15da153d58dfcfc9ba780e909","title":"what is the truth about vaping","story":"Jamie Doward and Max Sanderson join Anushka Asthana to navigate a way through the haze of the debate around vaping.

The Labour leaderships in London and Wales have recognised our right to choose … Just like us, they know there is going to be a referendum.” Downing Street used Monday’s Queen’s speech to double down on Boris Johnson’s previous insistence that the 2014 independence referendum was “once-in-a-generation”, while the Labour leadership has most recently insisted there should be no electoral pact or deal with the SNP, and that a referendum should not happen within the “formative years” of a Labour administration.Telling delegates that the party already had “a cast iron mandate for an independence referendum”, Sturgeon reiterated the importance of holding a vote that is legal and internationally recognised.On the first day of conference, an expected rebellion over a proposed “plan B” – the option of demanding independence without a legally-constituted referendum – was swiftly quashed by an overwhelming majority of delegates.In what was a mainly relaxed and humorous address, which quoted Billy Connolly and Robert Burns, Sturgeon took the opportunity to warn delegates about the conduct of a coming independence campaign.She said: “We will win our independence. But not the Brexit way. Not by undermining democracy, demonising those who disagree, and plastering lies on the side of a bus. We will win by inspiring and persuading. So let us resolve today that how we campaign for independence will always reflect the open, tolerant, inclusive and democratic nation we are determined to build.”Announcing a raft of domestic policies and potential manifesto commitments, including giving police the power to remove abusers from the family home, scrapping all non-residential social care charges and expanding free childcare into the school holidays for primary pupils from the poorest backgrounds, Sturgeon said that a general election “cannot come soon enough”.“When it does our message will be clear, simple and unambiguous. Vote SNP to demand independence and secure Scotland’s right to choose.”Guaranteeing that, in the event of a hung parliament, the SNP will never put the Tories into power, she added: “I have a message for any Westminster party that wants SNP support. If you don’t respect Scotland’s right to choose our own future at a time of our own choosing, don’t even bother picking up the phone.”Describing Brexit as a disaster, she railed against the unfairness of a potentially differentiated deal for Northern Ireland, saying: “Wales will have voted to leave. England will have voted to leave. Northern Ireland will be given a say over its future. Scotland will be the only country in the UK to be taken out of the EU against our will and with no say over our future relationship with Europe. That is not a partnership of equals. That is a denial of fairness and basic democracy.”Accusing successive Westminster governments of having “shattered the case for the union”, she told delegates that it was “time to complete that home rule journey” as she painted a picture of an independent Scotland free of Trident nuclear weapons, with a written constitution and leading globally on climate change. The Scottish Greens accused the SNP of hypocrisy earlier in the week for accepting sponsorship from Heathrow and BP at the conference.Sturgeon told cheering delegates: “It is time to reclaim our independence.””I don’t know about you but I’m utterly sick of Westminster. I’m sick of Brexit. And I’ve had more than enough of people like Jacob Rees-Mogg lording it over us while lounging across the benches of the House of Commons as if he owns the place. The people of Scotland are seeing all of this for what it is. A broken political system.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/890b9b802f45cf0227a5f36753a70fdd68852e76/0_130_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3d019ef4c0a3a72a1eda3e44963bf68c","title":"rees moggs dim brand banter entertains no one but himself","story":"Leader of the house’s unctuous insincerity fails to hide the fact he hasn’t a clue what’s going onCrack open the English sparkling wine. Boris Johnson has just won his first Commons vote. OK, it was only a statutory instrument to carry over EU air quality legislation to the UK after Brexit – the parliamentary equivalent of a second round victory in the Johnstone’s Paints Trophy – but these days the prime minister has learned he gets what he can get. Much more of this and he might even get an expression of confidence from the club chairman.That, though, was the high point of yet another day in which the government struggled to convince even itself that it knew what it was doing. It began with Jacob Rees-Mogg giving a short business statement, the sole point of which was to avoid saying that he didn’t have a clue what was going on so he couldn’t tell MPs whether they would need to be sitting on Saturday or not.Since joining the cabinet, lying has become second nature to the leader of the house. Power has corrupted him and what integrity he might once have had is now shot. Everyone knew that Saturday’s possible emergency session was entirely dependent on whether Johnson agreed to desperately negotiate himself back to a permanent Northern Ireland backstop with a customs border in the Irish Sea – the prime minister is one of the few people who could haggle the price up in a carpet shop – to give himself a deal on which the Commons could vote and save him the embarrassment of having to “die in a ditch” by writing an extension letter to the EU.But time and again Rees-Mogg argued otherwise. “Oh, no, no, no, no,” he said, chuckling to himself while oozing unctuous insincerity. “The honourable member had referred to ‘running a bath’ when surely he meant ‘drawing a bath’.” Weirdly, Rees-Mogg labours under the impression that this kind of bantz is clever. One can only imagine he rewatches his greatest hits on the BBC’s Parliament channel alone at night in a state of mild sexual arousal. Whatever gets you off.Saturday had nothing whatsoever to do with Johnson’s ability to agree to whatever the EU demanded, Rees-Mogg continued. The issue was that the Incredible Sulk was such a tough negotiator – “You’re welcome to keep Liverpool in a customs union as well if you like. I’ve never liked the whinging scousers and they’ve certainly never voted Tory. And while you’re about it you might as well help yourself to Scotland as well. After all, it’s only a matter of time” – that there might need to be a vote on the prime minister being forced to write to the EU.Er, you do know there is nothing in the Benn act about there needing to be a vote, Chris Leslie and Anna Soubry pointed out. Johnson could just knock out the “Dear EU” letter in between letting the dog out and spilling wine all over the sofa. But there is a need for a vote, Rees-Mogg persisted. There really isn’t. Not even his own backbenchers could bring themselves to offer him any support. One day, long after the thrill has gone, he might look back on this afternoon with embarrassment. It’s one thing to be thought dim. Another to prove it.Alok Sharma is one of the nicer Tory MPs, but even he must be surprised to find himself secretary of state for international development, as his entire career has been based on not doing anything to draw attention to himself. Neither clever nor stupid – the two usual qualifications for membership of the cabinet – just thoroughly unmemorably average. He must also have been horrified to find that Dominic Raab had done a runner and that he was now expected to open the Queen’s speech debate on foreign affairs.Um, I haven’t really got anything to say, he shrugged to a near empty chamber. The sheer futility of a government with a majority of minus 45 delivering a Queen’s speech is getting to almost everyone. Britain is the greatest country in the world. Which is why we wanted to leave the EU because Johnny Foreigner was just holding us back.And we’d also like to help some of the poorer countries, but frankly why should we? It would only encourage them to become more dependent on us. And yes it was true we were £60bn worse off as a result of voting to leave the EU but that was the kind of decision only the best country in the world could take. The only moment of honesty in his entire speech was when Emily Thornberry shouted “bollocks”. This wasn’t Sharma’s finest hour. Not that anyone could remember if he had ever had one. Maybe next time.Keir Starmer was assured in reply. Of the seven Brexit bills the government was planning to introduce, five were ones it had failed to implement in the last parliament and one had been withheld because it would never have passed. He swatted aside several Tory interruptions – it’s amazing how often it’s the MPs who understand a subject the least feel most inclined to speak about it – and repeatedly invited Sharma to say whether the government intended to crash out without a deal on 31 October regardless of whether there was a deal to be had. Sharma let out a quiet sob. This was massively above his pay grade. So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1be99cdf416a619a80d785b9f14a0e80c9c84651/5_0_3490_2094/master/3490.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=196214b1e5b29e9970b1a6329d3922c0","title":"uk to accelerate plans for decarbonisation of transport sector","story":"Government vows to unveil climate roadmap next year but critics demand action not more policies and plansThe UK government has vowed to accelerate its climate action for transport sector by drafting new plans to end emissions from trains, planes and cars by 2050.Ministers promised to begin the groundwork on the government’s first detailed plan to decarbonise the transport sector immediately, and unveil the plan in full next year.The climate action roadmap will be one of many new government climate proposals expected in 2020 to help meet the UK’s legally binding target to build a carbon neutral economy by 2050.The plans follow a damning rebuke from the UK’s Committee on Climate Change (CCC) earlier this year, in which John Gummer, the committee chair, likened the government’s climate efforts to the TV comedy Dad’s Army.Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, said: “We want to work with industry and communities around the country to develop this plan – to make our towns and cities better places to live, help to create new jobs, improve air quality and our health, and take urgent action on climate change.”Shapps was speaking on the same day that environmental protesters targeted the Department for Transport offices over its support for the HS2 rail project, which is expected to run through ancient woodlands.The transport climate roadmap is expected to bring forward a ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars by 2040 after Shapps told the Conservative party conference this month that the government would “thoroughly explore the case” for a 2035 deadline.The government also hopes to unleash a large-scale battery boom by cutting red tape in the planning system for energy storage projects larger than 50MW. This should help energy companies build bigger batteries faster, and at lower costs, to make help use more of the UK’s renewable electricity projects.Under separate plans the government has proposed setting out tougher minimum energy efficiency standards for rented workplaces which could put British businesses in line for savings of around £1bn a year on energy bills.Andrea Leadsom, the business secretary, said the government would build on Britain’s track record on climate action, and “will keep on going further and faster to ensure our action meets our ambition”.The ambition was broadly welcomed by industry, but many warned that the UK needs to take action rather than rely on proposals and plans.The campaign group Transport and Environment said the plan to accelerate the transport sector’s climate agenda does not go far enough. The group said ministers should have announced a 2030 ban on the sale of new combustion engine vehicles, an end to the fuel duty freeze and new taxes on aviation.Chris Stark, the chief executive of the CCC, said: “When it comes to preparing for the effects of climate change, the government’s approach continues to rest on the need for further research and guidance, instead of action. Meanwhile, the country remains unprepared for even a 2C rise in global temperature.“The UK’s role as a genuine climate leader now rests on tangible commitments – we will be watching next month’s budget closely.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/05184bcda21127d611feb5254b14390e827f9812/0_25_2355_1413/master/2355.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=071ce96fc2d364e96fe5907e1622b3df","title":"2019 earth science week photo competition winners","story":"The Geological Society has announced the winners of this year’s competition, which for the first time allowed in images taken from around the world.

Sue George helps her find out more than she imaginedWhen you start researching your family tree, you never know what you might find. Sophie Morgan – TV presenter and campaigner – knew very little about her family’s dark past.“We knew a few things about my mother’s side,” she says, “but nothing about my father’s.”As I delve into Morgan’s dad’s side of the family, using Ancestry, I’m soon introduced to someone whose life was punctuated with multiple marriages, domestic violence and even a proposed suicide pact.The life of John Andrew Towle (JAT senior), Morgan’s great-great-grandfather, not only highlights the absence of contraception in the 19th century and the infancy of modern medicine, but also the lack of women’s rights.JAT senior was born in Salford in 1826 and began his working life as a pawnbroker, like his father before him. JAT senior must have been energetic and ambitious, as he later became an engineer, while remaining a pawnbroker.He was married three times, the first two of which were to women who lived near him in the lively Broughton Road shopping district. His first marriage, to Catherine Dixon, took place in 1855.His second marriage, to Morgan’s two-times great-grandmother Mary Ann, took place in Paris in 1867. They went on to have six children together in the seven years they were married. Mary Ann died in 1874, around the same time their final – and her 10th – child, Octavia Ventnor Towle, was born.But it was his third marriage that was the most tumultuous. JAT senior married Jane Dunster Holliday in June 1875. But they soon went their separate ways. In her orce petition, dated August 1876, she states that he harmed her physically six weeks after their marriage, when he bruised her arm and tried to “pitch her out of the window”. Soon afterwards, he suggested that they take poison together. The litany of cruelty continued until January 1876. She finally left him after he violently pushed her and “hit her with severe blows, feeling the effects of it for some time”.At that time, orce was both unusual and expensive. The grounds for women to orce their husbands were fewer than those for men and their wives women had to prove cruelty, whereas for men, adultery on the part of their wife was sufficient.JAT senior didn’t marry again after the orce. He lived until 1914, dying aged 88.Many of his children, including Octavia, didn’t marry. Morgan’s great-grandfather, also called John Andrew Towle, finally married at the age of 49, and had his only child three years later.Unsurprisingly, Morgan was shocked to find out about her ancestor’s past. “We are uncovering a secret life, a dark side we didn’t know about, which is intriguing,” she says. “Clearly he was a very dodgy character. I wonder how the rest of the family will react? When you find out something you don’t like, how do you feel?”Meanwhile, Morgan’s mother’s side had their fair share of scandal too – from illegitimacy to fraudulent marriage certificates.Ancestry reveals that several branches of her mother’s line came from the Scottish Borders between Jedburgh and Berwick-upon-Tweed. Morgan’s great-grandmother, Ann Drummond Ferguson, lived and died in Scotland. Ann was born in August 1886 the word “illegitimate” was marked clearly on her birth certificate. However, when her mother, Agnes, married her father, John Ferguson, six months later, Ann’s birth certificate was amended to show her legitimacy.However, the illegitimacy wouldn’t have been the only thing raising eyebrows. Agnes was 30 when she gave birth to Ann, while John was just 18 – having been 17 when Ann was conceived. John clearly felt the strain of going against societal norms, as he lied about his age on the marriage certificate, listing himself as 21 when he was still 18, while Agnes, who by then was 31, said she was 30.They married in the manse (the minister’s house), rather than in church. This implies that they had a small wedding, which was quite normal because the couple were not well off.Their marriage endured, and they had another six children. However, a new family mystery emerges around Eliza Taylor Drummond – born illegitimate to Agnes two years before Ann, and not John’s child. Eliza was part of their household until 1901, but there is no trace of her after that.Finding out about her mother’s roots in Scotland made Morgan keen to visit the part of the country where her ancestors were based. “I love the idea that there’s this woman in the family who married a much younger man,” she says.The whole experience has made Morgan determined to keep searching for answers about her family’s past.“I’m so curious to take it further,” she says. “I want to go further back, and I’d like to find living relatives.”Discover your backstory by charting your family tree.

Look out of the hotel window and there is so much rising steam it suddenly becomes easier to understand why the tournament organisers chose unflashy Oita to stage two of this weekend’s four quarter-finals.Because this week is all about staying relaxed under pressure: who will respond best and not blow their tops as the tension mounts? Given only four of England’s squad – Ben Youngs, Manu Tuilagi, Dan Cole and Courtney Lawes – have experienced a World Cup knockout game, it is an area Australia will hope to examine given the way their opponents imploded during the 2015 pool stages.It is a fair enough target. As Japan have shown so wondrously against Ireland and Scotland, the side who can release themselves from the shackles of self-doubt and express themselves become infinitely more dangerous. If there is a greater threat to England’s aspirations than the Wallabies, it is fear itself. They are a good team but, under intense pressure, they have not always responded as positively as they might have liked.Joe Marler, their fit-again prop forward, was interesting on the subject on Tuesday. As one of the squad’s more senior players, he was around when England travelled to Cardiff in 2013 in pursuit of a Six Nations grand slam that never materialised. “I was involved in the 2013 England team and I remember the feeling among the group being really nervous. We were so close, we just had to win this game. Other teams I’ve been involved in have let nerves overcome them and caved in, allowing the nerves to become negative.”And now? According to Marler that 30-3 Millennium Stadium drubbing is ancient history, as is the tension-racked 2015 World Cup which he described only last month as a “crap” experience. “I don’t feel that in this group. You may turn to me on Sunday and say: ‘You ballsed that up, Joe’ if we end up losing but I don’t feel that. I feel the boys embrace that nervousness and use it as positive energy to drive us on. We have a bring-it-on mentality.”It is Marler’s belief, too, that England’s sizeable Saracens contingent, all accustomed to winning domestic and European club trophies, make up for any shortfall at Test level. “On paper there are only four boys who have been in a World Cup quarter-final before but the Saracens boys have been in big games consistently over the past four or five years. They’re big leaders in this team, huge cogs, and I think we’ve got enough in us to be able to cope with the challenge that presents itself on Saturday.”In Marler’s case, reversing his decision to retire from international rugby and making himself available for this World Cup has also clearly given him a fresh sense of perspective. He looks and sounds like a man who now views this weekend as a fabulous opportunity, having “worked my buns off” to show the management he remains hungry to succeed at the top level and, in the nick of time, resumed full training having been ruled out of last week’s cancelled France fixture.His time out of the England picture has also taught him that what works as a motivational tool for some does not necessarily suit everyone. “Each inidual is different. Jonny Wilkinson used to speak about the thing that drove him most was the fear of failure and that worked brilliantly for him. He was one of the best ever to play the game.Two more wins and he and his teammates will have a clear shot at matching the legends of 2003. Marler jokes that the next three weekends could make a big difference to this England side’s profile – “I’m sure a lot of ’03 boys will then be looking over their shoulders thinking: ‘Oh God, we’re going to be struggling for after-dinner gigs now’” – but finding the right mindset to tackle Australia is all that currently matters. Amid the steaming onsens of Oita, England feel they are coming nicely to the boil."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85e8885b1f3ceba389200c9a4e7097a9b68d1fbc/0_0_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cdbc12ad20b5ad0d5de8bcaab8055c77","title":"mountain climbers 2020 tour de france toughest chris froome","story":"Route described as ‘the toughest’ by Chris Froome as race organisers plan to use all the mountain ranges and include only one time trialThe Tour de France’s search for novelty and excitement in recent years has taken it in one direction: hillier, shorter, more intense, with occasional ventures off the Tarmac. The 2020 route heads down that road at breakneck speed, with only one time trial – and that up a severe climb – only one stage over 200 kilometres, and so many climbs that they risk becoming interchangeable, a blur of constant action.“The toughest Tour I’ve ever seen,” said Chris Froome, who hopes to return from a severe crash to try for his fifth title, as long as his teammate Egan Bernal does not snatch the leadership of Ineos from him. The toughness comes not so much in the actual volume of climbing – there are relatively few classic set-piece ascents in the Alps and Pyrenees, no Mont Ventoux, no Alpe d’Huez – but in the constant day-to-day intensity that will make it virtually impossible for the race to settle down. “It’s more a mid-mountain all‑rounder route. I don’t think that makes it more difficult to control,” said Froome’s boss, Dave Brailsford.That is what television demands in the 21st century, and in 2020 it will leave relatively thin pickings for the sprinters, and even less for cycling fans in the northern half of France. But the upside of an almost totally “southern” Tour is that the organisers can use all the mountain ranges of France to the full, beginning in the southern Alps on day two for what promises to be the toughest ever stage on a Tour’s opening weekend.As is now the case in the Vuelta a España, the climbs then hit the riders like a series of straight lefts and rights to the solar plexus. Heading east-west: Orcières-Merlette in the Alps, Mont Aigoual in the Massif Central, and then the Pyrenees with Loudenvielle and Laruns, the latter concluded over the super-steep Col de Marie-Blanque. Added to day two’s climbs that will make for arguably the hardest opening nine days the Tour has ever known.A brief flirtation with the flat – but possibly with the wind to fray the nerves on the Atlantic coast, then east again for a second dose of the Massif Central, including another uphill finish on the Puy Mary, a punchy finish in Lyon and a final week in the Alps. Here the novelties come with bewildering pace: three climbs of the same ridge, the Grand Colombier the toughest finish of the race on the traffic free Col de la Loze at 2,300m, and the gravel Plateau des Glières close enough to the finish at La Roche-sur-Foron for any puncture or crash potentially to decide the race.After which, there is a transfer north for the only time trial, to La Planche des Belles Filles, where there is a surprise: the organisers have not gone the whole hog and included the final gravel section, preferring the safe option of the “conventional” finish where Froome won in 2012. Overall, it is a route that will call for teams stuffed with climbers such as can be fielded only by the bigger-budget squads such as Froome and Bernal’s Ineos and Primoz Roglic’s Jumbo.It will also have a wealth of openings for a rider who is not a climbing specialist but who can compete from day to day through sheer panache and racing ability, such as the nation’s new darling Julian Alaphilippe. The volume of climbing will suit France’s other star of 2019, Thibaut Pinot, although the day-to-day intensity will fray his nerves. The final time trial starts in Pinot’s hometown and finishes in his backyard, but it is a route made for the 2019 winner Bernal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6294906c84b4bd67269f3523fd04b0b7b3c95ec8/0_85_4064_2439/master/4064.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d10be336ebdb95b51d34836c7a959f4a","title":"japan effort rugby world cup quarter final south africa","story":"Late one night, and lost, drunk, in the dairy aisle of a Tokyo convenience store, I spent five minutes trying to work out whether the carton I’d just picked up had milk in or not. Google Translate’s camera app didn’t help. “Bulgaria!” the label read when I scanned it with my phone, ‘4 arrange the lance! Of bacteria in the hen! Tummy Keep Good.” You get used to it. There are awkward bits and pieces of English all around Japan. “Let’s watch the great power of live battle of men on the big screen!” is my favourite, from a poster advertising a rugby fanzone in Fuchu. The jacket-back slogan “vigorous throw-up – since 1973” is a close second.It isn’t easy getting this stuff right. Just ask your friend in that Superdry hoodie, the one with “extreme speed try test” written across the front in kanji. There are plenty of Japanese words that even the experts struggle to translate exactly. Like doryoku, which comes up over and again when you’re reading or talking about Japanese sport. It means effort, yes, but ability, striving and endeavour, too. And all that still doesn’t quite capture its significance.Fortunately there’s all sorts of lore about the men and women who personified doryoku. Like the champion baseball team at Ichiko school, who used to have a workout regimen called “bloody urine” because they practiced so hard they’d piss red at the end of the day. Or the “death training” philosophy of the famous Waseda baseball coach Suishu Tobita, who wrote “if the players don’t try so hard as to vomit blood in practice, then they cannot hope to win games”.The history of Koshien, Japan’s high school baseball tournament, seems to be full of these stories. Like how the legendary Sadaharu Oh won the title for his school by pitching four games in four days even though he had blisters so bad the blood was dripping down his fingers onto the ball. When he grew up, Oh would to sign his autographs “doryoku”. These are all old and well-worn stories now, and overly-familiar to anyone who knows them, but new for the rest of us.It was doryoku I saw at Yamanote high school, where the kids in the first XV were doing six hours training a day, six days a week. And doryoku I heard about in the words of three teenagers who had come over from New Zealand to play there, when they spoke with awe about how much training they were being made to do. “Back in New Zealand we were training twice a week, here we are training every day, so it’s way more intense,” one of them said, “and these guys are just monsters in gym, they spend too much time there, they all want to get big to climb over everyone they play.”Those kids at Yamanote weren’t the first foreigners to struggle with the concept. The baseball writer Robert Whiting filled his brilliant book, You Gotta Have Wa, with stories about overseas pros who struggled to cope with the workload. Like the former Major League Baseball all-star Davey Johnson, who flopped at the Yomiuri Giants because the endless batting practice gave him a neuroma. And they still wouldn’t let him sit out training.I was thinking about all this while I was talking to Toshiaki Hirose last week. Hirose spent two years playing as Japan’s captain under Eddie Jones. He quit in 2015, but four years later he still winces when you ask him what it was like. “Very hard,” he said, shaking his head, “very, very hard.” But Hirose had come up through Japan’s high school system, same as his teammates, and what I couldn’t work out was how Jones could have worked him any harder than he was already used to.“Yes,” Hirose explained, “in Japan, we always do very long training, even from when we’re very young, but we don’t always do very good training, that’s the difference.” With Jones, he said, it was more about quantity than quality. “Eddie made us train for a short time but at a very high intensity.”There’s a clear echo here of another of the characters in Whiting’s book, the coach Don Blasingame, who was one of the first foreigners to manage a top Japanese baseball team. Blasingame had spent 14 years in Japan as a player and coach when he took over at the Hanshin Tigers in 1979, but it still didn’t work. Blasingame reckoned one of the big problems was that his players were training so hard that they were getting tired in the back half of the season. Just like Jones he told his team it wasn’t how long they practiced that mattered, but how well. He cut down spring camp and practice sessions to half the amount the other teams were doing. The Japanese players hated it. Blasingame was fired after a season and a half.That was 40 years ago though, and this Japan team have managed to fold together the traditional Japanese way of doing things with what Jones and his successor Jamie Joseph learned in Australia and New Zealand. The doryoku is still there. You can see it in their fitness levels, and their frantic speed of play. But their game is about more than hard work now. There are some powerful emotional currents pulling this Japanese team through this World Cup. Joseph wasn’t exaggerating when he said his team are being “driven and supported by the whole country”. More than 60 million people tuned in to watch them beat Scotland. They must appreciate the doryoku, but maybe they’re learning, too, that effort is never enough in itself. Whatever you call it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82a10213e963216e67729e85b66069b738c27f82/574_633_6001_3600/master/6001.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ffae413a7377763b237e3279c9b1f828","title":"emoblackthot twitter paper magazine","story":"When Isaiah Hickland revealed he was behind the popular @emoblackthot Twitter account, fans felt scammed and pushback was swiftThe Twitter account @emoblackthot was a virtual therapist and best friend for over 170,000 followers – many of them people of color andor queer. She would post gentle reminders to wear sunscreen every day and stay hydrated, rave about the latest songs she was obsessed with and share her struggles with anxiety and depression. If followers were experiencing anxiety attacks, @emoblackthot was there to talk them through it over DMs.On a platform overflowing with trolls and angry callouts, @emoblackthot stood out through her promotion of self-care and vulnerability and, as a consequence, quickly became viral. There was only one problem: she was not the person she claimed to be. Until last week, it was commonly accepted that the person behind @emoblackthot was a black woman. @emoblackthot would post about alleviating her period cramps with chamomile tea, the unfair beauty standards placed on darker-skinned black women and styling her kinky 4C hair. The posts felt like they belonged to a black woman who was confident, fashionable and a tastemaker. (At one point, followers genuinely theorized that the account was run by Normani, a fast-rising R\u0026ampBpop singer, or the megastar Rihanna.)Sometimes, @emoblackthot would tweet about experiencing financial troubles and ask for donations through the Cash App. Followers, many of them black women, would happily oblige, thinking they were giving their money to a fellow black woman in need.A few months ago, @emoblackthot began teasing the reveal of her identity. She shared concerns that no one would “like” the real person behind the account. Fans quickly assuaged her fears. “Do the identity reveal,” one follower replied to a since-deleted tweet. “The opportunities that will come your way would blow your mind! i know it seems scary but trust the process. it’ll work in your favor in the end.”Last Friday morning, the reveal came. @emoblackthot chose something big and dramatic: a photoshoot and interview with the fashion magazine Paper.@emoblackthot was not Normani. Or Rihanna. Or even a black woman.“I did not envision ever revealing myself,” Hickland said to the  over email about his decision to come out. “I wanted to deactivate the account without explanation and let it die, but people relied on it for their own reasons and I didn’t want to not give them an explanation as to why the account was gone.”Hickland said he quickly received a slew of threatening and angry messages – including racial and homophobic slurs – after the reveal, which led to him deleting @emoblackthot and his personal accounts. “I fully expected to be held accountable for my wrongdoings,” he said over email. “However, I didn’t expect the amount of vitriol, lies, and hate being spread and sent my way. I feel like my life is over.” Hickland said his mental health had taken a severe hit from the online attacks.In under an hour, @emoblackthot had gone from being one of the most beloved accounts on “Black Twitter” to one of the most hated. Even popular figures were brought into the mix. After interacting with and following @emoblackthot, the R\u0026ampB singer Kehlani was forced to clarify (in a since deleted tweet) how much she knew about Hickland. “I was asked for advice on his financial situation at his day job,” she posted. “Once he told me who he was, i told him he owed it to his followers to be honest about who he was … not a publication.”Soon, Twitter users began filling in the details. They shared screenshots of him sending messages, as @emoblackthot, in private group chats meant to be exclusively for black women. The reveal made everyone involved ask who we should and shouldn’t trust on the internet.Sandra Song said she had not been aware of Hickland’s presence in private group chats when she interviewed him for Paper and found the new allegations worrisome. “Throughout our conversation, Isaiah continually emphasized that this was him coming completely clean, so we all assumed that he was being totally transparent with us,” she said.Hickland said he had nothing but good intentions with @emoblackthot.“The account began as a burner account of self-expression for me,” he said. (He denies theories that he purchased the account from someone else, possibly an actual black woman, only a few weeks ago.) Hickland originally envisioned the account as a place for him to talk about bisexuality, mental health and social injustice without worrying about ramifications in his personal life.But as the account’s popularity grew, and so did his financial troubles, Hickland toyed with the idea of using it as a launching pad for a career in the entertainment industry. He pretended to be his own manager and pitched himself to industry contacts “to see if anyone would take a chance on me”. He was desperate: “I’m in an extremely dire situation and I’ve been trying to put myself in a position to get myself out of it.” (He said any donations he received from followers were used for preparing for job interviews and on life expenses while unemployed.)Pretending to be someone else on the internet is nothing new. In many ways, digital masquerade is built into how we use the internet – whether it’s blatant catfishing, or using a picture of a K-pop singer as our avatar, or only showing the pretty parts of our lives. Social media allows for our identities to become hyper-visible, but it also allows us to adopt new ones.Dr Crystal Abidin, an anthropologist with a special focus on internet culture, said the reason an account like @emoblackthot – with its simple reminders to drink water and eat food – was able to thrive on Twitter was because of how angry content on the platform has become: “The content is novel in a space that is already so depressed.” She said influencers who place an emphasis on self-care particularly appealed to marginalized communities (as with @emoblackthot’s black female following) because the stressors of everyday life ring true. “The culture of self-care has at its ethos the feeling of being oppressed by mainstream culture.”Digital masquerade is nothing new, Abidin points out. From Lonelygirl15 to A Gay Girl In Damascus to two TikTok teens faking a gay prom proposal, there have been plenty of faked viral moments.Hickland said it was likely the @emoblackthot persona was dead forever: “For now, I just plan on detoxing, doing a lot of self reflection, finally starting therapy and figuring out the next steps to attempt to make things right.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a9249df978a95e4075ac9035425e8c3313964aa/101_264_1990_1194/master/1990.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5d0c56213c0b891310d6cc944eb93a43","title":"native american canoes circle alcatraz to honor 50 years since occupation in pictures","story":"Native American tribes from up and down the west coast came together in San Francisco Bay to celebrate Indigenous Peoples’ Day on 14 October.

On 13 October, Kurdish leaders agreed to allow Syrian regime forces to enter some cities to protect them from being captured by\u0026nbspTurkey\u0026nbspand its allies. The deal effectively hands over control of huge swathes of the region to Damascus.That leaves north-eastern\u0026nbspSyria\u0026nbspided between Syrian regime forces, Syrian opposition militia and their Turkish allies, and areas still held by the SDF – for now.Before the SDF was formed in 2015, the Kurds had created their own militias who mobilised during the Syrian civil war to defend Kurdish cities and villages and carve out what they hoped would eventually at least become a semi-autonomous province.\u0026nbspIn late 2014, the\u0026nbspKurds were struggling\u0026nbspto fend off an Islamic State siege of Kobane, a major city under their control. With US support, including arms and airstrikes, the Kurds managed to beat back Isis and went on to win a string of victories against the radical militant group. Along the way the fighters absorbed non-Kurdish groups, changed their name to the SDF and grew to include 60,000 soldiers.For years, Turkey has watched the growing ties between the US and SDF with alarm. Significant numbers of the Kurds in the SDF were also members of the People’s Protection Units (YPG), an offshoot of the Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK) that has fought an insurgency against the Turkish state for more than 35 years in which as many as 40,000 people have died. The PKK initially called for independence and now demands greater autonomy for Kurds inside\u0026nbspTurkey.Turkey claims the PKK has continued to wage war on the Turkish state, even as it has assisted in the fight against Isis. The PKK is listed as a terrorist group by Turkey, the US, the UK, Nato and others and this has proved awkward for the US and its allies, who have chosen to downplay the SDF’s links to the PKK, preferring to focus on their shared objective of defeating Isis.Turkey aims firstly to push the SDF away from its border, creating a 20-mile (32km) buffer zone that would have been jointly patrolled by Turkish and US troops until Trump’s\u0026nbsprecent announcement\u0026nbspthat American soldiers would withdraw from the region.Erdoğan has also said he would seek to relocate more than 1 million Syrian refugees in this “safe zone”, both removing them from his country (where their presence has started to create a backlash) and complicating the demographic mix in what he fears could become an autonomous Kurdish state on his border.Nearly 11,000 Isis fighters, including almost 2,000 foreigners, and tens of thousands of their wives and children, are being held in detention camps and hastily fortified prisons across north-eastern Syria.SDF leaders have warned they cannot guarantee the security of these prisoners if they are forced to redeploy their forces to the frontlines of a war against Turkey. They also fear Isis could use the chaos of war to mount attacks to free their fighters or reclaim territory.On 11 October, it was reported that at least five detained Isis fighters had escaped a prison in the region. Two days later, 750 foreign women affiliated to Isis and their children managed to break out of a secure annex in the Ain Issa camp for displaced people, according to SDF officials.It is unclear which detention sites the SDF still controls and the status of the prisoners inside.The strategically located town of Manbij, a US base for three years, remains a major military target for Turkey, its president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, said on Tuesday. Shelling between Turkish proxy Syrian rebel forces and Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) positions continued at intervals throughout the day, although there have been no reports yet of fighting inside the city itself.Moscow’s special envoy to Syria, Alexander Lavrentyev, said on Tuesday Russia opposed the Turkish operation and would not allow direct clashes between Nato member Turkey’s troops and Syrian forces. The two sides stopped short of a direct confrontation when Ankara first put boots on the ground in Syria in 2016 to seize the area around Jarablus from Isis, in the process hampering the expansion of the SDF.Erdoğan spoke to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, on Tuesday about the need to prevent armed clashes between Turkish and Syrian regime troops. According to the Kremlin, Putin invited the Turkish leader for a working visit to Moscow “in the coming days” and Erdoğan accepted.As Putin exercised his enhanced influence in Syria, Washington was scrambling to limit the damage of Donald Trump’s acquiescence in the Turkish offensive. After announcing sanctions that critics described as ineffective, Trump dispatched key figures to Ankara including his vice president, Mike Pence, the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, national security adviser, Robert O’Brien, and special envoy on Syria, James Jeffrey.A White House statement said Pence would “reiterate President Trump’s commitment to maintain punishing economic sanctions on Turkey until a resolution is reached.”Erdoğan has so far refused to ease military operations, boasting on Tuesday that his troops had seized 1,000 sq km (400 sq miles) of territory from the SDF, an alliance that Ankara has long maintained is an offshoot of the militant Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK).The SDF was America’s ground partner in the five-year campaign against Isis and lost 11,000 troops in the long battle. Trump has attempted to rebut accusations even from his most loyal supporters that the move amounted to a betrayal.Despite the prospect of losing the area’s semi-autonomous status, Kurdish officials struck a Russian-brokered deal with Damascus on Sunday for reinforcements to protect Kurdish-held border positions. There are unconfirmed reports that talks are still under way to implement a Russian-enforced no-fly zone over the area.Syrian state media showed residents cheering the arrival of troops loyal to Assad in Manbij and Ain Issa, waving flags and throwing rice before the path of soldiers. The regime flag was also briefly raised above the famous clocktower square in Islamic State’s former capital of Raqqa on Monday night, a source in the city said, before it was taken down again by the SDF.Heavy fighting in the border towns of Tel Abyad and Ras al-Ayn as well as airstrikes and shelling of other Kurdish-controlled roads and towns has displaced 160,000 people from their homes and killed at least 165 civilians. SDF counterattacks over the border have left 20 Turkish civilians dead, including a Syrian baby.Erdoğan said that despite the threat of US and EU sanctions, as well as European arms embargos, Ankara would press on with the creation of a proposed 20-mile-deep (32km) “safe zone” on its border stretching from Manbij to Iraq, in which Turkey wants to resettle up to 2 million Syrian refugees. Turkey denies the resettlement of mainly Arab Syrians from other parts of the country would amount to demographic engineering.The offensive has been widely condemned for precipitating a humanitarian crisis and risking the return of Isis, after about 750 people with links to the militant group took advantage of the chaos on Sunday to escape from a Kurdish-run detention camp. Footage of Syrian rebel proxies summarily executing nine Kurdish civilians on a major highway have also prompted allegations of war crimes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d96284ece6ab5f8ea750f91a374a1d90c62367bc/128_0_3736_2242/master/3736.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=976fe4ec349993027ef5ece5e9d014a1","title":"six freed after years living in dutch cellar waiting for end of time","story":"Six adults removed from house and man, 58, arrestedA group described by local media as a man and his adult children have been found after spending several years living in the cellar of remote farmhouse in the north-eastern Dutch province of Drenthe “waiting for the end of time”.The group of six were discovered after the oldest son, 25, visited a local bar, the Kastelein cafe. On the first occasion, 10 days ago, he “ordered and drank five beers on his own”, the owner, Chris Westerbeek, told broadcaster RTV Drenthe. When the man reappeared last Sunday, he “looked confused”, Westerbeek said. “He was unkempt, with long tangled hair. We got talking. He said he had run away and needed help, and that he had never been to school. Then we called the police.”There was no indication of how long they had lived there or the whereabouts of their mother. The Algemeen Dagblad (AD) newspaper reported that police were considering the possibility that she may have died and been buried on the property.The bar owner told the local Dagblad van het Noorden newspaper that the man had said he had younger brothers and sisters living in the cellar, they all “wanted to end the way they were living”, and he had not been outside for nine years.Six adults were removed and were being taken care of, police confirmed, while a 58-year-old odd-job man who was renting the farmhouse was arrested after refusing to cooperate with their inquiry.Named by local media as Josef B, he is not the father of the young adults, according to police.Several neighbours in the village of 4,000 inhabitants told RTV Drenthe they had only ever seen a man who drove an old Volvo car on the property and assumed he lived there alone, although one said they had seen young children there some years ago and several reported hearing noises from the farm even when the man was absent.One neighbour told the Telegraaf newspaper that the man spoke German and was known in the village as “the Austrian”. The man, who reportedly moved in nine years ago, was “very sharp”, the neighbour said. “You only needed to go near the place and he’d send you packing. He watched everything through binoculars.” While Dutch media said the group were a family, a police spokeswoman refused to confirm the exact relationship or that the young adults’ father was among them, saying the investigation was ongoing.“Our primary concern is for the family members,” she said. “What exactly happened in the farmhouse is still very unclear. We are exploring all possible scenarios.”Citing unnamed sources, RTV Drenthe said that police had found a hidden staircase leading to the family’s hiding place behind a cupboard in the living room. The 58-year-old father was bedridden having suffered a stroke some years ago, it said. The children were aged between 16 and 25.Dutch media said the group appeared to have had little or no contact with the outside world and lived a largely self-sufficient life, apparently growing their own vegetables and keeping a goat and geese.The farmhouse owners, Klaas and Alida Rooze, told AD: “We knew absolutely nothing of this. We had rented the house for years to an inidual and now we learn that a man was living there with children. We have no idea who this can be.”The local mayor, Roger de Groot, told a press conference the situation was extraordinary and that he could give few further details. “For the moment, the police have a lot of unanswered questions,” he said, adding that most of the family appeared not to be registered with local authorities.Police had “assessed the situation and found a number of rooms with makeshift furnishings where a family was living an isolated existence,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fafaed6d8c2c2de39fc5c14680095a872a249ba0/0_233_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af2c5fa3c4f1d5eebeb522b8809d8830","title":"kim jong un jockeys for attention with horse ride up sacred mountain","story":"North Korean leader’s heavily publicised trip up Mount Paektu on white horse could be sign of a big decisionKim Jong-un is planning “a great operation to strike the world with wonder”, North Korean state media has said, after he found inspiration during a heavily publicised horse ride to the top of the nation’s most sacred mountain.In a series of photos released by state news agency KCNA, Kim is seen riding a large white horse through snowy fields and woods on Mount Paektu, the spiritual homeland of the Kim dynasty.“His march on horseback in Mt Paektu is a great event of weighty importance in the history of the Korean revolution,” KCNA said.“Having witnessed the great moments of his thinking atop Mt Paektu, all the officials accompanying him were convinced with overflowing emotion and joy that there will be a great operation to strike the world with wonder again and make a step forward in the Korean revolution.”It was unclear what the operation might involve, but Kim has often made trips to the sacred mountain at times of major policy endeavours.Analysts say the symbolism underscores North Korea standing up to international sanctions and pressure over its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programmes.“This is a statement, symbolic of defiance,” said Joshua Pollack, a North Korea expert at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in California. “The pursuit of sanctions relief is over. Nothing is made explicit here, but it starts to set new expectations about the coming course of policy for 2020.”In late 2017, Kim visited Mount Paektu days after North Korea launched its largest intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), and weeks before he made a key New Year speech in which he opened the door to engagement with South Korea.Last year, Kim took South Korean president Moon Jae-in to the top of the mountain as part of a historic summit.Since then, relations have cooled and Kim has said he will wait only until the end of the year for the US to soften its stance in denuclearisation negotiations before North Korea pursues an unspecified new path forward.Further afield, Kim’s latest trip sparked a raft of comparisons to western books, movies and TV series, including Game of Thrones, Lord of the Rings and The Chronicles of Narnia.Several experts said much of the rhetoric in the KCNA report revolves around the economy, and they suspect North Korea may soon conduct a space launch. That would enable the North to show its economic and technological power in a less provocative way than by testing an ICBM.Rachel Minyoung Lee, an analyst with NK News, a website that monitors North Korea, said: “The report in Korean has characterised Kim’s climb up to Mount Paektu on horseback as a new ‘myth’, and that, together with the images of him on a white horse, appear to have been designed to create maximum propaganda effect, which I believe media will play up in the days to come.”"},{"url":null,"title":"college open","story":"Open days give you a great chance to gauge how good a fit your course and college choice will bePreparation can help you take full advantage of open day opportunities"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4051616.1571160113!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"leaving cert should have greater focus on work experience","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSenior cycle education in secondary school could have a more rigorous vocational dimension, according to an OECD analysis.The Leaving Cert should have a more rigorous vocational focus and give real work-based experience to students, according to a review of senior cycle by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).The findings of the Paris-based organisation, which represents 36 wealthy nations worldwide, are to be discussed at a conference in Croke Park on Wednesday. The forum will deal with the development of senior cycle education .The State’s advisory body on the curriculum – the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) – has been conducting a review of the senior cycle in consultation with thousands of students and hundreds of teachers, parents and other stakeholders.OECD representatives have also been conducting a policy assessment of senior cycle education in Ireland for the past 18 months.ExperienceThe organisation’s report is based on participation in the NCCA’s national seminars and visits to schools to listen to the perspectives of teachers, students and school leaders.Senior OECD analyst Beatriz Pont will present some of their preliminary findings based on this work at Wednesday’s conference. She said Ireland is one of the “high-performing education systems” across OECD countries.“Our analysis of the current senior cycle shows a range of strengths, including high levels of public trust,” she said.However, she said the same analysis suggests some areas in which senior cycle could improve.“For example, stakeholders expressed their concern about not having a more rigorous and attractive vocational segment in senior cycle, one that gives real work-based experience to students and that is delivered in close co-ordination with employers,” she said.In relation to the review process, Ms Pont said the tailored approach to engage stakeholders in the senior cycle review is an “asset for the development of senior cycle . . . The NCCA succeeded in designing and carrying out an inclusive review process, collecting a range of perspectives that can enrich senior cycle.”VocationalThe OECD’s observation on the potential for greater vocational routes chimes with findings from the NCCA’s consultations so far.An interim report published by the council earlier this year found an appetite for the structure of senior cycle to be made more flexible, with exams spaced out and a much broader array of assessment methods such as projects, teamwork and portfolios.It also found a desire among groups who were consulted to introduce successful elements from transition year, such as work experience or life skills, into senior cycle.A public consultation on the review of the senior is continuing until November 1st, 2019. Iniduals and organisations are being invited to provide feedback through online surveys or making written submissions (ncca.ie).The review so far has included consultations with 41 schools, about 2,500 students and hundreds of teachers and parents, as well as feedback with other stakeholders.ReviewThe Association of Secondary Teachers Ireland (ASTI), meanwhile, has warned that major curriculum change at senior cycle level should not take place until there is a comprehensive review of the impact of junior cycle changes.ASTI president Deirdre McDonald says additional work generated by junior cycle changes is just one of a range of new demands on teachers in recent years.“Many teachers are overwhelmed by their workload. This situation is unsustainable and has to change,” she said.Against the backdrop of the senior cycle review, the union has commissioned independent research which concludes that major reforms are “not appropriate” in the near future due to factors such as the lack of capacity at school level, uncertainty about the outcomes of junior cycle changes and a “deterioration” in teachers’ working conditions."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Irish Kidney Association chief to address issue before Oireachtas health committeeIncrease of 30c will only be introducted in event of orderly Brexit, D\u0026aacuteil hearsAudit to examine oversight procedures board governance and fraud-reporting systemsOne in three \u0026lsquonot that worried\u0026rsquo about climate change, Ipsos MRBI poll findsConcern expressed over lack of \u0026lsquorigorous and attractive\u0026rsquo vocational segment in senior cycle\u0026lsquoBehind-closed-doors\u0026rsquo meetings with Government will explore US agendaVacuum being filled with far-right \u0026lsquoinfiltrators\u0026rsquo, particularly online, says McMahonOughterard locals \u0026lsquoused\u0026rsquo by outside elements pursuing political agenda, retired judge saysWaiting lists for children and adults with intellectual disabilities growing, says CopeRespondents split over willingness to pay more for fossil fuels to tackle problemNicholas Keogh made protected disclosure about alleged collusion with drug dealerDublin north and Cork-Kerry waiting lists are \u0026lsquoparticularly appalling\u0026rsquo says ShortallDonohoe told Harris in August he wanted ban on new medicines for remainder of yearSenior sources say the prospects of an accord are \u0026lsquolooking more promising\u0026rsquoDail considers law for new parental leave measure in addition to existing provisionsFoodcloud call on Irish manufacturers to become partners in donating foodVaradkar says progress made but \u0026lsquounclear\u0026rsquo if deal will be struck tonightCurrent ad-hoc approach not desirable or sustainable, public-service pay body saysRosalind Ferguson suffered PTSD after her car was pushed by 42-ton lorry, court hears"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4051707.1571167176!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"derry woman considers un complaint over uk citizenship ruling","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEmma DeSouza and her US born husband Jake.Ms DeSouza is considering further legal action. Photograph: Niall CarsonPA WireAn Irish woman who lost a ruling identifying her as British by birth under UK law is exploring whether she can lodge a complaint to the UN over a breach of the 1998 Belfast Agreement.Co Derry woman Emma DeSouza, an Irish citizen, won a case against the UK Home Office in 2017 after it deemed her British through her birth in Northern Ireland following an application from her US-born husband for a residence card.She argued that the 1998 peace agreement had allowed her to identify as British, Irish or both. On Monday an immigration tribunal sided with the UK Home Office in an appeal on the earlier ruling. She plans to appeal the ruling to the Court of Appeal and, if required, to the Supreme Court. Ms DeSouza has accused the British government of failing to comply with the Belfast Agreement by failing to legislate for the peace treaty in domestic UK law over the past two decades and to protect the birthright of people in Northern Ireland to be Irish. She lost her case on the basis of a 1981 UK nationality law.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar backed her case. He told the Dáil that he believed British citizenship laws are “out of step” with the 1998 accord “making a distinction between how people identify as to their citizenship”.Mr Varadkar said the agreement was “eloquent” on the right of people in Northern Ireland to be British, Irish or both and to be accepted as such. “That is the spirit and letter of the Good Friday agreement,” he said.The Derry woman said she was examining whether she could lodge a complaint to the UN over her fundamental rights to self-determination and to be free from discrimination.“I am starting to look into whether I can as an Irish citizen lodge a complaint to the UN and I believe I can as an Irish citizen,” she said.She referred to the complaints made by two Irish women who took cases to the UN Human Rights Committee claiming their rights had been infringed by Ireland’s ban, since lifted, on abortion. Ms DeSouza believes that her case “could go all the way” to the European Court of Justice given that the UK government could be denying her access to EU rights as an Irish citizen after Brexit. Bilateral meetingMr Varadkar said he would raise the case with UK prime minister Boris Johnson later this week and that Tánaiste Simon Coveney would speak to Northern Ireland Secretary of State Julian Smith about it. The Taoiseach said the British government had agreed to “review and resolve the issue” in line with the letter and spirt of the Belfast Agreement. London has yet to publish its review of the issue. “This judgment appears to make a distinction between identifying as British or Irish as opposed to being a citizen and that is a misreading, in our view, of the Good Friday agreement,” he said.Les Allamby, chief commissioner of the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, urged the UK government to publish its “promised review” and to implement a Bill of rights for Northern Irish people or “to effectively incorporate the intentions of the Good Friday agreement into UK law”.“We shouldn’t have to wait for the judges to decide this in the Court of Appeal or possibly even in the Supreme Court eventually, which will take a very long period of time,” he said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4051724.1571168083!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"emma desouza you can t get on with your life","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEmma DeSouza and her husband Jake.

Photograph: Niall CarsonPA WireEmma DeSouza and her US-born husband Jake thought someone at the UK Home Office had made a mistake when it refused him a residence card in 2016 because she had not renounced her British citizenship.Their application had been lodged on the basis that Emma, from Magherafelt in Co Derry, was an Irish national, as is her right under the 1998 Belfast Agreement, an international peace treaty.The Home Office said she first had to renounce her status as a British citizen and could then reapply.“Until that status is renounced, she is as a matter of fact a British citizen,” the Home Office told him in its September 2016 letter.“We thought it was a clerical error and it would be quickly overturned because everyone in Northern Ireland could be Irish or British or both,” the Derry woman said.An Irish woman being automatically identified as British was at odds, they felt, with the 1998 agreement protecting the Derry woman’s birthright to be Irish.It was not an error by the Home Office.“We just felt that they couldn’t get away with that and that nobody else should have to go through it. The whole thing just shouldn’t be happening,” she told The .‘Devastated’Four years after first applying, a UK immigration tribunal this week backed the Home Office. The couple spoke of being “devastated” at the ruling and the “personal cost” of the long-running legal battle.The Home Office had Jake DeSouza’s passport for almost two years and warned that if he left the country his application would be void.“The biggest loss will always remain that we did not get to see my husband’s grandmother before she passed away. We had three months of her on her deathbed,” she said.“We knew she wasn’t going to make it. Over those three months we tried desperately to get Jake out of the country.”The case has been “all consuming” in their lives, she said, with “the impending doom of another court case somewhere in the distance”.“You can’t get on with your life and be a normal married couple,” said Emma.Despite the toll taken on the couple, they are determined to continue fighting their case.“When you have invested four years, it is definitely not something that you are going to walk away from,” she said.DeSouza feels that this week’s ruling sets a precedent that “rewrites” a key provision of the Belfast Agreement and could restrict the rights of people in Northern Ireland post-Brexit.“There are all kinds of knock-on effects from that judgment that really put us in a position where we have no choice but to appeal it,” she said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4051237.1571147519!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"explainer what is the emma desouza case about","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEmma DeSouza and her US born husband Jake . Photograph: Niall CarsonPA WireWhat is the Emma DeSouza case about?It concerns the right of people in Northern Ireland to be considered Irish from birth under the terms of the 1998 Belfast Agreement, also known as the Good Friday agreement, the international accord that props up the Northern Ireland peace process. What does the agreement say about this?It recognises the birthright of people in Northern Ireland to identify and to be accepted as Irish or British, or both, as they may chose, and accordingly confirms that their right to hold both British and Irish citizenship is accepted by both the British and Irish governments and would not be affected by any future change in the status of Northern Ireland.Who is Emma DeSouza?Emma DeSouza is from Magherafelt in Co Derry and applied for a residence card for her US-born husband Jake to live and work in Northern Ireland in 2015 - the same year they were married in Belfast. She identified herself as an Irish citizen in the application.Why did she bring a legal case?She took the case after the UK Home Office rejected the application on the basis that it considered DeSouza a British citizen because she was born in Northern Ireland. She was told she could reapply identifying herself as British or renounce her UK citizenship and reapply as an Irish citizen. She claimed she never considered herself British so she could not renounce a citizenship she never had. She later said that she had “discovered that my lifelong Irish identity is evidently considered secondary to an unclaimed British identity.” What was this week’s ruling about?DeSouza lost an appeal taken by the Home Office against an earlier immigration tribunal ruling that initially found in her favour. The First Tier Immigration Tribunal ruled in 2017 that she was an “Irish national only who has only ever been such.” The Home Office appealed this decision to the Upper Tribunal and won this week. What does the ruling mean?It means that people born in Northern Ireland remain British citizens under UK law even if they identify as Irish. The UK government’s lawyers argued successfully that the British National Act 1981, not law flowing from the 1998 Belfast Agreement, covered this. But does this not contravene the 1998 Belfast Agreement?DeSouza argues that it does. She has accused the British government of failing to honour the spirit of a commitment in the 1998 peace agreement that people born in Northern Ireland could identify as British, Irish or both.How has anomaly arisen between the law and the peace agreement?DeSouza along with human rights campaigners and commentators, legal and otherwise, in Northern Ireland have argued that successive British governments have failed to legislate to give full effect to the peace agreement.Does any of this have anything to do with Brexit?It is a separate matter but related to Brexit given that the ruling comes against the backdrop of uncertainty around how Northern Ireland citizens will be treated after the UK leaves the EU given that people in Northern Ireland who identify as Irish, in turn, consider themselves EU citizens. DeSouza and human rights advocates in Northern Ireland claim that Brexit complicates matters because the automatic conferral of British citizenship on Irish citizens could be used to restrict and remove their access to EU rights and entitlements.

File photograph: Nick BradshawA majority of voters believe climate change is the most serious issue facing the world – but they are not convinced about carbon tax increases, and a substantial minority are sceptical about the urgency of the problem. The findings are from the latest Ipsos MRBI opinion poll, taken among 1,200 voters from Friday to Sunday.More than half of all voters (55 per cent) said they agree that climate change “is the most serious issue facing the world”, with 36 per cent disagreeing with the statement.A similar percentage of voters (54 per cent) said they were prepared to reduce their standard of living to combat climate change. However, when asked specifically if they were willing to pay more for fossil fuels such as petrol and diesel to tackle climate change, almost half of voters (48 per cent) said no. And voters do not want the Government to spend money on climate change at the expense of public services – 56 per cent disagree with the proposal to spend more money on climate change and less on public services. And just one-third of voters said they were not “that worried” about climate change.Asked about the statement “I don’t think climate change will be as bad as people say so I’m not that worried about it” 57 per cent disagreed, while 33 per cent agreed. Voters were offered a series of statements and asked whether they agreed or disagreed.On “I am okay with reducing my standard of living in order to help tackle climate change”, 54 per cent agreed and 36 per cent disagreed. However, when asked about specific measures – such as increases in fossil fuel prices – almost half said they disagreed with the idea. Those most convinced of the urgency of climate change tend to be younger, urban and better-off voters. Those less likely to be worried about it – and so less convinced of the need for action – tended to be older, rural, less well-off voters. Farmers were most sceptical about action on climate. Among the parties, Sinn Féin voters were the least supportive."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4051809.1571175899!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord westport to turlough road eclipses brexit as day s big reveal","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLeo Varadkar rushed across after his session in the House. Why, with all he has on his plate, he felt the need to be present at a bread and butter ministerial event announcing a road-building project in Mayo was a mystery. Photograph: Niall CarsonPA WireIt was all kicking off on Tuesday afternoon.Bloomberg reported from Brussels that negotiators were “closing in” on a draft Brexit deal. This nugget dropped minutes before Leo Varadkar began closing in on the Italian Room in Government Buildings with a view to holding forth.The Tánaiste, fresh from a meeting of EU foreign ministers, had paid a flying home-to-brief-the-boss visit and was now closing in on Belfast on his way to yet another Brexit meeting.Back at base, the domestic press corps was joined by representatives of the international media, wondering if Leo Varadkar would announce a deal. Closure, of sorts, at long last.“Key Brexiteers have gone into Number 10 . . . now expecting a press conference any minute from Varadkar as well . . . for what, we don’t know yet,” tweeted the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg in London.But our reporter Fiach Kelly was on the spot in Dublin with the answer.“The N5 Westport to Turlough road!”There are announcements, and there are announcements and then there’s news that the dual carriageway from Turlough, outside Castlebar, to Westport has been given the green light. Now that’s an announcement.Especially if your name is Michael Ring.Everyone was pure weak with the excitement, and that’s not including the Minister for Mayo, who was reportedly on the verge of passing out earlier on but managed nonetheless to put in a superhuman effort to show up for the big reveal.It wasn’t much of a reveal because Ringo was already up on the social media starring in a video shot on the side of a busy road with him bellowing above the traffic about the fantastic new road while avoiding being mown down by a lorry.The Taoiseach also let the cat out of the bag in the Dáil, announcing the commencement of the new Westport to Turlough road as one of his Government’s many triumphs on the transport front.As a young country, he said, Ireland doesn’t have the infrastructure of places like London or Paris. But “things are now really kicking off in terms of transport investment”.Finally kicking offWhich is great, but would his later appearance at Government Buildings be a sign that things were finally kicking off in the Brexit department?The media had been lured to Merrion Street with a mildly enticing “Government to make significant infrastructure announcement” email, no further details attached, followed by the real draw: “An Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, will attend if scheduling permits.”Where did we see that before? Why, last week, when a similarly vague missive issued with the promise: “The Taoiseach may also attend subject to his availability.”Funnily enough, it transpired Leo was available last week and, luckily, he was available this week too, which was convenient as the rest of Europe wanted to hear his latest take on the evolving Brexit situation.It being a Tuesday, Leo had to rush across from Dáil Éireann after his usual session in the House. Why, with all he has on his plate, he felt the need to be present at a bread-and-butter ministerial event announcing the green light for a road-building project in Mayo was a mystery.And sure, if there are rumours of a general election in the offing to be denied with gung-ho sincerity while blaming Fianna Fáil for fuelling the speculation in the first instance, why not do that as well?Meanwhile, Simon Coveney was in the chamber for Leaders’ Questions. The poor man needed the rest.Cool bro handshakeA few hours earlier he was in Luxembourg doing interviews and shootin’ the breeze with his homie Michel Barnier (check out the cool bro handshake between the two). He returned to Dublin later in the morning and briefed the Taoiseach on the Brexit state of play.Following his brief respite in the chamber and a sobering hour listening to the real issues – “It is a fact that it has been raining in Kerry for at least seven weeks – Danny Healy-Rae” – the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs hit the road again. This time for Belfast.It was all kicking off.Simon comes over as a very meticulous and thorough inidual. One imagines when he briefs somebody on a particular issue, he leaves nothing out. And there is nothing he doesn’t know about Brexit. Leo will have been well briefed before he left to go north.So once the announcement about the new road was out of the way – Minister for Transport Shane “Winston Churchtown” Ross was most gracious about it in the few minutes he got to speak and Ring was so delighted it rendered him uncharacteristically subdued – the questions began. It was all about Brexit and related questions about a Brexit-induced general election.Apart from being cautiously optimistic about the ongoing negotiations, the Taoiseach had very little to say. But he was happy to stand in front of the cameras and say it.“In terms of Brexit negotiations I’ve a confession to make. Tuesday is a pretty crazy day and I’ve spent the morning at Cabinet and the afternoon in the chamber so I’ve to go back to the office now and get a briefing from Brussels.”Poor Simon. Talk about a kick in the teeth. Then again, it was the very same last week when Leo made an unexpected appearance at a minor gig. He got out the message that while he hadn’t seen what were called “non-papers” from the UK side, he wasn’t happy about them.Positivity lineThis time, while not knowing very much, he still got out the positivity line.And perish the thought he was going to this announcement because an election is in the offing.“I’m confident we will have many more announcements like this before we go to the polls.” Every Tuesday, for starters, by the look of it.Ring was delighted. Speaking as somebody who “was born and reared” in the west of Ireland he was very happy to see this new stretch of the N5 getting the go ahead. “For 25 years I’ve been lobbying for this road.”“There’s a lot of happy people in Mayo today,” he declared.Not least Enda Kenny. He should be happiest of the lot, given that he announced the project as part of the six-year Capital Plan in 2015 and made sure to ring-fence the money before leaving office.The Taoiseach name-checked him in the supplied press release, but he wasn’t mentioned at the press conference. On the big day, after all his effort, the big announcement went ahead without him.Enda was in Tokyo when it finally kicked off."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Carrie Lam\u0026rsquos inability to deliver address marks major climbdown for chief executive15 people missing in aftermath of violent storm that hit central and eastern JapanXi Jinping cautions protesters and \u0026lsquoexternal forces that support the splitting of China\u0026rsquoStorm kills at least 40 and leaves large areas of central and eastern Japan under waterJapanese city takes \u0026lsquounprecedented scale\u0026rsquo warning seriously but escapes worst elementsFootage shows shoppers screaming, some injured as police charge shopping centreNearly 500,000 homes are without power as soldiers are used to save stranded residentsTokyo hit with heaviest rain and winds in 60 years as typhoon approaches landfallHigh proportion of under 18s detained during recent protests sparks further angerTech giant acts in wake of harsh criticism from Chinese media and online platformsHKmap.live compiles information on vehicles, tear gas, armed police and clash sitesClimbers ignore calls of indigenous people to stay off what they consider a sacred monolithPolice fire tear gas, baton-charged crowds as demonstrators throw bricks, petrol bombsPark rangers helped lead two elephants from ravine and will now monitor their conditionShops and city\u0026rsquos entire rail network closed on Saturday following overnight violenceJudge fires shot after claiming he came under pressure to change murder case verdictBoy (14) shot in leg in one of many clashes to erupt in beleaguered city after ban beginsOnce widely praised for order and efficiency, city is now bitterly ided by violence and politicsGovernment to invoke colonial-era law to ban use of face masks in effort to restore orderPyongyang hails \u0026lsquosignificant achievement\u0026rsquo before meeting with US officials on Saturday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4051618.1571161771!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ireland s diplomatic tour de force praised as macron prepares for summit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEuropean Council president Donald Tusk and French president Emmanuel Macron at the Élysée Palace in Paris on Monday. Photograph: Christophe Petit TessonEPAThe Irish Government has been praised in Paris for its conduct throughout the Brexit saga.“Dublin in a position of strength,” said a headline in Le Monde following Taoiseach Leo Varadkar’s meeting with prime minister Boris Johnson last Thursday.The UK repeatedly made the mistake of trying to “bilateralise” Brexit negotiations, an adviser to French president Emmanuel Macron said on Tuesday, while pointing out that EU unity did not preclude contacts between political leaders. For example, Macron spoke to Johnson on the telephone on Tuesday morning.“When Boris Johnson and Leo Varadkar saw each other a few days ago, Ireland played the European game perfectly,” the adviser at the Élysée said. “Mr Johnson made political overtures, and it was referred to the 27 for negotiations. It’s not Mr Varadkar or the Irish team negotiating with the British today. It’s Michel Barnier and his team.”‘Supported’The Élysée sees EU solidarity with Ireland as a shining lesson of the benefits of EU membership. “It is the profound meaning of the EU project that a member state which is in difficulty, whether it be an attack, an economic threat or a political difficulty, must be supported by the others,” the adviser said.“If belonging to the EU means anything, it is that there must be no ambiguity or hesitation about protecting the fundamental interests of a member state, and that is valid whatever the size of the country. It is valid for a country of five million inhabitants, like Ireland.”The fact that the Border between Northern Ireland and the Republic will become the EU’s only land border with Britain was “the second reason why Ireland was at the heart of the negotiations”, the adviser added.Though the Élysée hoped for an imminent agreement, the adviser warned that the summit in Brussels on Thursday and Friday must not be “a catch-up session or the continuation of technical or detailed negotiations. It will be the moment to endorse or formalise a political agreement, but in no event a nocturnal extension of tough negotiations”.Macron and German chancellor Angela Merkel will co-ordinate their positions at a Franco-German cabinet meeting in Toulouse on Wednesday, where they will be joined by their ministers for defence, foreign affairs, European affairs, finance, culture and the interior.The meeting will focus on trade tensions with the US and co-operation in industry and innovation, in particular artificial intelligence and military procurement. Paris and Berlin are developing a combat aircraft and a battle tank together.Toulouse is the site of the Airbus 350 assembly line, considered one of the most successful Franco-German projects.International eventsFranco-German relations are often rendered difficult because of international events external to them, the adviser said. “It’s the situation that is difficult, not France and Germany. ”Macron’s approach has been to attempt to reach compromise on areas of discord, such as the reform of the euro zone, not to paper over disagreement.The French president believes “there is no alternative or possible substitute for the Franco-German relationship. It is irreplaceable,” the adviser continued. But, at the same time, it is “not an exclusive relationship”. Under Macron, “France is working much more with other partners, for example the Netherlands and central Europe, than before.”Macron received a stinging rebuke from the European Parliament when it vetoed the appointment of Sylvie Goulard as a member of the European Commission. Macron had secured a weighty portfolio for her, including the internal market, industry, defence, space, digital technology and culture.The Élysée said the attributes of the portfolio reserved for France must not change. Macron wants the “political instability” of the parliament, which has no clear political majority, to be addressed before he chooses a new commissioner.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Dan KitwoodGetty British prime minister Boris Johnson has postponed his weekly cabinet meeting until Wednesday afternoon amid signs that Britain and the European Union are closing in on a Brexit deal. Downing Street said the meeting, which will happen at the same time as Michel Barnier is due to brief EU ambassadors, will give the prime minister an opportunity to update ministers on negotiations.Mr Johnson and his team have been in regular contact with the DUP as the talks in Brussels have intensified but Arlene Foster dismissed suggestions that her party was under pressure to make concessions.“It’s not about concessions, it’s about doing what’s right for Northern Ireland,” Mrs Foster told UTV News.“What we will do is what’s right for Northern Ireland. And we will never do anything that will damage the constitutional and economic integrity of the United Kingdom. ”\u0026nbspMr Johnson’s hopes of passing a deal through parliament received a boost on Tuesday evening when Steve Baker, chairman of the hardline Brexiteer European Research Group suggested that he could support it. Leaving Downing Street after an 80-minute meeting, Mr Baker said he had enjoyed very constructive talks with the government.“I am optimistic that it is possible to reach a tolerable deal that I am able to vote for,” he said.Earlier, Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg said he believed that “everybody’s desperate to finish this” and that the votes were there to get Mr Johnson’s deal through the House of Commons.Are the DUP a factor?The DUP’s 10 votes remain crucial for the prime minister, however, because their endorsement of any deal would help to unlock the support of almost all Conservative Brexiteers. With up to nine Labour MPs representing Leave-voting seats willing to back a deal, the DUP’s support is likely to give Mr Johnson a majority in the Commons.If a deal is agreed, the government has indicated that MPs will sit on Saturday for a “meaningful vote” on its ratification. But Mr Rees-Mogg said on Tuesday that it was too soon to say for certain if the Parliament would hold its first Saturday sitting since the Falklands war.Scotland’s first minister Nicola Sturgeon told her Scottish National Party’s annual conference that the prime minister’s plan would leave Scotland in a worse position than any other part of the UK.“If there is to be a deal, it seems inevitable that it will include a process to allow Northern Ireland to decide if and for how long it will stay aligned to the single market and customs union. And that’s exactly as it should be. But think about what that will mean,” she said.“Scotland will be the only country in the UK to be taken out of the EU against our will and with no say over our future relationship with Europe. ”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Democrats also found a new target: US Senator Elizabeth Warren, who has surged into a virtual tie with Biden in many Democratic opinion polls.Here are five takeaways from the night.To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Knowing his head was to be replaced with CGI, he covered his face in corpse paint and shrouded himself in a costume covered with Egyptian symbols and magical amulets, terrifying his co-stars in the process. Decades earlier, Cage had pulled out 12 of his own teeth in preparation for the lead role in Birdy (1984).Hilary Swank\u0027s exercise regime for drama Million Dollar Baby was so intense that it almost killed her. She spent so long in the gym (six days a week for three months) that a doctor told her a staph infection – caused by a burst blister on her foot – was hours away from reaching her heart.Such was the extent of Heath Ledger\u0027s commitment to the role of Joker in The Dark Knight (2008) that he ended up sleeping just two hours a night after locking himself away in a hotel room for an entire month to make a diary comprised of his villainous character\u0027s ramblings.Having lived an entire year in the life of late Doors frontman Jim Morrison, Val Kilmer had to go to therapy after struggling to get his life back on track. The actor had become so obsessed with the role that he ended up learning fifty of Morrison\u0027s songs and had everyone call him Jim on set of the 1991 biopic.Johnny Depp risked his life while preparing for the role of Hunter Thompson in Terry Gilliam\u0027s 1998 film Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas he took hard drugs and spent his nights sleeping next to extremely dangerous containers of gunpowder and nitroglycerin.For war thriller Fury (2014), Shia LaBeouf slashed his own cheek and pulled a tooth out during filming. He also didn\u0027t wash for an entire month forcing the crew to arrange a separate room for him during night-time shoots.Rooney Mara completely changed her image to play the role of Lisbeth Salander in David Fincher\u0027s 2011 adaptation of The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. She cut her hair, bleached her eyebrows and pierced her nipples to get into the mindset of the cyber hacker at the heart of Stieg Larrson\u0027s novels.Natalie Portman certainly worked for the Best Actress Oscar she received for 2010 film Black Swan. She shunned any suggestion of a body double for the film\u0027s extremely challenging dance scenes.In 2008, Joaquin Phoenix displayed some bizarre behaviour after\u0026nbsphe quit acting to become a hip-hop artist. It was later revealed that his life upheaval –\u0026nbspstrange interviews included – was, in fact, a giant hoax for mockumentary I\u0027m Still hereAfter hearing that Apple co-founder Steve Jobs had a diet comprised of just fruit, Ashton Kutcher thought he\u0027d do the same in preparation for his role in biopic Jobs (2013). He ended up hospitalised for severe vitamin deficiencies as well as a reduction in bone density.After begging Spike Lee to let her play the role of crack addict Vivian in his 1991 film Jungle Fever, Halle Berry proved her dedication to the role by refusing to bathe for two whole weeks.Meryl Streep has recounted the time Dustin Hoffman slapped her on their first take filming 1979 orce drama Kramer vs Kramer, something everyone can agree was an unacceptable step too far.Known to be one of the biggest method actors around, Daniel Day-Lewis spent six months alone in the wilderness in preparation for his role in The Last of the Mohicans (1992).Anne Hathaway may have won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for Les Misérables (2012), but the role of Fantine – which saw her cut off her hair and eat nothing but lettuce and oatmeal paste – left her in a state of deprivation, both physically and emotionally.Christian Bale has since vowed not to mess with his weight again following his Oscar win for Vice earlier this year but, back in 2004, he lost such an alarming amount of weight for the role of Trevor Reznik in The Machinist that he became virtually unrecognisable. I was intrigued by a perverse nature of mine just to see if I can go beyond what I\u0027ve been told is actually safe and okay, and see if I could push the limits, he went on to tell the BBC.While many would expect to see Charlize Theron here for her Oscar-winning turn as Aileen Wuornos in Monster, it\u0027s her role in spy film Atomic Blonde (2017) that saw her take things too far. Theron was so adamant she perform her own stunts that she bruised her ribs and clenched her teeth so hard she broke two of them. The entire cast of 1975 film One Flew Over the Cuckoo\u0027s Nest stayed in a real mental asylum to prepare for the film. DeVito went so far as to dream up an imaginary friend, one he became convinced was real.To get into the lead role of Oscar-winning film The Pianist (2002), Adrien Brody upheaved his life so much that it took him over a year and a half to get things back on track not only did he starve himself to a staggering degree, but sold his home and broke up with his long-term girlfriend.   The Oscar-winner got so into his role of Joker in 2016\u0027s Suicide Squad that he sent his co-stars, including Margot Robbie and Will Smith, stray bullets and used condoms in the post. He event circulated a video of himself with nothing but a dead pig for company to the entire crew.Kate Winslet took her role of the former Nazi concentration camp guard at the heart of drama The Reader (2008) so seriously that she spoke with a German accent while at home with her family. She compared leaving the character behind her to escaping a serious car crash.For Taxi Driver, most actors wouldn\u0027t have  got themselves a fake license and cruised around New York City throughout the night to get into the role of the deranged Travis Bickle, but that\u0027s precisely what Robert De Niro ended up doing in 1976.Nicolas Cage has a history of taking his roles too far, but the peak arrived with the Ghost Rider sequel, Spirit of Vengeance (2011).

If Britain crashes out of the EU at the end of this month, house prices will end the year 1.7 per cent lower than in 2018, said Standard \u0026amp Poor’s (S\u0026ampP), one of the world’s three biggest providers of government and company credit scores to investors.Prices will then tumble another 10.2 per cent in 2020 and another 6.1 per cent in 2021, S\u0026ampP said in a report on Tuesday. House values will start rising again in 2022, but a predicted 5.9 per cent increase that year will undo only some of the previous losses.Although S\u0026ampP’s forecasts are at the gloomier end of recent predictions, many organisations expect substantial declines in UK house prices in the event of a no-deal Brexit.Last month, KPMG said prices could fall by around 6 per cent in 2020 in that case, “with a drop of 10-20 per cent not out of the question” if the market reacts more strongly than the consultancy projects.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 51Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Police officers carry away an activist as Extinction Rebellion protesters block a road with caravan in central London, BritainQueen Elizabeth II sits with Prince Charles on the Sovereign\u0027s throne ahead of delivering the Queen\u0027s Speech at the State Opening of ParliamentGreat Britain\u0027s Joe Fraser competes on Parallel Bars during the World Gymnastics Championships in Stuttgart, Germany.

It sees a 1.5 per cent price rise in 2020 after stagnation this year.“We believe that Brexit uncertainty has already started to trickle down into lower housing prices and sales volumes, especially in London,” the agency said.According to the latest official data, house prices inched up by 0.7 per cent in July compared with a year earlier – the slowest pace of growth in almost seven years. Figures for August are due on Wednesday.The sluggish growth in prices will be welcomed by those yet to get onto the housing ladder.“House prices have been expensive here for quite some time,” Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, said earlier on Tuesday, adding that housing affordability is “a challenge”.“It’s first and foremost driven by supply dynamics in the country. It continues to strike me that there is twice as many people in the United Kingdom as there is in my native Canada and the same amount of houses are built every year in the United Kingdom as in Canada.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

If Britain crashes out of the EU at the end of this month, house prices will end the year 1.7 per cent lower than in 2018, said Standard \u0026amp Poor’s (S\u0026ampP), one of the world’s three biggest providers of government and company credit scores to investors.Prices will then tumble another 10.2 per cent in 2020 and another 6.1 per cent in 2021, S\u0026ampP said in a report on Tuesday. House values will start rising again in 2022, but a predicted 5.9 per cent increase that year will undo only some of the previous losses.Although S\u0026ampP’s forecasts are at the gloomier end of recent predictions, many organisations expect substantial declines in UK house prices in the event of a no-deal Brexit.Last month, KPMG said prices could fall by around 6 per cent in 2020 in that case, “with a drop of 10-20 per cent not out of the question” if the market reacts more strongly than the consultancy projects.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 51Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Police officers carry away an activist as Extinction Rebellion protesters block a road with caravan in central London, BritainQueen Elizabeth II sits with Prince Charles on the Sovereign\u0027s throne ahead of delivering the Queen\u0027s Speech at the State Opening of ParliamentGreat Britain\u0027s Joe Fraser competes on Parallel Bars during the World Gymnastics Championships in Stuttgart, Germany.

Two thirds all car finance lending in 2017 was sold with this type of commission, up from just over one third in 2008.Scrapping it would end the inherent conflict of interest for brokers and encourage them to act in their customers\u0027 interests, the regulator said.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 51Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Police officers carry away an activist as Extinction Rebellion protesters block a road with caravan in central London, BritainQueen Elizabeth II sits with Prince Charles on the Sovereign\u0027s throne ahead of delivering the Queen\u0027s Speech at the State Opening of ParliamentGreat Britain\u0027s Joe Fraser competes on Parallel Bars during the World Gymnastics Championships in Stuttgart, Germany.

Nearly one million people were expected to attend Sunday and Monday\u0027s carnival to celebrate Caribbean cultureChristopher Woolard, executive director of strategy and competition at the FCA, commented: “We have seen evidence that customers are losing out due to the way in which some lenders are rewarding those who sell motor finance.”By banning this type of commission, we believe we will see increased competition in the market, which will ultimately save customers money.“The proposals come more than two years after the FCA launched a review into car financing in response to concerns about questionable practices in the sector.It will consult on the plans until 15 January, with final rules set to be published later in 2020.The FCA warned the sector in March to clean up its act amid concerns over the commission charged on car finance plans for new cars.Scott Cargill, chief executive of Admiral Financial Services, said: “The announcement from the FCA today will be welcome news to anyone buying a car from a dealership. For far too long, there has been a lack of transparency around how some car dealers make commission on sales. This has resulted in some customers overpaying for their loans by millions of pounds a year, but not really having any real idea by how much.\u0026nbsp“Now the FCA has shone a light on some of the shady ways commission is made, we expect to see more competition in the market and better deals for consumers.”\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The government has rejected claims a Brexit deal cannot be negotiated in time for the EU leaders’ summit on Thursday. The bloc’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier has said a deal is still possible this week but added that it looks “more and more difficult”.As a crash-out exit remains a possibility, Mr Carney said: “There are likely to be circumstances in an abrupt no-deal Brexit where certain businesses become uneconomic and they close.”“And so, for the person who runs that business or works for\u0026nbspthat business or has someone in their family who works for that business, they will be directly affected … because of a loss of a market or potentially shorter-term disruption.”The central bank governor has previously made similar forecasts. In August, he said a no-deal Brexit would deliver a blow to a “potentially substantial number” of companies.Even those businesses that survived would not emerge unscathed, he suggested at the time, citing a survey of 10,000 firms by the central bank.“They think that output will go down, they’ll have to let people go … That is the view of those firms.”Created with Sketch.Boris Johnson and Brexit merchandise for sale at the Tory conference Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A Boris Johnson doll for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberMugs with Boris Johnson\u0027s portrait for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberA Boris Johnson themed T-shirt for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberBoris Johnson and other Conservative themed cards for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberBoris Johnson posters for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberCopies of The Conservative newspaper are ready to be distributed during the Conservative Party conference on 30 SeptemberGET BREXIT DONE mugs alongside other Conservative merchandise at the party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberAssorted Conservative merchandise for sale at the party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberBooks about Jacob Rees-Mogg and Jeremy Corbyn for sale at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberA variety of books for sale at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberA Boris Johnson doll for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberMugs with Boris Johnson\u0027s portrait for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberA Boris Johnson themed T-shirt for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberBoris Johnson and other Conservative themed cards for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberBoris Johnson posters for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberCopies of The Conservative newspaper are ready to be distributed during the Conservative Party conference on 30 SeptemberGET BREXIT DONE mugs alongside other Conservative merchandise at the party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberAssorted Conservative merchandise for sale at the party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberBooks about Jacob Rees-Mogg and Jeremy Corbyn for sale at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberA variety of books for sale at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberMr Carney reiterated the warning\u0026nbspdespite noting in September that Britain, as a whole, had become better prepared for a no-deal outcome.\u0026nbspOne part of the economy where the impact of the Brexit process has been particularly visible is the volatile exchange rate,\u0026nbspand Mr Carney predicted more sharp moves ahead.Analysts, polled by Reuters earlier this month, forecast that the pound will\u0026nbspfall to $1.10-$1.19 if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement. That will take a quarter off the currency’s value before the EU referendum in 2016.Likewise, economists, including those at the Bank of England, have been warning of a stark impact on the broader UK economy from a disorderly Brexit.Mr Carney said, on Tuesday, that the bank has some ability to support the economy in that case, by bringing interest rates “close to but slightly above zero”. \u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Communication Workers Union (CWU) said Royal Mail is failing to honour an agreement reached last year to raise pay and reform pensions. The deal also included plans to reduce the working week and improve job security.Terry\u0026nbspPullinger, deputy general secretary of the\u0026nbspCWU,​\u0026nbspaccused Royal Mail bosses of breaking a progressive agreement\u0026nbspfor a successful postal service with social aims.\u0026nbspHe added: Our members take honour seriously and have voted to fight for that agreement against those who now seek to break up the great British Postal service in the interest of fast track profit and greed.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Police officers carry away an activist as Extinction Rebellion protesters block a road with a caravan in central LondonQueen Elizabeth II sits with Prince Charles on the Sovereign\u0027s throne ahead of delivering the Queen\u0027s Speech at the State Opening of ParliamentGreat Britain\u0027s Joe Fraser competes on Parallel Bars during the World Gymnastics Championships in Stuttgart, Germany.

We also call on the public to get behind this dispute and your postal workers.We are very proud of our members today.

This\u0026nbspfood, known as fishmeal and fish oil (FMFO), is often produced using destructive and sometimes illegal practices that “strip the ocean bare” and damage marine ecosystems, the report stated.The\u0026nbspinvestigation found that Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Aldi, Lidl, Co-op, Tesco, Asda, Iceland, Morrison’s, Waitrose and Marks \u0026amp Spencer all source fish from companies that use unsustainable FMFO as feed in their farms.Almost one fifth of the world’s annual wild fish catch is now taken out of the ocean to be ground down for FMFO to feed livestock or farmed fish.In India and Vietnam - two key countries for supplying this growing demand - collapsing fish stocks are pushing fishing vessels to “systematically plunder” the oceans for species that have not previously been caught for FMFO, Changing Markets found.Created with Sketch.Environment news in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.18 Davos 2019: David Attenborough issues

researchers found FMFO had been exported with falsified food safety certificates.Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, who is supporting a campaign to improve standards in the industry, said FMFO was being sourced in ways that are devastating to the marine environment.“It’s increasingly clear that even products certified as sustainably produced are based on aquaculture that is sourcing fishmeal in deeply irresponsible ways. The bottom line is that we need to stop taking wild fish out of the ocean to feed farmed fish, before it’s too late,” he said.Scottish Salmon producers hit back at the criticism. A spokesperson for Scottish Salmon Producers Organisation (SSPO) pointed out that: “Companies providing feed for Scottish farm-raised salmon have confirmed that none of them uses ingredients from the Gambia, Vietnam or India or from reef fishing – the main thrust of the criticism highlighted in the report. Any claim or suggestion that Scottish feed suppliers are sourcing from these fisheries would be wrong, misleading and inaccurate.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailChanging Markets found that damaging fishing practices are being allowed to go unpunished partly because of a glaring conflict of interest in the fishmeal industry.The trade body which represents the interests of FMFO suppliers and lobbies governments on their behalf is also tasked with certifying that those producers meet environmental standards. Despite this, major British retailers accept assurances from the body.\u0026nbspWhy we need to widen the net and eat more challenging fish cutsFMFO is becoming increasingly important as people eat more and more farmed fish. The report estimates that that farmed species will account for 62 per cent\u0026nbspof the seafood the world consumes by 2030.Natasha Hurley from Changing Markets, said: “Shoppers across the UK are totally unaware that the seafood they are buying has a dark secret.\u0026nbsp“The boom in aquaculture, to match the global demand for premium seafood products such as salmon, is fuelling illegal and unsustainable fishing practices which are stripping the oceans bare.“Climate change is already destabilising our food system and that’s being exacerbated by the FMFO industry, which will take anything and everything out of the ocean to meet demand from the growing aquaculture industry.\u0026nbspLeah Riley Brown, sustainability policy advisor at the British Retail Consortium, said fishmeal and fish oil were essential raw materials for creating good quality farmed seafood.\u0026nbsp“The use of wild-caught raw material as marine ingredients in fishmeal is becoming progressively more efficient as novel ingredients are gaining more traction as sustainable additions to the feed basket, which is alleviating pressures on wild fish stocks.”“This has been supported through utilising greater amounts of fishery and aquaculture processing by-product and increasing amounts of plant-based ingredients. Moreover, most remaining wild-caught fish used in fishmeal and oil would not typically be fished in significant quantities for human consumption and are sustainably and responsibly fished.“A Waitrose \u0026amp Partners spokesperson said that all of the company\u0027s fish feed was sourced from responsibly managed fisheries and met standards set by the IFFO.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Among the under-25s, the employment rate has actually started to fall on the year.“Pay growth continues to outstrip inflation, as it has done for over eighteen months now.Despite the 0.1 per cent rise in\u0026nbspunemployment to 3.9 per cent, the proportion of people jobless remains at its lowest level since the 1970s.The number of job vacancies fell again to 813,000, its lowest level since late 2017.“This is further evidence that the underlying weakness in economic growth is restraining labour market activity,” said Thomas Pugh, UK economist at Capital Economics.“However, it could also be evidence that the uncertainty around Brexit is starting to impact firms’ hiring decisions. The survey evidence is consistent with a further softening in employment and wage growth going forward too.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Two thirds all car finance lending in 2017 was sold with this type of commission, up from just over one third in 2008.Scrapping it would end the inherent conflict of interest for brokers and encourage them to act in their customers\u0027 interests, the regulator said.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 51Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Police officers carry away an activist as Extinction Rebellion protesters block a road with caravan in central London, BritainQueen Elizabeth II sits with Prince Charles on the Sovereign\u0027s throne ahead of delivering the Queen\u0027s Speech at the State Opening of ParliamentGreat Britain\u0027s Joe Fraser competes on Parallel Bars during the World Gymnastics Championships in Stuttgart, Germany.

Nearly one million people were expected to attend Sunday and Monday\u0027s carnival to celebrate Caribbean cultureChristopher Woolard, executive director of strategy and competition at the FCA, commented: “We have seen evidence that customers are losing out due to the way in which some lenders are rewarding those who sell motor finance.”By banning this type of commission, we believe we will see increased competition in the market, which will ultimately save customers money.“The proposals come more than two years after the FCA launched a review into car financing in response to concerns about questionable practices in the sector.It will consult on the plans until 15 January, with final rules set to be published later in 2020.The FCA warned the sector in March to clean up its act amid concerns over the commission charged on car finance plans for new cars.Scott Cargill, chief executive of Admiral Financial Services, said: “The announcement from the FCA today will be welcome news to anyone buying a car from a dealership. For far too long, there has been a lack of transparency around how some car dealers make commission on sales. This has resulted in some customers overpaying for their loans by millions of pounds a year, but not really having any real idea by how much.\u0026nbsp“Now the FCA has shone a light on some of the shady ways commission is made, we expect to see more competition in the market and better deals for consumers.”\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They included an experiment known as Labeled Release, or LR, which was intended to look for signs of life on the planet.The results came back in 1976 – and seemed to indicate that something was happening on the surface.\u0026nbspGilbert V\u0026nbspLevin – an engineer and inventor who was the principal investigator on the experiment – has now written a long article arguing that those findings were indications of life on Mars, which were ignored by Nasa.“On July 30, 1976, the LR returned its initial results from Mars,” Levin wrote in an article for Scientific American.\u0026nbsp”Amazingly, they were positive.“As the experiment progressed, a total of four positive results, supported by five varied controls, streamed down from the twin Viking spacecraft landed some 4,000 miles apart. The data curves\u0026nbspsignaled\u0026nbspthe detection of microbial respiration on the Red Planet.

That meant that Nasa concluded that the LR results came from a substance that was mimicking life but was not actually life itself.Comet visiting our solar system is ‘like nothing seen before’Since then, Nasa has not a run a similar experiment has focused on examining whether the Martian habitat could be a suitable home for alien life.But Levin argues that those findings actually suggested that\u0026nbspthere is alien life on Mars. And, he argued, Nasa must do more to follow them up – because they could pose a significant threat to life on Earth.“NASA maintains the search for alien life among its highest priorities,” he wrote.\u0026nbspOn February 13, 2019, NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said we might find microbial life on Mars.“Our nation has now committed to sending astronauts to Mars. Any life there might threaten them, and us upon their return. Thus, the issue of life on Mars is now front and center.”Summing up the evidence of alien life, he wrote his experiment had found a whole host of positive results. But perhaps most strongly of all, he said there had been no experiment that had provided an alternative explanation for the results that came back from the LV experiment.“What is the evidence against the possibility of life on Mars? The astonishing fact is that there is none,” he wrote. “Furthermore, laboratory studies have shown that some terrestrial microorganisms could survive and grow on Mars.”In his conclusion, he asked that Nasa\u0026nbspconduct the same kind of experiments again, taking an altered version of the LR experiment to Mars on the next possible trip. And he asked that scientists be convened to examine those more than 40-year-old findings to see if they really were proof of life on Mars.“Such an objective jury might conclude, as I did, that the Viking LR did find life,” he wrote.\u0026nbsp”In any event, the study would likely produce important guidance for NASA’s pursuit of its holy grail.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The government has rejected claims a Brexit deal cannot be negotiated in time for the EU leaders’ summit on Thursday. The bloc’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier has said a deal is still possible this week but added that it looks “more and more difficult”.As a crash-out exit remains a possibility, Mr Carney said: “There are likely to be circumstances in an abrupt no-deal Brexit where certain businesses become uneconomic and they close.”“And so, for the person who runs that business or works for\u0026nbspthat business or has someone in their family who works for that business, they will be directly affected … because of a loss of a market or potentially shorter-term disruption.”The central bank governor has previously made similar forecasts. In August, he said a no-deal Brexit would deliver a blow to a “potentially substantial number” of companies.Even those businesses that survived would not emerge unscathed, he suggested at the time, citing a survey of 10,000 firms by the central bank.“They think that output will go down, they’ll have to let people go … That is the view of those firms.”Created with Sketch.Boris Johnson and Brexit merchandise for sale at the Tory conference Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A Boris Johnson doll for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberMugs with Boris Johnson\u0027s portrait for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberA Boris Johnson themed T-shirt for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberBoris Johnson and other Conservative themed cards for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberBoris Johnson posters for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberCopies of The Conservative newspaper are ready to be distributed during the Conservative Party conference on 30 SeptemberGET BREXIT DONE mugs alongside other Conservative merchandise at the party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberAssorted Conservative merchandise for sale at the party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberBooks about Jacob Rees-Mogg and Jeremy Corbyn for sale at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberA variety of books for sale at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberA Boris Johnson doll for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberMugs with Boris Johnson\u0027s portrait for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberA Boris Johnson themed T-shirt for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberBoris Johnson and other Conservative themed cards for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberBoris Johnson posters for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberCopies of The Conservative newspaper are ready to be distributed during the Conservative Party conference on 30 SeptemberGET BREXIT DONE mugs alongside other Conservative merchandise at the party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberAssorted Conservative merchandise for sale at the party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberBooks about Jacob Rees-Mogg and Jeremy Corbyn for sale at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberA variety of books for sale at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberMr Carney reiterated the warning\u0026nbspdespite noting in September that Britain, as a whole, had become better prepared for a no-deal outcome.\u0026nbspOne part of the economy where the impact of the Brexit process has been particularly visible is the volatile exchange rate,\u0026nbspand Mr Carney predicted more sharp moves ahead.Analysts, polled by Reuters earlier this month, forecast that the pound will\u0026nbspfall to $1.10-$1.19 if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement. That will take a quarter off the currency’s value before the EU referendum in 2016.Likewise, economists, including those at the Bank of England, have been warning of a stark impact on the broader UK economy from a disorderly Brexit.Mr Carney said, on Tuesday, that the bank has some ability to support the economy in that case, by bringing interest rates “close to but slightly above zero”. \u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We also call on the public to get behind this dispute and your postal workers.We are very proud of our members today. They have stood by their union in record numbers and given hope to workers across the nation.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

New York native Iliza Shlesinger brings a fresh take on topics from modern dating to wedding planning headaches. Her show is a delightful mix of reality checks and insightful takes.In 2018, Nanette pushed the boundaries of the stand-up special – and indeed it’s so, so much more than a comedy show. In a little more than an hour, Hannah Gadsby deconstructs the makings of a good joke, explains why she’s done with self-deprecation, and delivers an unforgettable, incredibly powerful take on the trauma she’s experienced as a lesbian in Tasmania.Standout line: “I have built a career out of self-deprecating humour and I don’t want to do that anymore. Do you understand what self-deprecation means when it comes from somebody who already exists in the margins? It’s not humility, it\u0027s humiliation. I put myself down in order to speak, in order to seek permission to speak, and I simply will not do that anymore. Not to myself or anybody who identifies with me.”If you liked Ali Wong in Always Be My Maybe (which she co-wrote!), then you’re going to love her in Hard Knock Wife (her second Netflix special and a follow-up on her 2016 debut Baby Cobra). Her unapologetic takes on motherhood and marriage (did you know she makes a lot more money than her husband and she’s not sorry?) are gold.Standout line: “Now, I make a lot more money than my husband by, like, a long shot. My mom is very concerned that he’s going to leave me out of intimidation. I had to explain to her that the only kind of man who would leave a woman who makes more money… is the kind of man that doesn’t like free money.”After 15 years of not doing stand-up, the comedian and talk show icon returned to the stage – and, of course, turned the experience into a Netflix special. Under the pretence of pondering whether she’s still relatable, Ellen DeGeneres basks in the (well-earned) glory her accomplishments, reflects on her personal experiences – including her 1997 coming-out and how it was received in Hollywood – and riffs on the absurdities of daily life. What a treat.510 Son of Patricia, Trevor NoahTrevor Noah has been starring in comedy specials for a decade, so it’s no surprise that he can take just about any topic (tourism in Bali, trap music, a conversation with President Barack Obama) and turn it into incisive jokes.Katherine Ryan’s second Netflix special (the follow-up to In Trouble, which came out in 2017) tackles some of her trademark topics, from dating to co-parenting, in a lighthearted, self-affirming way. A delight through and through.Back in 2012, Donald Glover, aka Childish Gambino, was appearing as the unforgettable Troy Barnes in Community – and spared a little time to record a Netflix special, which remains available to this day. Throughout this one-hour show, he shows off his range, reflecting on his music career, reaching his late twenties, and that brief time when the internet really wanted him to play Spider-Man.Standout line: “I lived in Downtown LA, and Downtown LA is kind of like the Eighties decided to stay there. They’re like, ‘Oh, OK, you guys go ahead and be the Nineties. Go enjoy Ace of Base – we’ll be here practicing the Moonwalk and selling crack.’”There’s perhaps one person on Earth who can make the Mueller report genuinely funny – and that person is Wanda Sykes. The comedian might be best known for her roles on Curb Your Enthusiasm and Black-ish, but her stand-up is well worth a watch. She has impeccable timing, sharp writing, and an apparently effortless ability to connect with her crowd.Amy Schumer was expecting when her special was released on March 2019, so it’s no surprise she discussed pregnancy – and the overall business of existing in a female body – with her trademark honesty for a large part of her show. This special is actually made up of two shows, Dark and Jigsaw. The Scottish comedian refreshes the “fish out of water” archetype by delivering his take on the US – and that time he told a joke about being an atheist in Indiana. His smart writing enables him to tackle topics, such as disability and – yes – paedophilia, in a way few comics could pull off.Standout line: “As a parent – no, I’m not a parent, but I like speaking for other people, because I’m white, middle-class and male, and that’s what my people do.”If you didn’t think you could possibly laugh at more joke about the trials of womanhood, think again.

This\u0026nbspfood, known as fishmeal and fish oil (FMFO), is often produced using destructive and sometimes illegal practices that “strip the ocean bare” and damage marine ecosystems, the report stated.The\u0026nbspinvestigation found that Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Aldi, Lidl, Co-op, Tesco, Asda, Iceland, Morrison’s, Waitrose and Marks \u0026amp Spencer all source fish from companies that use unsustainable FMFO as feed in their farms.Almost one fifth of the world’s annual wild fish catch is now taken out of the ocean to be ground down for FMFO to feed livestock or farmed fish.In India and Vietnam - two key countries for supplying this growing demand - collapsing fish stocks are pushing fishing vessels to “systematically plunder” the oceans for species that have not previously been caught for FMFO, Changing Markets found.Created with Sketch.Environment news in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.18 Davos 2019: David Attenborough issues stark warning about future of civilisation as he demands ‘practical solutions’ to combat climate changeSir David Attenborough has issued a stark warning about climate change to business figures gathered in Davos, telling them that what we do now...will profoundly affect the next few thousand years.Two decades of research have revealed that 60 per cent of the world’s coffee species face extinction due to the combined threats of deforestation, disease and climate change.38 Warming Antarctic waters are speeding the rate at which glaciers are meltingThe Antarctic ice sheet is losing six times as much ice each year as it was in the 1980s and the pace is accelerating, one of the most comprehensive studies of climate change effects on the continent has shown.48 Greater Manchester to ban fracking, paving way for confrontation with government over controversial industryGreater Manchester is to effectively ban fracking, raising the prospect of fresh confrontation with the government over the controversial industry.58 Japan confirms plan to resume commercial whaling in its waters from next yearJapan will resume commercial whaling next year for the first time in more than three

researchers found FMFO had been exported with falsified food safety certificates.Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, who is supporting a campaign to improve standards in the industry, said FMFO was being sourced in ways that are devastating to the marine environment.“It’s increasingly clear that even products certified as sustainably produced are based on aquaculture that is sourcing fishmeal in deeply irresponsible ways. The bottom line is that we need to stop taking wild fish out of the ocean to feed farmed fish, before it’s too late,” he said.Scottish Salmon producers hit back at the criticism. A spokesperson for Scottish Salmon Producers Organisation (SSPO) pointed out that: “Companies providing feed for Scottish farm-raised salmon have confirmed that none of them uses ingredients from the Gambia, Vietnam or India or from reef fishing – the main thrust of the criticism highlighted in the report. Any claim or suggestion that Scottish feed suppliers are sourcing from these fisheries would be wrong, misleading and inaccurate.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Despite this, major British retailers accept assurances from the body.\u0026nbspWhy we need to widen the net and eat more challenging fish cutsFMFO is becoming increasingly important as people eat more and more farmed fish. The report estimates that that farmed species will account for 62 per cent\u0026nbspof the seafood the world consumes by 2030.Natasha Hurley from Changing Markets, said: “Shoppers across the UK are totally unaware that the seafood they are buying has a dark secret.\u0026nbsp“The boom in aquaculture, to match the global demand for premium seafood products such as salmon, is fuelling illegal and unsustainable fishing practices which are stripping the oceans bare.“Climate change is already destabilising our food system and that’s being exacerbated by the FMFO industry, which will take anything and everything out of the ocean to meet demand from the growing aquaculture industry.\u0026nbspLeah Riley Brown, sustainability policy advisor at the British Retail Consortium, said fishmeal and fish oil were essential raw materials for creating good quality farmed seafood.\u0026nbsp“The use of wild-caught raw material as marine ingredients in fishmeal is becoming progressively more efficient as novel ingredients are gaining more traction as sustainable additions to the feed basket, which is alleviating pressures on wild fish stocks.”“This has been supported through utilising greater amounts of fishery and aquaculture processing by-product and increasing amounts of plant-based ingredients. Moreover, most remaining wild-caught fish used in fishmeal and oil would not typically be fished in significant quantities for human consumption and are sustainably and responsibly fished.“A Waitrose \u0026amp Partners spokesperson said that all of the company\u0027s fish feed was sourced from responsibly managed fisheries and met standards set by the IFFO.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Unless you live under a rock, you will have been as gripped as the rest of us by Coleen’s very public suggestion that Rebekah has sold stories about Coleen’s personal le “for a few years now”.“After a long time of trying to ­figure out who it could be,” Coleen wrote on Instagram, “for ious reasons I had a ­suspicion. To try and prove this I came up with an idea.”That meant blocking all of her followers except one on her private Instagram account, then posting fake stories to seethey made it into the papers.“The story about gender selection in Mexico, the story about ing to TV and the latest story about the basement flooding in my new house,” she wrote, were all .So when the stories appeared in print, Coleen pounced. “Now I know for certain which account inidual it’s come from. It’s . . . Rebekah Vardy’s account.”Rebekah denies being the ­source of the stories, claiming a string of other people have had access to her Instagram account. Call me old-fashioned, but why didn’t Coleen pick up the phone instead of picking a public fight Coleen assumed this saga would grab the world’s attention. It has, but perhaps not for the reasons she thought.It gives us a real insight into the reality of fame and the ­obsessive paranoia that can go with it.Although she is used to living out her ­personal dramas in the public eye, Coleen has ­forgotten that public spats, especially those waged on social media, never end well.All too often, they reflect badly on BOTH parties. And they can lead to a social media pile-on that seriously affects people’s lives.Rebekah cut short her ­holiday this week and has had to contend with some truly vile trolling about her children and even her unborn baby.Meanwhile, what Coleen has failed to grasp is this: Something is only a secretyou are the only person who knows about it.The moment you share your secrets on social media — even in a “private” group — you risk those secrets escaping into the real world.You know, the real world, where friends meet up for a glass of wine and a long chat, talking about their lives rather than sharing edited highlights via social media.That is what friends are for. I couldn’t survive without my friends and would far rather chat to them than post on social media.If you suspect someone is stealing your secrets and selling them on, wouldn’t any right-thinking person simply cut them out of their le Why bother laying an elaborate trap to catch the culpritthe main objective is to stop it happening and get negative people away from you To me, it feels very teenagerish, the sort of thing you do in school, not when you are a grown woman with four kids.The s Coleen went to ­suggest she has a bit too much time on her hands.Perhaps this is a by-product of an obsession with your privacy — when you want it, that is, and not when you are selling your wedding photos to glossy celebrity magazines.You develop such a high opinion of yourself that you truly believe the world and his we are on ­tenterhooks about the latest minutiae of your domestic le.This story highlights something : The impact fame can have on someone’s ego and their sense of their own importance.  Really, Coleen just needs to get over herself.WE desperately need to do something about one in three primary school kids being dangerously fat – double the rate of  years ago.But banning consumption of all food and drink on public transport – as well as pies at football matches – would be scratching the wrong itch.Isn’t the real answer to educate people about healthy eating and stop companies marketing sugary foods to children  Alongside spending more time and money promoting sport so kids move more and eat less Don’t get me wrong, I object to people eating food on the Tube. But that has nothing to do with weight . . . and everything to do with how off-putting it is to sit next to someone scoffing a stinking kebab.It is pretty straightforward to work outsomeone wants to have sex with you. And more importantly, when they don’t.Both my kids know how to respect others, as well as themselves. They learned it well before they got to uni.If you need to do this course when you start at university, it might already be too late.THE issue of kne crime in the capital was brought closer to home than ever for me when a schoolboy was stabbed at .pm in Stratford, East London.The attack took place in broad daylight, just after school ended, on West Ham’s doorstep.Just like that, another le was snuffed out and a family devastated.We must finally make this a priority before yet more children die needlessly.What will her one-year-old twins Leo and Lenon thinkthey read that in years to come  Maybe they will assume she was joking.Each of my two kids thinks I prefer the other one. At times, I prefer the dog!HUGE congratulations to Natalie Imbruglia, who has welcomed her first baby – a little boy she has called Max Valentine – at the age of  after conceiving with the help of a sperm donor.Good for her. She hasn’t just settled for any old man but wanted to become a mother so has done it herself. Much respect. A baby born to a mother who is single by choice could hardly be more wanted or more loved.Both Natalie and her baby will be happier without the wrong husband or father being on the scene.Meanwhile, Naomi Campbell has said she is “not yet” ready to become a mother at the age of . I respect her choice too.Butshe isn’t ready at , she never will be. I can’t imagine having a baby at , which Naomi would be evenshe went ahead with it right now.The word she used about my eggs was “manky”. Nice.

It wasn’t so long ago the EU ruled out EVER re-opening the negotiations and Britain was hurtling towards a No Deal crash. What made the dference  Could it be that our friends in Brussels were riled at the idea of Boris fighting an election while blaming them for Britain not getting out on time Things started to change on Tuesday when a No source briefed details of a call between the PM and Germany’s Angela Merkel. The insider’s memo said their conversation made it clear a deal was “overwhelmingly unlikely”.Bearing all the hallmarks of Boris Johnson’s de facto chief of staff Dominic Cummings, it was texted to James Forsyth, Sun columnist and Political Editor of The Spectator. In chilling tones, it raised fears Boris was heading flat out for No Deal.It threatened: “Supporting delay will be seen by this Government as hostile interference in domestic politics. Any delay will be negotiated between you, Parliament and the courts. We will focus on winning the election on a manesto of immediately revoking the entire EU legal order without further talks, and then we will leave.”Feathers were ruffled across the Channel — yet within two days Boris and Irish Taoiseach Varadkar agreed to meet then said they could “see a pathway” to Brexit deal. EU Council President Donald Tusk had earlier made clear his anger at the original briefing, tweeting at the PM: “What’s at stake is not winning some stupid blame game.”Outrage aside, Tusk is a seasoned politician and is wise enough to know a general election is coming. Evenhe asked for a humiliating extension, Boris could come back with a majority and a strengthened mandate to take the country to No Dealnecessary.It would have given the EU a reason to pause. Did they really want to take such a big risk and damage relations with the UK, especiallyBoris was going towith No Deal in his manesto  Boris has blustered his way through the critics, promising to “get Brexit done” despite the odds ening every day.At times it has all looked a bit desperate. But the UK doesn’t hold all the cards. To get a deal through, Boris needs the Irish government to compromise too. Varadkar’s stubbornness was a sticking point. Ireland’s leader, like everyone , knows Theresa May’s deal was not supported in Parliament.Showing no signs of movement on the issue would make the Irish just as culpable of creating a hard border as those in Westminster. This hardline briefing is not how any of us want to deal with our friends and allies in Europe. But the brinkmanship looks like it has produced results.We are not out of the woods by any means. At this moment, we are still not clear on any details of the new proposals. So you can see why No kept up the pressure on No Deal, why Chancellor Sajid Javid committed to spending more than £billion to get the Government ready to go and why Michael Gove is working on plans to put all that spending in place.For all the worry about No Deal, keeping it on the table was a necessary step to strengthen our position. Claims the Government was looking for a legal loophole to remove the obstacles now appear fancul.But the EU would have taken note and would have worried about stubbornly sticking to its positionthe threat of No Deal suddenly reappeared. If we are serious about a deal, No should end the hardline rhetoric. The EU will not make this easy. And why should they  But their cautious welcome of the breakthrough with Ireland means we have reasons to be cheerful.Now is the time for cool heads and for Boris to engage in a statesmanlike way. He needs to get to grips with the detail of exactly how we can make an alternative to the backstop work. Sadly, that’s not even the hard part.Any deal will need to come back to Parliament, where tribal loyalties, political positioning and genuine anger have intensied in recent months. There is almost no chance opposition parties will back anything that comes back from Brussels.So the only way to deliver Brexit is to bring together the fractious parts of the Conservative Party, the breakaway Tory rebel MPs and the hardcore Brexit “Spartans”.There is hope this can be done. The rebels will want to avoid a No Deal exit, which any deal would prevent, and the Spartans have started to see that leaving in an orderly way may be the only chance they have to get us out.The alternative could be more months of delay, ending in a second referendum. None of which they could possibly want. And there is one other group to win over, the dangerously dficult DUP.They are critical to parliamentary success. So far, they have stayed tight-lipped about the latest developments, only reiterating their original position of leaving with the rest of the UK.He needs to get Brexit done so he can start repairing the damage getting us here has created. There are  hours until the next EU meeting, when the fate of the country will be decided. Let’s make them count. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

You failed to turn around the business.You couldn’t hide these numbers forever, they caught up with you.

But, perversely, it may have also cost them the game.There are not yet specic punishments in place for breaking the racism protocol but Uefa’s Disciplinary Regulations  state: “If a match cannot take place or cannot be played in full, the member association or club responsible forfeits the match.”So it could have been perceived as a home win for racism and defeat for England.Uefa’s woefully inadequate response to a litany of previous racist incidents meant it was left up to Tyrone to make a call.Cool-headed England manager Gareth Southgate later said all his players wanted to carry on.If Uefa bosses had spines, they should have abandoned the game and given the points to England.Players should be able to walk out on a game where mass racism is taking place without risk of forfeiting the match. If nations such as Bulgaria can’t police and steward racist fans, then Uefa should force them to play behind closed doors or exclude them from tournaments until they can.In the build-up to the game, the Bulgarians pointed out the English could hardly occupy the moral high ground.There have been a number of reports of players being racially abused at games here this year and stars are regularly subjected to racism on social media.I have reported on England games for The Sun for the past  years and the dedicated fans are a friendly and welcoming bunch.Most use the opportunity of foreign games for sight-seeing and immersing themselves in local culture.Yet a “stag do” following of younger yobbish fans attaches themselves to Three Lions away games in party destinations such as Amsterdam, Porto and Prague.Booze and drugs are swilled down and continental squares echo to the sound of Ten German Bombers and splintering glass.A minority of fans it may be, but they are still intimidating to locals and families. We have our own house to get in order, too.After the final whistle Tyrone stated that he believed England’s collective decision to stay on was the correct one, saying he was “proud of how we dealt with it”.Dignied in stark contrast to the far-Right nasties who had hounded him.His cry of “Hey, did you hear that ” must surely now be acted upon in football’s corridors of power.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Before the Labour conference he was denounced and then nearly lost his job for saying the party’s policy  should be for a referendum on Brexit before a general election. John McDonnell has since  hinted he supports this position  as does his ally Rebecca Long-Bailey who, ironically, was one of the NEC members who voted to abolish Watson’s position as revenge for his breaking ranks. It now almost the official Labour line for everyone apart from Jeremy Corbyn.

At last nightaposs meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party MPs were not impressed when the party chair Ian Lavery insisted the party was ready for an election. Those who want to hold their seats can suddenly see the advantage of a second referendum.

Others simply see it as the best way of halting Brexit.  The numbers are not yet there in the Commons but they could beCorbyn drops his objections and demands a second poll as the condition for backing Johnson’s deal. Much depends on the power struggle taking place in the Labour Party.  McDonnell is increasingly in control of Labour’s direction and is hungry for power.  Unlike some of the people around Corbyn he is prepared to be more pragmatic about what Labour needs to do to make itself electable."},{"url":null,"title":"android users should delete 15","story":"NewsAndroid users should delete these  Google Play Store apps right nowTech company Sophos has warned users of Android phones to delete a series of apps that contain malicious softwareShareCommentsByMilo Boyd:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror tech video criminal-apps-you-need-delete-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news android-users-should-delete--\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

The teen complained of a swollen face soon after she arrived on holiday with her aunt and uncle and within less than  hours of seeing a hotel doctor, she was dead.

The resort doctor at Club Mac Alcudia where the family were staying immediately diagnosed Molly with Mumps, her aunt said. Molly had been vaccinated against mumps as a child, her family said. However doctors fear the decline in families opting to get their kids the childhood jab MMR that wards off measles, mumps and rubella could lead to increased death rates among youngsters.    The doctor prescribed ibuprofen and paracetamol, Miss Bower said. Within a few seconds of taking it, Molly drted off to sleep. We later tried to wake her for a shower, we couldn’t get her to walk, it was like carrying a dead weight. I left the room for five minutes afterwards to get her more clothes and the next thing I knew I heard screaming [from a family friend]. Molly’s eyes had rolled into the back of her head and she had stopped breathing.’ Doctors reportedly tried to save the teen for two hours before she was moved to hospital, where she later died from complications arising from mumps.

Swansea Crown Court heard that the defendant used to date his victimaposs mother and in the days before the attack had been heard expressing a desire to hurt and kill Sammy-Lee, her mother Sarah and Christopher Maher, the man he suspected of being in a relationship with Ms Lodwig senior. Prosecutor Michael Jones told the jury: He was, in short, jealous. Mr Jones read from a chilling letter written by Farrell after his arrest in which he wrote: We went back to my flat and we started arguing.  Then the next thing I had her tied up and told her Iaposd had enough and I was going to kill her. I did by repeatedly stabbing her in the face and throat. Farrell, who denies murder, started a relationship with his victim after she became a regular visitor to his flat for drugs, the court was told. Mr Jones said Farrell knocked at a neighbouraposs window on April , saying: I killed her. A friend of the neighbour went with six-foot-tall Farrell to his flat in Carlton Terrace in the Mount Pleasant area of Swansea.  There, he saw the body of Ms Lodwig, who was ft ins and weighed six stone, on a bed. Farrell fled after the emergency services were alerted and paramedics found his girlfriend fully-clothed, with cuts across her throat and forehead and severe bleeding on the bedding. It was estimated that Ms Lodwig died  or  minutes before they arrived. A black-handled kitchen kne covered in blood, with the tip of its cm blade missing, was found next to the bed.  Forensic scientist Claire Morse said it appeared the woman had been assaulted while on the bed. Mr Jones also said knotted and blood-stained dressing gown belts with traces of Ms Lodwigaposs saliva were found nearby, suggesting they may have been in or around her mouth. Injuries to her neck damaged major arteries and veins, while wounds to her chest were deep enough to enter both her lungs. The cause of death was established as stab wounds to her neck and chest. The court heard that later that morning Farrell phoned a friend, telling her: Iaposve killed her. I had enough. She wouldnapost shut up. I sliced her up, adding that it had been a slow death.

The nanny suffered agonising period pains from the age of nine-years-old which caused her to become delirious and frequently faint. She was misdiagnosed four times and says multiple doctors failed to spot the cm thick wall of tissue running vertically down her vagina known as the longitudinal septum - which caused her to have two.    After five long years, Molly-Rose began to thoroughly research online and discovered her condition, she is sharing her story for the first time to raise awareness of uterus didelphys. Molly-Rose from Gillingham, Kent, said: When I first started my periods, doctors would blame my age and say my body is still young and canapost cope. But now I know it is because I am having two periods at once, I have been on birth control since  years-old to try and reduce the heavy flow and fainting. As I got into my early teens, I attempted to use tampons, but it would fall straight out, I thought maybe it was normal. It wasnapost until I became sexually active with my then boyfriend, I began to worry as it was impossible and very painful. I noticed there was a piece of skin in the middle and two holes and I felt so embarrassed. From the outside, you would never even know, even the doctors didnapost as I had attended three appointments.    Before my diagnosis I was advised to get tested for a sexually transmitted disease due to the bleeding and abnormal discharge. It came back all clear, as predicted - I knew something was wrong and began to research myself which was a challenge itself. Molly-Rose says there was a lack of knowledge and awareness in the medical practise and she had to tirelessly research online before finding uterus didelphys. She adds: There wasnapost any leaflets for me to read nor doctors who could help me understand my condition which is why it took so long for me to get a diagnosis.    I told my GP that I know what it is and was referred to a gynaecologist and I requested general anaesthetic for the intrusive vaginal scan. I went on to have general anaesthetic for my second gynaecologist appointment... I was desperate to get some answers. Within ten minutes, they confirmed I have two uteruses, two cervixes and two vaginas - I felt so happy to finally know what is wrong.

Swansea council tree officer Alan Webster told a court the tree was “irreplaceable”. He added: “This is ancient woodland dating back hundreds of years. It is important.’ Sauro and his firm, Enzo Homes Ltd, were yesterday found guilty of contravening a tree preservation order by magistrates in Swansea, south Wales. The tree contractor who carried out the illegal felling was fined another £, for the destruction in the ancient woodlands. A court heard the towering ft tree was estimated to be worth more than £, but, in reality, it was “irreplaceable”. Sauro said the felling was an accident - but a judge ruled he “deliberately” ordered it to be chopped down to make way for  new homes.    Sauro and his company, Enzo Homes Ltd, were ordered to stump up a fine totalling £, by a district judge in Swansea, South Wales. Enzo Homes were fined £, while Sauro was fined £,. Annabel Graham-Paul, prosecuting, said: “This was an intentional breach or flagrant disregard for the law. “The trees felled are irreplaceable natural resources. The soils in the ancient woodland can never be replicated. “Swansea Council aim to replace the trees within two years but the ancient woodlands are irreplaceable and the redwood is going to take a long time to grow back to its former glory so it is by no means going to be a like for like replacement.” Swansea Magistrate’s Court heard Sauro made “no financial gain” from felling the trees and is involved with the council’s plans to replant what was cut down.    Alex Goodman, representing Sauro said: “Sauro has sourced replacement trees at his own expense which are being carefully nurtured in a nursery. “This reflects Sauro’s remorse and regret for what happened.” District judge Neale Thomas said: “I find it dficult to equate the harm to a monetary value. The harm is much greater. “It is inconceivable on this evidence the felling of this tree and the ancient woodland was done in any other way than deliberately. “There would have been discussions about how it was to be done, permission obtained to remove the fence and any other preparatory work.”  “Mr Sauro caused the destruction of these trees in the most obvious way: namely by directing they should be felled. “This is a deliberate planned breach of the tree preservation order and in defiance of it”. Sauro and his firm, Enzo Homes Ltd, were found guilty of contravening a tree preservation order. Both the company and its director were also ordered to contribute a total of £, towards the prosecution costs.

James Gwinnett, , was lucky to walk away when he fractured part of his spine in a rugby tackle which almost paralysed him. But his le as he knew it was over and he suffered severe boredom during the months off work that followed. There is only so much daytime TV you can watch, he toldin a candid exclusive chat. Those three months were dficult. The problem I had was that I would drink a lot of beer through the pure boredom . During this period at home alone, I would have one beer and then two, then three and it escalated and it spiralled quickly. I did sleep rough as a generalisation. When drunk, I would miss the last train out of Charing Cross station and then sleep rough outside it infrequently. I look back now and that was very dangerous. I also once slipped over and cracked my head open.    James, who lives in Harrow, northwest London, became frustrated by his sudden loss of routine and downed up to  pints each day for around two years. He added: I have always a big drinker socially. I have always had a problem in that most people will have four or five drinks with friends and say aposI feel a bit tipsyapos and say aposthat is enoughapos but for some reason my brain doesnapost have that switch. Routine is incredibly important to me. Rugby gave me that routine. My week was geared towards that Saturday afternoon match, and then Iaposd train and eat healthily for the next match. Losing that routine as well as losing that camaraderie in going out with my rugby teammates afterwards was dficult.    But since his traumatic fight with addiction between the February  accident and April , James has transformed his le with simple goals. Despite being at his worst ebb, he was inspired to train for the  London Marathon, conquered the test and has since reached the final of the gruelling SAS: Who Dares Wins challenge. James, originally from Tonbridge, Kent, is this year running km in ious stints and has already exceeded km. He said: Consultants told me not to continue [playing]. I was quite close to near paralysis because I had crushed discs between the vertebrae. I was lucky to walk away from the accident. But I was told by specialists and physios I was able to do the marathon and other challengesI cared for my body and trained in moderation.  He continued: I watched the  London Marathon on TV and it just hit me. This was the jolt I needed to turn my le around, so to speak. I find it hard to motivate myselfI donapost have specic goals in mind. So after two to three years drinking heavily, I saw these people pushing themselves to their limits, their incredible limits and thought aposI should do thatapos. Over the next year, I set myself manageable targets, that way you can break any goal down. That goal-orientated mentality is very important to me. Having broken my neck and everything , I am very interested in how the body is very fragile but you can also achieve great things with it. I am still interested in pushing myself further. That is quite philosophical but interesting. I am aware of my body and to take care of my body.  And remarkably, James reached the last eight in the final of the Channel  SAS contest, in which ex-Special Forces soldier Ant Middleton pits contestants against harsh environments across the world that replicate gruelling tasks in military selection processes. He also hasnapost had any alcohol since April  as he plans more endurance tests. But the PR guru is one of millions of Brits who have admitted to self-medicating their mental health in the past. Alarming research released recently by LeSearch shows % of over s in the UK are currently using alcohol or over-the-counter and illegal drugs to cope with mental health challenges.  "},{"url":null,"title":"stalker posts champagne celebration snaps","story":"NewsStalker posts champagne celebration snaps as early jail release angers victimsRangers fan Jill Sharp, who created fake social media profiles while tormenting two former pals, is seen grinning widely on a sofa while clutching a glass of Moet with partner Craig HaleShareCommentsByMark McGivernChris Kitching:,  OCT NewsJill Sharp celebrated her release from prison with her partner Craig Hale \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

Sharp replied with a plane emoji, writing: You know me only too well lol... The countdown is on! Sharp was released from jail after serving just three months of her one-year term for stalking two former friends, creating fake social media profiles while tormenting them.

Sharp sent emails to the couple’s workplaces with  claims they were involved in criminal activity, including dealing drugs to kids.  Mr Paton, , hit out at Sharp following her release, telling the Daily Record: “There is a total lack of remorse for what she put us through. This obsession she has with champagne is sad but we won’t be intimidated by her. “It seems ridiculous that Sharp was sentenced to  months but only served three and is out before Christmas. “But the whole world now knows what she did after she admitted it in court. She is the type to just keep squirming and denying everything but even her friends and family know she is an obsessive stalker and fantasist.  “She may have got out of jail early but her reputation has been destroyed forever by what she did to us. She is a laughing stock at Ibrox and you would have to be off your head to believe she is innocent after all the details emerged in court.” After her release from jail Sharp reactivated her Facebook account and posted the snaps of her and Hale celebrating with champagne. The couple both still live with their parents. In one photo, they are seen wearing matching Rangers pyjamas. But fans have made it clear they are not welcome at old haunts such as the well-known Rangers pub the Louden Tavern.

One friend wrote: Good to see you with the rangers top back on. Sharp replied: Thank you very much! It sure feels good lol!

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA report on plummeting cancer screening rates recommends introducing more convenient test times for women. Patients must be able to attend cancer screenings during evenings and weekends, and in locations close to their home or work, the Government-ordered review said. Professor Sir Mike Richards said women need to be given more choice over where they go for tests, including for cervical or breast cancer. The former national cancer tsar believes the changes could halt the worrying decline in the number of people attending screenings.    His study looked in detail at the NHS screening programmes for abdominal aortic aneurysm, bowel cancer, breast cancer, cervical cancer and diabetic eye screening. It said outdated IT systems used for screening must be overhauled as they are currently too fragmented and lead to errors, risking patient safety. Furthermore, delays in introducing new types of screening - such as a delay of over a decade in bringing in the new bowel cancer test - end up costing lives. The study found people would be more likely to accept invitations for screeningappointments were available either near their home or workplace - at convenient times. Some women also prefer to be screened at sexual health clinics, it said.    The document noted GPs must be incentivised to provide convenient appointments and ensure people take up screening. Text message reminders could also be sent to increase uptake of appointments, although current IT systems hinder access to mobile phone numbers. More should also be made of social media campaigns to raise awareness of the importance of screening, the report said. The study also said trans people and gender erse populations are currently poorly served by screening services and this must be improved.    It said: Transmen may have a cervix and thus be at risk of cervical cancer. However, their gender may be recorded as male and thus they would not be routinely called for cervical screening. Transwomen are at an increased risk of breast cancer compared to cisgender menusing hormones, but are only invited for screeningregistered as female. The report welcomed the Governmentaposs new funding to replace MRI machines, CT scanners and breast screening equipment, saying some equipment was hugely outdated. It noted that some mobile vans for breast screening were at least  years old with leaking roofs. And while most patients get the results of their screening on time, just .% of women received their cervical screening results within the recommended two weeks in April  due to a changeover to a new system.    The report said the current screening service saves over , lives a year but there is a sense that we are now slipping and each screening service could do better. It was also unclear who is accountable for the screening service - with Public Health Englandand NHS England both having key roles - and the report said responsibility must be transferred to NHS England. The current system lacks clear leadership and accountability, the report said. The rationale for iding responsibilities across PHE and NHSE is often unclear and creates confusion, delays and risks to patient safety. On IT, the study said the current systems used for screening are woefully out of date and long due for replacement, leading to inefficiencies and errors. It added: Some of the systems - particularly those for breast and cervical screening - are old and liable to fail.

A multinational task force is trying to track down Tse Chi Lop, a Canadian national born in China who is suspected of leading a vast drug network that accumulates up to billion a year. The syndicate provides tonnes of methamphetamine, heroin and ketamine to at least a dozen countries in the Asia-Pacic region, from Japan to New Zealand, authorities believe. Meth, a powerful drug that can create very strong psychological and physical dependence, is believed to be the networkaposs main business. Tse, who is protected by a guard of Thai kickboxers, flies by private jet and once lost million in a single night at a Macau casino, police say. His narcotics empire was allegedly born out of an alliance of five of Asiaaposs triad groups. Police have dubbed the network Sam Gor, Cantonese for Brother Number Three, which recalls one of Tseaposs nicknames, but its members simply call it The Company. In , the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime  estimated the syndicateaposs revenue at billion a year, but says it could be as high as . billion.   The agency estimates that the cartel, which often conceals its drugs in packets of tea, has a  percent to  percent share of the wholesale regional meth market that has expanded at least fourfold in the past five years, according to a Reuters investigation .A Taiwanese law enforcement flow chart believes Tse is the “Multinational CEO” of the syndicate, but police have not publicly identied him as the suspected boss of the trafficking group. Jeremy Douglas, Southeast Asia and Pacic representative for UNODC, said: “Tse Chi Lop is in the league of El Chapo or maybe Pablo Escobar. “The word kingpin often gets thrown around, but there is no doubt it applies here.” Sam Gor supplies a bigger, more dispersed drug market and collaborates with a more erse range of local crime groups than the Latin cartels do, including Japan’s Yakuza, Australiaaposs biker gangs and ethnic Chinese gangs across Southeast Asia, Reuters reports. “The crime groups in Southeast Asia and the Far East operate with seamless efficiency,” one veteran Western anti-drugs official said. “Theylike a global corporation.” "},{"url":null,"title":"first human baby born space","story":"NewsFirst human baby born in space will be delivered within the next  yearsDr Egbert Edelbroek, founder and chief executive of SpaceBorn United, made the huge claims at the first Space and Science Congress of Asgardia the Space Nation in Darmstadt, GermanyShareCommentsByNina Massey:,  OCT NewsFeet of a newborn baby are seen under a ultraviolet lamp\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

This is only possible, for now, in Lower Earth Orbit , and it is only possible thanks to a very thorough selection procedure, he said. The congress heard some of the requirements for participant expectant mothers, and medical staff.  These would include having experience of two flawless previous deliveries, and a high natural radiation resistance.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailDonald Trump went to Istanbul in  for the opening of the Trump Towers complex. The guest of honour was Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the country’s then Prime Minister, now the President. Trump, in between plugging the US version of The Apprentice, heaped praise on Erdogan. He said: “The Prime Minister is very highly respected.” Last week Trump did Erdogan another favour by withdrawing US troops from northern Syria where they were helping Kurdish forces contain the Islamic State threat. The US President effectively gave Erdogan the green light to launch an invasion, he calls it a “peace operation”, aimed at forcing out the Kurds from the region. What happens next could determine the fate of the Middle East and could redraw the battle lines in the power struggle between Russia and the West.    Erdogan is standing over a powder keg with a lit torch. When the EU protested at his military incursion he threatened to send into Europe the . million Syrian refugees Brussels has paid Turkey £.billion to look after. At the UN last month he lectured other nations about the refugees as he held a photo of Alan Kurdi, the three-year-old Syrian boy whose body washed ashore in Turkey in  after drowning trying to cross the Mediterranean. Nor does he appear to care that the Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces are being driven into the arms of Syria’s dictator Bashar al-Assad. The Turkish president has never been afraid of making enemies. Which may be just as well as he is about to make a lot more of them. Born in , the son of a coastguard, he supplemented the family’s meagre income by selling lemonade on Istanbul’s streets. After attending Islamic School he did a degree in business management before taking his first steps into politics. In the s he joined the Islamist National Salvation Party, challenging the secular tradition that had been the hallmark of Turkey since Mustafa Kemal Ataturk’s presidency in the s.    When Erdogan was banned from taking his seat in parliament in  he successfully stood to be Mayor of Istanbul in . In  he was jailed for four months for reading out an Islamist poem that included the lines “the mosques are our barracks, the domes our helmets, the minarets our bayonets and the faithful our soldiers.” Two years later he founded the Justice and Development Partywhich swept to power in  with Erdogan as Prime Minister. His initial years in power saw him reach out to a West that was, in those days, still hoping that Turkey could one day join the EU. Critics of his tendency to accumulate power and silence critics were won over by his economic reforms and technocratic flair. But it became increasingly hard to ignore his authoritarian tendencies. In  he became the country’s first directly-elected president. Then in  he used the aborted military coup to impose a state of emergency that saw him throttle dissent and imprison opponents. He then held a referendum in  to grant himself more powers. Erdogan abolished the post of Prime Minister and gave himself the right to appoint ministers and senior civil servants, issue decrees and oversee all security matters.    The United Nations Human Rights Office said the scale of the repression was “staggering”. In the past three years nearly , people have been arrested , civil servants sacked teachers, judges and lawyers prosecuted on trumped-up charges  journalists arrested , websites blocked and  media outlets shut down. Like Trump he is not adverse to large scale building projects, though his recently completed presidential palace in Ankara makes Trump Towers look like an exhibit from LegoLand. The building cost £million and has more than , rooms, including a laboratory where scientists can check the president’s food has not been poisoned. In the first sign that Erdogan’s grip on power may be fading, his party lost the Istanbul elections in March. After ordering a re-run on the unproven charges of vote rigging he was defeated again with the Republican People’s Party winning by an even bigger margin. The economy has also begun to slow with unemployment reaching % and inflation nudging %. His invasion of northern Syria is seen by some as a classic example of a leader using a military exercise to distract attention from domestic failings. Having won power as a nationalist hard man, Erdogan would have looked weakhe failed to move against Kurds he has long accused of being terrorists. The brutality witnessed on the domestic front has now extended to the foreign. Airstrikes on Kurdish territory by Turkey forces have killed innocent children and caused thousands of civilians to flee the area. Any chance of Turkey joining the EU has evaporated because of Erdogan’s autocratic rule. This has pushed the Turkish leader closer towards Vladimir Putin.

They were given a book commemorating his mum Dianaaposs visit to the region in September , when she wore a feathered cap and white coat. The Cambridges took time to shake hands with locals and learn about the effects of climate change on glacial landscapes on the third day of their royal tour to Pakistan.    The couple visited the Chitral district of Pakistanaposs Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province as they follow in the footsteps of Dianaaposs tour of Pakistan  years ago. On Tuesday, the Duke of Cambridge used a speech at the historic Pakistan Monument on the second day of their five-day visit to draw attention to spectacular glaciers melting in the area. Tomorrow we will be seeing some of these impacts first hand and meeting some of the communities adjusting to the new realities and new challenges that climate change has brought to their towns and villages, William told a reception on Tuesday evening.  I hope to learn what more we all can do to help prevent and mitigate this impending global catastrophe. Anticipated to walk around the glacieraposs northern tip, the excursion will be the first time the royal couple have seen a melting glacier in person. The couple hope to highlight the effect of global warming during the visit, which will also see them travel to a village in a valley of Chitral.  Isolated communities in the area have suffered from flash flooding in recent years as a result of the glaciers melting. While in the Chitral valley, the couple are also due to explore a site damaged in severe floods in , to meet the local community and hear how they are adapting their way of le in response to climate events.

That change was made after a - defeat to Rangers at Ibrox.Devlin said: “Thatprobably wasn’t ideal preparation.“However, I have to respect the Aberdeen manager in terms of his team selection because he knows what is best for the team.“I have got to work hard day on day to show I am improving and in the best shape possible for Aberdeen.“If that results in being called up to Scotland, then great.”Scotland brushed aside San Marino, the side rock bottom of the Fa world rankings, to move up to fourth in Group I. Devlin said: “We wanted to end the week on a high.“We had been really disappointed with the result in Russia but are delighted we can take positives from this.“Now we need to build momentum going into the next two games and hopefully this is the start of it.“Whenever you have a disappointment or a low you have to bounce back as quickly as possible to try to get that result and win under your belt.“That is what picks everyone up.“As disappointed as we were after Russia we had a big game to focus on against San Marino in our own stadium in front of our supporters.“They came in brilliant numbers to support us in Moscow and we wanted to try to send them home happy.“We were delighted with the six goals and to win the game.

Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee.

Two men were paid to accompany Patrick the Fool on his journey from England to provide entertainment for the King and his guests while residing at Tarbert.Also recorded is a figure for #making a suit for the King at Tarbert#.  Bruce visited Tarbert on many occasions. His final visit was in the year of his death.Tarbert is believed to have been one of the earliest Royal Burghs in Argyll. An early reference as such was made in . It is also said to have had one of the earliest paved streets in Scotland.King James IV also had a close connection with Tarbert. The addition of the #keep# to the castle, part of which still stands today, was constructed at his direction. Whilst this work was underway, James summoned parliament to meet him here to discuss matters local to the area. This meeting took place on July  .Over the years, many travellers of note have passed this way and commented on Tarbert and its scenic surroundings.In  Thomas Pennant arrived by sea at East Loch Tarbert and described the scenery as #picturesque#.CGS Teighnmouthpassed through the Kyles of Bute in  and commented that #it offers no scenery worthy of notice#. He continued to note that #the romantic little harbour of East Loch Tarbert – with the overhanging keep of its ruined castle # form a scene singularly picturesque#. He became a frequent visitor to Tarbert.In  Lord Cockburndescribed the Kyles as #rugged and picturesque# but, arriving at his destination, exclaimed: #But Tarbert! East Tarbert!

Similarly, Visit Scotland is reported as having raised no objection as well as closing all its tourist offices in Cowal, Mid Argyll and Kintyre in the past year.With the recent decline in the Loch Fyne fishing industry, Tarbert is increasingly dependent on tourism to provide employment.Other issues include the sterilisation of ground under the proposed line of overhead wiring. Opportunities to extend social housing will be restricted under the present plan.OFGEM administers a £ million fund set up to mitigate the impact of electricity infrastructure on national parks and #scenic areas#.Tarbert, along with its harbour and the isthmus linking it with West Loch Tarbert, without doubt, constitutes a #scenic area#.Reconsideration of this proposal is essential."},{"url":null,"title":"accordion and fiddle club back in tune","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe new season of Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club gets underway on Wednesday October .Guest artistes for the opening night are accordion maestro Gordon Pattullo from Coupar Angus, with Malcolm Ross on drums making a welcometo the club.Margaret Mather encouraged supporting players to join for a tune: #Without you there would be no club, so why not look out your accordion or fiddle and head for the Inveraray Inn.#This season, the club has opted for a new starting time of .pm for each session."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column october 4 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsTo an observer, it seems that Argyll and Bute Council is, at best, confused over its approach to autism.The people who know this best are those affected by the condition and their families and their view of senior council officials was made crystal clear when Autism Argyll gave up banging its head against a brick wall a year ago.Little seems to have changed since then.A council Autism Strategy Group is apparently being bypassed in the formulation of a strategy, yet the councillor in charge of health and social care says the strategy is the responsibility of the HSCP.Yet again, it is people affected by autism who are losing out.

These are big, old oaks.Appearing in support of the application, Gavin Yuill, of Galashiels-based Camerons Architects, said: ldquoIn relation to the design and placemaking, the one-and-a-half storey houses proposed are the most common house type in the rural Scottish Borders and in Minto village.ldquoThe two nearest neighbouring houses are both one-and-a-half storey, the set back of both proposed houses is consistent with the street and the stone, wet dash rendered walls, timber cladding, timber windows and doors, natural slate roofs and metal gutters are all consistent with the high-quality materials used in traditional Minto village.ldquoThe overwhelming number of retained trees, the replacement of all lost trees, and substantial new screen and hedge planting will reinforce the existing habitats and ensure that the bioersity is maximised.ldquoThese are demonstrated by the proposed landscaping drawings provided with the application.Also appearing in support of the applicant was Tim Ferguson, of Galashiels-based Ferguson Planning.He told the committee: ldquoA review of the housing analysis into the forthcoming local development plan again shows the signicant benefits windfall sites of this nature can have in meeting housing delivery targets.ldquoThe delivery of the annual housing targets are short of where they require to be and thusproposals of this nature will assist in meeting local needs.ldquoA signicant amount of housing within the Scottish Borders is met via small developments and self-build and indeed has occurred where within the confines of Mintorsquos settlement.ldquoThis subject site falls within the settlement boundary of Minto and is clearly in compliance with related planning policy principles and which has no defined restrictions upon it.Councillors also heard that planning officers are recommending the application be approved, subject to conditions.Galashiels councillor Sandy Aitchison said: ldquoMuch is made by the objectors that the buildings are not in keeping with Minto, yet the report from officers says that there are no two buildings the same in the village.ldquoTo be honest, they look okay to me but Irsquod need to see them in the context of what is already there.ldquoThe houses already there donrsquot look hugely architecturally important to me but perhaps Irsquom a Philistine.Members of the committee agreed to conduct a site visit, and to reconsider the application at the next meeting of the planning and building standards committee, which is due to meet on Monday, November ."},{"url":null,"title":"planned-early-years-centre-given-go-ahead","story":"COUNCIL planners have approved proposals to extend St Ronanrsquos Primary School in Innerleithen.Scottish Borders Council wants to construct a single-storey extension on the school, in order to meet demand generated by the Scottish Governmentrsquos decision to increase entitlement to free early learning and childcare provision.The new space will cater for  children, with  spaces allocated to two to three year olds, and  space set aside for three to five year olds.The plans will also see the relocation of the existing play area, a pumping station and water tank, and fenced nursery garden.A design statement, submitted by the councilrsquos in-house architect, reads: ldquoAccessibility and inclusivity have been a key focus during the design development.ldquoThe provision will be universally accessible and will offer a high-quality learning environment for the children and teaching staff.ldquoThe proposal has been developed to meet current and future teaching with the primary focus being on teaching spaces that are flexible and adaptive to cater for a iety of needs and learning experiences.ldquoThe design ethos has been simplied to provide a hierarchy of spaces from the two to three year oldrsquos playroom up to the three to five year oldrsquos playrooms with intermittent shared activity spaces in-between.ldquoLarge bi-folding doors within the play areas creates easy passage between the indoors and outdoors, encouraging independence and providing additional learning opportunities.ldquoA large canopy running theof the building strengthens the pedagogy of a seamless transition between the spaces and enables children to stay outdoors in wet weather conditions.ldquoFurthermore, it minimises solar gain during sunny weather.

He said: \"My initial concept was to produce a comparatively modest format, aimed at the photographically conscious visitor.\"By good fortune however, in engaging with Gerda as co-author, the scope and spirit of the work has been widened and deepened.\"The poems featured in this book have interacted with my images penetrating the veneer that can often dominate the city.\"All those prestigious castings and fine masonry may, collectively, have created one of Europersquos most beautul cities, but there were struggles in its making, and so often a human price was paid.\"I hope, therefore, it proves thought provoking at the very least.Gerda, who is an award-winning actor, songwriter and director as well as a writer, added: \"This has been a fascinating and welcome collaboration ndash an opportunity to reacquaint myself with my beloved home city, and its many contradictions.\"Irsquove relished both the process of responding to Allanrsquos vibrant images, and the way in which the

more lean muscle mass, research suggests.The new study comes after theInternational Association of Athletics Federationsruled on Monday that trans female athletes must lower their levels of testosterone to compete in the female category, following concerns that higher testosterone levels lead to a performance advantage over their peers.The IAAF said athletes must now keep their levels of natural testosterone below five nanomoles per litreof blood in order to compete in womenrsquos races.The new regulation is the same as that which applies to athletes with dferences of sexual

must take testosterone-reducing medication in order to compete in track events from m to the mile, or change to another distance.For the latest study, published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, experts led by the Karolinska Institute in Sweden said there was surprisingly little evidence on the effects of testosterone in women.They took  healthy, physically-active women aged  to

in the testosterone group also saw their levels of the hormone increase from . nmol L to . nmol L.Testosterone also led toan increase in lean muscle mass, even though body weight did not change, the findings showed.The total change in lean muscle mass over the  weeks was g for the testosterone group compared to just g for the placebo group.In the lower limbs, the typical change in lean muscle mass was g in the testosterone group compared to g in the placebo group.There were no dferences between the groups in other tests such as cycling on an exercise bike or squat jumps.The authors concluded: ldquoThe study supports a causal effect of testosterone in the increase in aerobic running time as well as lean mass in young, physically active women.They said the average increase in testosterone levels to . nmol l among the women given the hormone cream is below the average range found in men.Yet it still signicantly increased theof time the women could run before reaching

Assisted by Scott Souden’s low cross from the left flank, the substitute striker guided a delightful flick into the net beyond the Glynhill keeper. Taking on the role of target-man with gusto, Radecki played a big part in the Feathers-sponsored Pupils’ fourth goal, when he held off a defender down the right wing and crossed to substitute Calum McKillop, whose back-heel flick found Souden at the penalty spot, and the -year-old winger, making the journey home from Edinburgh for a game, passed the ball into the net with ease to complete the scoring.The game became a procession in the closing minutes with man-of-the-match Crossan, the midfield linchpin alongside the impressive Liam Renton, orchestrating some controlled possession football, but there was some trouble on  minutes when a malicious foul on ex-Dumbarton man D McCallum sparked into a melee with players from both sides involved. It resulted in a second booking for Kenny Kerr, a yellow for J McCallum, and a red card for the original Glynhill culprit, as well as yellow for the visiting keeper from referee Jimmy Litster, after charging from his own goalmouth to become involved.Undeterred, the Pupils settled back down to seal a richly deserved victory,achieved through a disciplined and determined performance.The Kintyre Park side will now enjoy a free week, with ato action scheduled for Saturday October , opponent to be confirmed.For fixture updates, and to see second-half action and goals from last Saturday’s match, see Campbeltown Football on Facebook, or @PupilsAFC on Twitter."},{"url":null,"title":"weather wont play fair for men","story":"Strong winds, for most of the players, deflected several balls into the severe rough and out of bounds and pushed scores upwards.Robert Shaw, one of the first out in the morning ballot, had an excellent round to finish on a nett  from Ken MacMillan on nett .The wind continued in the afternoon but didn#t deter John Docherty from the best scratch score of the day.

However, it was the home side that took the lead on the nd minute when Ashfield’s centre forward cut in from the left before sending an unstoppable shot in to the top corner.A test of character was required from the boys as they fell behind and with five minutes of the half remaining they were rewarded after a corner dropped to Stuart Phillps in the box. The young forward adjusted his feet quickly to send a beautul curling shot past everyone to make it -.Fteen minutes into the second half the Pupils took the lead. New signing Raphael MacLachlan, playing in only his second appearance for the s, sent in a delightful whipped corner that brushed off the Ashfield centre-half into the goal to make it -. The Clachan youngster can be proud of his impact on the game and is already proving to be a valuable addition to the team.As the Pupils pressed for their third of the game a long ball evaded the defence to allow the Ashfield number  in again to equalise with  minutes remaining.As the game drew to a close, it looked like both sides would share the points until a dramatic final minute. A long clearance by Ashfield was misjudged by the Pupils defence to allow Ashfield’s player in with a chance of his hat-trick but the youngster scuffed his shot into thankful hands of Pupils goal-keeper Lorne Paterson.Knowing it was the final minute, Paterson tried to kick the ball up the field as quickly as possible only for it to cannon off the back of Euan O’May’s head! It landed back in Paterson’s hands and he quickly dispersed the ball, long up the field where the ball bounced high over everyone, only for Calum Ellis to nip in front of the Ashfield centre-half, run in on goal, calmly round the advancing goal-keeper and stroke the ball home to make it - to the Ardshield Hotel-sponsored side – much to the delight of his fellow team mates and coaches.Ellis who has now scored seven goals in the Under s# opening four games.This weekend the team will enjoy a free fixture due before playing at home to Glasgow Boys Club on Sunday October ."},{"url":null,"title":"mcfadyens amam a tremendous days golf","story":"It was one of sponsor McFadyen Contractors Ltd#s own teams that won the trophy with a tremendous score of  # a mighty  under par.

We still recognise that as we have always said these interventions have to be considered part of a live trial and very much hoping it has a positive impact on the beach.ldquoFor residents and visitors, the beach has historically been a real draw.ldquoI think everybody who has been involved recognises that it has a very signicant economic value to the town."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource srcset=/resources/images/10403372.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"gerry-cinnamon-announces-second-glasgow-hydro-gig-popular-demand","story":"The Castlemilk singer recently told how he is to play the SSE Hydro on December  following his insane TRNSMT set.This morning the venue confirmed a second leg of his Glasgow show the next night for December .EXTRA DATE ANNOUNCED FOR @GerryCinnamon!! #Tickets for  +  December are on sale NOW... https:t.co JVHyTY pic yXRWuCIimPosting on social media the Hydro wrote: \"EXTRA DATE ANNOUNCED FORGerry Cinnamon.\"Tickets for  +  December are on sale NOW...\"We told previously howCinnamon, , told fans they had \"lost it\"they didnt think hed soon play in Glasgow and his latest output confirmed two December gigs for lucky punters to get excited about.He will also play Aberdeen in November."},{"url":null,"title":"watch-incredible-moment-karaoke-singer-stuns-hamilton-pub-nessun-dorma-performance","story":"William Boyle had the usually rowdy crowd at Bar West at a hushed silence as he bellowed through Paottis famous tune.The clip was posted on social media by user Ann Robertson who hailed the performer.:Watch boy, , belt out Bohemian Rhapsody on Central Station pianoShe said: \"I love all music but my absolute fave song in the whole world is Nessun Dorma by Luciano Paotti.\"I hope I dont embarass this gentleman but he nailed this in Bar West tonight n should be proud.

The prize he truly covets, of course, isa majority in parliament whether that happens off the back of a deal or no-deal is a mere moot point to this reckless PM.Despite a move to substantive negotiations, there is still no guarantee that a deal can or will be struck with the EU.

Why would they  Ms Sturgeon has been consistent from the outset: her party will not vote for any deal that takes Scotland and the UK out of the single market and customs union, causing untold damage to the Scottish economy. And since the current prime minister favours a harder, more isolationist and ideologically right-wing Brexit than even that fashioned by Mrs May, it is surely incumbent upon all UK opposition parties to fight tooth and nail to save the country from such a disastrous and isive path.Thatrsquos why they have no option but to vote down Mr Johnsonrsquos deal and force a general election, the circumstances of which will be vital in determining how it can be framed. After all, itrsquos not just Mr Johnsonrsquos tenure that must be keep short, but his list of options.The Lib Dems under Jo Swinson wonrsquot vote for any deal, not least because ldquogetting Brexit done would render their new \"stop Brexit altogether\" mandate redundant. And though itrsquos perhaps inevitable that some of the rebel Tories sitting on opposition benches might end up voting for the PMrsquos dealothers might decide to stick it to their former party and put the interests of the country first, especially since they are likely to lose their jobs anyway.

We looked at a wide range of things ndash infrastructure, communities, housing being some examples.ldquoWe realised very quickly that the biggest problem facing the island was housing and it had to be fixed before everything . Therersquos simply just not enough housing for people who are working normal jobs and we are talking about the whole spectrum of things you need for a community ndash from doctors and teachers to care workers and cleaners.At  per cent Arran has one of the highest rates of housing used for holiday or second homes in the UK, second only to St Ives in Cornwall, where one-quarter of properties are holiday homes.The average house price is pound,, while the average wage is only pound,. The AEG estimates that earnings of pound, are required to get on the housing ladder.A study carried out by the group warns that the lack of housing for workers will have serious impacts on the islandrsquos population as time goes on, with  jobs being lost due to lack of affordable accommodation each year with a pound.m loss to the local economy.After  years,things remain as they are, the employment impacts are expected to have risen to  jobs lost and a pound.m shortfall per annum.Ms Borthwick added: ldquoThere are job vacancies right across the island we canrsquot fill because therersquos nowhere for them to stay. What we want to do is build houses that people want to live in. North Ayrshire Council ndash the local authority for Arran ndash is also building new homes on the island to try to alleviate the problem.Councillor Jim Montgomerie, Cabinet Member for Place, said the signicant growth in the short-term lets market was causing particular problems.He added: ldquoWe know that second homes have an inflationary effect on housing markets, and this effect has been magnied on Arran where increasing access to affordable housing is particularly challenging because of land availability, land values, and high construction costs. We are preparing to begin construction of  new council homes on the island and while this new development wonrsquot eliminate the problem, it will be an important step towards addressing the issue."},{"url":null,"title":"snp-dissidents-keep-faith-leader","story":"One thing we can be certain of is that the vote to leave the EU fundamentally changed our expectations and perceptions of politicians. We both revere and vily them as never before.In using legal prowess to cut a path through the arcane procedures of the House of Commons, Dominic Grieve and Joanna Cherry have emerged as unlikely heroes ndash or baddies, depending on your perspective. A recent poll for Sky News showed that only one in seven people trust Parliament on Brexit.That lack of trust cannot be separated from the widespread perception that the public are not being told the full story ndash or even the synopsis ndash from those in power. As ldquoDowning Street sourcesrsquorsquo release briefing and counter-briefing ndash often contrary to Government policy ndash the effect is a dizzying upending of reality.Will they do what they say they will, and do they even want to As we pin our hopes on the wisdom of our elected representatives while also doubting their intentions, the cracks in the pillars of our democracy worsen.It looks a lot like the rules have changed, and that the conventions that previously governed the honesty of politics have been gradually eroded.One politician who has emerged relatively unscathed from the Brexit process thus far is Nicola Sturgeon. Ironically, her greatest political challenges at present come not from the electorate, but from critics within her own party.There is internal stre over her approach to a second independence referendum, tensions which have been exasperated with every juddering lurch of the Brexit crisis. The constant ticking of the countdown clock, as we have edged nearer to each deadline in the Article  process, has ramped up the disgruntlement and impatience within the SNP.As Ms Sturgeon took to the airwaves for a mammoth media round on the second day of SNP conference on Monday, she set out her short and long-term priorities on Brexit and independence.She wants to see Boris Johnson fulfil the obligations placed upon him by the Benn Act to request a three-month extensionParliament hasnrsquot passed his deal ndash or given its support for no-deal ndash by October . It is her hope that the opposition parties will manage to get their act together and that a General Election will follow soon after.She also confirmed that indyref will be ldquofront and centrersquorsquo in the SNPrsquos campaign in the upcoming General Election. With the SNP projected to win the most seats in Scotland, she hopes the momentum is with her party to negotiate over holding another vote.Her strategy relies on Labour forming a minority government with the support of opposition parties. The price of the SNPrsquos support will be for prime minister Jeremy Corbyn to grant a Section  order so a referendum can be held.However, there is a widespread expectation that any such request would be refused, either by an emboldened Mr Johnson ed as prime minister with a majority ndash or a witless Mr Corbyn who refuses to give ground to earn the SNPrsquos support. If that scenario materialises, the undercurrent of party dissent could threaten to burst its banks.:Andy Maciver: Scottish independence is inevitable  Im not so sureA ldquoPlan B to counteract this, supported by SNP councillor Chris McEleny and others, would see a pro-independence majority at the next election being taken as a mandate to enter straight into independence negotiations with the UK government.Ms Sturgeon holds no truck for this muddy proposal, or indeed any deviation from the ldquogold-standardrsquorsquo route to independence that was pursued in . In one interview recently she pointed out that the Westminster voting system makes it possible for the SNP to win the most seats in Scotland, but on a minority of votes. In an age of relentless spin and endless loophole-searching to rig the system, her candour was refreshing.Lets not forget the catalyst for the runaway train of crisis we have seen since  was a leader ndash in David Cameron ndash who bowed to pressure from a minority in his party to seek an answer to a question that, at the time, very few were asking.It is easy to see why the naturally-cautious Ms Sturgeon would want to avoid the legal and constitutional headache that Plan B would bring.She believes that the knee-jerk refusal from Unionist parties to allow a second independence referendum is untenable and that it would be a democratic outrage for Westminster parties of any colour to deny Scotland the right to have a say on its future. While compelling, this argument does rely heavily on the politics of yesteryear: where manesto commitments and election victories meant something, and political reality had an impact on events. In the Brexit Britain of today, it is unlikely that a desire to be ndash or be seen to be ndash fair and reasonable will be enough to compel Mr Johnson or Mr Corbyn to concede to the SNPrsquos demands.But Ms Sturgeon is an experienced political operator and it is inconceivable that she will not have planned for that eventuality. Perhaps too quietly for some, perhaps in too guarded a manner to quell the disquiet from her party, but she will have planned nonetheless.:Nicola Sturgeon in row over unofficial email accountGiven that, it would have been wise of her critics to wait at least until that key moment before declaring that they had lost faith in her ability to secure a second referendum.If some in the SNP got their way, theyrsquod have her abandon moderation and diplomacy during the Brexit crisis. After all, Mr Johnson fights dirty, so why shouldnrsquot she Some may see her unwillingness to play the game under the new, gloves-off, Brexit rules as weakness. Others now question whether she really wants independence at all. In doing so they undermine one of their partyrsquos greatest assets ndash a leader who hasnrsquot lost a sense of perspective and public duty.You get the sense that a chunk of SNP supporters long for the bombastic days of Alex Salmond, believing that in the current political climate, bullishness and bul***t is power. They should be careful what they wish for.When the time comes for Scotland to decide its future, voters will be asked to put their trust in the arguments made by politicians. Having a leader who still plays by the rules and isnrsquot prone to party-political flights of fancy will be an asset for the campaign.For that reason, MsSturgeonrsquos critics should be wary of deciding that their captain is a dud or declaring the game over before it has even begun."},{"url":null,"title":"nail-bars-car-washes-consumers-must-not-ignore-modern-slavery","story":"Irsquom sure there are people who enjoy the chore - the routine of it, the pride in the finished result, care given to their pride-and-joy vehicle. No thanks.Why find space in onersquos busy schedule for hard labour when for a mere pound. you can have five men clean your car til its glinting Well, becauseit seems too good to be true then itrsquos likely to be too good to be true.More likely, a pound. car wash means those five people are being exploited as cheap labour. Possibly they are victims of modern slavery, perhaps they have been trafficked.But, given the proleration of hand car washes and the queues at them daily - and nightly, many of the car washes are open long hours - this fact is obviously easy enough for people to turn a blind eye to.Itrsquos interesting that modern day slavery has entered the public consciousness with regards to the clothing industry. We know quite well that our cheap clothes - the pound. swimsuit, the pound pair of jeans - come at a price that is far from economic. There is shock when big name, reputable brands are found to be churning out clothes in factories where workers are paid p an hour to toil in squalid conditions.Boycott, comes the cry.Just yesterday an exposeacute in thenewspaper alleged that workers in a factory making clothing for the high end active wear brand Lululemon are being subjected to cruel treatment - beatings, verbal abuse and pressure to work overtime. They are paid, it is claimed, around pound a month, which is less than the cost of one pair of Lululemon leggings.The company has said it will launch an immediate investigation, no doubt acting swtly and sharply because it knows the gross ill treatment of Bangladeshi female factory workers will play extremely badly with its middle class, socially aware customer base. Will boycott become the cry for Lululemon Yet when poor working conditions exist on our doorstep, we somehow find it easier to overlook.Nail bars are another consumer convenience where modern day slavery prolerates. They satisfy the desire for a bargain, make you feel good and therersquos no inconvenience of having to book ahead for an appointment. In the current financial climate, women have less money to spend on beauty treats and so something like a regular manicure is an addictive temptation for some.But is it ethical to continue to go to a nail baryou believe you may be participating in exploitation  Itrsquos easy for me to ask: the one and only time Irsquove set foot in a nail bar was accompanying a Police Scotland operation on human trafficking. If I was a woman keen on regular manicures and pedicures, would I be, as with the car washes, uncomfortable but still settling down for a file and polish The restructuring of how we shop has created an environment in which it is easy for exploitation to go unchecked. As with nail bars satisfying the need for a quick, cheap treatment, petrol stations are under pressure as consumers find it more convenient to fill up at supermarket petrol pumps rather than make two journeys to two locations.This means a decrease in the number of mechanical car washes and an increase in vacant space to be taken over by... exploitative hand car washes. Which is not to say that all car washes are exploitative. The UK body the Car Wash Advisory Service has an accreditation scheme, WashMark, that drivers can look out for.Drivers and nail bar customers can also easily look out for the signs of exploitation: workers who canrsquot communicate with customers in English, where the staff appear withdrawn or very young, where they are living in houses of multiple occupancy.A high profile court case last week saw four members of a gang found guilty of trafficking young Roma women and girls from Slovakia to Govanhill, to flats just a couple of streets away from where I live. One of the young women was sold into a sham marriage for pound, outside a branch of Primark in Glasgow city centre. The story captured readers in high numbers, likely from the shock of having such a heinous crime against such a familiar background.Yet exploitation is happening all around us and it needs consumers to be alert to the issue in order to tackle it.The Scottish Government commissioned a public survey this year on public responses to human trafficking. It found that respondents saw the crime as less of an issue in Scotland than overseas. In ,  per cent of people saw modern slavery as an issue in Scotland, falling to  per cent this year.People were far more likely to believe modern slavery to be an issue in Europe and the rest of the world - showing an awareness of the subject but a belief that it doesnrsquot happen here. Some  per cent of respondents admitted to a low level of understanding of human trafficking.At an event a few years ago I was chatting to a chap who said he owned a handful of car washes at dferent locations in the west of Scotland. He was quite confident in the ethics of his working practice, saying all his staff earned pound for a  hour day and were given a hot meal at lunchtime.The justication he gave to me was the men he employed would otherwise be out of work. With little English, no qualications and no support networks in Scotland, they would be destitute. He saw exploitation as, in fact, a gt to his staff, a generous springboard into a better le.That was the last time I visited the hand car wash.

There is another side to this story, and it remains to be seen whether the lurking risks for the yes campaign have been fully baked into their thinking.At the centre of this is the weekend poll showing unionist:nationalist sentiment at :. This was lauded as a breakthrough the first time a Panelbase poll has recorded such success. It is progress - of that there can be absolutely no doubt. But I am not at all convinced that it is enough. It was not so long ago that ostensibly senior people were briefing the media that they considered % pro-independence polling to be the point at which it was safe to agitate for another referendum. They talked of the stars aligningBrexit turned into a quagmireandBoris Johnson became Prime Minister . How many more stars do they need I see a requirement, from the nationalistsrsquo perspective, for the polling to be signicantly higher, because those lurking risks are real, and they provide a very competitive counterweight to the demographic idend.:SNP to scrap council fees for at home careDespite the polling indicating a perceived stronger economic future inside the EU than inside the UK, it remains a moot point whether economics will again be the Achilles Heel of the Yes campaign. It cannot be downplayed - the fiscal deficit is dismal, the currency question is further spiced by the inevitable debate over whether or not Scotland will have to join the Euro, and the Green-inspired drt to the left is creating an electorally worrying gap between personal tax rates north and south of the border, a gap which is only likely to expand.Other signicant drivers of voter behaviour will undoubtedly be more prevalent this time around. Voters in Scotland have had an election or referendum every year since  with the exception of last year, which despite the lack of a poll was anything but stable. By the time the next referendum comes around, we will have had another two national elections and, presumably, a formal exit from the EU.Lenin said there are decades when nothing happens, and weeks when decades happen. We are living that, now, and after the UK eventually leaves the EU it is a monumental request of the politically-fatigued Scottish people to plunge themselves into another potentially dficult constitutional negotiation.And then there is the EU relationship itself, in which so much stock is placed. For what itrsquos worth, I think that we are in a manufactured state. I say as a Remain voter that much of the Europhilia coursing through Scotland is faux, with no real foundation. It is a knee-jerk response to current turmoil. When we leave, votersrsquo default assumptions, and the starting point from which they decide which box to cross, will change.In essence, we will be asking Scottish voters to choose the EU over the UK. We will be asking them to leave a union to which they retain a fair emotional attachment, to join one to which their emotional attachment is unproven, at best. We may even be asking them to authorise the creation of some sort of, albeit probably limited, Scotland-England border checks.It is the ask of asks. So much so that I find it dficult to see the SNPrsquos official position being to immediately rejoin the EU.

Since its inception in , the award has only twice before been shared. First was in , when Nadine Gordimer and Stanley Middleton were twinned, and again in , with Michael Ondaatje and Barry Unsworth. After that regrettable outcome, whereby both writersrsquo thunder was stolen, the rules were changed, vetoing this ever happening again.During rsquos final meeting, Florence and his team ndash Liz Calder, Xiaolu Guo, Afua Hirsch and Joanna McGregor ndash were reluctant or unable to make a clear-cut decision. Asking for advice, they were reminded of the rules. Gaby Wood, of the Booker Prize Foundation, reported that, ldquoThey were not so much ided as unwilling to jettison any more when they finally got down to two, and askedthey might split the prize between them. On being told that it was definitively against the rules, the judges held a further discussion and chose to flout them. They left the judging room happy and proud...Should they be proud  I donrsquot think so. That rule was in place to prevent exactly what is already happening. The impact on an author of winning this prestigious title can be dramatic, as last yearrsquos laureate, Anna Burns, made clear in her speech to the literati in Londonrsquos glitzy medieval Guildhall. Gaining the imprimatur of the Booker brings a blaze of international attention, and a Himalayan spike in sales that no sensible novelist would dare dream of, for fear of waking up to the grim reality of meagre royalties that make the living wage look like a Euro Lottery windfall.Margaret Atwood, a previous winner, hinted as much when accepting the accolade. More than anyone, she understands the stakes. This was attention she does not need, her career already illustrious, and she was gracious in acknowledging that. Perhaps she also knows The Testaments isnrsquot in the same class as some of her earlier work. It is not one of the best books Irsquove read this year, although one that is ndash Lucy Ellmannrsquos Ducks, Newburyport, which was shortlisted ndash was a strong contender for first place.Atwood, to my mind, was given her share of the trophy because of the hype around her long-awaited follow-up and its cult following, thanks in large part to the recent television series. But even had it been her finest novel yet, the judges have been cruel to Bernardine Eisto. She is the first black woman to win, a good news story by any standards. That triumph should have been shouted from the rooftops. What a great statement it would have been for her to have been selected, head and shoulders above the rest. Instead, a  that consisted of four women and one man did a disservice to a writer who deserved the full glory, and the full commercial boost, that this distinction brings.The make-up of the judging  is interesting, reflecting the need for greater ersity, and less male dominance, in literary decision-making. And yet this predominantly female group, drawn from a iety of backgrounds and disciplines, blew it.

Since its inception in , the award has only twice before been shared. First was in , when Nadine Gordimer and Stanley Middleton were twinned, and again in , with Michael Ondaatje and Barry Unsworth. After that regrettable outcome, whereby both writersrsquo thunder was stolen, the rules were changed, vetoing this ever happening again.During rsquos final meeting, Florence and his team ndash Liz Calder, Xiaolu Guo, Afua Hirsch and Joanna McGregor ndash were reluctant or unable to make a clear-cut decision. Asking for advice, they were reminded of the rules. Gaby Wood, of the Booker Prize Foundation, reported that, ldquoThey were not so much ided as unwilling to jettison any more when they finally got down to two, and askedthey might split the prize between them. On being told that it was definitively against the rules, the judges held a further discussion and chose to flout them. They left the judging room happy and proud...Should they be proud  I donrsquot think so. That rule was in place to prevent exactly what is already happening. The impact on an author of winning this prestigious title can be dramatic, as last yearrsquos laureate, Anna Burns, made clear in her speech to the literati in Londonrsquos glitzy medieval Guildhall. Gaining the imprimatur of the Booker brings a blaze of international attention, and a Himalayan spike in sales that no sensible novelist would dare dream of, for fear of waking up to the grim reality of meagre royalties that make the living wage look like a Euro Lottery windfall.Margaret Atwood, a previous winner, hinted as much when accepting the accolade. More than anyone, she understands the stakes. This was attention she does not need, her career already illustrious, and she was gracious in acknowledging that. Perhaps she also knows The Testaments isnrsquot in the same class as some of her earlier work. It is not one of the best books Irsquove read this year, although one that is ndash Lucy Ellmannrsquos Ducks, Newburyport, which was shortlisted ndash was a strong contender for first place.Atwood, to my mind, was given her share of the trophy because of the hype around her long-awaited follow-up and its cult following, thanks in large part to the recent television series. But even had it been her finest novel yet, the judges have been cruel to Bernardine Eisto. She is the first black woman to win, a good news story by any standards. That triumph should have been shouted from the rooftops. What a great statement it would have been for her to have been selected, head and shoulders above the rest. Instead, a  that consisted of four women and one man did a disservice to a writer who deserved the full glory, and the full commercial boost, that this distinction brings.The make-up of the judging  is interesting, reflecting the need for greater ersity, and less male dominance, in literary decision-making. And yet this predominantly female group, drawn from a iety of backgrounds and disciplines, blew it. What might have been a historic moment, representing a signicant cultural turning point, has had its impact blunted, its signicance diminished.The reasoning behind this is hard to understand.

Scotland ndash its people, its government, its parliament, has been disregarded and disrespected by the UK Government.And here we are, with Prime Minster Boris Johnson riding roughshod over our democratic will as he accelerates towards the clf edge on his big Brexit bus, with the UKrsquos jobs, economy and living standards dragged along behind.The Scottish Government has been ramping up preparations for this possible outcome, developing mitigation measures to cushion Scotland from the no-deal Brexit blow as much as we can.However, we are by no means accepting of this outcome ndash we continue to do everything in our power to prevent it and indeed stop any form of Brexit. But given the risks we face, preparing for the impact of a no-deal Brexit is the necessary and responsible thing to do.We know thatthe UK leaves the EU without a deal, Scotland faces traffic disruption on Northern Ireland routes - so we are looking at repurposing the disused port at Stranraer to hold up to  HGVs to help manage the flow.\"@context\": \"https:schema.org\",\"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\"name\": \"Sturgeon to request transfer of power at end of this year\",\"description\": \"Sturgeon to request transfer of power at end of this year\",\"thumbnailUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer v media OCdTGiSj poster.jpg width\",\"uploadDate\": \"--T::+:\",\"duration\": \"PDTHMS\",\"contentUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer manests OCdTGiSj.mu\",\"embedUrl\": \"https:www.heraldscotland video  \",\"publisher\": \"@type\": \"Organization\",\"name\": \"HeraldScotland\",\"logo\": \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\"url\": \"https:www.heraldscotland sitelogo \",\"width\": ,\"height\": Small business, including our world-renowned food and drink sector, face massive challenges - so we are enabling suppliers to work more flexibly and making up to pound. million available to help small and medium-sized businesses prepare for exiting.Local authorities are also facing additional Brexit related pressures - so we are working extremely closely organisations such as COSLA and have released pound. million to councils for their own preparations.All of these consequences are serious - but in a no-deal scenario there is a signicant risk to the health and welfare of our most vulnerable people. As the outgoing Chief Medical Officer to England warned last week ndash lives are at risk.We have set up a Scottish Medicines Shortage Response Group to review evidence and recommend action in the event we experience major impacts on the supply of medicines and medical devices.A no-deal Brexit also has the potential to drive up prices by % - affecting those on lowest incomes the most, pushing an additional , people into poverty. We have set out plans for a pound million Rapid Poverty Mitigation Fund to help those most in need get support quickly.But these plans cannot mitigate the full impact of a no-deal Brexit. No amount of preparation can prevent the catastrophic damage it will inflict upon the country, so we need to stop it in its tracks.The people of Scotland have suffered enough under the Tories. Their damaging Brexit pursuit has already shrunk the economy by pound billion. If they succeed in imposing a no-deal on us, it risks , Scottish jobs and a recession.:Nicola Sturgeon says indyref must happenWhilst it is the Tories pursuing this ruinous agenda, they will not be the only ones to blame for such an outcome.The SNP at Westminster has worked constructively with opposition parties but every day the Lib Dems and Labour sit on their hands and shrink away from a motion of no confidence is another day the Tories are in power.Jo Swinson seems more interested in letting Tories into her party than kicking them out of office. And Labour is more focussed on fighting its own ranks than fighting Tory austerity.Together we have a job to do. The SNP is not for propping up a Tory Government - and nor should the other parties be.Itrsquos time to get these Tories out of office and put power back in the hands of the people with a general election.Twenty years on from devolution, it cannot be denied that Scotland is a better place because of it. But many of the key powers over Scotland remain at Westminster ndash and leaving them there is risking our future prosperity.The past few years have already forever changed the UK as we know it.There is no mandate in Scotland for Brexit. But there is a mandate for a referendum on independence.And there is momentum - polls show support for independence is growing, as is support for an independence referendum. Nobody has the right to block that decision from being made.Scotland can be part of a broken Brexit Britain, or we can take our place as an equal partner in a group of independent nations.Itrsquos time Scotland is able to make that choice.This article originally appeared in The Evening Times"},{"url":null,"title":"kemnay post office set to reopen in 2019","story":"The Kemnay Post Office is set to reopen next month in a new location.The Post Office has announced that the new community branch will be located at the McColl’s shop on Aquithie Road.The new location is just a short walk from the previous Post Office on High Street, which has been temporarily closed since October due to the resignation of the previous Postmaster and the withdrawal of the premises for Post Office use.When the move goes ahead, the branch will open, from am–pm Monday to Saturday and am–pm on Sunday.

The governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, has admitted there are “known errors” in the RPI system and last year called for the UK Government to stop issuing bonds linked to it.But that advice has come too late for many local authorities in Scotland which are now shelling out millions more in costs for schools that were built under private finance initiatives.Costs of other Scottish PFI schemes, from prisons to hospitals, have also been rocketing since the deals were agreed.A Scottish Government spokesman said PFI had left “taxpayers in Scotland liable for a £ billion legacy of payments”.He added: “The annual PFI repayment bill now exceeds £ billion – nearly five times more than the Non-Profit Distributingprogramme which we introduced and is proving far better value to the public purse.“The funding of public infrastructure has vastly improved since . “We are working to ensure PFI contracts which have been inherited provide the best value for money for the taxpayer – and to ensure savings are achieved from existing contracts, wherever possible.”The Scottish Government is understood to be eyeing a model of public-private partnerships pioneered by the Welsh Government.Like PFI, the so-called Mutual Investment Model sees private partners build and maintain public assets for a fee.But the deals do not include services like cleaning, which have proved costly through PFI. The model also involves the public sector as a minority co-investor, taking a share of the profits.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.donsidepiper webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Figures published by Facebook show that #. million was spent on political ads on Facebook or sister site Instagram.\"  Thousands spent on targeted Facebook adverts by Scottish politicians viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"DONS | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"DONS | Article Teaser\"Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard has pledged to ban any further public-private finance dealshis party takes power.“Scotland’s historical PFI deals have put unnecessary pressure on our NHS, our local government services and right across the public sector,” he said.“That is why I have been clear that the Scottish Labour government that I lead will introduce a ban on new PFI PPP NPD deals.“We will also take private contracts back in-house at the earliest opportunity to save the taxpayer money in the long term.”The JPI Media investigations team has been looking into PFI contracts across the UK.According to figures obtained from hundreds of public bodies, rocketing inflation and extra costs are set to add at least £ billion to the overall price tag of PFI schemes.Among its findings, the team found that:• An NHS maternity unit built and run by a private company was closed after just  years but is still costing the taxpayer millions of pounds• A police force is trying to think up new uses for a mothballed custody suite it is still paying for• Expensive maintenance contracts have seen one police force billed £ for an extra chair.Trade union leaders have called for urgent action.Unite assistant general secretary Gail Cartmail said the escalating costs of PFI were a “national scandal”.She said: “The money that has poured into the pockets of profit-hungry financial institutions and private companies could have been much better spent directly on public service projects and infrastructure. “PFIs are a rip-roaring example of out-of-control ‘bandit capitalism’.”"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"October ,  at : amCalMac Ferries are challenging Transport Scotland on its decision to award the Northern Isles ferry contract to competitor Serco Ltd.

It neither meets the needs of the local community nor the standards people in Orkney have a right to expect from their leline service.“I have raised these concerns with the First Minister and Transport Secretary in the past, highlighting the impact on constituents. I was given assurances that it would be addressed in the new contract.“Given the announcement that Serco Northlink has been chosen as the preferred bidder, it is important that the Scottish Government now claries what the arrangements will be for the forthcoming refit period.#The new contract needs to address the failings of the current contract and ensure that this leline route is served during the refit period by a vessel that is fit for purpose”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

As is tradition, an ensign, which has been tied to the wreck of the battleship was presented to a family member of one of the crewmen. This year, it was presented to Allan Myers from Stoke-on-Trent, whose father, marine George Myers, was lost aboard the battleship.HMS Royal Oak sank to the bottom of Scapa Flow after it was torpedoed by the German submarine U-.

Competitive pricing from hotels and other accommodation providers in Aberdeen has undoubtedly contributed to this, but that also acts as reassurance there are other options available for those who need it. Bookings are not being taken beyond the end of October, which is the intended date of closure subject to the outcome of our consultation with affected staff.“We will continue to offer other British Red Cross services from other locations in the city.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

However, I was shocked to hear that Easyjet would not permit me to travel. Instead, I was advised to go to my ‘embassy’. I explained that I was a UK citizen and, hence, had no embassy in London. The customer services person then told me to go to the passport office – even though I had not lost my passport.”Desperate to catch her flight home, Dr Ruxton visited the passport office as instructed, despite the fact her passport had been left safely at home in Scotland.Read more: Easyjet founder claims victory in ‘Easy’ name battle with ChinaShe said: “As predicted, they told me that, since I had not lost my passport and needed no ID toto Scotland, they could do nothing for me. I even tried to contact DVLA to obtain another driving licence but was told that I had to apply online and it would take a week to arrive - at my home address.”AdviceEasyJet’s customer service team repeatedly told Dr Ruxton that customers are always advised to “validate their travel documents with the local embassy” and that she had needed to obtain an emergency travel document from consular staff - despite her telling them that she was a British citizen and was in the UK.She was forced to borrow money from a work colleague living in London and bought a rail fare to Scotland - at a cost of £.After directly contacting Easyjet’s head of customer relations, John Leighton, via LinkedIn on her , the customer service team eventually offered Dr Ruxton a £ voucher, but reiterated that she should have visited her embassy in London - and had refused to follow their advice.Dr Ruxton said: “I declined the voucher. All I want is for them to say ‘Sorry for giving you the wrong advice’ and refund me the £ I had to pay out for my train fare.“The Easyjet ‘line to take’ – that a UK citizen living in Scotland who has been a victim of crime should have to go to an embassy to prove their identity in order to get home – displays a worrying lack of understanding about the nature of the United Kingdom and a lack of care for customers.”Read more: These are the companies which have been rated the worst for customer serviceThe UK Government confirmed that there was no British Embassy in London for British citizens.A spokesman for EasyJet said: \"We are sorry that Mrs Ruxton and her daughter were unable to travel on their flight on  July and were incorrectly informed, as a UK citizen, to contact the embassy. \"It was correct, however, that photo ID is required as they had hold luggage and so this is required for safety reasons. This meant the documentation she had was not sufficient to be able to travel.

Personal attacks on opponents, third-rate jokes, laboured puns, and extravagant claims of future success are all fair game in the conference hall, likely to provoke an enthusiastic response from starry-eyed, ultra-loyal, party activists, many nursing hangovers from the previous night’s festivities.It is in this context that we should view Finance Secretary Derek Mackay’s comments to the SNP conference in Aberdeen on Monday, specically his claim that the economic case for independence is “stronger than ever”. Scotland can “more than afford to be independent”, Mr Mackay told SNP delegates.The timing of the Finance Secretary’s comments was somewhat unfortunate, coming out on the very morning that the latest Royal Bank of Scotland PMI report showed that manufacturing firms in Scotland had suffered a sharp drop in output last month, and a steeper decline in new orders. Scotland ranked only above Northern Ireland in parts of the United Kingdom in terms of business confidence, trailing behind the UK average.: Queen’s Speech rejects call to repeat ‘once in a generation’ independence vote: Poll: Support for Scottish independence hits %It is not just on this measure that the Scottish economy is underperforming, after  years of SNP Government. We are in a decade of below average economic growth, with unemployment rates in Scotland higher than the UK average, and employment rates signicantly lower. On one estimate, there are some , more adults of working age in Scotland economically inactive compared to the UK average. Their participation in the workforce would provide a signicant boost to the Scottish economy, not to mention a considerable contribution towards income tax revenues.Independence miracle unlikelyNotwithstanding the SNP’s disappointing track record on economic issues, we are now expected to believe that independence will see a miraculous improvement not just in economic performance, but in our fiscal position. How, exactly, this is likely to come about remains a mystery. The Scottish Government’s own figures told us in August that we run a nominal annual deficit of £.bn, representing seven per cent of Scotland’s GDP. This translates into a Union Dividend of just short of £, for every man, woman and child in Scotland. It is this level of fiscal transfer from other parts of the UK that supports higher levels of public spending here, and these funds would require to be replaced in the event of separationwe were not to see dramatic tax hikes, swingeing public service cuts, or a combination of both.We are still no clearer what exactly the SNP would do to fill Scotland’s fiscal gap post-independence, beyond vague promises about the need to “grow the economy”. At least the  White Paper had one policy proposal which might have driven forward economic growth: the promise to cut corporation tax by three per cent below the UK rate. But even that has now been ditched.SNP politicians will talk about how Scexit will allow Scotland to pursue a more liberal immigration policy, with a growing population driving economic expansion. Scotland’s track record in this area, after  years of SNP Government, gives little cause to be optimistic on that particular front.Woeful lack of planningDespite having free movement of people within the EU for decades, levels of inward migration to Scotland have been lower than average for the UK as a whole. What exactly would reverse this trend and attract more European immigrants to Scotland in the future – with higher taxes than the rest of the UK and with all the economic uncertainties around independence – is far from clear.It is not just on the question of fiscal balances that the SNP’s economic prospectus is threadbare. We are still no clearer as to what exactly the currency of an independent Scotland would be, but the preference now seems to be for ditching the pound sterling and adopting an alternative, presenting clear challenges for Scottish businesses trading with the rest of the UK.Moreover, at the weekend Nicola Sturgeon refused to rule out the prospect of a hard border between the Solway and Tweed in the event of Scexit, again presenting huge challenges for Scottish business. The UK domestic market is worth three times more to Scottish exporters than the value of the EU Single Market, yet the SNP, in an exercise in economic absurdity, wants to prioritise the latter over the former.Against this backdrop, it is little wonder that whilst Scottish businesses whom I speak to on a regular basis may have their concerns about a no-deal Brexit, by far their greater concern is the prospect of independence – with a dferent currency, a hard border, a massive fiscal deficit, and a woeful lack of any long-term plan.If Brexit tells us anything, it is that extracting ourselves from a -year-old economic union is more complex than anyone first imagined. On any logical basis, dissolving a -year-old economic, social and political union will be many times more problematic.The fact is that the economic case for the Union is stronger than ever. Despite all the noise coming out of the SNP conference at Aberdeen this week, there is no evidence that that situation is about to change any time soon.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"bbc scotland presenter judith ralston swears after fluffing weather report","story":"Scottish weather presenter Judith Ralston swore on last nights Seven Days review programme after forgetting part of her report. window.twttr The BBC Scotland presenter was quick to apologise for saying the F-word before her sound was cut.

By the new year, we will have completed our legislative preparations.“We are already working to update the independence prospectus.“And I can confirm today that before the end of this year, I will demand the transfer of power that puts the legality of a referendum beyond any doubt.“And when I do, the question should not be to the SNP – what will we doWestminster refuses “The question should be demanded of the Westminster parties – what gives you any right to deny people in Scotland our ability to choose our own future ”The Edinburgh agreementWestminster has control over the constitution and agreement must struck to transfer power to Holyrood to stage such a vote, similar to the Edinburgh Agreement reached between Alex Salmond and David Cameronin  But this has been refused by Boris Johnson with the Queen’s Speech at Westminster this week effectively rejecting another referendum.It prompted one leading Scottish Government minister, constitution secretary Mike Russell, to warn this week that a court challenge to secure Scotland’s right to stage a second referendum “cannot be ruled out.”But the First Minister insisted yesterday that the problem is the current constitutional set-up.She said: “That problem is the Westminster political union. For Scotland, Brexit shows that the Westminster system is broken.“And it is broken utterly beyond repair.”• : Scottish independence: A key sign SNP could be winning the argument – Ian SwansonMs Sturgeon insisted her government had a “cast-iron mandate for an independence referendum”.\u2028She added: “That fact is beyond doubt.“But we don’t just have a right to offer the people of Scotland a choice over their future. In the circumstances now Scotland faces, we have a duty to do so.“And it is what we intend to do.”BrexitThe fallout of the  Brexit referendum, which saw Scots vote to remain in the UK, was branded a “disaster” by Ms Sturgeon.She added: “Whatever happens over the next few weeks it will continue to dominate Westminster for years to come. There is no sense in which it will be ‘done’.“We don’t yet know whether the UK will leave with a deal or without. But we do know that neither of these outcomes is in Scotland’s interests.”While she said a no-deal Brexit would be “unthinkable” she added that “a deal of the type Boris Johnson is proposing would not be much better”.The First Minister said: “His plans would take Scotland out of the EU, out of the single market and out of the customs union.” “Let me make this absolutely clear today, SNP MPs will not vote for that - not now, not ever.”With a general election widely expected in the coming months Ms Sturgeon said it “can’t some soon enough.”She added: “When it does our message will be clear, simple and unambiguous - vote SNP to demand independence and secure Scotland’s right to choose.Ms Sturgeon said: “Some polls suggest that an election might result in a hung parliament.“The SNP will never put the Tories into power.“But I have a message for any Westminster party that wants SNP support.“If you don’t respect Scotland’s right to choose our own future at a time of our own choosing, don’t even bother picking up the phone.”Tory interim leader Jackson Carlaw said the speech showed that Ms Sturgeon’s priorities were not domestic issues her Government has responsibility for.“Nicola Sturgeon wants to be judged on health and education, yet she couldn’t spare a single sentence for either during this y and isive speech,” he said.“Instead, she simply wanted to get through what was a potentially hostile conference with a series of vacuous promises which will never be kept, and throw some red meat to the hardliners.He added: “When she does demand the powers to hold a second unwanted and isive referendum, the answer should be an unequivocal no.”Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie warned independence would mean “cuts and tax rises.”He added: “Independence will be bad for Scotland just like Brexit because breaking up long term economic partnerships is very hard to do.Pamela Nash, chief executive of Scotland in Union, added: “This was a speech full of nationalist rhetoric with no answers about the catastrophic impact of breaking up the UK. Nicola Sturgeon’s obsession with iding communities is clear for all to see.”©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"independence movement must win over wavering scots with open arms and understanding","story":"The independence movement must win over wavering Scots with #open arms and understanding# as one fth of voters are still undecided on the constitutional question, SNP delegates have heard.Deputy leader Keith Brown, who is heading up the revised campaign for independence, says this will be “the key” to delivering a Yes vote in a future referendum.Former Westminster leader Angus Robertson had earlier said that  per cent of voters in Scotland are wavering on the issue of independence and echoed the appeal for a “sensitive and respectful” approach on the doorsteps.There have been concerns about an abusive element among the pro-independence movement, particularly online, where so-called “cybernats” have unleashed a vitriolic broadside against pro-Union opponents.Mr Brown insisted that a growing number of Scots are “on a journey” towards independence as an alternative to the Brexit chaos engulfing the UK as he issued a rallying call yesterday, with recent polling showing  per cent support for leaving the UK.“We need to get out there, we need to be chapping doors, we need make the case and gather support for the cause,” he told delegates at the party’s autumn conference in Aberdeen.A rising tranche of Scots who voted No in  have shted to Yes, Mr Brown added.“It’s people like that that we have to reach – people out there who are currently making a journey in their political opinions and currently re-assessing the nation’s future prospects. It’s really important to listen and listen respectfully.”The key to success in the next referendum campaign will not be appealing to those who voted Yes in , he added.“We have to convince others who will be more reluctant to come across. The reason we have to do that is because we don’t win independence without them. If we think very carefully about the approach we take, I’m sure we can get further support for independence.“We have to provide the reason and the context for people to make that choice we have to persuade them with patience and understanding and with open arms.“There’s no point in saying you got it wrong in … We have to make sure that we make it as easy possible to come on board with our arguments. This is the key to building further support for independence.”Mr Robertson now heads up polling organisation Progress Scotland which is seeking to produce research which will help make the case for independence.A fringe event staged by the organisation yesterday heard one fth Scots are “up for grabs” on the issue of independence.Older voters, people born where in the UK and EU citizens in Scotland are the key groups which are most sceptical about independence.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"first look at the jarls squad ","story":"Plenty of onlookers were already on the streets as the squad made its first procession of the day from Islesburgh Community Centre, past the galley shed on St Sunniva Street and on to the Toll Clock Shopping Centre.In the gloom, the ranks of the Jarl#s Squad looked the part wearing emerald green kirtles with dragon mots underneath simple brown leather breastplates embossed with the same mot.

It states that rural and remote areas, especially those in The Highlands and Islands, have signicant populations at risk from the fallout of leaving the EU – with or without a trade deal.The report considers community access to services, working-age population, income deprivation, workers in #Brexit-sensitive# industries, EU worker migration and how many EU payments are received.Highlands and Islands representative Ms Todd said: “We always knew that Brexit would be damaging to Scotland but this new analysis really hits home the devastating impact that Brexit will have here in the Shetland Islands.“Families across Shetland will feel the impact of Brexit, with up to  per cent of the local population most vulnerable to the potential economic shock.“The SNP government will continue to do what it can to mitigate and minimise the impact on our most vulnerable communities, but this study lays bare the recklessness of the Tories in their blind determination to pursue Brexit at any cost.“Scotland never voted for Brexit and certainly not for the reckless extreme version now pursued by the UK government. It’s essential that we stop Brexit and go back to the people.”Ms Todd added that a report by the Institute for Fiscal Studies , also published this week, #found the UK is already £ billion worse off as a result of Brexit before we have even left the EU – with the UK economy .- per cent smaller than it otherwise would have been.#Over a million voters in Scotland voted for BREXIT, % of Shetlanders voted to leave, are their votes to be ignored  As a UNITED Kingdom we operate as a single unit well we did during two world wars. I find that Maree Todd’s concern about the potential economic effect that BREXIT could have upon Shetlanda bit of a cheek, coming from a party that currently has chalked up a deficit of £ billion for Scotland, due to irresponsible spending policies.Brexit, is nothing more than for the Tories to distance themselves from the EU, and to have a trade deal with the USA, and the, most likely, mass privatisation of most government responsibilities and duties of care going to US companies, where the Tories will benefit as shareholders of such companies. It is so typical of the Tories to put themselves first regardless to the devastating consequences of their policies and selfish agenda#s onto the people of the UK, especially those in society who struggle as it is. It will be a society of those who have and those who do not have. Where profit is the dominating principle which governs and controls those in power. Brexit, will make the UK, very much an unfair, unjust society for the majority of people. It will also have a great impact on smaller communities where the work-force is from the EU, and the economic circumstances putting many jobs and businesses at risk.Brexit, in all its forms, will cause more harm than good####not to mention poking the fires of xenophobia and racism in its wake.If Shetland is #among the most vulnerable to Brexit#, then presumably, it will also be #among the most vulnerable to Scexit# as we are guaranteed to be out of the EU with No Deal, should the SNP#s policy of Scottish independence ever become reality Tulloch undermines himself. As a UNITED Europe we acted as a single unit. Why should leaving one Union be better than leaving the other  He should reflect on the plain fact that it isn’t our European neighbours that are demanding we split from England against our stated will.“Take back control” my rear end.Peter Hamilton, we agree at last. You, at last, you admit to talking from your rear end!! Now it all makes sense.No Peter, it is the Tories. As I have previously mentioned, their agenda is nothing more than to privatise and hand control of the UK#s Health Care and and other Infrastructure to US companies, where the Tories will benefit mostly. The cost of living under Brexit, will most certainly increase, and the people most affected by it will struggle even more.The Tories, as they have always done, have only thought of themselvesand what they can gain regardless to the damaging consequences upon everybody  in society.Their policies and political motives are highly isive, and generally do more harm than good to society as a whole.Bad enough we have London Europe bleating how they will sufferwe leave EU, when frankly none of them venture beyond the M wall to see England.

The two businessmen confirmed that the Wrightbus factory has been saved from liquidation with Jo Bamford as the new owner of the business.“Mr Bamford’s firm will acquire the entire premises at Galgorm including the factory, fixtures and fittings as well as the associated land.“Commenting on the purchase agreement and wishing Mr Bamford every success Mr Wright confirmed that he had gted  acres of family owned farmland to Mid and East Antrim Council by way of a legacy for the people of Ballymena in recognition of their contribution over  years to the service of Wrightbus.”In a personal statement, Mr Wright said: “This legacy gt is a tribute not only to my father, his father before him, and the Wright family members but most importantly it is a tribute to the generations of workers who helped build a proud manufacturing tradition in Ballymena.

Amongst the terms of the agreement is a commitment that there will be no floodlights and a fence will not exceed . metres at the facility.The resolution will further ensure that there will be no infrastructure put in place for the installation of floodlights at a later date.A seven-person committee made up of school representatives, residents, and an independent chair will now be appointed to manage the facility.Local residents, Martin Derby and Anthony Marron, commented: “We have agreed, in good faith, a pathway to allow for the construction of the De La Salle Sports Facility to commence. Recently we have been part of positive and open discussions with the college and the outcome is a cohesive proposal that benefits all parties involved. This proposal has now been accepted and we will work closely together through a newly formed committee for the project delivery. We will continue to act with the community and our young people at heart throughout the forthcoming process.”Claire White, Principal De La Salle College, said: #The school is delighted to have worked in partnership with local residents to reach a mutual agreement thus allowing for the construction of the sports facility to begin. The facility will provide much needed sports amenities for the pupils of De La Salle College as well as for young people within the community.

I hope that they will make that decision as soon as possible.“There have been other large-scale applications that have been submitted after Casement Park, which have already been decided. So once they get that information from DfI Road they should make that decision without delay.”Meanwhile MORA has written to the DfI Planning to object to the new stadium proposals.The letter, which has been seen by the Andersonstown News, states that “Further Environemtal Information” provided by Ulster GAA in July “fails to allay” concerns about development of the stadium “to an oversized capacity”.The residents’ association insists that the redevelopment would have “unacceptable impacts” on people in the area including “excessive over-shadowing and loss of daylight”, air pollution, as well as “noise, disturbance and safety issues” should proposals for three major concerts a year at the stadium be given the green light.“In addition, the applicant has been unable to demonstrate that the road network can safely handle the extra vehicular traffic that would be generated by sporting and concert events,” the letter reads.“The applicant’s proposals for safe evacuation, which now extend to the Stockmans Lane roundabout, also give rise to serious concern and demand for more rigorous scrutiny.”A spokesperson for Ulster GAA said: “Within its planning application, including its Further Environmental Information submission, Ulster GAA has comprehensively addressed all factors relating to the stadium’s operations and impact, with the Safety Technical Group having unanimously supported the project plans.“As the stadium plans are currently under consideration by the Department for Infrastructure it would be inappropriate to comment further on the live planning application.”The Safety Technical Group comprises representatives from Sport NI Belfast City Council, the PSNI, the NI Ambulance Service the NI Fire and Rescue Service Sports Grounds Safety Authority and the GAA’s ground safety management."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"playboy as relevant today as it ever was","story":"One of the most iconic plays of Irish theatre has been reimagined for our times and received a standing ovation at the Lyric Theatre during its opening night.Running until November , JM Synge’s The Playboy of the Western World tells the story of Pegeen Mikewho is tired of her le, working in her father’s pub in a small village in rural Ireland, where she isbetrothed to the dull Shawn Keogh, only for stranger Christy Mahonto walk into her le with a story that sets the whole village talking.While all the women in the village have their heads turned by Christy, whose dark secret makes him all the more attractive, the playboy’s past threatens to catch up with him and it surely does.First performed in , the play is as fresh today as it was when it caused riots in Dublin on its opening night.

But Aidan was intrigued by the natural world – just like so many youngsters today – and when he was  his le changed forever when a simple thing happened – his father bought him a pair of binoculars so he could better study the birds he spent so much time watching in the gardens of Riverdale.Those old second-hand binoculars were the catalyst that propelled him on a le journey that culminated this week in the opening of an Eco Wildle Garden at St Michael’s Nursery School in Andersonstown.The garden was a labour of love for Aidan and fellow wildle crusader Debbie ‘Doolittle’ Nelson. Their plan to build a nature haven for kids – rather than a common play park – got the full backing of the school. Principal Clare McAllister said the children now choose themselves to go outdoors every day.“They just love to be outside in the middle of nature – so many children don’t get the opportunity to getoutside. And I think this park will encourage children and parents to use our parks and public amenities more,” she said. Board of Governors chairperson Sean Óg McGuinness said that even bad weather doesn’t deter the kids. “They just put on their wet gear and can’t wait to get out to play. It’s a nature paradise.”Aidan and Debbie spent months designing and perfecting the garden – Debbie herself did all the joinery work, making the  bird boxes, as well as hedgehog havens in each corner and a wildle pond.“I planted giant water lilies for dragonflies to rest on, and just as I was putting them in during the summer a dragonfly flew by,” said Debbie. “So even though we’re in the heart of West Belfast there are still some rarities about here.”Debbie even managed to allow pathways for hedgehogs to the fenced-off pond by cutting mini-archways into the fence. “The pond itself has wee ramps so frogs and newts and hedgehogs can safely visit it,” she said.And the nestboxes aren’t just to attract garden birds – one at the front of the school has been designed for kestrels. Aidan said: “You can just imagine the faces of the kidsa pair of kestrels take up residence here. It would be fantastic.”In fact the boxes are designed to provide homes for seven other species – including swts, robins, house sparrows, treecreepers and bats. The children’s eco garden – behind the school beside St Michael’s church – is sheltered by giant trees including oaks that long predate the school – “it could be one of the oldest oak trees in West Belfast,” said Aidan.He added: “We need to be teaching young ones, today, at home, in school and crucially in the nursery – the formative years – how to appreciate and look after wildle, the pollinators, birds, bats, hedgehogs, vegetables, amphibians, orchards and ultimately ourselves so to be best placed in years to come to deal with all the many complex survival challenges ahead for people and bioersity.” Things were so dferent when Aidan was young. The binoculars which helped instil a love of nature unfortunately didn’t last long. British soldiers based in nearby Casement noticed them being used at an upstairs window and thought they were being spied on. They raided his house, running up the stairs to find Aidan birdwatching from his bedroom.The soldiers confiscated the binoculars. “The gave me a wee ticket, and said I could collect them when the Troubles were over,” Aidan said this week. “I never imagined that would be  years later!” Aidan never got his hands on those binoculars again, but he attributes that short time spent with that special gt from his father to his lelong love of nature.

Thats going to be the starting point going forward.\"It is a ridiculous position to have been placed into, and it shows the total ineptitude of the DUPs so-called negotiating position over the last three years.\"Mr Allister told yesterdays Radio Ulster Nolan Show that the DUP had been \"foolish\" by shting its position on a regulatory border in the Irish Sea, which had resulted it in being \"shafted\" by the Government.He told the Belfastthe removal of the \"unionist veto\" would have serious implications for Northern Irelands constitutional future in the UK.\"It is becoming clearer that the DUP were sucked into agreeing a regulatory border in the Irish Sea with the promise of a unionist veto - and once they were sucked in, they are to be shafted,\" Mr Allister said. \"If the unionist veto is to go,there is to be a customs border as well as a regulatory border, and we are to be put in captivity in the EU and removed essentially from the UK economy and put in the orbit of the economy of the Republic - then it is very serious for the future of the Union,\" he continued.Mr Allister called on the DUP to \"disavow\" the regulatory border in the Irish sea, and take a \"step back\".But Sir Jeffrey branded the remarks as unhelpful at a time when unity between unionists is called for.\"This is a time when unionist parties with common ground on Brexit should be working together rather than attacking each other,\" he told the Belfast . \"The DUP has led from the front on Brexit whilst others have remained on the sidelines.\"It is deeply disappointing that some fellow unionists are peddling nonsense against the DUP based on media speculation. \"We want to see a sensible and balanced negotiated agreement as we leave the EU, but arrangements that create barriers to trade in the Irish Sea would not be supported by us,\" Sir Jeffrey added."},{"url":null,"title":"dup held series of meetings with loyalists to discuss eu exit specifics","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The warning led to calls for greater engagement with the loyalist community.In a series of tweets yesterday, journalist Brian Rowan alleged that Mrs Foster, along with other senior DUP colleagues, met with Jimmy Birch, Jackie McDonald and Matt Kincaid, who have previously been named as senior UDA figures.At a separate meeting, organised through the auspices of the Action for Community Transformation project, Mr Rowan stated that alleged senior UVF members Winston Irvine and Harry Stockman were present.Read MoreDUP defends its position as rivals claim it’s been ‘suckered’ in Brexit talksThe former BBC NI security editor said it was his view that it was important that loyalists are \"involved included in legacy and other dialogues, including Brexit\".

Is it a good deal  Is it a bad deal  Is it the only deal \"The source continued: \"If Sinn Fein thinks its all right [any Brexit deal] loyalists will think its all wrong.\"Mr Rowan also tweeted that he was told that loyalists are exploring ways for their concerns to be heard outside Northern Ireland and that a \"mechanism means\" to achieve this is currently being explored. According to the Sunday Times, sources within the UVF have said it is planning to organise demonstrations and protests using proxy groupsthe government attempts a Brexit compromise by aligning Northern Ireland and the Republic in any customs arrangement.A DUP spokesperson said: \"The Party engages with a range of stakeholders about a range of matters on an ongoing basis in the interests of moving Northern Ireland forward.\"Meanwhile, the UDA in west Belfast were said to be adopting a \"wait and see\" approach until the specics of any Brexit deal are announced.In response, the Ulster Unionist MLA Doug Beattie had said he believes that the loyalist community has not been engaged with enough on Brexit issues.Commenting on the alleged meetings between the loyalist representatives and the DUP, loyalist blogger Jamie Bryson said there was \"nothing controversial\" about the largest unionist party engaging with a \"signicant section\" of the unionist and loyalist community.\"I dont think theres anything overly signicant about that however, I do think the DUP should be listening to the voices of the grassroots in the unionist and loyalist community,\" he added. \"I do think in the past number of days we have certainly seen a change from the DUPs position last week where they were ultimately almost signing up for an economic united Ireland. I wasnt present at any of these meetings.

We have a very simple saying, Happy pupils, high expectation, high achievement and thats it in a nutshell.\"The school is well led by a supportive board of governors.\"Principal of Loreto Grammar, Omagh, Grainne OHanlon, said she was \"delighted\" at its joint top ranking, the first time it has topped the league table.\"It is the result of the professional relationship and trust which the teachers establish with the pupils,\" she said. \"Theres a strong, supportive pastoral Special Educational Needs and safe environment surrounding the pupils and thats fully endorsed by the parents.\"Its the overriding belief that our young girls are creative, talented and able, and with a lot of self belief and hard work they can achieve.\"Lumen Christi College principal Siobhan McCauley said her schools academic success is largely due to \"the excellent relationships that exist between students and staff\".She added: \"The strong support of parents coupled with the hard work and dedication of the staff enables our students, who are well-motivated and enthusiastic, to perform at the highest level and thus achieve outstanding exam results.\"Principal of Rainey Endowed Mark McCullough said the results were enabled by a \"three-way partnership between the school, parents and pupils\".\"Its a great accolade - we just work and do the best for them that we can,\" he said.\"Im absolutely delighted and would like to thank everybody for all their hard work.\"Principal of St Dominics in Belfast Carol McCann said that % of all GCSE grades achieved in her school were A* A.\"Our performance at GCSE is the highest it has ever been in the A* A grades,\" she said. \"We are very proud of the achievement, which is down to the hard work of the pupils, staff and parents, who have worked together.\"Our Lady and St Patricks College principal Deborah McLaughlin said her schools joint sixth position was \"testament to the positive attitude of our students, who are supported by our committed staff and our parent body\".\"Were very much a team,\" she said. \"It is a balance between academic and extracurricular activities for students.\"Principal of St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena Sean Rafferty paid tribute to the work of pupils, staff and teachers.\"I would like to congratulate the pupils, teachers and parents for their magnicent effort.

We first have to come to an agreement on negotiator level and secondly would have to be approved at European Council and third go to the House of Commons.”Mr Varadkar said that while he and Mr Johnson had a “broad meeting of minds” on the key Brexit stumbling blocks, turning that into legal text is “a dferent thing”.“Our objectives have always been the same, it’s to avoid a hard border North and South and allow the all-island economy to thrive and to allow North South co-operation to resume as envisaged by the Good Friday Agreement and ensure the integrity of the single market and our place in it,” he added.“These discussions are happening in Brussels. I will get a further briefing this evening so the situation may have changed in the last few hours but the gap was still quite wide, particularly on the issue of customs,” he added.His comments come as Ireland’s deputy premier said he remains hopeful a Brexit deal can be fleshed out before the crucial EU summit.Simon Coveney rejected claims that a deal cannot be negotiated in time for the EU Summit in Brussels on Thursday and FridaySpeaking after his briefing with the European Union’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier in Luxembourg, Mr Coveney warned that a lot of progress needs to be made over the next  hours between the EU and UK negotiating teams, who are locked in discussions.This isnt a time for optimism or pessimism quite frankly, we need to deal with the facts as we see themSimon Coveney“I don’t think it’s inevitable that they can’t get a deal before the summit,” Mr Coveney said.“I think what Michel Barnier said today was very clear, that it’s dficult but possible to have a deal between the two negotiating teams this side of the leaders’ summit.“That means that a lot of progress needs to be made today, but I think that’s doablethere is a willingness on both sides to move this process to conclusion.“Of course,that doesn’t happen, well then it leads to another debate in terms of how the leaders will respond to that in the context of whether more time will be needed or whether we can continue discussions into next week on trying to get the job done.”Ireland’s foreign affairs minister told reporters that securing a deal will require “a big step forward” from the negotiating teams today.“This isn’t a time for optimism or pessimism quite frankly, we need to deal with the facts as we see them,” he added.Good meetings in Lux. today at GAC. ⁦@MichelBarnier⁩ provided a detailed update on state of #Brexit negotiations.

The EU is very clear on that.”In order for a deal to be reached ahead of the crucial summit, which has been seen as the cut-off point for a deal, the negotiating teams have to finalise the legal text in the agreement.Mr Coveney said Tuesday is the “key” day in doing that."},{"url":null,"title":"victoria square apartment owners set to take legal action","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Foryou know who should hear ya, you know what youd get..pushThose lyrics kept repeating in my head after the summit between An Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar and British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson. Nobody was saying much about anything.And the chorus wasnt much better. Take the words of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Julian Smith, on the meeting: \" I am not going into the details of the negotiations.\" Then Micheal Martin. Leader of Fianna Fail: \" The less said in public, the better!\" And the Taoiseach, in rare harmony, said: \"I wont be going into detail as its sensitive.

The key is whether both parties feel the same way the morning after the night before.The format of the day was unusual. Meetings occurred between the British and Irish teams, then reduced down to handful of key advisors and both Prime Ministers. This was followed by a brisk walk and some couple time for the two leaders.Much can be lost in translation from such a format. Understandings and undertakings may become blurred. Could it all be a charm offensive to prepare for the blame game  Maybe, but I think not. Johnson needs a deal. As does Leo. And so does Northern Ireland.The morning after and the goodwill seems to have prevailed all the way to Brussels for the meeting between Brexit Secretary, Steve Barclay, and EU Chief negotiator, Michel Barnier.The semi news block out is necessary. All too often, careless talk, sniping briefings and megaphone diplomacy has snatched defeat from the jaws of victory.This is not the time to allow the futures of two neighbouring countries, who have joint stewardship of the problem child - Northern Ireland - to have their negotiations dissected and pulled apart by Twitter trolls, jumped up bovver boys, madcap lefties and right wing loonies.There will be nervousness within the DUP ranks. Further pragmatism may be required.They should face up to this because such pragmatism will not change the constitutional position of NI within the UK.It will demonstrate maturity and it delivers on the joint Executive Letter of August , signed by Arlene Foster and the late Martin McGuinness and their stated desire for a soft landing for NI post Brexit.Being mature, leading from the front and not bowing to the lowest common denominator in loyalism would do much to restore the cross-community credibility the DUP lost during the past , days.Johnsons electoral success depends on delivering a Brexit which is recognised as such by voters in Britain. If there is a ranking order for his priorities, it is wherever his votes are. They are not in Northern Ireland, as the Tories hardly register on the Richter scale.The alignment of some in the DUP to the Brexit Party is like hitching a lt on a Catherine wheel, momentarily exciting, all sparks, only to fizzle out like a damp squib.Farage never looks like a man who wants a full-time political job. Post Brexit, his party will disintegrate, as did its predecessor, UKIP.Sinn Feins leadership has been unusually quiet. Mary Lou gave a cautious welcome to the news there was positive vibes coming from the Anglo-Irish summit.When a Brexit deal didnt look at all possible, some in Sinn Fein hoped a crash out of the EU would lead to the type of chaos which would anger nationalist voters. Thus giving a timely lt to a party languishing in the polls in the Republic.The campaign to have a border poll will also stallJohnsons government can pull off the elusive deal.However, the idea of a bespoke NI referendum on the customs union or back stop is a real possibility. That said, every election in Northern Ireland is a quasi border poll.The Tories will never concede on a border poll whilst in hoc to the DUP. The momentum has, for the time being, left any prospect for a border poll years away. Unionists should take comfort in that, too.Deal or no deal - Sinn Fein probably thought they could still make electoral advantage from either outcome.If, and its a huge , a no-deal Brexit is avoided, Sinn Fein will come under huge pressure to go back into the Assembly and restore the Executive.

The popular presenter has a close affinity to the Down side, having been brought up in Burren, and will bring plenty of fun and laughter to the proceedings.Louise Kearney, part of the organising committee, said excitement is building in the area on the countdown to the historic night in the club on Saturday, October .She added: ldquoWe are delighted the Down legends are coming to spend a special evening in our clubrooms. It will be a wonderful opportunity to reminisce with All-Ireland winners. We are very proud to have two Loughinisland men who gave so much to the county, and continue to give so much to our club and community.Itrsquos a night not to be missed as this is a landmark year for the Down side who created history when they brought Sam Maguire across the border for the fth time.Louise said: ldquoIt may be one of the last times the squad will be together in a club in this capacity for a number of years and we are grateful they are spending that time with us. We will have a relaxed but enthralling evening as we look back at the glory days.While the spotlight will be on the Down legends, families from the Loughinisland Justice Group will be special guests at the event and their loved ones will be remembered during the night.Louise added: ldquoWe will also take time to remember that  was such a dficult year for Loughinisland. A quarter of a century on from the massacre, we will think back on the impact of the Down win on the community, the uplt that the team brought and the footballing spirit which helped people through the darkest days. We have a lot of stories to hear.The organisers have secured the Sam Maguire and Anglo-Celt cups for the event so there will be opportunities on the night to get photographs taken alongside the Down greats and the legendary silverware.Former Down and Loughinisland player Alan Molloy, who is also one of the organisers, said it was a remarkable feat that a small rural club like Loughinisland had three medals from the great teams of the s and their achievements had brought much joy and prestige to the club.He added: ldquoThis will be a wonderful opportunity to reminisce with these All-Ireland winners, including Loughinisland men Gary Mason and Gerard Colgan, who gave so much to the county and continue to give so much to our club and community.ldquoGary Mason is the proud owner of two medals, from the victories in  and .

A great start to her league campaign and pressure on dad to produce in his race.James Armstrong has had a great summer of cycling and has taken this rich vein of form into the cyclo-cross. Curtis McKee, from Maryland Wheelers, would keep James from the top spot of the podium, but only by a mere six seconds.With junior members having set the scene at the cyclocross it was time for the senior team to get on their bikes.In the MTB Support race Mick Foley, fresh back from injury and claiming to be unfit, tore through the mud to claim a top  finish leaving expectations that he can only get better and better.The club had a large representation in the B race which saw  riders competing.It didnrsquot last long for Gibson Chambers as he got caught up in a crash at the start.This left Paul Hamilton taking the honour of first Dromara man home in sixth place, not far behind was Richard Cowan in eighth, Brian Kellett managed to take th and hold off Darren McCann, just.Adi Booth took the bragging rights as he finished ahead of Bryce Hetherington and Mike Barton finishing st, rd and th respectively.

We believe he is still finding out the additional things he can do with his new hand and therersquos still improvements ahead.Mr Moore said Alfie learnt to write with his left hand and still does but there is hope that over time, that he might be able to write and use his prosthesis hand for everything he normally does with his left hand.He says that Alfiersquos classmates and other pupils have accepted the new addition to the P pupil very well.Mr Moore added: ldquoWersquore never have had any problems with other children understanding about Alfie.

It is set to remain a key feature of the proposed redevelopment project.Council officials insist that the former police basersquos listed building status is not an impediment to the development of the site and while they concede that preserving the building will be a challenge, it is also presents an opportunity to something exciting with it.The heritage value of the site, which extends as far back as St Patrickrsquos Avenue, is something council officials are not only keen to preserve, but build upon as they work with the Department for Communities to maximise the potential of the site.The government department, which has already acquired the former PSNI base, is working in partnership with the local authority to help bring new investment to Downpatrick town centre.Leading brands such as Marks and Spencer and Home Bargains, along with several other big names, are keen to invest in Downpatrick, but at present cannot identy suitable accommodation to meet their respective needs.Those behind the Irish Street plan hope that a redevelopment scheme can act as a catalyst for additional town centre investment, increasing footfall and providing a boost for existing businesses which have been at the backbone of the townrsquos economy for many years.Councillor Dermot Curran has welcomed confirmation that work on the development brief could be completed shortly.He believes that the transformation of the former police base and adjacent land can provide Downpatrick with a signicant economic boost, creating new retail space and much-needed jobs.Cllr Curran reiterated the importance of the townrsquos business community being asked for its input into the redevelopment plan which has the potential to attract more shoppers to the town.He said many will be looking forward to seeing the detail of the development brief and the potential options for a hugely important development site in the heart of Downpatrick.ldquoThere has been no signicant retail investment in the town for quite some time.

Bright finally got their hands on the JFC trophy after a pulsating victory over Aughlisnafin at Pairc Esler on Sunday.Despite having lost the previous six finals they have appeared in, the Ballynoe-based club went into the clash full of confidence and it showed as they broke Aughlisnafinrsquos hearts with an expansive display.The game ebbed and flowed throughout with fortune favouring the brave.Aughlisnafin seized the early initiative before the departure of Mark Stratton to a straight red card threatened to derail their challenge.However, Bright were unable to take real advantage and just when they made their move, Seamas Tumelty joined Stratton for an early shower.The game opened up at this stage with Bright showing a greater composure to prevent Aughlisnafin from completing the double in a thrilling finale to the game.Oran Flanagan and Cailean Toner exchanged early scores in a positive opening to the game before a long range point from the impressive Adam Garland and a good effort from Shane McCann sent the lsquoFin into a - to - lead by the sixth minute.The action was hot and heavy all over the park, but Stratton saw red in the th minute and Bright took full advantage.Sam Dinu reduced the deficit to a single point before the accurate Flanagan converted a free to restore the lsquoFinrsquos two-point lead.Dinu and Breannain McComiskey swapped scores before two Flanagan frees stretched Aughlisnafinrsquos lead to four points, despite being down to  men.Kyran Smythrsquos side held on grimly to the lsquoFinrsquos coat tails and just before the break Gareth George helped breathe new le into Brightrsquos challenge when he pointed from a rsquo to leave his side trailing - to - at half-time.The second half was in its infancy when Bright lay down their marker.A blistering spell of attacking football yielded unanswered points from Declan Trainor, Kevin Groves and the ubiquitous George to draw level.There was only one team in it at this stage, but Bright went and shot themselves in the foot when Tumelty fell foul of the referee and was shown the red card.Brightrsquos heads were now down and Flanagan punished the indiscretion when he pointed the lsquoFin into a - to - lead after  minutes.Smyth sent for the cavalry at this stage and it duly arrived in the shape of Matt McKiernan.The rangy forward was on hand to steer the ball past Calum Croskery and when Toner quickly tagged on a point, Bright suddenly and from nowhere, were three points clear, - to -.Driven on remorselessly by Donagh Steele, Aughlisnafin battled back and points from Sean Fitzsimmons and two from Flanagan had it all square again with  minutes gone.The game was still being played at a hectic pace and with  minutes gone, Garland pointed the lsquoFin into a deserved, but precarious - to - lead.Dinu held his nerve to level matters, but Aughlisnafin went back in front thanks to a point from Shea Croskery. Corey Ranaghan quickly levelled matters, but that man Croskery gave his side a - to - lead with less than eight minutes remaining.Fingernails were being bitten to the quick as Bright went in search of the equaliser and it arrived less than a minute later via a Kevin Groves free.It was now a case of who dares wins as the game hurtled to a conclusion and points from George, Dinu and Matthew Burns had Bright literally home and hosed.Aughlisnafin refused to capitulate and they knew that only a goal would do, but all they could muster in added time was a point from Flanagan as Bright held on for an historic win.Bright: Michael Farrand, Barry Mageean, Marc Burke, Seamas Tumelty, Freddie OrsquoConnor, Nicholas OrsquoConnor, Jack McLaughlin, Corey Ranaghan , Cailean Toner , Sam Dinu , Kevin Groves , Declan Trainor , Owen McEvoy, Gareth George , Rian Tempany.

The exercise is expected to take around  months to complete.Council officials will examine each community centre in detail with the exercise looking at the population they serve, the number of young people in their area, crime statistics andthe facilities are located in so-called neighbourhood renewal areas.One area the review will examine will be Crossgar where local people are keen to see new community centre provided.A major feasibility study was carried out a number of years ago with a site adjacent to St Colmcillersquos High School in the village identied as the preferred location for a new community and sports centre. While a new facility was never constructed, the forthcoming review will examinethe need for it remains.The idea of the community centre probe is to determine potential under provision and where new facilities may be required moving forward.Council officials will also look to seethere is over provision in any areas but insist there are no plans to close any existing centres. They argue that the main driver is about increasing and improving community provision across the district.While itrsquos still early days, council officials say they will work through the process over the next year and will keep ratepayers fully informed about consultation meetings which will be held across all seven district electoral areas to ensure everyone has an opportunity to have their say.Described as a ldquosignicant piece of work, the review will also include discussions with community groups and associations.Insisting that the review is not about closing community centres, council officials say the examination of current provision will focus on where they are located and local need. And they have suggested that the exercise could potentially throw up issues which surfaced during the playground strategy which resulted in some play parks amalgamating.Council officials say while the intention is not to close any centres at this stage, the review will focus on potential gaps in current provision to help form strategic decisions about where to build new centresthis is required.The review will also examine which community centres may require refurbishment and potential extensions to allow them to meet increasing demand.Council officials have confirmed that a number of the districtrsquos community centres are part-funded by the Department for Communities with a number also run by local groups and associations.Ahead of the community centre review, council officials have been conducting an exercise looking at the user figures and the number of programmes that the respective centres deliver. Part of the forthcoming review will also take a critical look at funding streams to help increase centre usage.Council officials say the parks and open spaces strategy will identy those that need upgraded and those which are not necessarily adding any value. It will examine those that can be improved with the review rolled out over the next  months.When the community centre and parks and open spaces review has been completed, initial reports will be debated by the local authorityrsquos Active and Health Communities Committee which will then make recommendations to the full councilto agree a new strategy moving forward..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th October 2019 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C October 9%2C 1979  ","story":"STRANGFORD LOUGH mdash Police have still not recovered the body of the second man drowned on a fishing trip to Strangford Lough at the weekend.At Downpatrick police station mdash from where the search operation was co-ordinated mdash police say there is no hope that  year-old Carrickfergus man, Mr John Craig, is still alive.They believe that Mr Craigrsquos body has been swept out into the Irish Sea and search has now been stretched to the Isle of Man.Mr Craig went in a -foot fibre glass cabin cruiser to fish for mackerel bait on Saturday afternoon, along with with Peter Johnson , from Woodcroft Rise, Braniel, Belfast.In the early hours of Sunday morning police were alerted by the relatives of the two men, anxious that neither had ed.

No one player has a bigger or more important job than anyone .They are in this together and they have an unfaltering belief in their own ability and work on the motto thatyou fail to prepare, prepare to fail.Martin McCourt has dislodged the experienced Niall Kane in goal for the last few games and could well hold on to the number one spot for the final.One thing for certain, bar injury, is that the five Branagan brothers will start, four in defence, with Eugene lining out at corner forward, but given a licence to roam.They epitomise everything good about Kilcoo.

They must attack Kilcoo and utilise their magical set of forwards.McAleenans men have shipped a lot of scores in the league and to invite Kilcoo on to them would not be advisable.Thats why going at Kilcoo from the off and getting top scorer Ross McGarry involved early on is essential.McGarry is the one player who has the ability and temperament to unsettle Kilcoo.He is not the biggest full forward in the game, but he has pace, bravery and rarely misses in front of goal.He is undoubtedly Warrenpoints ace in the pack and along with the Boyle brothers adds a touch of class to the Points challenge.McGarry relies heavily on Donagh McAleenan, Ruairi McCormick, Aaron Magee, Ryan Mallon and Ryan Boyle and this unit must be firing on all cylindersWarrenpoint are to cause a shock win.Kilcoo are red hot favourites at   with a generous   being offered on Warrenpoint.

The key issue we have to address is the presence of a wet weather centre in the resort which I would suggest includes a fun-type family pool, he said.ldquoI believe that alongside this there needs to be a few swimming lanes to accommodate the needs of local people who have not had access to modern leisure facilities for some considerable time.Cllr Clarke said this issue needed to be flagged up as part of the consultation process on the way forward.He said it was important that elected representatives highlighted the needs of local people during the process.ldquoWe are talking about a once in a generation opportunity to deliver a modern leisure facility in Newcastle and we will not be settling for less. The location is good and while there may be issues with parking, these are not insurmountable.ldquoWe are talking about a complete new build which will maximise the large area of space at the rear of the existing centre and I would be keen to see a high quality design, comprising wood and glass, he said.Cllr Clarke added: ldquoI would like to see an eco-friendly building, which is both sustainable and carbon neutral..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th October 2019 Planners.jpg","title":"Planners recommend expansion at Newcastle’s Barbican supermarket  ","story":"A LEADING Newcastle business is in line for a major extension.Planners are recommending that mdash subject to a number of conditions mdash an amended proposal to expand the Barbican filling station at the Dundrum Road in the resort should be given the green light.The approval recommendation is due to be discussed at a meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Planning Committee on Wednesday of next week.The proposal includes the redevelopment of the existing petrol station and forecourt and extending the storersquos retail space.

Additional fuel pumps also form par of the development proposal.Planners say that the redevelopment of the Barbican filling station is compatible with surrounding land use, will not harm the amenities of nearby residents, with the filling station and retail unit not at any risk from flooding.Signicantly, planners are content that the existing road network can cope with any extra vehicular activity at the Dundrum Road site and that adequate access arrangements and parking area is in place.One of the existing accesses to the site will be lost as a result of the redevelopment.Recommending that the amended plans should be approved, planners say that the site must only be used as a petrol filling station with no part used for the display or sale of vehicles and that all existing fuel tanks must be removed in line with current pollution guidance.Councillors will be told at next weekrsquos planning meeting thatduring development works, contamination risks are encountered which have not previously been identied, works should cease and planners notied immediately.The storersquos opening hours will remain unchanged when the redevelopment work is completed.

aspects of the scheme include upgrading existing traffic signal equipment and the introduction of a one-way traffic systemon Lower Stream Street from the junction towards Racecourse Hill.Roads

","story":"BALLYNAHINCH shook off their insipid displays in the SONI Premiership to push much-fancied Terenure right to the wire in their first appearance back in AIL Division A since .The Dublin outfit were the form team over the second half of last season and having recently clinched the Leinster Senior League title, were heavy favourites with pundits and bookmakers prior to kick off.They were also almost at full strength, while the home side were patched up in midfield after losing Rory Butler to injury. Veteran centre Stuart Morrow was again pressed into service with Aaron Cairns ing on the wing following concussion.Up front Ben Cullen earned the starting loose head spot and hugely influential number  Conall Boomer ed from injury. However, with eight players involved in the Ulster A Celtic Cup game on Friday night and four more in South Africa with the Pro squad, Brian McLaughlinrsquos options were limited.Tom Stewart and Connor Rankin were released to take their places on the bench, but the team that took the field was largely drawn from the squad which had been under-performing over the pre-AIL period.A few honest words on Tuesday night and an exceptional week on the training paddock clearly made a big dference as the home side tore into their opponents from the whistle.Playing away from the clubhouse and into the wet and gusty conditions, they drove into the Terenure half and were rewarded for an excellent scrum with a penalty to allow Sean OrsquoHagan to give his side the lead.Some indiscipline from a visibly fired up home forward pack allowed Terenure the chance to gain a foothold in the home half, but a superb turnover from Boomer on former lsquoHinch prop Campbell Classon allowed Ryan Wilson to clear.Cairns was doing his best to keep the home support involved and after skinning his opposite number twice in quick succession, he proceeded to drive him almost into the home dugout with a massive hit which got the home crowd even more fired up.However, a three point lead was scant reward for Ballynahinch after  minutes and Terenure began to turn the screw.They had a clear scrum advantage with referee Kieran Barry taking umbrage with Cullenrsquos angles and following a scrum deep in lsquoHinch territory, they went through the phases and eventually drove prop Liam Hyland over for a try at the posts to take a - lead.Moments later a superb long grubber kick forced Cairns back over his own line and Terenure won another penalty from the resulting m scrum.Declining the shot at goal they opted for another scrum and another infringement led to a penalty try, taking the lead out to - after  minutes.Undaunted, Ballynahinch finished the half strongly when a trademark Rhys OrsquoDonnell show and go sent him flying up the left touchline and almost over in the corner. Stout defending from Terenure averted the immediate danger, but a penalty for offside allowed OrsquoHagan to kick another penalty and cut the gap to - at half-time.As conditions worsened there was belief around the ground that this was not an insurmountable deficit, but disaster struck early in the first half when replacement Rankin elected to move the ball from deep.His long pass to a flying Ross Adair was only inches off target, but allowed the prolic Jake Swaine to hack through and win the race for the line to take his side  points clear at -. Ballynahinch refused to lie down and used the conditions to dominate field position.Blindside Aaron Hall put his injury nightmare behind by driving Terenure back at every opportunity and OrsquoHaganrsquos deadly boot dragged them back into the game with two penalties. When the under pressure Terenure outfit conceded another penalty in their own , almost everyone in the ground expected another three points.The ever-alert OrsquoDonnell had other ideas as he took a quick tap penalty and weaved his way over to score at the posts.OrsquoHaganrsquos conversion made it  all and as the weather really closed in, the home side were the clear favourites as they piled on the pressure in search of a win.Terenure defended well and were handed a leline when Cairns elected to run a speculative clearance instead of launching it back downfield.The ball was knocked on in the centre of the pitch and with heavyweight lock James Simpson off, the field Terenure once again exploited their scrum superiority to milk a penalty.Swaine held his nerve to nail the kick which, although central, was made tricky by the grim conditions.Ballynahinch threw everything at a tiring Terenure defence as the game entered injury time and after more than  phases of hammering away around the m line OrsquoHagan called for thegoal.The slippery conditions and heavy pressure meant his kick was a little rushed and it dropped short and wide to allow the away side to mark the ball and kick it out for a hard-earned win.The locals will reflect on a game they probably should have won, but will take an enormous amount of positives from the performance after visibly stepping up their physicality.Small margins will make a huge dference in this league and the fixtures come fast over the next few weeks. lsquoHinch travel to UCC this weekend to take on a student side buoyed by their demolition of much-fancied Trinity at the weekend and with the squad still thin due to Ulster Arsquos involvement in the Celtic Cup final, skipper John Donnan will have to lt his men for another big effort. However, he will be a happier man after his team showed that they belong in this company.Ballynahinch: Ben Cullen, Conor Piper, Johnny Blair, James Simpson, John Donnan , Aaron Hall, Olly Loughead, Conall Boomer, Rhys OrsquoDonnell, Sean OrsquoHagan, Aaron Cairns, Ryan Wilson, Stuart Morrow, George Pringle, Ross Adair.

Language is what makes the heart audible. We had a teacher who came to our primary school and taught me the meaning of my name. Gorm is the Irish word for blue. Gorman were the people whose hair was so black it had a blue sheen off it. I thought, ‘wow’. I was about nine, I wanted to find out more. “I started to learn Irish, I went away on summer courses. It’s important to me.“I understand that there are people from the same bit of ground as I am who speak Ulster-Scots to whom that is equally important. I wanted to find out more.“My dad would have used Ulster-Scots expressions at home before I realised what they were. He’d say things like ‘red up’ and called us gaunches, or better, carnaptious gaunches. One of my favourite words in any language is the word ‘thran’.”For the programme Damian s to the Ards peninsula as he tries to understand why, for so many people, Ulster-Scots and its literary heritage is still important and relevant today. He reconnects with Hugh Robinson, who helped him start a writers’ group there, and spends time with native speakers and scholars including Carole Gilmore and Elaine McFeeters.Of the Irish language act which has seen red lines drawn at Stormont, and the limited use of Ulster-Scots in the Province, Damian said: “In our part of the world there are dficult conversations still to be had and that being the case I just think we need all the language we can get.”In his spare time Damian teaches conversational English to a group of Syrian refuges in Wales: “As has been pointed out to me I’ve passed on quite a bit of Ulster–Scots.

We hope to find this litter new owners soon, so they can quickly adjust to being part of a loving family.“Canine carers at Dogs Trust Ballymena have found there is often misconceptions about the Lurcher breed, with people often thinking they require lots of exercise. Lurchers actually don’t require any more exercise than a typical dog and many enjoy staying cozy and snuggling up for a snooze.“At such a young age they will all need homes where they will be given lots of care and attention, as well as ongoing support with their training. Families who adopt any of the puppies will be invited to join Dogs Trust’s Dog School at ious locations across Northern Ireland.”Dog Trust’s Dog School was launched in  to support dog owners and their pets through our reward based training methods, teaching valuable skills needed for everyday le. Dog School is just as much about supporting and guiding owners as it is about training the dog. Classes run over five weeks and each dog owner will receive training homework after the class to practise at home. It is important for owners to continue the training at home on a regular basis to practice what their pet has learned in class.If you believe a dog is for le and would like to find out more about the adorable Lurcher puppies, get in touch with the team at Dogs Trust Ballymena on  or visit www.dogstrust.org.uk our-centres ballymena.

He was all over it like a rash.”In , Moy Park had been bought by giant Brazilian meat processor Marfrig in a  million deal. But within just seven years, Moy Park’s valuation more than doubled.In September  – as Moy Park’s farmers were piling into RHI – the company was sold to another Brazilian meat giant, JBS.Andrew CrawfordLess than a year later, bribery charges – unconnected to the Moy Park sale – would begin to be levelled at senior JBS figures in a massive scandal which would shake Brazilian society.Moy Park has since been sold by JBS – but to a company which it controls, Pilgrim’s Pride, in a sale which attracted further allegations and litigation from shareholders.In , Mrs Foster travelled to Brazil on a trade mission. In her role as Stormont’s enterprise, trade and investment minister, one of her major engagements was with Marfrig. and Nigel Dodds\"   and Nigel Dodds\"  DUP department used public cash in threat to injunct News Letter – over its own leakIrish Premier Leo Varadkar to raise outcome of citizenship with Boris Johnson Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"The book reveals Mrs Foster’s briefing notes, showing that on the night of May , she had been due to dine with Marfrig executives at the Michelin-starred Mani Manioca, one of Sao Paulo’s hippest restaurants.According to the briefing material, she was to conduct the key meeting – unusually – without her civil servants.It was the only event on the entire trade mission where one of Foster’s officials or an official from the British consulate did not accompany the minister.Only Dr Crawford and Invest NI chief executive Alastair Hamilton, a former DUP spad, were to be present. The unusual situation was justied on the basis that it was “to ensure that the two Marfrig representatives aren’t overwhelmed”.The purpose of the meeting was “to further discuss Marfrig’s presence in Northern Ireland”. When asked questions about the meeting, Foster and Crawford replied with a solicitor’s letter which did not answer the questions and failed to provide any explanation for what had gone on – but instead threatened to sue for libel.The letter also said that the meeting had been shted from dinner to breakfast and that the DUP figures “did not meet with Marfrig executives without officials present in order to ensure there was no minute of the meeting”.The letter added that a translator had been present, although it would not be the role of a translator to record a civil service minute of what transpired.Stormont’s rules state that departmental meetings with external iniduals must be minuted.When asked what she had done to ensure that an accurate record of the meeting was kept, Mrs Foster declined to respond.The year after Mrs Foster travelled to Brazil, Marfrig chief executive Sergio Rial said the company had “ongoing, positive engagement with the Northern Ireland Executive and have experienced a very pro-business attitude”.Responding to questions from the News Letter about why Mrs Foster met Marfrig executives without her civil servants being present, and what steps she had taken to ensure that an accurate record of what was discussed was kept, a DUP spokesperson said: “It would not be appropriate to comment on issues related to the work of the public inquiry before that process has been completed.”try catch  TrendingWrightbus: Green Pastures issue statement after bus building firm confirmed to continue in BallymenaN.I. hotel F**k the Pope and the I.R.A. wedding video reported to police -

The Prime Minister is in a race against time to get a fresh agreement negotiated in time for the Brussels summit of European leaders starting on Thursday. reported senior sources on both sides of the Channel saying that a draft treaty could be published on Wednesday morning after the UK agreed in principle there will be a customs border in the Irish Sea.But the PMs official spokesman said: \"Talks remain constructive but there is more work still to do.\".ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button Downing Street sources were also downplaying the chances of a breakthrough being imminent and an EU official stressed \"talks are ongoing\".Meanwhile, Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said it remained uncertain whether a deal would be ready in time for the Brussels summit.\"The initial indicationsare that we are making progress, negotiations are moving in the right direction,\" he told reporters.\"But whether we will be able to conclude a revised Withdrawal Agreement, which is an international treaty, in time for the summit, thats as of now unclear.\"Mr Varadkar also revealed that the PM told him during their meeting last week he was \"confident\" he would be able to do what Theresa May thrice failed to do by getting a deal through the House of Commons.Suggestions a deal was closing in came as Downing Street declined to recognise a midnight deadline apparently set by EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier.Mr Barnier warned Mr Johnson that \"it is high time to turn good intentions into legal text\".But the PMs official spokesman said: \"We are working hard. The Prime Minister is aware of the time constraints that we are under.\"Mr Johnson is set to update his Cabinet on Brexit on Wednesday afternoon in order to give them the most up to date information on talks. and Nigel Dodds\"   and Nigel Dodds\"  DUP department used public cash in threat to injunct News Letter – over its own leak Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Downing Street officials are understood to have been meeting with ious parliamentary factions in recent days as negotiators hammer out a deal.Mr Barnier struck a positive note after meeting Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay at the General Affairs Council on Tuesday morning.He debriefed EU ministers in Luxembourg before tweeting: \"Talks are dficult but I believe an agreement is still possible.\"The latest comments comments came as negotiators stepped up efforts to work out a way to break the deadlock over the Irish backstop, the contingency measure to prevent a hard border on the island.Irish broadcaster RTE had reported that two sources confirmed that British negotiators will bring forward an updated plan on Tuesday to deal with the issue of customs and the Irish border.Irelands deputy premier Simon Coveney stressed \"signicant progress\" would need to be made on Tuesday \" there is to be a deal that Michel Barnier can report on tomorrow to EU capitals in advance of the leaders summit\".Meanwhile, Downing Street said Mr Johnson told French president Emmanuel Macron in a phone call that UK officials would \"continue to work hard\" on securing a Brexit deal.The two-day EU summit is crucial because the PM must get a new deal approved by MPs by Saturdayhe is to avoid a clash over asking for a Brexit delay.The Benn Act passed by MPs opposed to a no-deal, including Tory rebels, says he must ask for an extension to Article MPs do not back a deal by then.There are fears that a loophole could be used to avoid this, with the PM repeatedly ruling out making the extension request under his \"do or die\" pledge to get Brexit done by the Halloween deadline.Leader of the Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg has suggested the Government could use European law to achieve no deal, while Labour has threatened court action to force the PM to obey the legislation.Regardless of the outcome in Brussels, a showdown is anticipated in an emergency sitting of Parliament on Saturday, the first in  years,the Government requests the unusual move and it is backed by MPs.They will be able to back or reject any deal presented to them, or there will be discussions on what to do next in the Brexit saga.try catch  TrendingWrightbus: Green Pastures issue statement after bus building firm confirmed to continue in BallymenaN.I. hotel F**k the Pope and the I.R.A. wedding video reported to police -

We want to turn them into respectful iniduals with good values and an understanding of issues across the whole spectrum le has to offer.The school encourages pupils to voice their ideas, and shape their own education to a degree. They are asked what additions and activities they would like around the school, push for pupil engagement with a range of le experiences, and emphasis the development of their social skills to help them interact with others in dferent settings.The idea works well in practice. The students are friendly, confident, and respectful to the teachers. They smile, wave and say hello to the teachers in the corridors.ldquoThis is my eleventh year here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoI feel privileged to work in Fairfield. Itrsquos a school with a wonderful ethos and atmosphere, and skilled staff who know the children well, ensuring theyrsquore getting the best possible.ldquoThe children really exude enjoyment and enthusiasm for their learning.One classroom was filled with children learning their times-tables by singing and dancing, grins from ear to ear. In the schoolrsquos on-site nursery, youngsters concentrate on their basic arithmetic, rolling modelling clay into a single sunflower, or a pair of bananas.The nursery is the most recent addition to the school, having been opened in January of last year. Itrsquos the sort of place you can hear long before you see, as smiling toddlers enjoyed their break time.The nurseryrsquos addition to the school site would allow for an improved transition for pupils from nursery to reception.ldquoChildren benefit from being challenged with their learning at an earlier stage, explained Ms Lewis. ldquoWe want to make them feel safe and comfortable at the school, and make it as easy as possible to move up to reception.ldquoWe also give our older pupils a chance to experience both Stanwell and St Cyres secondaries around here to give them a smooth move into secondary education.Therersquos plenty on offer at the school, as well.Opportunities for extracurricular activities is vast, with local community groups using the hall throughout the week, for gym, dance fitness, karate, football and music tech.The introduction of a lsquoMid-week Muddle-Uprsquo allows pupils to work across age groups on half-termly projects, which use staff expertise in particular areas for a project that they collectively work on such as working on the environment in their own conservation area, or lsquoPizza Mathsrsquo combining elements of maths and fractions with cookery.Pupil groups cover School Council, Sports Council, Creative Committee, Sgwad Cymraeg, Eco-Committee, Team Captains, Digital Leaders, while other groups focus on global issues and the impact of their actions internationally.Jake Kidby, Ahmed Maher and Georgia Tomalin-Reeves are on the school council.Though each had a dferent focus for their enjoyment of the school site, they all agreed they were very happy at Fairfield.Jake said: ldquoI absolutely love my football and therersquos loads of chances to play that here. The new gym trail outside is great too.Ahmed said: ldquoI prefer maths and challenges. We thought school council would be a fun responsibility to look after the school, help people and share ideas.Georgia said: ldquo As part of school council we decided to build a lsquorelaxation stationrsquo for anyone who feels down. They can bring paper and pens and books. Itrsquos just a wooden den. But wersquore putting in shelves, posters. And therersquos lot of free space to run around front and back.The school has been lauded for its environmental efforts, securing a Bronze Welsh Charter Award last term, and earning a Platinum Flag for their approach to ecological and sustainability issues.Pupils Isaac Eley and Sophie Wilford were at the schoolrsquos conservation area.They explained to me that the area was first started around  years ago, but they had begun pushing for more lessons to be held outdoors.They hope to add tables, chairs and more outdoor classroom equipment, so they can take lessons in the open air.ldquoThe staff go above and beyond here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoWith increased pressure on funding for schools staff, governors and parents have to really put  per cent effort in.ldquoThe PTA has raised an incredible amount for us over the years and have done wonders for our IT departments.ldquoParents have helped out in raising money for the new gym trail.ldquoOne father built our relaxation station shed by himself, and the stage on the playground for singing and dancing was also built with parentrsquos help.ldquoThey ensure we can continue and we can be excellent for all the childrenrsquos learning.ldquoAttainment is high and all pupils make good progress specic to them, and this achievement is something of which we are extremely proud.Therersquos an underlying feeling of positivity in Fairfield, off the beaten path but quietly proud and it seems thoroughly well-earned. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The Government is spending millions on an advertising campaign that appears to conflict with an Act of Parliament and all the meanwhile jobs, security and stability are put further and further at risk.Boris Johnson is playing Russian roulette with all of our lives over Brexit, and we cannot stand by and let him do it.The last three years have been a shambles, and it is clear we will now need to go back to the people for them to have the final say.That is why the case for a Peoplersquos Vote, where a credible deal is put to the British people, with the option to Remain, provides the best and most democratic ways of ending this crisis.Readers will know I think Brexit is a disaster for our jobs, security and international standing ndash and so would campaign resolutely to Remain in that scenario.Either way, I believe we need to heal some of the isions in this country and get back to focusing on the issues we all want to talk about.Despite the Brexit chaos, Irsquove continued to work hard on lots of other issues locally.It was a real pleasure to attend the Penarth Picnic at the weekend, and I want to thank Penarth Town Council, Production  and all those involved for a great event ndash showcasing the best of Penarthrsquos wonderful community spirit. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Yet, too many people across the UK ndash and here in Wales ndash are going hungry.It is shameful that in the sixth richest country on the planet people are struggling to put food on the table.A recent report by the South Wales Food Alliance has shown that  per cent of  to -year-olds ran out of food in the past year and , children in Wales are living in households for whom a healthy diet is increasingly unaffordable.In addition, the Trussell Trust has reported record numbers of people accessing its services. Last year, it provided over , emergency food parcels to people in crisis in Wales, , of them to children. A No Deal Brexit will be catastrophic for the countryrsquos most vulnerable households and would be an act of economic self-harm impacting many generations to come. This is why I am supporting the campaign for Food Justice.There can be no doubt that the causes of rising hunger are rooted in a decade of austerity, tax and welfare changes, and an economy that no longer provides a fair dayrsquos pay for a fair days work for too many.The food crisis that the UK is living through is likely to be signicantly worsenedwe leave the EU without a deal. The recently published government documents on Operation Yellow Hammer predict shortages of some fresh foods and an increase in the price of food by up to  per cent, as a likely scenario.The papers make for grim reading for the many hard pressed families who are already struggling to put food on the table.In Wales we are committed to eradicating food poverty but we need UK-wide action.The Co-operative campaign is calling on the UK Government to commit to zero-hunger by  and incorporate it into UK law.While many of the solutions to food poverty are the responsibility of the UK Government there is local action that we can take that can make a real dference.The campaign is encouraging councils across Wales to commit to playing their part by designating a lead member for food poverty, to draw up a food action plan, and to take inspiration from emerging community responses to food poverty.The good news is that there is a huge amount of work already going on in our communities by councils, churches, charities and food banks.For more information or to get involved in the campaign please visit www.party.coop campaign food-justice article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This compares to five per cent of the population in , when  per cent of adults smoked.However, there has also been an increase in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape.:The National Survey for Wales shows that, in ,  per cent of e-cigarettes users also smoked cigarettes. This fell to  per cent in  .Across the UK the number of vapers who are ex-smokers reached . per cent in  with the main reason given for using e-cigarettes being to help them quit.Of those surveyed by ASH Wales,  per cent of e-cigarette users cited health as their main reason for vaping.Suzanne Cass, chief executive of ASH Wales said: ldquoThe rise in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape in Wales shows that many smokers are using e-cigarettes to quit.ldquoIndeed, when coupled with behavioural support e-cigarettes have been shown to be one of the most effective ways to give up smoking, enabling thousands of smokers in Wales to break a habit that destroys lives.ldquoHowever, with more than double the amount of people in Wales smoking compared to vaping, we still face a major challenge when it comes to changing peoplersquos behaviour and de-normalising what has become an entrenched habit in many of our most deprived communities.Despite the increase in the number of people vaping, the survey also revealed perceptions of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes have worsened.Now almost a third of people in Wales believe e-cigarettes are equally or more harmful than tobacco cigarettes.Suzanne Cass said: ldquoThere is work to be done when it comes to raising awareness of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes and addressing concerns about the safety of vaping.Since the survey was carried out, reports of a possible link between e-cigarette use and deaths from lung disease in America have led some medical experts to warn of the dangers of vaping.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention many of those vapers affected had used products with liquids containing cannabinoid products.E-cigarettes are regulated in the UK in line with a set of European-wide rules by the medicines regulator, the MHRA. The MHRA also monitors adverse reactions through its yellow card system, which to date has not identied serious respiratory problems similar to that found in the US.Meanwhile vapers in the UK are urged by ASH to only ever purchase e-cigarettes from reputable suppliers. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We were a mix of young people, parents and other concerned citizens of Penarth, and met outside Grfin Books.ldquoWe joined the young people who have been striking from school. In a year this movement has grown from Greta Thunberg by herself to millions worldwide.ldquoThe evidence on climate change is clear. Our actions through burning fossil fuels and demands for continued economic growth cause global warming and climate change.

A former head of two other schools in Gwent, he is clearly proud of his school and all they have accomplished.ldquoItrsquos a wonderful school and everyone here has worked so hard to make it that way, he said. ldquoBut it does face challenges.Like other head teachers in Penarth, Mr Rees had signed the open letter to the Welsh Government calling for fairer funding for Vale schools earlier this year. He had discussed coming in to the school on weekends to clean the toilets himself to help balance budgets. But he is firmly optimistic.ldquoBetween kind donations and fundraising efforts from our PTA, renting out the school hall, and younger members of staff taking on some extra burdens we are just about able to balance our budgets, he said. ldquoTo be honest, next year might start looking grim, but wersquore keeping our heads high.ldquoWith that said, wersquove been working hard on incorporating new initiatives and the new curriculum, we have a great crop of pupils and staff morale is high. We are very positive here.ldquoItrsquos also our th anniversary this year, so we have loads of ex-staff and pupils coming through the doors to say hello, a celebratory PTA barbecue and more planned.Taking a tour around the school, this positivity is reflected in students and staff alike. Children seem genuinely excited to learn, smiling, waving and saying hello to Mr Rees.Evenlode Primary School itself has an interesting history.It was opened in  as the first open plan primary school in South East Wales.The population of the school has risen dramatically over the last  years, from  on roll in  to the present .The building itself, a maze of classrooms and corridors plastered in colours, has also changed to accommodate more pupils.Much of the semi-open plan design has disappeared, making way for more conventional classrooms.The school benefits from having a superb site with two playgrounds as well as a large playing field, a designated play area for Reception children, a wildle area, open access to the local tennis club facilities, a newly constructed lsquooutside classroomrsquo and adventure trail.One of the first stops was a hall used by its lsquoSaplingsrsquo Out of School Care, the pre and after-school club for children.Saplings provides childcare for around  children from all year groups, providing breakfast in the morning and looking after children from .am to pm when needed.There, the children can access a wide range of activities, switched up on a regular basis.These have included cooking, gardening, art, crafts, sporting activities, outdoor play and plenty more.A couple of pupils, part of the Saplings, are called through. They happily talk about their favourite part of the clubs. One says arts and crafts another, going outside and playing sport four more say the food.Saplings isnrsquot the only place the students can indulge in a little food.Pupils have set up a fruit tuck shop in the school yard, a group endeavour that students control all aspects of - from placing orders for snacks, selecting the products, handling finances and, of course, selling to their friends.A small group of budding merchants were excited to show me their wares, selling oranges and bananas at break time.There was plenty more to do outside, as well.Mr Rees himself taught fire-making lessons in their fire pit, while the school also made use of rope courses, and a newly refurbished gazebo.Bike racks could be found at the front and back of the site, with students encouraged to cycle to school.Sport is very high on the schoolrsquos agenda.ldquoWe have kids from the school representing us in cricket, rugby and tennis at a county level, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore also fielding regular football, rugby and netball teams, and we are pushing plenty of other outdoor activities - like our new ropes and outdoor assault course.ldquoWersquore lucky to have parents in this area who are incredibly supportive of sports, and we have some shining examples of sporting prowess in our children.ldquoWe think itrsquos a very important part of being a rounded and healthy inidual.The school doesnrsquot just focus on sport - they aim to nurture minds and souls too.ldquoExpressive arts is a major area of focus at the moment, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore lucky enough to have a drama specialist supporting us, helping coach the children through both acting and production.ldquoWe are even working with the Welsh Government on a production of H.G. Wellrsquos The Time Machine, to be held in our school hall.The hall had been built with money raised from selling off surplus land, with a further loan from the Vale council.It is tidy, modern, and neatly decorated, with a sophisticated looking lighting system - built with help from parents.ldquoWersquore very proud of the relationship we have with parents here, said Mr Rees. ldquoThey have been enormously helpful with our budgetary concerns.Evenlode is a school with a cheerful outlook, a happy student body and a strong working relationship between staff, students and parent alike.It deserves to go far. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In the past he chaired the all-party Parliamentary group on nuisance calls and secured changes to the law to restrict cold telephone calling.ldquoThere have been a number of complaints about the increase in nuisance callers and the rise of the doorstep economy in the Vale of Glamorgan. Ahead of the clocks going back, Alun wants to provide constituents with a proven means of reducing the number of doorstep callers.Welsh Labour parliamentary candidate for the Vale, Belinda Loveluck-Edwards said: ldquoIt appears that Alun Cairns is using public money to try and block his political opponents from speaking to voters. This must be investigated.ldquoThis is a deliberate attempt to present a  equivalence between genuine political canvassing and those who would wish to scam vulnerable people.ldquoMany people will be deeply unsettled by this behaviour from Cairns at the same time as the Tories are attempting to suppress votes by making it a requirement to show ID at polling stations- a move that will disproportionately affect working class, ethnic minority and young voters.ldquoThis is not how politics should be done.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

Their mother Emma, who was found straying by local authorities, gave birth to the  puppies shortly after arriving at the Rehoming Centre.One of the litter of rescue puppies hoping they wont be left in the lurchThe puppies, named after popular award-winning actors and actresses, are now more than eight weeks old and canine carers at the busy Rehoming Centre have been working hard to get them prepared for their potential new owners. The puppies currently available for adoption are named: Emmy, Brando, Legend, Jolie, Heath, Goldberg and Leonardo.Oonagh Phillips, Rehoming Centre Manager at Dogs Trust Ballymena, said: “The Rehoming Centre is no stranger to puppy residents however, we do find that Lurcher puppies tend to stay with us a bit longer. We hope to find this litter new owners soon, so they can quickly adjust to being part of a loving family.“Canine carers at Dogs Trust Ballymena have found there is often misconceptions about the Lurcher breed, with people often thinking they require lots of exercise. Lurchers actually don’t require any more exercise than a typical dog and many enjoy staying cozy and snuggling up for a snooze.“At such a young age they will all need homes where they will be given lots of care and attention, as well as ongoing support with their training. Families who adopt any of the puppies will be invited to join Dogs Trust’s Dog School at ious locations across Northern Ireland.”Dog Trust’s Dog School was launched in  to support dog owners and their pets through our reward based training methods, teaching valuable skills needed for everyday le. Dog School is just as much about supporting and guiding owners as it is about training the dog. Classes run over five weeks and each dog owner will receive training homework after the class to practise at home. It is important for owners to continue the training at home on a regular basis to practice what their pet has learned in class.If you believe a dog is for le and would like to find out more about the adorable Lurcher puppies, get in touch with the team at Dogs Trust Ballymena on  or visit www.dogstrust.org.uk our-centres ballymena.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals. What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you  Believe in yourself, be flexible and above all when opportunities present themselves to you, grab them.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/2_web.jpg","title":"top  voice of business never stronger or more important","story":"Posted on Friday  September  by Ulster Business John Mulgrew, Michael Neill, Sarah Little and Len OHagan The voice of Northern Ireland’s business community has never been stronger and more important as industry attempts to avoid a hard Brexit, a gathering of top business leaders has heard. The Top  Northern Ireland Companies  dinner, with AL Goodbody, brought together some of top business chiefs making the list, to the grand backdrop of Queen’s University’s Great Hall. The event heard renewed calls for securing a deal on Brexit, and the restoration of Stormont, as we approach , days without a devolved government here. John Mulgrew, editor of Ulster Business, told those gathered: “On the precipice of Brexit, the voice of business has never been stronger or more important – further enforcing the need for a deal. Avoiding a hard exit. And retaining a strong trading relationship across the island. “But we should also take this opportunity to clearly note, that we are approaching , days since having a devolved government – up and running. “It affects you and your businesses, and it’s cited as the key reason putting off investment from overseas, and our own local companies, from making key investment decisions.” The Top  edition is an annual showcase of the leading and largest companies, located right across Northern Ireland. This year sales rose by almost %, approaching a combined figure of £bn. And for the eighth year in a row, poultry processing giant Moy Park has come in at the number one spot, with turnover of £.bn. Michael Neill, head of Belfast office at AL Goodbody, said: “What the Top  companies have achieved in the past  months in what can only be described as capricious circumstances is truly remarkable – but imagine what could have been achieved had we some semblance of ‘normality’. “My hope is that we find ourselves doing so in a Northern Ireland that is embarking on a new and positive era of opportunity, rather than picking up the shattered pieces of a ‘no deal’ Brexit for many years to come.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"firms must prepare for no deal as economic forecast revised down","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland firms must prepare for a ‘no deal’ Brexit – a bank chief economist has warned – as it downgraded its forecast for the economy to .%.  Danske Bank’s Conor Lambe said there were still a number of possibilities for what might happen over the next  days, with the UK due to leave the EU on October . Possibilities included a no-deal exit, a withdrawal agreement being reached, an extension of Article  period or a general election. But predictions were \"incredibly dficult\", he said. \"Businesses should behave prudently and use this time to ensure they are as prepared as they can be for a worst-case scenario, no-deal Brexit, in case it occurs at the end of this month,\" he said. The .% is down from the bank’s previous forecasts, delivered in June, that growth would hit % in  and .% in . In its latest Northern Ireland Quarterly Sectoral Forecasts report, Danske Bank said that the Northern Ireland economy likely expanded in the second quarter of the year, but the rate of growth over the first half of the year remained modest. “We have revised our forecast for economic growth in Northern Ireland downwards for both  and ,” he said. “This largely reflects the modest data for the first half of the year, increased Brexit-related uncertainty and the weaker global economic environment. “Assuming that a no-deal Brexit is avoided, we expect the Northern Ireland economy to grow by .% in  and .% in , below the .% we expect UK GDP to grow by in both years. “A combination of strong wage growth and more stable inflation is likely to lead to solid growth in consumer spending, but the lack of clarity around the UK’s future relationship with the EU is expected to continue holding back business investment.” It says the information and communication, and professional, scientic  technical services sectors are expected to be the fastest growing parts of the economy over the next two years. Meanwhile, output in the construction sector is forecast to rise by .% in  and .% in , while expected output growth in the wholesale and retail trade sector has been revised down to .% in  and .% in . Public administration and defence is continuing to have the weakest outlook of all the sectors of the Northern Ireland economy, with output expected to contract by .% in , and by a further .% in . “Over the coming weeks, a number of potential Brexit options are possible, including a no-deal exit, a withdrawal agreement being reached, an extension of the Article  period or a general election,” Mr Lambe said. “Predicting what will happen next in the Brexit process is incredibly dficult, but businesses should behave prudently and use this time to ensure they are as prepared as they can be for a worst-case scenario, no-deal Brexit, in case it occurs at the end of this month.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/BOI11_web.jpg","title":"bank of ireland uk empowering colleagues to support local communities","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by Ulster Business Paul Slevin, Alison Mitchell, Ian Sheppard, Sally Irvine, Christine Graham and Paul Magee With a purpose to enable customers, colleagues and communities to thrive, Bank of Ireland UK staff are building on a long history of supporting local charities and community organisations. Ulster Business speaks to Northern Ireland managing director Ian Sheppard, and learns more about how colleagues are being empowered to play an active role in the local communities where they live and work Bank of Ireland UK sees developing its colleagues and helping customers and communities to thrive as part of its DNA, according to Ian Sheppard, managing director in Northern Ireland.From key charity partnerships, to fundraising, volunteering, sponsorship and more, Ian says the desire for Bank of Ireland UK is to make a positive impact by empowering colleagues to make a dference.“When I speak to my colleagues, I hear how really active and involved they are in their own community,” Ian says. “There are so many examples and I never cease to be amazed by their passion and commitment.An important partnership for the bank is with Alzheimer’s Society, its flagship charity for the last two years. In that time around £, has been raised in Northern Ireland, but as Ian explains it’s about more than fundraising.“We realised that not only can we help them financially, but there are resources we can share and opportunities we can offer which can help to signicantly raise the charity’s profile and raise much needed funds.”One example in which the bank has supported Alzheimer’s Society in this way is through its own long-running partnership with Ulster Rugby.“We donated our advertising and promotion activity for a televised game at the Kingspan Stadium making the charity ‘Sponsor for a Day’. This included using their logo on the back of the Ulster Rugby jerseys, taking over the pitch side boards and inviting a group of people living with dementia, their family and carers to the game – helping to get their brand message out to not only a stadium with capacity of , people but to a much wider TV audience.”Alzheimer’s Society sees some fantastic people giving their time to help others. That’s no clearer than its Side by Side programme, which Bank of Ireland UK helps to fund.The photograph on the front of this edition of the magazine taken at the Grand Opera House in Belfast features Mary Dalzell a Side by Side volunteer, alongside Hazel Whiteside, who has been living with dementia for two years.They share a love of music, theatre and cinema and the Side by Side programme, which re-connects people with dementia to their communities by doing the things they love, has not only put a smile on both their faces but has had a positive impact on their lives.There are so many people impacted by dementia and Alzheimers in our local communities, and its touching so many people’s lives, taking this as our motivation, the bank now has almost , staff trained as Dementia Friends.The bank’s ‘Give Together’ programme means staff can take one day a year to spend the time working with a charity or community organisation of their choice. “This day can involve anything from gardening work to painting a youth centre,” Ian says“Beyond Alzheimer’s Society, colleagues are helping many other organisations such as Macmillan Cancer Support, Cancer Research UK through its Relay for Le Legenderry, the Wooden Spoon children’s rugby charity, and Space NI, which offers support services in health and social care sectors to the local community.” You canabout some of the good work colleagues have done further on in this feature.“We are also committed to reflecting the community by developing a erse and modern workforce – which is part-and-parcel of a progressive company,” Ian says. “It’s something that current and future employees expect in their employer. For us its part of our DNA, something that’s always been there but we are now putting a clear and visible structure around it,” Ian says.This has included being a founding member of FuSIoN – the Financial Services Inclusion Network which drives to support and promote LGBT+ professionals across the sector, becoming JAM Card members – allowing staff to knowcustomers with a communication barrier need ‘just a minute’, as well as recently being awarded the Diversity Charter Mark.“Our community involvement is something we are very clear about - something I’m passionate about and it’s an easy ask to get staff engaged. It’s very natural, and it has always been developed from the ground up,” Ian says.He believes this contributes to the huge numbers of staff doing their bit – enabling their own local communities to thrive.  ALISON MITCHELLA customer service manager for Bank of Ireland UK in Londonderry, Alison has worked for the bank for  years, but her motivation for fundraising and support for Alzheimer’s Society began in , following her mother-in-law’s diagnosis with dementia. Alison trained at her local hospital to become a dementia volunteer and learned so much she asked Alzheimer’s Society to run similar sessions in her own branch to enable staff to better assist customers with dementia.Sadly, Alison’s mother-in-law passed away in May of this year but to mark her passing and to raise vital funds in her memory, Alison took part in Alzheimer’s Society Cupcake Day. Initial plans to simply sell cupcakes within her own branch changed rapidly as colleagues from nearby branches heard of the event and wanted to support both Alison and the charity.  Faced with orders for more than  cupcakes, Alison requested a Give Together day, which is time given by the bank to both iniduals and teams to give back to their communities. Alison says: “I was in the kitchen from am to pm baking and icing but it was worth it. The event raised £, which Bank of Ireland UK matched doubling the amount raised to £,. “I could not have achieved that without the support of family, colleagues and the wider business. I was proud to raise the funds in my mother-in-law’s memory and I am proud to work for an organisation that not only values our role in the wider community but supports it too.” CHRISTINE GRAHAMChristine Graham has helped to raise funds for Cancer Research UK through the Relay for Le “Legenderry” event held in St. Columb’s Park, Londonderry.The Derry-based senior business manager for Bank of Ireland UK has personally been touched by cancer as she lost two close family members to the disease. Her young great niece was also diagnosed with a rare form of cancer in  and is now doing well, but seeing the impact a cancer diagnosis has on a family inspired Christine to get involved with the Relay for Le event.“Our event truly is ‘legenderry’,” she says. It is a -hour relay race that brings the whole community together to celebrate the lives of cancer survivors, to remember those lost to the disease, to fight back by increasing our knowledge of cancer and by raising money to fund le-saving cancer research.”In just three years the event has raised over £, for Cancer Research UK with Christine helping to raise £, in  – not only the most successful Relay for Le event in the UK this year but all funds raised in Northern Ireland stays here.  Christine values the support she has had from the bank who promote the event to the wider community and from her colleagues who enter teams.“Relay for Le is for all ages and stages, all shapes and sizes,” she says. It’s cross community and intergenerational and the atmosphere every year is electric.”Plans are already underway for Relay for Le  which promises to be another massive event. PAUL MAGEEPaul Magee, associate director of the corporate banking team, became involved with the Ulster Region Committee for Wooden Spoon, the Children’s Charity of Rugby, five years ago after he successfully completed the charity’s Four Peaks Challenge, reaching the summits of the UK and Ireland’s highest peaks. He is now an active committee member for Wooden Spoon, helping to raise funds to provide le-enhancing experiences for disadvantaged and disabled children. “All funds raised in Ulster stay in the region and benefit the children here,” Paul says. “For instance, we provided £, to the Mae Murray Foundation to buy specialist equipment for the first fully accessible beach in Ulster at Benone Strand. When we created the access to the beach, one parent was very emotional as he watched his teenage daughter in the sea for the first time. It’s those occasions where we’re responding to a need within the community that makes the effort worthwhile.”Wooden Spoon has funded numerous charity projects, most recently £, for a new multi-sensory room at Parkview Special School in Lisburn and purchasing a horse for Riding for the Disabled Association in Coleraine, a charity that enhances children’s lives every day.  With his passion for and involvement in Wooden Spoon, Paul is grateful for the support Bank of Ireland has given him in his role with the organisation, specically the corporate banking team who value his dedication to making a dference. He says: “The bank has been fantastic – I appreciate the flexibility the team offers in the lead up to events and my colleagues often attend Wooden Spoon fundraisers. I’ve also benefited from the bank’s Give Together initiative, which offers days of paid leave that employees can use for volunteering. The bank’s support has helped facilitate my commitment to Wooden Spoon, where I can really see and be a part of the impact the charity has on the local community.” SALLY IRVINEOver the last  years Sally Irvine’s coffee mornings have become a highlight in the office calendar, in turn raising more than £, for MacMillan Cancer Support and funding  days of specialist nursing care for cancer patients across Northern Ireland.Sally, a business lending and credit governance manager at Bank of Ireland UK, arranged her first Macmillan Coffee Morning in  following a colleague’s cancer diagnosis. She found herself wanting to do something to help people living with cancer and so took the plunge and decided to be a host as part of Macmillan’s biggest coffee morning fundraising event. From the outset, Sally had tremendous support from her team members and the wider business, and this has contributed to the ongoing success of the event.The bank plays a huge part in ensuring Sally can deliver the event each year by giving her support through their Give Together scheme.Sally says: “The coffee morning has become a very special occasion and a great day of fun where people from across the bank come together to have a wee cuppa and a cake and take time to catch up while raising money for a really important cause. One in two of us will face cancer at some time in our lives and I am passionate about continuing to fundraise to provide the specialist nursing care that’s so vital for those living with cancer.”Plans are already underway for this year’s Macmillan Coffee Morning and Sally is hopeful the annual fundraiser will continue to hold a special place in the office calendar. PAUL SLEVINBranch manager at Bank of Ireland UK in Newry, Paul Slevin is someone who embodies the bank’s ethos of community involvement through his role with the charity Space NI.  Space NI offers support services in health and social care sectors to the local community. Through its service Home to Hospital, the organisation has helped  elderly people travel to crucial hospital appointments, while its Family Support Hub offers vital assistance to families in distress. Paul joined the charity in  and has just completed five years as chairman of the Board of Directors. He is proud that his background in finance has enabled him to support the charity through its repositioning process to ensure that its activities best serve the community.  Since Paul’s involvement with the charity began, Space NI has won the ‘One to Watch’ award at NI Social Enterprise Awards and the ‘Community Wellbeing Initiative’ at the All Ireland Pride of Place Awards. The organisation has also grown and opened a third premises in Newry and launched a range of volunteer made soy wax candles to raise crucial funds. “Bank of Ireland UK encourage all staff to give back,” Paul says. “Every manager I’ve had was very active in their community, so they were both great role models and great motivators. I think it’s really important to give our time, our expertise, and to do whatever we can to help and support the communities we live and work in.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/12312323.jpg","title":"novosco sold to global services giant for m","story":"Posted on Monday  October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland IT services firm Novosco has been bought by a German-based global industry giant for around £m, it has emerged.
