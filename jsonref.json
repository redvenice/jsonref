None of these people reported anything to police at the time.

Prince Albert had projected in 2016 that the restoration project would take at least a year to complete, and he was pretty close on his estimateNow with two children of his own, he told People magazine at the time that he purchased the property that he can\u0027t wait to make new memories there with his own children, twins Prince Jacques and Princess Gabriella.\u0027I\u0027m looking forward to showing the house to the kids, sharing it with them, having them see the garden,\u0027 he said. He projected then that the restoration project would take at least a year to complete, and he was pretty close on his estimate.

She now speaks fluent Swahili, because she was determined to converse with her children in their native tongue.Claire’s own mother couldn’t be more proud of how her daughter has chosen to do things — although she has baulked at some of the challenges she has faced.Take the first time Helen, now 63, flew over to visit in 2012 — just a day or so after grandchild number three, Bella, arrived.When Claire was sent from the orphanage to pick up Bella at a neighbouring village, the word was that this abandoned little bundle of skin and bones, weighing just 10lb, was a few months old. In fact, she turned out to be two years old.Helen remembers Claire patiently tending to the little girl’s tiny fingernails and toenails, but not in the usual way.          First there was Alfie, then 13 months old, a little boy she coaxed to smile, and went on to foster and adopt. Alfie is now ten. His siblings, Layla and Isabella, are eight, and little Jack is five‘I remember sitting watching Claire picking maggots virtually out of every pore. It brought home the conditions these children had been brought up in.’There are other colourful memories, such as that time she put bread in the toaster and ‘all the creepy-crawlies came out’. And Nanny — as Helen is known by the children — hasn’t quite recovered from the fact Claire was perfectly happy sharing the kitchen with a lizard.‘It was on the wall,’ she complains. ‘I had a problem with that. But nothing fazes Claire.’Those exotic anecdotes may be numbered, though. Although it was never Claire’s plan to return to the UK with her children, changing circumstances have forced a rethink, and she is trying to get home — new family in tow.Her own mother could not be happier, and the Skype conversations are all about the move. Alfie is desperate to see snow. And they all want to visit Buckingham Palace, and see a red London bus in real life instead of in the books Nanny sends.There is a problem, though. While love is clearly in abundance in this family, money is not. The political climate in Tanzania (meaning Westerners aren’t finding it as easy to get work) means Claire isn’t working — and is finding it difficult to support her family.While her parents have always helped her out, they aren’t in a position to do so now. Helen works in the catering industry and lives modestly in a one-bedroom home. Claire’s dad, Derek, from whom Helen was amicably orced, died earlier this year.So how can Claire fund the expensive return to the UK? Well, she has turned to that very modern charitable source — crowdfunding, appealing to friends, family and strangers to donate. She needs to raise £34,000 to get herself and the four children back to the UK, the bulk of the money needed for flights and lawyers to assist with the visa applications.

They are pictured here in 2017          Although they have no blood ties, the emotional bonds are as strong as they get. ‘They are typical siblings,’ Claire laughs at their spacious, if slightly chaotic, family home just outside Arusha, in north-eastern TanzaniaYet as much as her own family supports her, not everyone does. News reports about her appeal this week were met with a decidedly mixed reaction.While some applauded Claire’s ‘mission’, others have questioned the idea that she should be financially bailed out when the decision to take on the four children was hers alone.One particularly brutal online commentator called her a potential ‘Madonna on benefits’. And what will happen, some asked, if the family still struggle after they arrive in the UK? Will the taxpayer have to foot the bill?‘The whole point is to get them over here so Claire can work,’ Helen says. ‘She has no intention of being on benefits.‘And if I can say one thing about her is that she is a hard worker. She has never been work-shy — quite the opposite, in fact. She came home when her dad was ill, to be with him when he died, and even in those few weeks she got a job here.’Claire herself is appalled at the suggestion she is trying to milk the system. ‘There is no way I want to be on benefits. It’s not who I am. My parents instilled the idea of hard work in me, and I want to do the same with my children. It’s exactly why I want to come home so they can see me work.’It’s a dilemma Madonna and Angelina Jolie and those high-profile advocates of foreign adoption simply do not face. Deep pockets can smooth all manner of problems.          While her parents have always helped her out, they aren’t in a position to do so now. Helen works in the catering industry and lives modestly in a one-bedroom home. Claire’s dad, Derek, from whom Helen was amicably orced, died earlier this yearClaire will have to rely on family to help with childcare while she works and her plight does raise genuine questions about whether the heart should rule the head even in these emotive matters.Should we applaud Claire’s selflessness in putting these children above all else, or question her naivety in thinking she could do it alone?The family’s answer, of course, is that she is not alone. They are clearly close, and have been through a good deal together. The Claire they waved off to Tanzania at 19 certainly hadn’t had a sheltered life.Claire’s elder brother, Adam, was killed in an accident when he was 12, when a rope became tangled round his neck while he was playing. Understandably, Helen and Derek were highly protective of Claire. ‘But you can’t wrap them in cotton wool,’ she argues. ‘And we tried so hard to bring Claire up to be as independent as possible.‘We were worried when she wanted to go to Tanzania, but we knew how she felt about wanting to work with children,’ Helen says. ‘We heard all about Alfie, who seemed special to her. But I had no idea she was talking about my future grandson!’.Claire has cared for more than 200 children since she arrived in Tanzania in 2009, but Alfie touched her heart most. An orphan, Alfie, then 13 months old, was perhaps not in as pitiful a state physically as some of the other children (‘we couldn’t save some of the babies who were so malnourished when they came in’) but his behaviour upset her.‘He was very withdrawn and bewildered. Toddlers in the orphanage were always more aware than the little babies, and Alfie just wouldn’t smile. I was drawn to him. You try not to favour one child, but because I was trying so hard to get through to him, it was hard. I got to the stage where I coaxed a smile out of him, and a bond developed. He’d look for me if I left the room.’          Five months after Alfie moved in, baby Layla followed. Then came Bella, then JackThat first stint in Tanzania was a short one and Claire returned to the UK to work as a nanny.She felt compelled to go back, however, but when she did she discovered Alfie had been moved to a different orphanage 15km away. She went to visit him. ‘I’m sure he recognised me even at the start,’ she says. ‘But by the end of that visit he was in tears. They had to prise him off me.’Distraught, she wondered if she could somehow sponsor Alfie. But her inquiries led to her asking if she could foster the little boy, and in 2011 she became his sole carer. ‘I still wasn’t thinking adoption,’ she says. ‘At the start, that never occurred to me. And he wasn’t the only one I fostered. I’d often have the sickest babies overnight, or for longer periods. But Alfie stayed.’Five months after Alfie moved in, baby Layla followed. Then came Bella, then Jack. ‘It was a natural progression,’ Claire says.‘It felt right. I’ve always felt that however good an orphanage is, children thrive best in a home situation.’ It was 2016 before the legal process to adopt all four children was completed, but Claire says they felt like ‘hers’ practically from the moment they arrived.Did she ever sit her parents down and tell them about her adoption plans? ‘No,’ she says. ‘But it wasn’t like it was one big decision. It was a series of little ones. And they were always right behind me. They came out and met the children. My dad doted on them. He couldn’t have helped more, and he was really proud of what I was doing.’          \u0027The plan was never to return to the UK, though. ‘I thought our lives would always be in Tanzania,’ Claire saysThe plan was never to return to the UK, though. ‘I thought our lives would always be in Tanzania,’ Claire says.Outwardly, they must seem well off compared to the locals. Like many in the expat community, they have a security guard patrolling their home (‘It’s essential,’ says Claire), and a woman who is employed as a cleaner, cook and babysitter. Whenever Claire was working at the orphanage or, latterly, when she has returned to the UK for visits, this lady has looked after the children.But the lifestyle is no longer tenable. The children have been educated at an international school — so they would be fluent in English — and the fees were not affordable some time ago, ‘but luckily when I explained this the school agreed to let the children stay on anyway’.Hence the idea of moving back. Losing her father has just reinforced the idea that Claire needs to be at home.‘It was such a shock,’ she said. ‘Dad was the fittest person I know. He was never ill. But he collapsed one day, and he was dead seven weeks later. I made it home to see him before he died, but it has been devastating. It’s made me realise I want the children to grow up with their extended family. The expat community is a transient one. At home, we will have support.’But the costs involved are eye-watering. And there are other problems, too. It’s by no means a given that the British authorities will extend the sort of warm welcome the family want, and the state of Claire’s bank account will be a major deciding factor.          Claire has cared for more than 200 children since she arrived in Tanzania in 2009, but Alfie touched her heart most‘To satisfy the immigration authorities, you have to have a certain amount in your bank account, around £5,000, and prove that you can support your children, so we are working towards that,’ says Claire.Her online critics will say she clearly can’t support the children, if she is having to crowdfund. Her reply? ‘But longer term, I will be able to. And the big thing is that we have somewhere to live. We are not asking for State assistance.’Claire’s aunt and uncle have offered her and her children a home in the UK. It will be a squeeze, admits Sally Clifford-Smith, 53, who shares her four-bedroom home with her husband and daughter, 22. ‘But we are so looking forward to getting them all home,’ she adds. ‘We aren’t in a position to hand over thousands of pounds, but we can do this.’For Helen, though, the day that she can throw her arms around her grandchildren on British soil can’t come quickly enough.‘I cannot wait,’ she says. ‘I love these children to bits, and we just want them all home.’To help Claire, donate at youcaring.comtheupshall children-836976"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/11/20/4C1BEFD500000578-0-image-m-70_1526068656020.jpg","title":"A spiky guide royal survival Princess Dianas private secretary","story":"    Meghan will be judged by standards that have never been entirely defined, writes Jephson\u0027It\u0027s not too late to send me an invite\u0027: Meghan Markle\u0027s...Share this articleMemories of Wallis Simpson, the last American orcee to marry into tsheir ranks, are long, unhappy — and regularly resurface.For the Windsors, therefore, the royal wedding represents a momentous gamble.What, then, must Meghan learn?For the hard reality is that survival as a royal newcomer in a 1,000-year-old family business takes much more than a winning smile and a stylish curtsey.Meghan will be judged by standards that have never been entirely defined and cannot be found in any reference book or on any website.But after eight years as Princess Diana\u0027s equerry and then private secretary, I can offer her the following pointers . . .NEVER ROCK THE ROYAL BOATContrary to what some may think, the essential qualification of a new princess is not an encyclopaedic knowledge of obscure palace protocol, nor the ability to maintain a diplomatically acceptable level of small talk with a halitosis-stricken visiting head of state. Nor, even, is it a talent for getting out of a low-slung limousine in a low-cut evening gown while maintaining the highest standards of modesty.Least of all is it a gift for attracting huge crowds of adoring new fans (or acres of drooling newsprint).Instead, the one key skill Meghan absolutely must perfect is how to avoid being seen as any kind of a destabilising force.In the whispering labyrinth of the court, unexpected surprises, even nice ones, can be misinterpreted as threats. Anything new or unknown, until it is proven to be harmless, will therefore be treated with suspicion — even hostility. When you\u0027re in the dynasty business, everything is subjected to the ultimate test: will this personthingideadevelopment help or hinder the survival of the current royal line?          The public\u0027s impression of Diana as a gutsy woman doing her best to help those in need was  essentially accurate. Pictured: Princess Diana and Patrick Jephson in Hungary in 1990It\u0027s a useful guideline when weighing the pros and cons of any intended course of action, from saving a local playgroup, to saving an endangered species, to saving the planet. What always comes first is saving the monarchy.Why? Because the Windsors know that all the grand trappings of royalty are held in trust for the British people and that the monarchy depends for its survival on a very volatile commodity: the benign approval — or, at the very least, tolerance — of its subjects.They also know that everything they hold dear could be lost through miscalculation. After all, in recent family history, their European counterparts have lost their thrones despite reigning for generations with every appearance of indestructibility.The guillotine may never be erected in Trafalgar Square, but a fickle public mood multiplied by merciless digital media has the capacity to decapitate an unpopular royal family — or family member — as surely as any blade.Postponing that day is the unwritten first duty of those in the British royal dynasty business.So, Meghan\u0027s prime function will be to support the Crown, avoid bringing it into disrepute and act as a non-political focus of national unity. Everything else — even developing a globally acclaimed portfolio of irreproachably good causes — is superfluous. The bottom line is that, as a princess, she has no remit to save the world or anything in it. Or preach at us, admonish us or signal any fashionable virtue.Her job is to exist, preferably without rocking the constitutional boat. And if, in the process, by the way she conducts her own life, she gently inspires us to do more and better with our own, then she\u0027ll probably be treated with respect and remembered with affection far into the future.DON\u0027T FORGET ABOUT THE CHAPSNobody could doubt Meghan\u0027s sincerity when she said: \u0027Right now, with so many campaigns like #MeToo and #TimesUp, there\u0027s no better time to continue to shine a light on women feeling empowered and people supporting them.\u0027However, the perspective that draws such warm applause at Californian awards ceremonies may need adjusting in a nation with a female prime minister and female head of state.Indeed, Meghan\u0027s advisers may also feel uneasy about an attitude that so readily excludes half the population. She might also like to bear in mind that quite a few members of the Royal Family are men and that not all of them have always managed to achieve #MeToo-approved standards of what is considered to be correct male behaviour.          One key skill Meghan absolutely must perfect is how to avoid being seen as any kind of a destabilising forceBEWARE THE REST OF THE FAMILYIt\u0027s been several centuries since any of Harry\u0027s forebears cut off the head of a wife who displeased him. But Meghan should be in no doubt about the House of Windsor\u0027s ability and willingness to exercise some very modern tortures on errant newcomers.Among these must be counted the clumsy efforts of some misguided Charles loyalists to smear Diana not just as sad and mad, but bad as well. As the Diana tragedy confirmed, when dealing with perceived threats, Windsors can be quite uncompromising.If you acquire for yourself a profile, a purpose and a passionate public devotion independent of the royal mainstream, then you risk being perceived and presented as a threat to the Crown itself.This will mobilise the full forces of the Establishment against you.And it won\u0027t feel constrained by any fluffy notions of old-fashioned British fair play.Whatever fairytale image Meghan may have once had of palace life, the reality is as old as time: behind the public image, courts are breeding grounds of intrigue, ambition, gossip and jealousy.DON\u0027T LET IT ALL GO TO YOUR HEADOne evening, I accompanied Diana to a glittering New York ceremony at which she was given the Humanitarian of the Year award. This was an honour she\u0027d tried to resist, partly on the grounds that her job meant she should be giving out awards, not receiving them.Afterwards, over a glass of champagne, I told her: \u0027I think you were right to accept this one. You\u0027ve certainly earned it.\u0027She briefly raised her eyebrows, then turned to look at the night-time Manhattan skyline.\u0027No, Patrick, I don\u0027t deserve this,\u0027 she said. Then she raised her glass. \u0027But I am working on it.\u0027That phrase summed up her vision of herself. And it wasn\u0027t a bad poster image for a very successful brand of royalty: modesty and determination.The danger of Meghan forming a false sense of her own worth is very real.    Everything apart from serving the crown - even developing a globally acclaimed portfolio of irreproachably good causes - is superfluousBE TRUE TO YOURSELFA large part of royal interaction — and especially the bit of it we see in public — is a kind of act. When I was at the palace, we used to joke that nine-tenths of being royal was turning up at the right place at the right time in the right clothes with the right speech in your pocket and the right expression on your face.However, Meghan should beware. Any suspicion that your public persona is not an honest reflection of your real personality will become obvious, sooner or later.It\u0027s also wise to remember that hardly anyone, not even a trained actress, can keep up an act for ever. So Meghan may as well decide that the part of her she allows us to see is one that is both real and reliably predictable. Take Princess Diana. The public\u0027s impression of Diana as a gutsy woman doing her best to help those in need — while raising two sons and fulfilling exaggerated expectations as a royal role model — was, as I saw for myself, essentially accurate.People liked what they saw, believed it to be authentic and wanted more of it.ONE THING YOU SHOULD NEVER DOIn a lifetime of royal service, Meghan cannot expect always to please. She should think long and carefully, however, before reaching for the race card as a response to unfavourable news stories.Her erse ancestry is a positive asset for the House of Windsor, as its members and supporters are well aware. But it would be tragic if Meghan or her husband got into the habit of firing ethnic warning shots at the very same media that will reliably trumpet all their good work for years to come.STEER CLEAR OF POLITICSMeghan should make an early vow to avoid all activity or communication that might be interpreted as a comment on politics or public policy. Her reputation won\u0027t survive theatrical interventions in areas that rightly belong to elected politicians.So her widely advertised support for Democratic politics in the U.S. is a piece of personal baggage that must now be jettisoned. The sacred royal duty of political neutrality doesn\u0027t end at the shores of the kingdom.          Top priority for a royal apprentice is to know the distinction between celebrity and royaltySEEK OUT THE BEST ADVICEThe Royals can choose from a limitless smorgasbord of advice — good, bad and downright dangerous. Ultimately, it\u0027s where Meghan chooses to turn for it that will determine much of her success or failure as a princess.Diana didn\u0027t always choose her advisers wisely. By the time she gave a self-sabotaging interview to the BBC\u0027s Panorama, she had an increasing tendency to seek advice from those who saw her as a useful vehicle for their own agendas.Sadly, they encouraged her to portray herself as a victim, rather than as the strong, influential woman I knew her to be.NEVER COMPLAIN, NEVER EXPAINThe Queen has demonstrated over the course of a lifetime that modern monarchy works best when it sticks to the old rule: \u0027Never complain, never explain.\u0027Prince Charles favours a different tactic, drawing criticism for what has been seen as an unwise amount of complaining and an un-royal amount of explaining.Even Harry\u0027s mother was rather too fond of both — although, in Diana\u0027s defence, she may have learned it from her husband.The public doesn\u0027t always respond well to complaints from those who have virtually unlimited resources and plenty of privacy. LEAVE YOUR SHOWBIZ DAYS BEHIND YOUTop priority for a royal apprentice is to know the distinction between celebrity and royalty.Meghan may find that she can\u0027t go to her local shop on Kensington High Street without causing a minor riot. With that kind of profile, it\u0027s all too easy to think your very existence is cause for celebration.For Meghan, who has devoted so much energy to acquiring celebrity, the task of distinguishing between fame she\u0027s earned and fame she has acquired through Harry may be particularly hard. So, if she hasn\u0027t worked it out yet, now is the time to get it clear in her own mind.Get it wrong and she may never be forgiven.Meghan is particularly vulnerable in this respect because there\u0027ll always be sceptics ready to question whether her marriage is a love story or just part of a long-running fame campaign. Although many of the perks of royalty and celebrity are identical, the defining difference is that celebrity lifestyles are won, while royal privileges are granted.They exist in return for a life devoted to service, with lots of visible, unenviable duty and the appearance of sacrifice.Meghan may have already worked out that huge public warmth is directed at Harry and would be shared by anyone he chose to marry.So, even more than most royal newcomers, she\u0027ll be judged by her success as the never-failing source to her husband of strength, comfort, encouragement and wisdom.If Meghan allows doubt to grow that she is anything less than devoted to her man, his family and her obligations to her adopted country, then she may not have the luxury of any second chances.          \u0027Patrick, we\u0027ll do animal charities when we run out of people charities,\u0027 Diana would say when requests came in for her to be pictured with cuddly animalsKEEP OPINIONS TO YOURSELFBeing royal means that you will automatically always be heard, even when you just whisper.It\u0027s a magical power, given to very few and earned by even fewer.Unlike a struggling actress, a princess will be listened to respectfully and in silence, bar a few polite laughs at the right moments.This readily given approval can all too easily give the speaker an inflated and dangerously misleading perception of her own oratory and intellect.The Royal Family usually does best when it follows the example of the Queen.Despite having a powerful platform on which to share her views, insights, big ideas, wishes and prejudices, Her Majesty has resolutely kept her opinions to herself. AVOID CUDDLY ANIMALSCentral to Diana\u0027s success as a humanitarian was her instinct for what made best use of both her status and her compassion.She focused on causes that resonate in the public mind.Her sons have developed their own distinctive and admirable style. But one area where they\u0027ve taken a very different tack is in their promotion of conservation, especially in Africa.\u0027Patrick, we\u0027ll do animal charities when we run out of people charities,\u0027 Diana would say when requests came in for her to be pictured with cuddly animals.The most eloquent speech on the evils of the ivory trade will still do little to boost Meghan\u0027s profile.AND FINALLY...REAP THE REWARDSThe best news for Meghan, for Harry and for an expectant British public is that if she gets it right, the reward will be the secure evolution of the great institution that has welcomed her — and two lives made complete by their service to humanity.  Adapted from The Meghan Factor by Patrick Jephson, published by Bombardier Books, priced £11.22 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/08/01/044D3588000007D0-0-image-m-13_1525740168377.jpg","title":"Record employment figures suggest key happiness really holding 9 5","story":"    The key to happiness really is holding down a stable job, say experts (stock photo)Proof benefits cap DOES work: 48,000 drop in the number of...Unemployment could be set to fall to levels not seen since...Share this articleThe findings are a boon for Theresa May and the Tories, who have overseen falling unemployment since 2010.Latest figures show more than 32million are in work – the most ever.

They said unemployment is often linked to lower levels of well-being, as it can lead to psychological issues such as low self-esteem and loneliness.The report said: \u0027Unemployment is the macroeconomic phenomenon most detrimental to national well-being, and maintaining low unemployment should be a major focus of economic policy.\u0027One of the researchers, John Helliwell of the University of British Columbia, said inflation was another useful predictor of happiness but unemployment had twice as powerful an effect.Earlier this week figures showed 48,000 once jobless families have moved into employment since the 2013 benefits cap, which limited handouts to £23,000 a year. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/12/00/4C1E11FB00000578-5720089-image-m-98_1526080239734.jpg","title":"Solar powered gadgets British garden","story":"    This solar barbecue probably works best on an Australian beachThis space-age-looking barbecue uses curvy reflectors to direct the power of the sun onto a metal vacuum tube, which then heats up to — apparently — as high as 270c to cook the food within.The food is inserted into a stainless cooking tray, which you slot into the machine for 30 minutes. It also has a lightweight carrying bag. The downside? It probably works best on an Australian beach. On a sunny British afternoon, the tube barely warmed up at all, even though I left it out all day.Verdict: Disaster. My sausages came out hardly lukewarm, let alone cooked or edible. And the narrow tube can only fit food for one person at a time.  SOLAR MASON JARS (various suppliers)Every trendy garden party needs a mason jar these days, whether it’s to drink cocktails from or to hold artfully rustic wildflower arrangements.Now, you can even use them as lighting and decoration rolled into one thanks to the solar panels hidden in the lids.          Every trendy garden party needs a mason jar these days - and these are truly usefulMy favourite, a blue-and-green stripy one from Argos (£9.99, argos.co.uk), stored enough sun in two hours to properly light up my dinner table in the evening, casting out pretty radiating stripes of coloured light onto my white tablecloth and lasting five hours or more.A jar containing a string of 50 delicate fairy lights also did solid service as a table light (£9.99, argos.co.uk).Sainsbury’s does a fun supersize range, too (£28), with rattan ropes so you can hang them from branches or stand them on the patio.Verdict: Truly useful — and so pretty. Never faff about with a candle lantern again!  SOLAR RADIO (£24.99, amazon.co.uk)          A solar radio is a great garden-enhancing purchaseWhy pay for batteries or battle with endless extension leads when you can harness the power of the sun to listen to your favourite radio station in the garden — for up to six hours? You may wonder when you try this robust little gadget with a flip-up solar panel on top that charges to full in four hours of medium sun.It comes with a powerful reading light and torch — and there’s even an alarmingly loud SOS alarm, presumably for campers who run into trouble in the wild, but you could easily use it to signal to your other half that it’s time for another G\u0026ampT . . .Verdict: A garden-enhancing buy.  TRUEFLAME TORCH LIGHTS (£24.99, thesolarcentre.co.uk)These torch-style garden lights promise to add an oddly medieval touch to your garden parties. They even come with a spike so you can easily dig them into your flowerbed or lawn.They charge up during the day in direct sunlight and switch on at dusk, producing an attractive flickering flame effect for most of the night.          The TrueFlame torch lights are stylish, unusual and perfect for a garden partyKeep them clear of any shady areas, though — the strength of the light depends on how much sun they get through the day.The design has also been adapted for the British weather, and the maker claims you can even use them in winter.Verdict: Stylish and unusual — perfect if you plan to party in the garden until dawn.  FLOATING POOL FOUNTAIN (£24.99, amazon.co.uk)Every garden needs a water feature — and having no pond, or even space to put one, need not be a hindrance any longer.This hilarious floating fountain sits in your paddling pool, and uses a solar panel the size of an iPad to produce a jet of squirting water nearly a foot high, albeit with a loud churning noise from the internal motor.

As long as the sun shines, that is — because comically, as soon as it goes behind a cloud, the fountain slows to a pathetic dribble before subsiding altogether. What a disappointment!You also have to connect the solar panel to the fountain via a rather unattractive thick black wire, which ruins the look a bit.Verdict: Inconsistent — still, it’s a fun party trick for a truly cloudless sunny day.  SOLAR WIND SPINNER (£12.99, aldi.co.uk)          The solar wind spinner takes two days to charge fully but runs beautifullyAt 130cm high — about the height of a tall sunflower — this brushed bronze wind spinner adds a decorative touch to your garden.It takes a bit of a breeze to get the blades spinning, but looks great. There’s also a solar-powered globe light in the middle, which changes colour at night. It takes two days to charge fully, but runs beautifully.Verdict: Pretty, if a little pointless. It will definitely confuse the moths.  FAIRY HOUSE (£11.99, amazon.co.uk)          This fairy house would be a sure winner with young childrenThis wood-effect — but actually extremely plastic — fairy house has a small solar panel on the roof. The idea is that it stores the sun’s rays during the day — taking four hours to charge — then produces a warm orange glow through most of the night.After a full day’s charging, the fairy house did light up dimly and looked slightly magical, I have to admit. A similar lighthouse model I tried did nothing much, however.Verdict: A sure winner with young children — if parents can bear the tacky plastic look of it during the day  INTEX POOL HEATING PAD (£21, amazon.co.uk)Even with the mercury rising, there’s nothing fun about dipping a toe into a freezing paddling pool.So after filling mine with icy water, I hopefully attached this heating pad.          The Intex pool heating pad would probably work well in the Sahara...A pump takes water from your pool via a hose and pushes it through a thin, 1.2 m sq black pad, where it heats up as it’s exposed to the sun’s rays beating down on the pad, before being pumped back into the pool. Or at least that’s the idea. So, was it worth covering up part of my carefully tended lawn with the ugly PVC pad?After three hours of soaking up the rays, the pad was very hot to touch (beware any toddler running onto it!).However, there was no discernible difference in pool water temperature all day — let alone the extra 3-5c it promised.Verdict: Maybe it would work in the Sahara, but it did nothing in Britain’s milder climate.  SOLAR CHARGER POWER BANK (£13.99, amazon.co.uk)This sounds perfect for outdoor weekends when you never get time to plug in your phone. It’s a block about the size of an iPhone, with 20 solar-powered cells on its surface.However, it promises far more than it delivers. It took all day to charge and then barely got my phone to 10 per cent battery in two hours.Verdict: This really is a last resort — when you on a long country walk or having a day out far from any power points.          This solar charger power bank promises far more than it delivers            The beauty of this watch is that it charges from a solar cell hidden in the clockfaceCASIO \u0027TOUGH SOLAR\u0027 WATCH (£34.99, amazon.co.uk)Most of us have suffered a wristwatch battery conking out. The beauty of this watch is that it charges from a solar cell hidden in the clockface. However you may end up being late if you don’t adjust your wardrobe accordingly — if covered by long sleeves, it may run down.It’s incredibly easy to recharge, taking ten minutes in sunshine or up to an hour through a window. Also, it’s waterproof and includes a stopwatch to time your laps in the swimming pool.Verdict: It will keep summer ticking away nicely.  RETRO LIGHTS (string of 4, £4.99 Aldi.co.uk, or set of six clip-ons, £12.99, argos.co.uk)The beauty of solar power is there’s no fuss. There are no wires or electricity needed, you simply hang these pretty retro fairy lights wherever you want them, and they charge for two hours then shine all night long. Made of non-breakable plastic, they come either in a string to drape over tree branches, or as oversized single bulbs in blue and green — to add a carnival feel.Verdict: Party heaven, as long as you have some other light source, too. The light is fairly dim but the glow looks cosy and inviting.          These retro lights are made of non-breakable plastic, charge for two hours and then shine all night long"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/11/08/4C03263600000578-0-image-m-29_1526024373393.jpg","title":"Tory MPs told post animal pictures Instagram","story":"    Tory MPs have been told they need to show they are \u0027real people\u0027 by posting animal pictures on social media.

Over the same period average fees increased from £11,300 a year to £17,200 now.Even some private school heads themselves have admitted that their traditional parents have been priced out and increasingly school places are instead filled with children of the world’s super-wealthy.Although the Durham school’s budget is tight, its leaders say they can cut costs by not having grand facilities such as swimming pools – and much of the money will be spent on hiring good teachers.The headmaster, Chris Gray, was previously head of Grindon Hall Christian School, which failed an Ofsted inspection several years ago because of the government’s ‘British values’ drive. Although it had previously been judged as ‘good’, it was downgraded because inspectors thought it did not teach pupils to respect other faiths and communities enough.  A school has banned expensive pencil cases to stop children from poorer families feeling stigmatised.

In his absence, it is left to the surgery\u0027s 3,300 patients to voice their fury. \u0027It\u0027s ridiculous,\u0027 said grandmother Joyce Noley, 58.\u0027This place is vital. It has been here ever since I have, and that\u0027s 40 years. There are lots of old and disabled people. Where are they meant to go?\u0027 Retired cleaner Ellen Charles, a 71-year-old asthmatic who lives with her husband Alan, 67, who has survived a stroke, added: \u0027I was devastated when I found it was closing down. It couldn\u0027t be more convenient. The doctors knew my name and I knew the girls behind reception. Now that\u0027s all gone.\u0027 As for 89-year-old Connie Scott, a greatgrandmother and patient of Osler House since it opened, she learned about the closure in a letter sent in February.Patients calling 999 will be told to show handlers a live...Women and bereaved families caught in NHS breast cancer...Share this articleShe now faces a four-bus round-trip taking more than 40 minutes each way to see a new doctor.\u0027When I found out about the closure, I was so angry it actually made me ill for a few days,\u0027 said Mrs Scott, who became the face of protest at the closure in an online video. \u0027I\u0027ve been so happy in Harlow but this has broken my heart.\u0027What has added to the sense of anger are the circumstances in which the surgery was shut. The decision to close Osler House was taken without any consultation with patients. The powers-that-be simply informed them they had no choice but to shut the surgery for good.Osler House was too small, too expensive to run and no other practice wanted to take on the contract, the West Essex Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) claimed. They even tried to spin the closure as good news.\u0027There is now a huge opportunity for patients to benefit from the services offered by local larger health centre teams nearby,\u0027 the CCG said in a letter to Robert Halfon, Harlow\u0027s Conservative MP. But is that what patients really want? Not according to Mrs Scott and her fellow patients. They say that proximity to a surgery where they can see a doctor who knows them is what matters above all. Sadly, the reality is that up and down the country, 700 surgeries, many of them smaller ones, have closed over the past five years.Today, one in four is a \u0027superpractice\u0027 with more than 10,000 patients on its books, and the proportion of surgeries with such list sizes has risen by 27 per cent since 2013.But that isn\u0027t the only way in which general practice has changed in Britain, because Osler House wasn\u0027t run by a local GP or a partnership of doctors, but by a private company.Called The Practice Group (TPG), this company is responsible for some 50 GP practices and healthcare centres, providing more than a million appointments each year for 200,000 patients across the country.           The Practice Group (TPG) is majority-owned by a hugely wealthy health insurance company based 4,000 miles from Harlow in St Louis, Missouri (pictured)In 2016, the company was paid almost £30 million by the NHS for its services. And yet the reason it gave for pulling out of the contract with Osler House? That it was no longer \u0027financially viable\u0027 for it to run it. Nor is this the first time that The Practice Group has pulled the plug on GP surgeries because it was not being paid enough.Which is, perhaps, all the more surprising because TPG is, in turn, majority-owned by a hugely wealthy health insurance company based 4,000 miles from Harlow in St Louis, Missouri.Called the Centene Corporation, its motto is \u0027Better health outcomes at lower costs\u0027.It\u0027s a corporate behemoth, with revenues tipped t o hit £45 billion in 2018 and a chief executive who pocketed £18.6 million last year.Yet currently, it is facing legal action in the States, accused of failing to provide its customers with the medical services they have paid for. \u0027There are some serious issues in this case,\u0027 says Seth Lesser, a New York lawyer acting for some of the claimants.\u0027Centene appears to be an example where the private market is not doing a good job.\u0027 Concerns over the involvement of foreign firms in the running of the NHS heightened as it emerged that an IT company from Dallas was at the centre of the scandal over women missing breast cancer checks having had a contract to run the software for the NHS\u0027s screening programme since 2015.The company denied responsibility for the glitch. Dr Richard Vautrey, the BMA\u0027s GP committee chairman, says there are certainly worries about the involvement of private companies in the provision of primary care. \u0027Practices are being closed because they are no longer financially viable,\u0027 he told the Mail.\u0027Private companies are more likely to walk away from those contracts than GPs who are committed to the local community. \u0027The normal model remains a group of GPs working in a partnership. If you are the business owner and also on the shop floor day by day seeing patients, then you are likely to be more responsive to their needs than if you are a remote business owner who doesn\u0027t have direct contact with patients on a daily basis.The key point is that whoever is running the business needs to be directly connected with the local community.\u0027 For the first 50 years of the NHS, a general practice typically comprised one or more doctors working alone or in a partnership in shared premises under a standard contract with the government. But new types of contract were introduced under a Labour government in 1998 and 2004 that were locally negotiated and allowed commercial, voluntary sector and other new providers to offer GP services. Since then, a number of privately-run commercial companies, both big and small, have entered the market.Their share is put at less than five per cent of the 7,500-odd GP surgeries in England — but amid mounting pressures to cut NHS costs, it is a sector with the potential for massive growth. Of the private companies active in the primary care market — Richard Branson\u0027s Virgin Care is one such player — The Practice Group is amongst the largest. It was set up in 2005 by two GPs, Dr Jeremy Rose and Dr Ajit Kadirgamar, and Peter Watts, a former investment banker.Based in Amersham, Bucks, the company started out by winning a contract to supply GPs to carry out ward rounds at the local hospital. It was then awarded three contracts to run GP surgeries, and over the years has taken on more contracts, as well as surgeries in prisons, walk-in centres and specialist clinics.By centralising IT, human resources and other admin functions, The Practice Group hoped to maximise profits. In a 2010 newspaper interview, Mr Watts, then chief executive (he no longer works for the company), spoke of his ambition to grow its turnover from £18 million to £100 million in five years. \u0027The more patients we get, the more economic we become,\u0027 he said. \u0027It works on an actuarial analysis the more patients you have, the less risk you carry.And if we can do it for less, why not?\u0027 That same year, The Practice Group merged with another company to give them a total portfolio of 50 practices and healthcare units. \u0027Bigger is better,\u0027 Mr Watts said at the time. As well as investment from the founders, TPG has received substantial injections of cash.But despite its ambitions, it has not declared a profit in any year for which accounts are available. The 2016 accounts report a loss of £1.3 million on a turnover of £29.5 million, while in 2015 there was loss of £637,000 on a turnover of £28.9 million. During its lifetime, investors have put £19.5 million into the business. In 2015, this included a £4.16 million investment by the American health giant Centene for a 49 per cent share of the business. In 2016, Centene increased its interest to 75 per cent with an additional £5.18 million investment.According to a note on the The Practice Group accounts, Centene plans to inject further cash in the future. Such sums are small beer for Centene, which is one of the biggest players in America\u0027s multibillion dollar health insurance market. It employs 32,000 staff, many of them at its swanky HQ on Centene Plaza in downtown St Louis.In the U.S. alone, the company and its subsidiaries serve 12.3 million people in 28 states. Centene has concentrated on providing insurance for the uninsured or under-insured, from cash-strapped middle income families to prison inmates.          Concerns over the involvement of foreign firms in the running of the NHS heightened as it emerged that an IT company from Dallas was at the centre of the scandal over women missing breast cancer checks (stock image)This year, it expects to earn more than £45 billion. Much of its success has come under the leadership of 74-year-old chief executive and chairman Michael Neidorff, the highest-paid executive of the eight largest publicly traded health insurers in the U.S. He and his wife, Noemi, a Hungarian-born pianist, are generous patrons of St Louis\u0027 arts scene, particularly the opera. But the Centene success story is not without controversy.Every U.S. health insurance company has to provide customers with a local list of doctors, dentists, hospitals and other medical organisations who accept their insurance plans. However, in a federal \u0027class action\u0027 lawsuit announced in January, Centene has been accused of not providing adequate access to doctors in 15 states. \u0027Members have difficulty finding — in many cases cannot find — medical providers,\u0027 according to documents filed in the multi- million dollar lawsuit.Buyers of its Ambetter insurance plan around the U.S. \u0027report strikingly similar experiences\u0027, finding that the provider network was \u0027largely fictitious\u0027.Nurses, medical students and even non-doctors have been designated as primary care providers, it is claimed. But customers discovered this only after they had paid thousands of dollars and were locked into the policy, it is alleged. People signing up for Centene insurance \u0027discovered there were no doctors\u0027, says lawyer Mr Lesser.\u0027In America, Centene has grown much too fast to be able to service all the people for whom it issued insurance,\u0027 Mr Lesser says. \u0027We have also seen that Centene has been refusing to provide benefits that it is supposed to be providing. It\u0027s an insurance company that likes to collect premiums but doesn\u0027t like to pay claims.\u0027 A Centene spokesman said: \u0027Our networks are adequate and we work in partnership with our states to ensure our networks are adequate and our members have access to high-quality healthcare.\u0027Centene refused to discuss with the Mail its plans for the UK or the row over The Practice Group\u0027s decision to close a surgery.With that background, what is to be made of the recent actions of TPG, its subsidiary in the UK? The closure of its Harlow practice is not the first to cause controversy.It faced protests two years ago when it terminated contracts to run f ive smal l practices in Brighton, leaving 11,500 patients looking for a new GP. Again, a potential cut in funding was given as the reason.It has also closed a surgery in Camden Road, London, the Maybury surgery in Woking, the Brandon Street practice in Leicester and the Arboretum surgery in Nottingham.In Harlow, TPG gave six months\u0027 notice on October 31 last year to the Clinical Commissioning Group that it wanted to end its contract to run Osler House. In an explanatory letter to the local MP, the CCG stated: \u0027The reason for the notice is that the provider has stated that it is not financially viable to continue to provide the services within the current NHS contract value.\u0027 It added that the practice had been consistently expensive to run due to the low number of patients and that a recent review had seen the funding cut. Half of that reduction came into place on April 1, 2017, and the other 50pc was to take effect on April 1, 2018.           A spokesman for West Essex CCG said Osler House patients were now registered with one of ten other surgeries in Harlow, three of which are within 1.2 miles (stock image)Eighteen months ago, The Practice Group had assured the CCG that the company were committed to continuing delivery of the contract after April 2018. Presumably, at some point, TPG decided the figures did not add up. Questions are now being asked about the CCG\u0027s failure to consult and its role in the closure. \u0027CCGs should have a duty to properly consult with local residents before making major changes to the services they receive,\u0027 says local MP Mr Halfon.A spokesman for West Essex CCG said Osler House patients were now registered with one of ten other surgeries in Harlow, three of which are within 1.2 miles.TPG has said: \u0027The well-being of patients is central to every decision we make at The Practice Group, which is why we have worked closely with the local NHS commissioning body, West Essex CCG and other local practices to ensure the handful of patients we have receive uninterrupted care provision.\u0027Most importantly, the Osler House patients are now registered with other local surgeries.\u0027 For hundreds of former patients of a much-loved practice, that is simply not good enough."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/10/22/4C114DDD00000578-0-image-a-19_1525989465294.jpg","title":"Queens official composer snubbed Meghan Markle opts gospel group","story":"    Judith Weir (pictured), who is the first woman to be Master of the Queen’s Music, tells me she has not been invited to contribute to the big day\u0027I\u0027m not so well now\u0027: Alzheimer\u0027s-hit Barbara Windsor has...Fugitive who \u0027killed and butchered convicted paedophile then...Share this articleTwo works by her predecessor, Sir Peter Maxwell Davies, were performed at Prince William and Kate Middleton’s wedding in 2011.The Queen’s wedding in 1947 started with a specially composed fanfare by Sir Arnold Bax, who was then Master of the King’s Music.

Prince Albert shows Kotb one of the irreplaceable personal touches that somehow remained throughout the residence, like the linen closet floor on the second floor          The linen closet door survived with etchings of the Kelly children\u0027s heights clearly visible, from two years old to their late teens          Though he was thankful the memories were preserved unscathed, Prince Albert couldn\u0027t really offer much of an explanation for the still-standing treasure          \u0027Maybe they thought we were going to take it back one day,\u0027 he said, suggesting previous owners might have realized its importance to the history of the familyThough he was thankful the memories were preserved unscathed, Prince Albert couldn\u0027t really offer much of an explanation for the still-standing treasure.\u0027Maybe they thought we were going to take it back one day,\u0027 he said, suggesting previous owners might have realized its importance to the history of the family. That is a sweet thought, but it\u0027s not likely all of the previous owners had such charming intentions in the back of their minds.The property made headlines in 2014 when its 81-year-old former owner pleaded no contest to animal cruelty charges for keeping cats and dogs in unsanitary conditions on the property.Officials with the Pennsylvania Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals seized 15 cats from the home and found the remains of several others.The owner had lived in the large brick house since 1973.

She now speaks fluent Swahili, because she was determined to converse with her children in their native tongue.Claire’s own mother couldn’t be more proud of how her daughter has chosen to do things — although she has baulked at some of the challenges she has faced.Take the first time Helen, now 63, flew over to visit in 2012 — just a day or so after grandchild number three, Bella, arrived.When Claire was sent from the orphanage to pick up Bella at a neighbouring village, the word was that this abandoned little bundle of skin and bones, weighing just 10lb, was a few months old. In fact, she turned out to be two years old.Helen remembers Claire patiently tending to the little girl’s tiny fingernails and toenails, but not in the usual way.          First there was Alfie, then 13 months old, a little boy she coaxed to smile, and went on to foster and adopt. Alfie is now ten. His siblings, Layla and Isabella, are eight, and little Jack is five‘I remember sitting watching Claire picking maggots virtually out of every pore. It brought home the conditions these children had been brought up in.’There are other colourful memories, such as that time she put bread in the toaster and ‘all the creepy-crawlies came out’. And Nanny — as Helen is known by the children — hasn’t quite recovered from the fact Claire was perfectly happy sharing the kitchen with a lizard.‘It was on the wall,’ she complains. ‘I had a problem with that. But nothing fazes Claire.’Those exotic anecdotes may be numbered, though. Although it was never Claire’s plan to return to the UK with her children, changing circumstances have forced a rethink, and she is trying to get home — new family in tow.Her own mother could not be happier, and the Skype conversations are all about the move. Alfie is desperate to see snow. And they all want to visit Buckingham Palace, and see a red London bus in real life instead of in the books Nanny sends.There is a problem, though. While love is clearly in abundance in this family, money is not. The political climate in Tanzania (meaning Westerners aren’t finding it as easy to get work) means Claire isn’t working — and is finding it difficult to support her family.While her parents have always helped her out, they aren’t in a position to do so now. Helen works in the catering industry and lives modestly in a one-bedroom home. Claire’s dad, Derek, from whom Helen was amicably orced, died earlier this year.So how can Claire fund the expensive return to the UK? Well, she has turned to that very modern charitable source — crowdfunding, appealing to friends, family and strangers to donate. She needs to raise £34,000 to get herself and the four children back to the UK, the bulk of the money needed for flights and lawyers to assist with the visa applications.

They are pictured here in 2017          Although they have no blood ties, the emotional bonds are as strong as they get. ‘They are typical siblings,’ Claire laughs at their spacious, if slightly chaotic, family home just outside Arusha, in north-eastern TanzaniaYet as much as her own family supports her, not everyone does. News reports about her appeal this week were met with a decidedly mixed reaction.While some applauded Claire’s ‘mission’, others have questioned the idea that she should be financially bailed out when the decision to take on the four children was hers alone.One particularly brutal online commentator called her a potential ‘Madonna on benefits’. And what will happen, some asked, if the family still struggle after they arrive in the UK? Will the taxpayer have to foot the bill?‘The whole point is to get them over here so Claire can work,’ Helen says. ‘She has no intention of being on benefits.‘And if I can say one thing about her is that she is a hard worker. She has never been work-shy — quite the opposite, in fact. She came home when her dad was ill, to be with him when he died, and even in those few weeks she got a job here.’Claire herself is appalled at the suggestion she is trying to milk the system. ‘There is no way I want to be on benefits. It’s not who I am. My parents instilled the idea of hard work in me, and I want to do the same with my children. It’s exactly why I want to come home so they can see me work.’It’s a dilemma Madonna and Angelina Jolie and those high-profile advocates of foreign adoption simply do not face. Deep pockets can smooth all manner of problems.          While her parents have always helped her out, they aren’t in a position to do so now. Helen works in the catering industry and lives modestly in a one-bedroom home. Claire’s dad, Derek, from whom Helen was amicably orced, died earlier this yearClaire will have to rely on family to help with childcare while she works and her plight does raise genuine questions about whether the heart should rule the head even in these emotive matters.Should we applaud Claire’s selflessness in putting these children above all else, or question her naivety in thinking she could do it alone?The family’s answer, of course, is that she is not alone. They are clearly close, and have been through a good deal together. The Claire they waved off to Tanzania at 19 certainly hadn’t had a sheltered life.Claire’s elder brother, Adam, was killed in an accident when he was 12, when a rope became tangled round his neck while he was playing. Understandably, Helen and Derek were highly protective of Claire. ‘But you can’t wrap them in cotton wool,’ she argues. ‘And we tried so hard to bring Claire up to be as independent as possible.‘We were worried when she wanted to go to Tanzania, but we knew how she felt about wanting to work with children,’ Helen says. ‘We heard all about Alfie, who seemed special to her. But I had no idea she was talking about my future grandson!’.Claire has cared for more than 200 children since she arrived in Tanzania in 2009, but Alfie touched her heart most. An orphan, Alfie, then 13 months old, was perhaps not in as pitiful a state physically as some of the other children (‘we couldn’t save some of the babies who were so malnourished when they came in’) but his behaviour upset her.‘He was very withdrawn and bewildered. Toddlers in the orphanage were always more aware than the little babies, and Alfie just wouldn’t smile. I was drawn to him. You try not to favour one child, but because I was trying so hard to get through to him, it was hard. I got to the stage where I coaxed a smile out of him, and a bond developed. He’d look for me if I left the room.’          Five months after Alfie moved in, baby Layla followed. Then came Bella, then JackThat first stint in Tanzania was a short one and Claire returned to the UK to work as a nanny.She felt compelled to go back, however, but when she did she discovered Alfie had been moved to a different orphanage 15km away. She went to visit him. ‘I’m sure he recognised me even at the start,’ she says. ‘But by the end of that visit he was in tears. They had to prise him off me.’Distraught, she wondered if she could somehow sponsor Alfie. But her inquiries led to her asking if she could foster the little boy, and in 2011 she became his sole carer. ‘I still wasn’t thinking adoption,’ she says. ‘At the start, that never occurred to me. And he wasn’t the only one I fostered. I’d often have the sickest babies overnight, or for longer periods. But Alfie stayed.’Five months after Alfie moved in, baby Layla followed. Then came Bella, then Jack. ‘It was a natural progression,’ Claire says.‘It felt right. I’ve always felt that however good an orphanage is, children thrive best in a home situation.’ It was 2016 before the legal process to adopt all four children was completed, but Claire says they felt like ‘hers’ practically from the moment they arrived.Did she ever sit her parents down and tell them about her adoption plans? ‘No,’ she says. ‘But it wasn’t like it was one big decision. It was a series of little ones. And they were always right behind me. They came out and met the children. My dad doted on them. He couldn’t have helped more, and he was really proud of what I was doing.’          \u0027The plan was never to return to the UK, though. ‘I thought our lives would always be in Tanzania,’ Claire saysThe plan was never to return to the UK, though. ‘I thought our lives would always be in Tanzania,’ Claire says.Outwardly, they must seem well off compared to the locals. Like many in the expat community, they have a security guard patrolling their home (‘It’s essential,’ says Claire), and a woman who is employed as a cleaner, cook and babysitter. Whenever Claire was working at the orphanage or, latterly, when she has returned to the UK for visits, this lady has looked after the children.But the lifestyle is no longer tenable. The children have been educated at an international school — so they would be fluent in English — and the fees were not affordable some time ago, ‘but luckily when I explained this the school agreed to let the children stay on anyway’.Hence the idea of moving back. Losing her father has just reinforced the idea that Claire needs to be at home.‘It was such a shock,’ she said. ‘Dad was the fittest person I know. He was never ill. But he collapsed one day, and he was dead seven weeks later. I made it home to see him before he died, but it has been devastating. It’s made me realise I want the children to grow up with their extended family. The expat community is a transient one. At home, we will have support.’But the costs involved are eye-watering. And there are other problems, too. It’s by no means a given that the British authorities will extend the sort of warm welcome the family want, and the state of Claire’s bank account will be a major deciding factor.

Nor, even, is it a talent for getting out of a low-slung limousine in a low-cut evening gown while maintaining the highest standards of modesty.Least of all is it a gift for attracting huge crowds of adoring new fans (or acres of drooling newsprint).Instead, the one key skill Meghan absolutely must perfect is how to avoid being seen as any kind of a destabilising force.In the whispering labyrinth of the court, unexpected surprises, even nice ones, can be misinterpreted as threats. Anything new or unknown, until it is proven to be harmless, will therefore be treated with suspicion — even hostility. When you\u0027re in the dynasty business, everything is subjected to the ultimate test: will this personthingideadevelopment help or hinder the survival of the current royal line?          The public\u0027s impression of Diana as a gutsy woman doing her best to help those in need was  essentially accurate. Pictured: Princess Diana and Patrick Jephson in Hungary in 1990It\u0027s a useful guideline when weighing the pros and cons of any intended course of action, from saving a local playgroup, to saving an endangered species, to saving the planet. What always comes first is saving the monarchy.Why? Because the Windsors know that all the grand trappings of royalty are held in trust for the British people and that the monarchy depends for its survival on a very volatile commodity: the benign approval — or, at the very least, tolerance — of its subjects.They also know that everything they hold dear could be lost through miscalculation. After all, in recent family history, their European counterparts have lost their thrones despite reigning for generations with every appearance of indestructibility.The guillotine may never be erected in Trafalgar Square, but a fickle public mood multiplied by merciless digital media has the capacity to decapitate an unpopular royal family — or family member — as surely as any blade.Postponing that day is the unwritten first duty of those in the British royal dynasty business.So, Meghan\u0027s prime function will be to support the Crown, avoid bringing it into disrepute and act as a non-political focus of national unity. Everything else — even developing a globally acclaimed portfolio of irreproachably good causes — is superfluous. The bottom line is that, as a princess, she has no remit to save the world or anything in it. Or preach at us, admonish us or signal any fashionable virtue.Her job is to exist, preferably without rocking the constitutional boat. And if, in the process, by the way she conducts her own life, she gently inspires us to do more and better with our own, then she\u0027ll probably be treated with respect and remembered with affection far into the future.DON\u0027T FORGET ABOUT THE CHAPSNobody could doubt Meghan\u0027s sincerity when she said: \u0027Right now, with so many campaigns like #MeToo and #TimesUp, there\u0027s no better time to continue to shine a light on women feeling empowered and people supporting them.\u0027However, the perspective that draws such warm applause at Californian awards ceremonies may need adjusting in a nation with a female prime minister and female head of state.Indeed, Meghan\u0027s advisers may also feel uneasy about an attitude that so readily excludes half the population. She might also like to bear in mind that quite a few members of the Royal Family are men and that not all of them have always managed to achieve #MeToo-approved standards of what is considered to be correct male behaviour.          One key skill Meghan absolutely must perfect is how to avoid being seen as any kind of a destabilising forceBEWARE THE REST OF THE FAMILYIt\u0027s been several centuries since any of Harry\u0027s forebears cut off the head of a wife who displeased him. But Meghan should be in no doubt about the House of Windsor\u0027s ability and willingness to exercise some very modern tortures on errant newcomers.Among these must be counted the clumsy efforts of some misguided Charles loyalists to smear Diana not just as sad and mad, but bad as well. As the Diana tragedy confirmed, when dealing with perceived threats, Windsors can be quite uncompromising.If you acquire for yourself a profile, a purpose and a passionate public devotion independent of the royal mainstream, then you risk being perceived and presented as a threat to the Crown itself.This will mobilise the full forces of the Establishment against you.And it won\u0027t feel constrained by any fluffy notions of old-fashioned British fair play.Whatever fairytale image Meghan may have once had of palace life, the reality is as old as time: behind the public image, courts are breeding grounds of intrigue, ambition, gossip and jealousy.DON\u0027T LET IT ALL GO TO YOUR HEADOne evening, I accompanied Diana to a glittering New York ceremony at which she was given the Humanitarian of the Year award. This was an honour she\u0027d tried to resist, partly on the grounds that her job meant she should be giving out awards, not receiving them.Afterwards, over a glass of champagne, I told her: \u0027I think you were right to accept this one. You\u0027ve certainly earned it.\u0027She briefly raised her eyebrows, then turned to look at the night-time Manhattan skyline.\u0027No, Patrick, I don\u0027t deserve this,\u0027 she said. Then she raised her glass. \u0027But I am working on it.\u0027That phrase summed up her vision of herself. And it wasn\u0027t a bad poster image for a very successful brand of royalty: modesty and determination.The danger of Meghan forming a false sense of her own worth is very real.    Everything apart from serving the crown - even developing a globally acclaimed portfolio of irreproachably good causes - is superfluousBE TRUE TO YOURSELFA large part of royal interaction — and especially the bit of it we see in public — is a kind of act. When I was at the palace, we used to joke that nine-tenths of being royal was turning up at the right place at the right time in the right clothes with the right speech in your pocket and the right expression on your face.However, Meghan should beware. Any suspicion that your public persona is not an honest reflection of your real personality will become obvious, sooner or later.It\u0027s also wise to remember that hardly anyone, not even a trained actress, can keep up an act for ever. So Meghan may as well decide that the part of her she allows us to see is one that is both real and reliably predictable. Take Princess Diana. The public\u0027s impression of Diana as a gutsy woman doing her best to help those in need — while raising two sons and fulfilling exaggerated expectations as a royal role model — was, as I saw for myself, essentially accurate.People liked what they saw, believed it to be authentic and wanted more of it.ONE THING YOU SHOULD NEVER DOIn a lifetime of royal service, Meghan cannot expect always to please. She should think long and carefully, however, before reaching for the race card as a response to unfavourable news stories.Her erse ancestry is a positive asset for the House of Windsor, as its members and supporters are well aware. But it would be tragic if Meghan or her husband got into the habit of firing ethnic warning shots at the very same media that will reliably trumpet all their good work for years to come.STEER CLEAR OF POLITICSMeghan should make an early vow to avoid all activity or communication that might be interpreted as a comment on politics or public policy. Her reputation won\u0027t survive theatrical interventions in areas that rightly belong to elected politicians.So her widely advertised support for Democratic politics in the U.S. is a piece of personal baggage that must now be jettisoned. The sacred royal duty of political neutrality doesn\u0027t end at the shores of the kingdom.          Top priority for a royal apprentice is to know the distinction between celebrity and royaltySEEK OUT THE BEST ADVICEThe Royals can choose from a limitless smorgasbord of advice — good, bad and downright dangerous. Ultimately, it\u0027s where Meghan chooses to turn for it that will determine much of her success or failure as a princess.Diana didn\u0027t always choose her advisers wisely. By the time she gave a self-sabotaging interview to the BBC\u0027s Panorama, she had an increasing tendency to seek advice from those who saw her as a useful vehicle for their own agendas.Sadly, they encouraged her to portray herself as a victim, rather than as the strong, influential woman I knew her to be.NEVER COMPLAIN, NEVER EXPAINThe Queen has demonstrated over the course of a lifetime that modern monarchy works best when it sticks to the old rule: \u0027Never complain, never explain.\u0027Prince Charles favours a different tactic, drawing criticism for what has been seen as an unwise amount of complaining and an un-royal amount of explaining.Even Harry\u0027s mother was rather too fond of both — although, in Diana\u0027s defence, she may have learned it from her husband.The public doesn\u0027t always respond well to complaints from those who have virtually unlimited resources and plenty of privacy. LEAVE YOUR SHOWBIZ DAYS BEHIND YOUTop priority for a royal apprentice is to know the distinction between celebrity and royalty.Meghan may find that she can\u0027t go to her local shop on Kensington High Street without causing a minor riot. With that kind of profile, it\u0027s all too easy to think your very existence is cause for celebration.For Meghan, who has devoted so much energy to acquiring celebrity, the task of distinguishing between fame she\u0027s earned and fame she has acquired through Harry may be particularly hard. So, if she hasn\u0027t worked it out yet, now is the time to get it clear in her own mind.Get it wrong and she may never be forgiven.Meghan is particularly vulnerable in this respect because there\u0027ll always be sceptics ready to question whether her marriage is a love story or just part of a long-running fame campaign. Although many of the perks of royalty and celebrity are identical, the defining difference is that celebrity lifestyles are won, while royal privileges are granted.They exist in return for a life devoted to service, with lots of visible, unenviable duty and the appearance of sacrifice.Meghan may have already worked out that huge public warmth is directed at Harry and would be shared by anyone he chose to marry.So, even more than most royal newcomers, she\u0027ll be judged by her success as the never-failing source to her husband of strength, comfort, encouragement and wisdom.If Meghan allows doubt to grow that she is anything less than devoted to her man, his family and her obligations to her adopted country, then she may not have the luxury of any second chances.          \u0027Patrick, we\u0027ll do animal charities when we run out of people charities,\u0027 Diana would say when requests came in for her to be pictured with cuddly animalsKEEP OPINIONS TO YOURSELFBeing royal means that you will automatically always be heard, even when you just whisper.It\u0027s a magical power, given to very few and earned by even fewer.Unlike a struggling actress, a princess will be listened to respectfully and in silence, bar a few polite laughs at the right moments.This readily given approval can all too easily give the speaker an inflated and dangerously misleading perception of her own oratory and intellect.The Royal Family usually does best when it follows the example of the Queen.Despite having a powerful platform on which to share her views, insights, big ideas, wishes and prejudices, Her Majesty has resolutely kept her opinions to herself. AVOID CUDDLY ANIMALSCentral to Diana\u0027s success as a humanitarian was her instinct for what made best use of both her status and her compassion.She focused on causes that resonate in the public mind.Her sons have developed their own distinctive and admirable style. But one area where they\u0027ve taken a very different tack is in their promotion of conservation, especially in Africa.\u0027Patrick, we\u0027ll do animal charities when we run out of people charities,\u0027 Diana would say when requests came in for her to be pictured with cuddly animals.The most eloquent speech on the evils of the ivory trade will still do little to boost Meghan\u0027s profile.AND FINALLY...REAP THE REWARDSThe best news for Meghan, for Harry and for an expectant British public is that if she gets it right, the reward will be the secure evolution of the great institution that has welcomed her — and two lives made complete by their service to humanity.  Adapted from The Meghan Factor by Patrick Jephson, published by Bombardier Books, priced £11.22 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/12/00/4C1E329A00000578-0-image-a-24_1526079816392.jpg","title":"Terrified tourists run cover Disney parade","story":"    Video of the incident shows the head of the animatronic beast completely engulfed in fire, moving towards the crowd as black smoke billows to the sky          The attraction is Maleficent\u0027s dragon and part of the Magic Kingdom\u0027s daily Festival of Fantasy parade located in Liberty SquareMaleficent, the self-proclaimed \u0027Mistress of All Evil,\u0027 is a \u0027dark fairy\u0027 who first made her appearance in the Disney animated classic \u0027Sleeping Beauty\u0027 released in 1959.The fire was extinguished by a park employee and the area was cleared for tourists shortly thereafter.

Cliche has long since reduced much of what occurred to “student revolt”, but that hardly does these happenings justice, partly because it ignores the workers’ strikes that were just as central to what occurred during ’68 and the years that followed, but also because the phrase gets nowhere near the depth and breadth of what young people were rebelling against, not least in France.This was the last time that a developed western society glimpsed the possibility of revolution focused not just on institutions, but the contestation of everyday reality, which is still enough to make the simple phrase “May 1968” crackle with excitement – even if you were not around when les évenéments took place. I was born in 1969, but what happened in France and beyond retains a magnetic allure.To mark 1968’s 50th anniversary, Christian Dior and Gucci have respectively launched a celebratory collection and ’68-themed ad campaign, proof if any were needed that the year’s legacy has been commodified in a way that plenty of its agitators and thinkers would have seen coming. But there are also more cerebral commemorations: a series of events, focused on liberties and utopias, at Nanterre University, the suburban campus where the French unrest first flared up and at King’s College in London, workshops, film screenings and symposiums on ’68’s protests and what they have come to signify.The leftwing publishers Verso are reissuing a handful of texts, including Tariq Ali’s memoir-cum-history Street Fighting Years and the Raymond Williams-edited May Day Manifesto (1968), arguably the founding text of the British New Left. The same company is also publishing a new book titled Opening the Gates, the compelling story of an attempt at co-operative socialism that took root in the early 1970s at a watch factory in eastern France. Allen Lane, meanwhile, has published The Long ’68, by British historian Richard Vinen, an exhaustive work whose narrative runs across Europe and the US. By a neat historical coincidence, these commemorations happen just as France experiences one of its characteristic spasms of ision and protest. Railway workers are in the midst of three months of rolling strikes, against President Macron’s plans to introduce his country’s transport system to competition and new labour arrangements. At the same time, students are protesting against plans to make university entrance more selective, and proposed changes to the baccalaureate exam system.Thirty years ago, the 20th anniversary of 1968 was the focus of a fortnight-long season on Channel 4, which included a Jean-Luc Godard movie, the three-hour film of 1969’s Woodstock festival and a smattering of documentaries. This was some people’s introduction to a huge historical moment that had rather been forgotten. The members of a Mancunian rock group called the Stone Roses were captivated by footage of one young Parisian, as guitarist John Squire recalled, “chucking stones, with a really nice jacket and desert boots”. They wrote a hymn of cross-generational admiration titled “Bye Bye Badman”, which took its place on an album whose sleeve featured the French tricolour and three slices of lemon – a reference to the fact that the latter had been used in Paris to nullify the effects of tear gas. Meanwhile, others, like me, programmed their VHS recorders for the wee hours and amassed their own ’68 archive.If your mind was ever open to that year’s mixture of subversion and confrontation, it will probably have stuck with you. Most of the time, mundane reality wins out, but from time to time, an explosive critique of modernity bursts through and demands action, even if it just as quickly recedes. This, perhaps, is the essential story of 1968 and its enduring legacy.The book is objective and factual: his sources include police reports and dispatches filed from Paris by British diplomats, but his text still conveys a sense of events so convulsive and all-encompassing that they exude a deeply romantic sense of ordinary reality somehow being suspended. As Vinen recounts, an initial confrontation between students and the authorities at the Nanterre campus – partly over restrictions on male-female living arrangements – spread to the Latin Quarter, and by some process of cause and effect almost impossible to explain, led in turn to a general strike that soon involved 10 million people. “It looked likely that De Gaulle, who had ruled France for 10 years, would fall,” he writes. But this was only the start:“For a couple of weeks, the country seemed to hover on the edge of some kind of revolution – though no one really knew what kind. The leaders of the Communist party, which had been talking about revolution for 50 years, were mystified by, and usually hostile to, the student protest. All sorts of groups were touched by the apocalyptic mood.“There were working-class protests all over the world, but this huge concentration of a general strike in May ’68 was specific to France,” he says. Herein lies an element of the story that the foregrounding of students has sidelined: a restive mood among industrial workers, which he partly puts down to the fact that large swathes of France only began to industrialise after the second world war. “You had a group of workers who’d come into industrial work relatively recently and had never accepted its disciplines and structures, or the disciplines of their trade unions,” he explains. “The other country where that was true was Italy.”The Italian “Hot Autumn” of 1969 was fictionalised in We Want Everything, a 1971 novel by the Italian author Nanni Balestrini, only published in English in 2014. Telling the story of a discontented worker at Fiat’s vast Mirafiori factory in Turin, it captures the mood in Italy during the “Cassa del Mezzogiorno”, the postwar attempt by the Italian government to bring industry to the deprived south of the country.The failure of that effort fed into a revolt against something much more fundamental: work itself, and a regimented, bureaucratic vision of life pushed by both the left and right. Towards the end of the book, there is a speech:The sense of a malaise unanswered by politics defined the spirit of ’68 across the world. As workers and students saw it, communism – whether in central and eastern Europe, or the communist parties in the west – was as much of a blight as capitalism, something vividly illustrated by that year’s so-called Prague spring, and the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia. More generally, the traditional leftist idea that the state could be the bringer of liberation was dramatically undermined by a widespread conviction that traditional power structures were so problematic as to be almost useless. This latter idea runs through 1968 in the form of a vivid leitmotif: ranks of police – in Paris, London, Chicago – charging at crowds of young protesters.Among the best films about 1968 and its meaning is A Grin Without a Cat, by the French director Chris Marker, and one of its most compelling moments comes during a sequence dedicated to the unrest in Paris. “All of a sudden, the state reveals its repressive side, the one which is more or less diluted in daily life,” says the narrator. “But now, it has to make a show of strength. And to do so, it sends in the police force, with all kinds of gear and contraptions you didn’t know existed. Fine: for the demonstrator, the state appears as a vision, like the Virgin Mary at Fatima. It’s a revelation.”Power, and the eternal human tendency to try to negate it: such has been the story of wildly erse revolts, from the first stirrings of punk rock to the Occupy movement. The latter was criticised for its lack of specific demands, but this missed the point. “What we have in the United States is an oligarchy and what we need is a people’s democracy,” said one protester at Occupy Wall Street. “So we’re occupying this country. We start out at Wall Street, then we spread out and occupy the country and take it back.” Perhaps unwittingly, he was following a famous edict that had been daubed on to a Parisian wall in 1968: “Be reasonable – demand the impossible.”Hari’s Kunzru’s 2007 novel My Revolutions centres on a character, Chris Carver, who is changed forever by the events of 1968. He takes part in sit-ins at the LSE, the famous anti-Vietnam demonstration outside the US embassy in Grosvenor Square, and then becomes one of the core members of a group who move from direct action to terrorism.There are echoes here of the German Red Army Faction, otherwise known as the Baader-Meinhof gang, but the basis of the story is the Angry Brigade, the London-based group who cut their teeth in the midst of 1968’s tumult. From the summer of 1970 onwards, against a background of rising industrial strife, the Angry Brigade launched a series of bomb attacks whose targets included the embassies of far‑right regimes, the home secretary’s house and the Miss World competition. (In 2002, a journalist from the Observer interviewed the former Angry Brigade member Hilary Creek, who briskly captured the contexts of what she had been involved in: “Basically, I’m not ashamed of anything I have done, going from the student protests at Essex to the organisation for the Vietnam war demonstrations, squatting and the early women’s movement. Some of the things we did I am proud of and we still see the effects now.”)Kunzru is a perfect example of someone who came of age long after ’68, but was dazzled from a distance. “Thatcher got into power when I was nine and the Tories left when I was 27,” he says. “So the idea of living your young life at a time when you believed that everything was about to change and you were on the brink of remaking the world was almost unimaginably distant.” There was also, he felt, a job to be done writing about ’68 and its aftershocks in terms of moral and political complexity, because “there was so little written about what happened back then that wasn’t in the service of mythmaking”.“I was writing in the early years of the war on terror,” he explains. “The question of radicalisation was on everyone’s minds. I wanted to write a book about how you go about deciding to use violence in support of your political beliefs.”The main characters in My Revolutions shape their view of the world into an exacting, almost neurotically judgmental sensibility, which captures how much the thinking of some ’68 activists marked a clean break with the live-and-let-live mores of the hippies. In one passage, Carver and a character called Anna go to a chi-chi party in north London. She says:“Look at these people. Look at them, Chris. They’re blind. They’re happy to ignore everything around them, just pleased to be having a good time. And, as far as I’m concerned, that makes them culpable. It makes them complicit in everything they’re ignoring. Vietnam, the lot. It makes them pigs.”The scene is redolent of another Parisian graffito: “To call in question the society you live in, you must first be capable of calling yourself in question.” Later in the book, Kunzru’s characters act this demand out with the aid of LSD:Anna told Leo she didn’t really think he believed in building the revolution and Leo defended himself and made a counter-accusation and gradually we were all drawn in, putting one another to the question, everyone an inquisitor. Kunzru says this scene drew on the kind of ritualised self-criticism practised by Maoists, and by the American violent protest group the Weather Underground (or “Weathermen”), whose activities decisively began in October 1969 and lasted well into the 1970s. But the scene makes a wider point about one of the plotlines of the years after ’68: the way that revolutionary zeal tends to burn out, and the fact that radical left politics has an tendency to sooner or later turn inwards.Even during ’68 itself, the revolt quickly dissipated, symbolised by De Gaulle’s landslide win in legislative elections, and by the arrival in the White House of Richard Nixon in the following year. So what of ’68’s essential spirit endures? “In the long term,” says Vinen, “it helped create a new kind of left. Partly a less economic left in some ways, a less working-class left. I think in Britain, there are a lot of ways that ’68 fed through into a leftwing Labour party in the 1980s, but also a lot of ways in which the left was rethought, some of which ended up in New Labour. In all countries, there’s a sense that it ties in with a left that involves new kinds of issues: things which may not be very important in ’68 itself, but became important – feminism, gay rights, environmentalism. That’s one part of its legacy.”Another small but vital literary and political legacy centred on two immensely powerful books. Although it was first published in 1967, Guy Debord’s The Society of the Spectacle became the key text that conveyed the profound critique of modernity that motivated some of ’68’s most imaginative rebels. In the age of Facebook, fake news and the sense that our online lives have taken precedence over real existence, it has an amazingly prophetic aspect, evident in its opening sentences: “The whole life of those societies in which modern conditions of production prevail presents itself as an immense accumulation of spectacles. All that once was directly lived has become mere representation.”Its companion piece is The Revolution of Everyday Life, written by Raoul Vaneigem, a forceful voice in Debord’s organisation the Situationist International. Among this text’s insights is an attack on the supposed importance of work that chimes with a 21st-century conversation sparked by automation: “In an industrial society which confuses work and productivity,” Vaneigem wrote, “the necessity of producing has always been an enemy of the desire to create.”The ideology captured in these books has long been a kind of ghost within western culture and politics, periodically making itself known at moments of crisis and contestation. In late 2011, the writer and activist Paul Mason watched this happen in the wake of student protests at the Conservative party’s London HQ, when what he called a “makeshift anarchism” was afoot, and plans were forming for a new action. “The posters proclaiming this new demonstration … had begun to borrow the imagery of Paris ’68,” he wrote, in Why It’s Kicking off Everywhere. “But since Marx is out of fashion, and Lenin and Mao have been branded left fascists, who else is there to study but the Frenchman whose musings have become required reading in the era of Lady Gaga: Guy Debord?” When people who had come of political age around this time were drawn into a new Labour party by Jeremy Corbyn, their links to the politics of 40 years before quickly became clear. These newcomers have cohered into an imaginative, questioning tendency whose gatherings, which grew out of Momentum and take place alongside the Labour party conference each year, go under the very ’68ish title The World Transformed.Clearly, then, even at 50 years’ distance, the ideas at the heart of 1968’s events live on. “Their brave utopianism and their willingness to think outside the terms they were given – that’s an intellectual legacy we can still draw on,” says Kunzru. “The way the language of capital has robbed us of our dignity as citizens is something we can fight with the intellectual tools they gave us.” His point brings to mind yet another Parisian graffito, arguably even more relevant to our time than it was to the era when it was written: “Are you a consumer or a participant?” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d637280414c132b76dbb0fc8a8d0d4547b9633c6/0_646_2560_1535/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4ab84de5b7e2a9b47ef965c3f64b95ad","title":"britains richest hedge fund manager mike platt sunday times rich list","story":"Tory donor and art collector Mike Platt has boosted his fortune by £600m in a yearMike Platt, a Preston-born financier who started investing at the age of 14 with a £500 gift from his grandmother, has been named Britain’s richest hedge fund manager with a £3bn fortune.Platt, 49, the co-founder and chief executive of Belgravia-based BlueCrest capital management, has increased his wealth by £600m over the past year to retain his crown as the richest hedge fund manager, according to the Sunday Times Rich List. Platt, who claims to have never suffered an annual loss, spends a lot of his wealth on art, which he displays in the crypt of a deconsecrated church in Marylebone. The collection includes a black Christ in an electric chair beside skulls, stags’ heads, 5bn-year-old meteorites, a Japanese woman riding a walrus and the levitation of St John the Baptist. There are pieces by the taxidermist Polly Morgan, the Turner prize-winner Keith Tyson and Reece Jones.A Tory party donor, Platt also owns a Bombardier Challenger private jet and homes in London, Switzerland and the US. His first investments, funded by his grandmother, were in Britain’s privatised utilities. The second richest UK hedge fund manager is Robert Miller and his daughter, Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece, who increased their wealth by £420m to £2bn. Miller, the co-founder of the Duty Free Shoppers (DFS) chain, invests his family fortune via the Hong Kong-based hedge fund Search Investment Group. Sir Michael Hintze, who runs CQS, is ranked third with a £1.4bn fortune. Hintze, who gave £1.5m to the Conservative party in 2014, increased his wealth by £100m. However, the personal wealth of David Harding, another philanthropic hedge fund manager, fell by £300m to £1bn after profits at his fund Winton Capital halved to £107.3m. The top 20 UK hedge fund managers are collectively worth more than £16bn.Robert Watts, compiler of the Sunday Times Rich List, which is published this weekend, said: “The recent volatility of global stock markets have provided opportunities for the City’s richest hedgies to gild their wealth. “But life as a billionaire hedge fund manager is not a one-way bet. Four big names of the hedge fund world have seen big falls in their wealth over the past year. Managers tend to invest heavily in their funds, so if their fund bombs so does their own wealth.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75cada7028d43d7a0e42ca0cb47a6376a82216c4/0_180_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=90556ab0b61c8db6ff4ef5710e1763e1","title":"after metoo disinviting monica lewinsky is old fashioned misogyny","story":"Town \u0026amp Country magazine’s withdrawal of an invitation after Bill Clinton accepted was plain rude – and bad party-planningHow would you feel if you were invited to a party and then told not to come because someone you had a relationship with decades ago was going to be attending? A quarter century is long enough for most of us to be civil in those circumstances. But the event planners at Town \u0026amp Country magazine seemingly didn’t have faith that Monica Lewinsky would be capable of acting like a mature adult in that situation. They disinvited her from an event this week after they found out that Bill Clinton was also planning to attend.The party hosts were also not smart enough to remember that it’s a long time since Lewinsky has been silent in the face of insults. On Wednesday, she wrote on Twitter: “Dear world: please don’t invite me to an event (esp one about social change) and – then after i’ve accepted – uninvite me because bill clinton then decided to attendwas invited. it’s 2018. emily post would def not approve.” When it comes to self-preservation, Lewinsky is a model to us all. After some difficult years following her affair with Bill Clinton, she has emerged as a crucial spokeswoman against bullying and shame. That Lewinsky did not perish under the weight of hundreds of thousands of critical, mocking cable news stories and late-night comedy gags is an achievement in itself.Lewinsky is the rare media pariah to not just survive, but to use her notoriety for good. In particular, in the post-#MeToo era, she’s cast a light on how her treatment by the media in the 1990s was a monstrous exercise in misogyny: “The wholesale dissection of a young, unknown woman – me – who, due to legal quarantine, was unable to speak out on her own behalf.” Though Lewinsky takes pains to note that her relationship with the president was consensual, it was also “a giant abuse of power”. And yet, in the context of the Town \u0026amp Country soiree, Lewinsky and not Clinton became the persona non grata. It’s as if a magazine that celebrates the rococo country homes of the rich and famous didn’t get the memo about what people think about sexual misconduct in 2018.“We apologize to Ms Lewinsky and regret the way the situation was handled,” Town \u0026amp Country said the morning after, a classic sorry-but-not-sorry approach: the passive voice, the distancing from responsibility by calling it handled. And what was the situation, in any case? Two people who had a consensual relationship two decades ago were going to be at the same party? That didn’t need “handling”, beyond perhaps a double check of the seating chart. Good manners would assume that two adults in that situation would have the capacity of ignoring each other if they happened to find themselves in the same queue for the bar. Alas, this was just a case of old-fashioned misogyny: of protecting a man from the evidence of his past extramarital misdeeds rather than respecting the humanity, and prompt RSVP, of a woman. That’s just plain rude. But it’s also plain bad party-planning. An articulate and resilient woman makes a better companion than a man who preys on his intern any night of the week."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21382daea48faee90773357bb6e8369358978745/53_156_2919_1751/master/2919.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9149c74e8e779e69466189376a11e09c","title":"why all the sniping at single women are they having too much fun","story":"From Japanese MPs to myriad press reports, unmarried females are either a ‘burden on the state’ or ‘giving up and caving in’, but actually it is society that is intent on ruining their livesAll the single ladies, all the single ladies, all the single ladies, now put your hands up! Because you ruin absolutely everything and deserve to be called out. Endlessly, and around the world. The latest example is Kanji Kato, a Japanese MP who has called single women a “burden on the state”. Annoyingly, there is a grain of truth in this, if the single women are childless, as ageing populations put pressure on national health services, including our own NHS.In the past, globally, when people tended to have more children, those children cared for their parents and other older relatives. But in many countries that trend is declining, requiring medical professionals, nurses and retirement homes to bridge the care gap. But it never seems to be the case that politicians pipe up about single, childless men, who also grow old and need care, and who, in their youth, are deified as ambitious or approved of as charming, roguish scamps. It’s women who, in the words of another Japanese politician, are the “birth-giving machines”, and any who choose not to have children, or who can’t, are deemed to be malfunctioning.But hey, single women have become used to this attitude, alongside the millennial generation, who are also responsible for everything bad or depressing. Single women are making everyone feel awkward (particularly the entire global tabloid press if that woman is Jennifer Aniston). Their need for babies is forcing the rest of us to pay for them with our taxes and provide IVF on the NHS (a move that “casts doubt on the government’s family-friendly credentials”, according to the ). Apparently, single women are also responsible for men who go on murdering sprees because they had the indecency to reject them.It’s amazing that single women have the audacity to roam about in daylight, as if they were, in fact, not single and therefore normal. A favourite series of articles of mine on this subject are titled along the lines of: Avoid the Mistakes Single Women Make, which include (really) “being shortsighted about life”, “falling down on the job of life” and “giving up and caving in” .It’s not really a new thing, viewing single women as freaks. Remember that Bridget Jones quote, when she is asked why so many women in their 30s are single? “I don’t know. I suppose it doesn’t help that underneath our clothes, our entire bodies are covered in scales.”Single women deserve a break. Especially because it’s actually society that is ruining everything for single women. There is the extortionate cost of renting alone, or forking out double the cost when you holiday solo, then having to watch couples coo at origami swan napkins while they demand you take photos of them. There is trying to pretend that other people’s babies don’t all look the same. Or, for single women who have children, having to deal with society’s raised eyebrows.A 2017 report found that single women were much happier than single men, mostly because they are not tied down with the emotional and domestic labour that comes with being a woman in a (heterosexual) relationship. It probably also has something to do with the fact that nobody can veto your Netflix choices if you’re the only one making them, and not being dragged along to a partner’s work do. Could these snide asides at single women just be the politics of envy?It’s extraordinary, really, what has happened to Arctic Monkeys. The band made their name thanks to their authenticity, and now a song on their new album, Tranquility Base Hotel \u0026amp Casino, has Alex Turner playing an ageing rock star and singing “maybe I was a little too wild in the 70s” – despite being born in 1986.Turner has told BBC’s Radio 1 that he feels embarrassed by his old lyrics, even though their second album beautifully summed up a dying relationship as, “Several hours or several weeks  I’d have the cheek to say they’re equally as bleak” while the new record, five years in the making, includes: “I can get you on the list for all the clubs” and has a song called The Ultracheese.It’s not that Arctic Monkeys are bad now – it’s just that they were so much fun then. It was exciting, for those of us who had the bootleg recordings from live gigs, to see their songs transform from the rough to the recorded version (often with name changes – When the Sun Goes Down was first named Scummy).It’s part of the joy of being a music fan watching acts (or their collaborators) evolve and innovate. And though I’m sure repeated listens of TBH\u0026ampC may unearth melodies, somewhere, at the moment it feels like the audio equivalent of an enforced David Lynch marathon and Turner’s piano practice. I mean, Britney went from … Baby One More Time and pronouncing the word baby as “babe-un” and 12 years later gave us Toxic. Kanye’s debut single took a Chaka Khan vocal and made her sound like a chipmunk, but eventually gave us Power. Some acts evolve, others change their DNA. I’m mourning then, for a band that represented all the joy of that first Jägerbomb at a house party and now sound like the drunk old guy in the corner of a pub muttering under his breath.To Carpinteria, a town 85 miles from Los Angeles, which has begun to stink of weed more than a student with low-slung pants and a This Guitar Kills Fascists sticker. Californians voted in 2016 to legalise marijuana, which is great if you love a toke. But it would be awful for people like me who gag on pretty much all of London’s pot-filled streets – Carpinteria’s air essentially sounds like one big plume of dope smoke. Still, the UN found that 44 UK cities and towns are so polluted that they are dangerous to breathe in, dope or no dope.

Schools should reflect wider society people of different faiths, backgrounds and skills working together, with those who come from lower-income families being given a real chance to improve their lives.”The plans announced by Hinds would provide £50m a year to existing grammar schools to expand, either by providing more places or by building new annexes or satellite campuses, potentially in different towns.The opening of new grammar schools is barred by legislation passed under Tony Blair’s government in 1998, but the current government has said satellites of existing schools could be approved.Natalie Perera, the executive director of the Education Policy Institute, said grammar schools posed a threat to the prospects of disadvantaged children.“Our research finds that, as the number of grammar places increases, a penalty emerges for all pupils who live nearby but don’t get in and this penalty is larger for disadvantaged pupils than non-disadvantaged pupils,” Perera said. “Indeed, the gap between disadvantaged pupils and their peers is wider in wholly selective areas than in non-selective areas.”Hinds said the new funding would be tailored towards existing grammar schools that make an effort to attract and admit children from disadvantaged families and backgrounds.“To be able to expand as a selective school, you will need to come forward with a proposal of how you are going to reach out further with inidual primary schools, look again at your admissions to make sure you are as inclusive as possible, because we want more children from disadvantaged backgrounds to be able to access that education,” Hinds told the BBC.But Melissa Benn, who chairs the Comprehensive Future group, said: “Asking grammar schools to find ways to take in a few more children from poorer backgrounds will not alter the well-established fact that selection harms the educational and life chances of most disadvantaged children.”“The government has broken this promise, dropped the pledge they made to our country’s 6 million Catholics and ignored the tens of thousands of Catholics who campaigned on this issue,” said Malcolm McMahon, the Catholic archbishop of Liverpool, who called the cap unfair. Ephraim Mirvis, the chief rabbi, said the decision to allow new voluntary-aided faith schools would be “welcomed warmly by the vast majority of our community”. One group was happy with the consultation’s outcome: universities in England welcomed the removal of plans to force them to sponsor state schools.

So how can we wean ourselves off them?On the eighth-floor isolation ward of London’s University College Hospital, nurses have two lines of defence against the spread of life-threatening diseases. First are the airtight double lobbies in every room. Second – and, arguably, more importantly – are the disinfectant wipes they rely on to prevent the spread of germs and viruses.For nurse consultant Annette Jeanes, the disposable flannels are a godsend that allow her and her staff, not only to protect themselves from superbugs such as C difficile and other viruses, but also to make the most of their time, a crucial factor in the National Health Service.“It’s hard to imagine a time when the NHS didn’t use wipes,” she declares as she surveys the length of T08 ward. “Our nurses are one of our greatest resources and we don’t have enough of them. Wipes have made their lives easier and freed them up to do other things.”Similar arguments could be heard the length and breadth of the UK this week after the government announced plans to address the worst effects of wet wipes following a host of revelations about the ubiquity of the throwaway towels. While the NHS – which is by far the biggest public sector user – can make a strong case for the necessity and benefits of disposable hygiene products, the picture is very different in wider society, where wipes can be more aptly described as a consumer luxury that chokes waterways and threatens wildlife.Until now, the rise of the wet wipe has been irrepressible its history a mirror of global inequality, consumerism and short-term thinking. In the 60 years since the first was deployed, usage has surged to an estimated 450bn a year - or about 14,000 every second.Market research suggests wipes and other throwaway hygiene items are near-perfect markers of haves versus have-nots. In poor nations, usage is close to zero. But once average salaries rise to $1,500 per month, women begin to buy sanitary products. From $3,500, parents are willing to spend on disposable nappies. Once incomes hit $8,000, people splash out on wipes.Age is also a factor. Younger generations whose bottoms were cleaned as babies are more inclined than their parents and grandparents to use wipes. Busy mums are the main market. In the US, 22 million Americans used pre-moist cloths 31 times or more within a week. Between 2005 and 2015, the surface area of non-woven wipes produced in Europe almost doubled.The supplanting of cloth napkins, cleaning rags and toilet paper began 60 years ago.The first pre-moistened, scented napkin was produced in a Manhattan loft in 1958 by a former cosmetics industry employee, Arthur Julius, who later convinced Col Harland Sanders that his finger-lickin’ chicken would sell better if messy eaters could clean up with the Wet-Nap® he had trademarked. Kentucky Fried Chicken has since given away close to a billion wipes. “Enough to reach halfway to the moon,” a spokesman claimed, omitting to mention that disposal will have to be an earthly operation and not a cosmic one.This is only a tiny fraction of the total. Tweaks to the chemical and manufacturing processes have led to alcohol swabs, baby wipes, airline refreshment towels, disinfecting tissues, antibacterials, makeup removers, insect-repellent towelettes and countertop cleaners.Julius’ company – Nice-Pak is still the market leader, churning out 150bn wipes per year – almost 5,000 a second. Rival firms spin out more than that number again, but the most modern products have little in common with the original.Fibres of the paper can now be woven, spun-laced, doused in sanitising isopropyl alcohol, scented, and preserved with anti-fungal agents such as methylisothiazolinone.But the fastest-growing market in recent years is for damp, chemically-treated alternatives to toilet paper, such as adult moist tissues, toddler care products and feminine hygiene wipes. Unlike baby wipes, they are designed to be flushable. Consumers do not appear to know the difference.As well as ugly, it is expensive. Blockages cost the UK about £100m every year, according to Water UK’s director of corporate affairs, Rae Stewart: “Water companies spend billions of pounds every year improving water and sewerage services in this country, but our sewers are just not designed to handle these new wipes which clog up the system. Sewer blockages end up costing the country about £100m every year so it’s clear that something needs to change.”This has contributed to a second wave of pollution of the Thames. Following the contamination of the industrial era, London’s river is now increasingly clogged with the detritus of the consumer age.Walk along the bank near Hammersmith or Barnes at low tide and many of the exposed rocks are flecked with wet wipes discharged through nearby sewer outlets. These are now the most common item of rubbish found on the riverside, overtaking plastic bottles and cotton buds. The citizen clean-up group Thames21 recently claimed wipes are reshaping the waterbed after finding 5,000 in an area half the size of a tennis court.Although some are supposed to be biodegradable, the risks do not go away when they break down. Kirsten Downer, campaigns officer for Thames21 fears for the herons and ducks she sees pecking on the dirty clumps in case they suffer the fate of fish. The problem has also spread along waterways towards the coast. Over the past 10 years, the Great British Beach Clean – an annual event in which volunteers collect rubbish from shorelines – has recorded a fifteenfold increase in the number of wet wipes. On average last year, they found one every five or six steps.The government’s promise of tough action on these single-use plastics has yet to be matched with deeds. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said it is not planning a full ban on wet wipes, but says it will work with industry to develop plastic-free alternatives and examine which products are most at fault for sewer problems. Other countries are also taking steps. The European Union is investigating wet wipes as part of a wider study of ocean microplastics. Earlier this month, Australian authorities fined Pental $700,000 for falsely claiming its White King wipes were flushable.Industry leaders in other countries prefer to stress Britain’s exceptional circumstances, saying the problem here is one of sewers rather than products. “I see issues in the UK that we don’t have in the States, notably the presence of waste on the shoreline,” said Dave Rousse, president of the the US Association of the Nonwoven Fabrics Industry. “This suggests – with a high possibility – that sewers are opening out directly into rivers. The waste water is not being filtered.”Rather than a ban, he said the best solution was for better markings on packaging and more education of consumers so they can distinguish between more “flushable” wipes – which are made of cellulosic materials (which break up and sink) – and regular thermoplastic wipes (which bind and float). But many environmentalists and water authority officials are unimpressed by the distinction, and the higher price of the more biodegradable products puts off all but one in 10 buyers.Manufacturers are trying to develop greener products that use wood fibres and other natural materials. There are also calls for a universal ‘Bin it, don’t flush it’ logo on packaging, but the best way to ease the wipe problem is to use them less or stop completely. To help, Thames21 have issued a guide for plastic-free parenting. For the many iniduals and institutions that cannot be weaned, the best bet is to seek the most nature-friendly alternative and to discard items responsibly.At the University College Hospital, which gets through 90,000 packs of wipes each year, staff are trained to dispose carefully. Only used wipes contaminated by faeces, blood and bodily fluids and deemed to be ‘infectious waste’ are destroyed by incineration. All others are ‘macerated’ or pulped down and recycled.Specialist medical suppliers are also working on solutions without plastic. They will inevitably be more expensive, but Jeanes supports change: “I can’t see wipes disappearing from the NHS but it’s a good thing if we are questioning whether we can do things in a way that is better for the environment and reduces our own waste.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a310e813be9479ebcb7e830ee78c474f6a98d526/0_123_2096_1258/master/2096.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b36d0d4aa74b34bacb0f4627e659755d","title":"the week in wildlife in pictures","story":"A nesting stork, a rescued bobcat, and flamingos at sunset are among this week’s pick of images from the natural world"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ef21e5c47343c1e263d958a08cbc466f5b4490f/203_426_2543_1524/master/2543.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b12b4ebebe734c5169a8f49a987e5788","title":"rihannas empire empowering women and making lots of money","story":"The singer’s new lingerie brand has been met with fanfare and lengthy online queuesOnline queues and “sold out” signs greeted UK shoppers hoping to purchase items from Rihanna’s lingerie collection, Savage x Fenty, as it launched on the brand’s website on Friday morning.

Bras are available from 32A to 44DD (although established brands such as Rigby \u0026amp Peller extend a further five sizes, to a J cup), while underwear and the rest of the collection ranges from XS to 3XL. To further assert the body-positive message, the pieces are modelled by a erse group of models of all sizes and skin tones, including plus-sized Instagram star Audrey Ritchie.“Women should be wearing lingerie for their damn selves,” Rihanna told US Vogue. “I can only hope to encourage confidence and strength by showing lingerie in another light. You don’t have to stick to one personality with lingerie it’s fun to play around ... I want people to wear Savage x Fenty and think: I’m a bad bitch. I want women to own their beauty.”Savage x Fenty prices start at about £13 for underwear, rising to £89 for a corset. Shipping is available to 210 countries. By 8am, several of the pieces from the promotional campaign – including the microfibre T-shirt bra (£30.50) and the lace teddy (£61.79) – were already gone. In September 2017, when Fenty Beauty launched exclusively at Harvey Nichols in London, queues formed around the block as fans stood in line for up to three hours, while 8,500 online customers queued to shop before 8am on launch day.“While we predicted that the brand would be popular with our customers and Rihanna fans alike, we could not have predicted how quickly the products would sell out,” says Jo Osborne, concessions and beauty buying director for the department store. “Rihanna certainly has the midas touch and is a smart businesswoman amassing quite an empire.”The immediate success of Savage x Fenty is testament to Rihanna’s pulling power and business acumen. The 30-year-old, who was discovered in Barbados aged 16, has eight multiplatinum studio albums under her belt and was ranked 7th in Forbes’s list of the highest-paid women in music in 2017, with earnings of $36m (£27m) in the previous year. Her 2016 collaboration with Puma generated $1bn in sales for the sportswear brand, while Fenty Beauty, on which she partnered with LVMH-owned brand incubator Kendo, was named one of the best inventions of 2017 by Time magazine. She is a philanthropist, too: in 2012, she established the Clara Lionel Foundation, a US non-profit organisation that benefits impoverished communities across the world, for which she was named humanitarian of the year by the Harvard Foundation in 2017. She puts her success down to intuition. “I approach everything with the same mentality,” she says. “It has to be authentic, it has to be from me, my perspective. I’ve wanted to do a lingerie line for a long time, but it was important to me that it be done right. To push past the boundaries associated with lingerie and encourage women to embrace their uniqueness. Everyone should feel good wearing lingerie.”Savage x Fenty has a membership programme that costs $50 a year and gives early access to launches, limited-edition pieces and free shipping.“Membership brands are so hot right now and Rihanna can certainly create something special where people feel like they belong and want to buy from her,” Georg Richter, CEO and founder of the subscription commerce platform OceanX, told the fashion trade newspaper Women’s Wear Daily. “A person like her has it easy in this business, because people are already looking for her – she’s a modern influencer. It’s hard to start something if you don’t have that reach.”The extent of Rihanna’s influence was apparent in March, when she wiped almost $1bn off the value of Snapchat’s parent company, Snap Inc, after criticising the social media app for hosting an advert that appeared to make light of domestic violence.This year she is broadening her horizons again to star in the all-female lineup of Ocean’s 8, alongside Sandra Bullock, Cate Blanchett and Anne Hathaway.The film draws a parallel with the female empowerment message behind her lingerie line. As she says of Savage x Fenty: “As women, we’re looked at as the needy ones, the naggy ones, the ones who are going to be heartbroken in a relationship. Savage is just the reverse. And you know, guys don’t like getting the cards flipped on them – ever.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a53ed7428ec8ceb8d134a0662b823bb70ee67fe/0_277_3944_2367/master/3944.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e6f3ac71f81411ce68ddff823767d00d","title":"the image book review jean luc godard cannes 2018","story":"The veteran auteur returns to Cannes with his latest essay film, a mosaic of clips and fragments lent the urgency and terror of a horror movieImage Book is a work that reprises many of Jean-Luc Godard’s familiar ideas, but with an unexpected urgency and visceral strangeness. It’s an essay film with the body-language of a horror movie, avowedly taking Godard’s traditional concerns with the ethical status of cinema and history and looking to the Arab world and indirectly examining our orientalism – Godard cites the Conradian phrase for a culture held “under Western eyes”.Appropriately there are some amazingly fierce images, and the screen of Cannes’s Grand Theatre Lumiere is a colossal canvas over which to spread them.As so often in the past, Godard churns the dark waters of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Image fragments are dislodged from the deep, and come floating up to the surface: paintings, news headlines, classic Hollywood clips, often digitally distorted or bleached out or suffused with a snow-blind white glow. These are juxtaposed with brutal news footage and Isis YouTube propaganda. Here are the alienations and macroaggressions of the contemporary world.Image Book is the signature Godard irony-mosaic of clips and fragments, with sloganised, gnomic texts, puns in brackets, sudden fades-to-black, unpredictable, unsynchronised sound cues which appear to have been edited quite without the usual concern for aural seamlesness, and vast, declamatory orchestral chords.Godard’s is a cinematic language that has now possibly been largely co-opted by the cultural theorist or the conceptual artist. But Godard always insists on the larger, traditional prerogative of film and the grandeur that only cinema, only the phenomenon of people gathered in the dark before the vast screen, can convey.In Image Book he appears to gesture, again, at the subject of cinema’s culpable failure to witness the horrors of the modern world, failure to account for Auschwitz and Hiroshima. Cinema, that thrillingly seductive and ersionary mass-image-industry of the twentieth century, evolved in tandem with technologies that gave us wholesale slaughter, genocide and tyranny - outrages which happened behind cinema’s back. This is, I think, still at the heart of Godard’s view and at the heart of the title here. What is the status of the image? Is it text? If it is a sign then what is its real-world referent? Just another sign? Another book? Can we empathise with the sufferings of others, the sufferings of oppressed peoples, if the news of such suffering is just an ideologically constructed text of images and words?But now perhaps, the problem is different. There are too many images. Still images. Moving images. Images on our phones and iPads. We are drowning in images – they swamp our ability to make sense of them. Godard selects, with his cinephile connoisseurship and his old leftist anger - and we are bombarded with eyeball-frazzling pictures plucked out of context. The supersaturated colours of video are a thrillingly dissonant, deafening synesthesia. It is bewildering. I’m not sure I understood more than a fraction and of course it can be dismissed as obscurantism and mannerism. But I found Image Book rich, disturbing and strange.

The outgoing manager has promised to reveal all one day but now, on the eve of his final game at Huddersfield Town on Sunday, it is not the time. There is life in the tease yet. But did he regret having always stayed put? “Maybe,” Wenger replied, which felt faintly shocking.The 68-year-old is resolutely not one for regret or looking further back than the previous match. He has taught himself to blot out personal feeling, to compartmentalise, to “control the animal that is inside of you”. But when he held his final briefing as the Arsenal manager with the written press, he was reflective and wistful.Wenger admitted that, like most observers, he separated his lengthy tenure into two parts – the Highbury years and the Emirates Stadium era. The club’s 60,000-seat bowl, into which they moved in 2006, is a monument to Wenger and he was not about to speak ill of it. And yet, when he talked so lovingly about Highbury – the scene of his greatest triumphs – it was possible to sense internal conflict.“Highbury had a special spirit,” Wenger said. “It’s a cathedral, a church. You could smell the soul of every guy that played there. The Emirates was like buying a new house. It took us a while to feel at home there. It’s a fantastic stadium but there was something special at Highbury that you could never recreate when you build something new.”Wenger painted a picture of the Emirates move as a necessary but painful aspect of the club’s evolution in the context of Premier League expansionism something they were somehow pressed into by the circumstances of the time. “We had to do it,” he said. “There is no club that can turn down people who wanted to attend the game.”But it is plain that Wenger feels it restricted him. The idea was that the increased revenues from having more match-going fans would propel Arsenal to a position of financial pre-eminence. The problem was that broadcast money, rather than that from the turnstiles, would become the principal driver over the decade or so that followed. The other major issue was the emergence of extremely rich owners at rival clubs.Wenger dwelt on Dein. He had mentioned him apropos of nothing last Tuesday, paying tribute to the man who appointed him, and the bond between the pair runs deep. Dein left Arsenal in April 2007 and he would eventually be replaced by Ivan Gazidis in January 2009. “Ideally, I would have loved to continue working with him,” the Frenchman said of Dein.Wenger believes that Tottenham will be forced to confront similarly harsh realities in the short-to-medium term as they live their own stadium rebuild. Arsenal’s neighbours must find at least half a billion pounds to finance the project.“The prices for the stadium have doubled but the transfers of players have tripled or quadrupled,” Wenger said. “Today, a guy like Harry Kane – I don’t know for much they can sell him: £100m? So they might have more supply. But they have to face it. Will Tottenham have to sell players? To Arsenal, maybe.”Wenger gave a mischievous smile. There is no doubt that since what has come to be known as The Announcement, he has loosened up a little. He also admitted, at last, why he insisted on dragging the media to St Albans for 8.45am press conferences – and it was what we had always suspected. (It is possible to count on the fingers of one hand the number of times he was on time.)“I know that in the press, nobody likes to get up early so it is to make you suffer a bit, as well,” he said.Yet it was his own suffering that undercut the final address. This is a man who has lived in north London for 22 years but, by his own admission, does not know the way into town. “Basically, I’ve never been to the centre without a driver,” he said. “My way was Totteridge-London Colney.” In short, Wenger’s life has been Arsenal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/001709f56c49b915d0d1cd4ea98eb840d22c4819/0_120_2926_1756/master/2926.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aea4b76b8a9b60936a791a1268e1b6e0","title":"derby county fulham championship play off match report","story":"The side who finished sixth in the Championship have not won promotion through the play-offs since Blackpool managed it in 2010. Derby County have spent the intervening years seemingly finding new and more elaborate ways not to go up but they took a step towards the top flight with a battling 1-0 win over Fulham in the first leg of their semi-final on Friday night.This was a granite solid performance from Derby, defending Cameron Jerome’s first-half header as if the very future of the club depended on it, and keeping Ryan Sessegnon and Aleksandar Mitrovic, who have laid waste to the Championship at times this season, quiet all night.Fulham’s manager, Slavisa Jokanovic, did not seem overly concerned, though. “It’s not a bad result,” he said afterwards. “Definitely not the result we deserved. This is a very good performance from my point of view.”The game started in that usual frantic, uncoordinated mess that these play-offs tend to. Both teams tried to start on the front foot, which is a sure recipe for entertaining chaos. Fulham tried surgically to pick holes in the Derby backline but without any real joy. A couple of fairly weak efforts was the best they could manage. The Rams showed little of the same intricacy, yet their more simple approach was brilliantly rewarded in the 34th minute.Tom Huddlestone spread the ball to Craig Forsyth who, pinged over a superb cross from deep on the left, right on to the head of Jerome, who powered his effort into the net. Before the run-in Jerome had scored only once since joining Derby in January: that was his fifth in the last four games. When he signed it seemed like a curious move: now it looks inspired.The Fulham of the first half looked more like the side of the past few weeks, when they have seemed tired and tense. It is tempting to think that extraordinary run, 23 games unbeaten that nearly won them automatic promotion, had come a tiny bit too early and had sapped their energy. One could tell the travelling fans were getting nervous: at the start of the second half they started booing a ballboy.After the break their team showed more purpose: Kevin McDonald belted a shot against the bar, Floyd Ayite volleyed over from a terrific long pass by Matt Targett and Tom Cairney curled a shot just wide. Yet they struggled to create a significant chances of note.Mitrovic, so often Fulham’s brutal inspiration in the latter months of the season, struggled to find space to do much damage and began dropping deeper and deeper as he searched for the ball. Plenty of credit must go to Curtis Davies, who marshalled the big Serb superbly. “Defensively all game, we handled them really, really well,” said Rowett.Sessegnon, the boy wonder of the Championship, was also kept quiet. He was taken off with 15 minutes to go, his anonymous performance suggesting two things: that Andre Wisdom had done a fine job in neutralising him, and also that a rumoured call-up to the senior England squad is too soon for a player who does not turn 18 until next week.On the touchline, as Fulham attack after Fulham attack was snuffed out, Jokanovic, in that brooding manner of his, cast his eyes towards the ground like a parent who was not angry, just disappointed. If this often thrilling side do not go up this season, it will be a shame but in truth they deserved no more from a game where they did not make enough of their theoretical domination. They will need to be more clinical in the return on Monday.The result leaves the second leg placed beautifully. “We can’t go down there and try to protect the lead. We’ve got to try to win the game,” Rowett said, expressing the requisite degree of caution. “It gives us a slender lead but, as we know, that can be cancelled out in a second. I didn’t let them have the music on in the dressing room because we’ve got to be focused for the next game.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d1cf7bd2e0b43e8d618ba9d3fcab3049cc46bd6/1_0_2593_1556/master/2593.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f551202d55840d1dff70135ec444a8d3","title":"should vegan rise podcast contribute","story":"In our next We Need to Talk About podcast, we’ll consider the key questions in adopting a plant-based lifestyle. What are your views?Supporters’ voices are essential to our monthly podcast, We Need to Talk About…, whether our subject matter is Brexit, nationalism or the environment. In our next podcast, we’ll consider the rise of veganism as a lifestyle choice – why are so many are opting to go vegan, and what are the implications for society?Since  columnist Decca Aitkenhead wrote about her own vegan experiment, and we published a long read on the topic, we have had a huge number of responses – from readers, academics, experts and others. Defying naysayers’ predictions that it was yet another hipster food fad, adopting a plant-based lifestyle is becoming a popular choice for people for many different reasons. We’ve invited Decca into the studio to host our next podcast and we’d love you, the ’s supporters, to pose questions to her for the discussion. Have you or a family member recently adopted a vegan lifestyle? Have you been driven by ethical, health, environmental or financial factors? If the factors are environmental, are you concerned mostly with deforestation, bioersity loss, or something that affects you more locally? If you made the choice for health reasons, have you noticed the benefits and have you found it easy to eat a balanced diet? Is it a decision you made alone or as a family? Is it something you tried but later decided against? Perhaps you are a lifelong vegan and you are relieved to see it becoming more mainstream?Another point for discussion could focus around the role of social media in the rise of veganism. There are a number of Netflix documentaries on the subject there are Instagram influencers and prominent academics who are becoming vegan. Perhaps it works for them, but is it for everyone? There have also been concerns that veganism provides a socially acceptable cover for disordered eating. You might want to discuss the potential issues around this surge in public curiosity. Or explore how your consumption and habits have changed in recent years. Are you sceptical about the rise of veganism, or inspired by it? How can farmers and food producers adapt to better cater to the change in demand? Please do get in touch, wherever you are in the world: we would like to hear your questions, views and experiences.

Listeners to The Start have heard Ai Weiwei open up about being targeted by the Chinese authorities after his artwork commemorating the 80,000 people killed in the hushed-up Sichuan earthquake about Sofia Coppola’s nerves when her father Francis appeared on the set of her first film, The Virgin Suicides and Peaches ulge how cancer and the painful end of a relationship inspired her to make her debut album, the electronic music landmark The Teaches of Peaches.Eva Krysiak, The Start’s producer, says that artists jumped at the chance to talk about their first major creative acts. “I must have sent 400 emails asking people to take part and almost everyone we got in touch with was interested,” she says. “It’s a really warming and personal subject that is easy to talk about: there’s nothing threatening about it, there’s no prying.” Furthermore, talking about their formative work “allows people to delve into their past and remember what it was like to be an everyday Joe – a little glimpse of life before the flashbulbs were popping”.That’s not to say that there haven’t been some revelations – not least that Damien Hirst’s artistic awakening came after he broke into the house of his neighbour, a compulsive hoarder. “With a subject matter like this you can ask slightly more personal questions,” Krysiak says. “You can say ‘the time you were making this piece was the start of a relationship with somebody that you mentioned meant a lot to you – can you tell me a little bit more about that relationship?’ You hope that somebody felt comfortable enough to give you something a little bit precious or close to their heart.”The intimacy of the podcast format also encourages interviewees to open up. “There’s no camera – it feels like a safe space,” Krysiak says. “People say that being interviewed for radio feels like therapy. You are in this cosy room together, and often the sound is very soft, there’s a sense that nobody is going to interrupt you, so you have to use all of those things to your advantage.” She adds that Hirst regarded the opportunity to be interviewed about his artistic genesis as an opportunity to reveal a different side to the brash Brit-artist. “Listeners said the episode changed their perceptions of him, and that he was really likeable. They went away feeling completely different about his work. That was really nice, to realise that it takes the right kind of media and the right kind of question for that to happen, and I think that’s what podcasting is really brilliant for.” The Start was an immediate hit, with over 140,000 listeners, and people emailing in from around the world “saying that we’d made something unique and touching”. Its innovative sound design also made The Start stand out. “There’s a lot of texture,” says Krysiak. “We build up a sense of time and place using sound effects and archives, really bringing the spoken word to life. There’s a lot of layering in terms of sounds, a lot of warping and sometimes adding effects to pull people out of reality and pull them into that world of imagination and then straight back into what the speaker’s saying.” The Start was the result of a long debate at the  about what a new arts-based podcast should be. Krysiak says that she wanted it to mix household names like Hirst, Coppola and Ai with artists who are less familiar, like internet artist Ann Hirsch and drummer and composer Mark Guiliana, who played on David Bowie’s final album, Blackstar. She also ensured that there was a 5050 gender split, a multi-disciplinary approach and a distinctively international outlook, including Iranian video artist Shirin Neshat as well as Brits Abi Morgan and Lemn Sissay.A second series is being commissioned, to go live towards the end of this year, and with a new group of new names on Krysiak’s wish list. She would love to interview Marjane Satrapi, the IranianFrench author of Persepolis, “for the fact that she represented a totally different kind of ‘art’, namely the graphic novel, which also combines two different art forms, drawing and storytelling”. Toni Morrison is high on the list, to allow the author to translate her vivid storytelling abilities to the medium of audio, and to present “the firsthand realities of trying to succeed in a time and place that presented so many challenges for a black female writer.” David Lynch, the director of Twin Peaks, is another aspiration: “for managing to make it big with what must have initially been seen as a completely leftfield creative mindset and potentially impenetrable ideas”. Lynch on getting something as flat-out bizarre as Eraserhead out into the world: who wouldn’t love to listen to that?You can review and subscribe to  podcasts on , iTunes, Soundcloud, Audioboom and Mixcloud.

It has titanium wings encrusted with green tsavorites, a highly fashionable gem discovered in 1967. They are said to be 1,000 times rarer than emeralds. The museum said it was delighted to receive the “stunning” ring. Its jewellery curator, Clare Phillips, said: “Beyoncé is a figure whose personal style the V\u0026ampA is proud to represent and a gift from whose personal collection we are honoured to receive.“The Papillon ring she has gifted is an exquisite example of contemporary jewellery design by one of Britain’s master jewellers.”Spiro, who became an apprentice at Cartier when he was just 15, began producing jewellery under his own name when he launched his brand, G, in 2014. He operates from mirror-lined rooms in Mayfair that once belonged to the royal couturier Norman Hartnell. The ring is one of a number of G pieces Beyoncé owns, mostly gifted by Jay-Z.The V\u0026ampA said the American singer was enthusiastic about museums and decided to donate the ring to one in Spiro’s home city.The Papillon is on display in the William and Judith Bollinger jewellery gallery, which contains more than 3,000 jewels from the ancient Greek period to the present day. There are pendants that were given by Elizabeth I to her courtiers diamond jewellery made by Leopold Pfisterer for Catherine the Great and sold by the Bolsheviks after 1917 and an emerald and diamond necklace that Napoleon and Joséphine, his first wife, are believed to have given to their adopted daughter, Stéphanie de Beauharnais, for her arranged marriage to the heir of the Grand Duke of Baden in 1806."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/993efc7f18e978cd9b43dee3d7ffffe84951f6b5/554_59_4224_2535/master/4224.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d4e0d3d41c0182a9bff1c154045048ca","title":"how metoo revealed the central rift within feminism social individualist","story":"It’s not a generational ide, but rather a split between two competing visions of feminism – social and inidualist. By  Moira DoneganWhen the #MeToo moment began in earnest last October, many women felt optimistic, galvanised others felt uncomfortable. As stories of abuse and harassment accumulated in the media, men began to experience consequences for their treatment of women. Some lost jobs, others were demoted, many faced public embarrassment. The careers of men such as Hollywood producer and alleged rapist Harvey Weinstein, masturbating comedian Louis CK, and predatory actor Kevin Spacey were declared dead. Others, like the groping chef Mario Batali, took a temporary “step back” from their public lives. A reckoning seemed to be underway, and many women felt that it was long overdue.In the media and in private life, conversations about consent, hostile environments and power began, and there was a growing acknowledgment that a man’s unwanted sexual overtures were a symptom of broader social and political forces. Soon, these discussions were interrupted by hand-wringing and anger from male commentators – everyone from conservative columnist Andrew Sullivan to Donald Trump – who claimed the movement had gone too far before it really began. But unexpected ides emerged between feminists as well.Some feminists urged caution others wanted the reckoning to go further. But the most common complaint about #MeToo came from those who felt that the whole movement had very quickly become silly. Self-described feminists such as Daphne Merkin and Bari Weiss in the New York Times, Katie Roiphe in Harper’s, Germaine Greer in the Sydney Morning Herald and 100 French women in Le Monde complained that many of the incidents of harassment were too minor to warrant opprobrium. They argued that by grouping together such a wide spectrum of sexual misbehaviour, #MeToo had lost a sense of nuance. They called on women to toughen up. Whatever happened to no-nonsense rejections, they asked. Those who complained about harassment and assault, Merkin wrote, “perceive themselves to be as frail as Victorian housewives”. By this logic, women could solve the problem of sexual harassment and assault with good humour, patience and a high tolerance for pain.This disagreement was quickly characterised in the media as generational. Older feminists, we were told – say, anyone over 40 – were sinisterly complicit, laughably outdated, or just too scared of overstepping. Younger women, depending on who you asked, were either righteously passionate, naively idealistic, or out for blood.In part, this notion of a generational ide came from the feminist opponents and supporters of #MeToo themselves. In Harper’s, Roiphe derided the #MeToo movement as “Twitter feminism”, giving the impression that only narcissistic, social media-obsessed millennials want a reckoning over sexual assault. In her article criticising the direction #MeToo was taking, Bari Weiss emphasised the youth and naivety of an anonymous woman who made allegations against the comedian Aziz Ansari. Meanwhile, the feminist website Jezebel, whose readers and writers skew young, ran an article headlined “The Backlash to #MeToo is Second-Wave Feminism”, gesturing vaguely at a misguided crop of older feminist thinkers but not engaging much with those thinkers’ actual achievements and failures. Each side used age stereotypes, with varying degrees of cynicism – older women were crotchety or out of touch, younger women were egoists or spoiled children. None of this commentary seemed interested in the fact that the women coming forward with stories of sexual abuse were both young and old. #MeToo’s feminist detractors also come from different generations. At only 32, Weiss is young enough to be Merkin’s daughter, or Greer’s granddaughter.The #MeToo moment and its backlash made it clear that there really was a ide among feminists, but analysis of that ide cast it as a mere catfight, or a screaming match between weary mothers and teenage daughters. The implication was that the feminist debate unfolding around #MeToo is a kind of routine domestic drama, something we’ve seen before.This is a mistake. A closer look at the arguments being made by these two camps reveals a deeper, more serious intellectual rift. What’s really at play is that feminism has come to contain two distinct understandings of sexism, and two wildly different, often incompatible ideas of how that problem should be solved. One approach is inidualist, hard-headed, grounded in ideals of pragmatism, realism and self-sufficiency. The other is expansive, communal, idealistic and premised on the ideals of mutual interest and solidarity. The clash between these two kinds of feminism has been starkly exposed by #MeToo, but the crisis is the result of shifts in feminist thought that have been decades in the making.The central claim of the anti-#MeToo feminists is that the movement does not treat inidual women as moral agents with the capacity to say no, to enjoy and pursue sex, and to do wrong. From this perspective, women who come forward about their experiences of harassment or assault should often be given more responsibility for those experiences than the rhetoric of #MeToo assigns them. This thinking partakes in a long moral tradition – one that’s highly compatible with capitalism – in which personal responsibility, independence, and willingness to withstand hardship are revered as particularly valuable virtues. It’s an ethos of pulling yourself up by your own bootstraps – from poverty into prosperity, or, in the anti-#MeToo feminists’ logic, from “feminine” victimhood into “masculine” strength. They believe that the pervasiveness of sexual harassment suggests that it is inevitable, and that the best response is not anger, but resolve. Theirs is a feminism that posits that inidual women have the power to make choices to diminish the negative impact of sexism, and to endure any sexist unpleasantness that can’t be avoided – if only they have the grit to handle it.On the other hand, there is the #MeToo movement. It might seem strange to assert that #MeToo can be spoken of as a single ideology at all – that this cultural moment, which has exposed such a broad array of bad behaviour across so many industries and disciplines, could ever be coherent enough to have an agenda. But #MeToo, as a social movement and as a personal gesture, makes certain assumptions that aren’t compatible with the intellectual habits of most mainstream feminisms that have preceded it. By saying “me too”, an inidual woman makes herself a part of a broader group, and chooses to stand with others who have been harassed, assaulted or raped. This solidarity is powerful. It is still rare to see such a large group of women identifying their suffering as women’s suffering, claiming that they have all been harmed by the same forces of sexism, and together demanding that those forces be defeated.In this light, the ersity and breadth of the #MeToo movement is not a weakness, but a strength. After all, if so many women, with so many different kinds of lives, have experienced the same sexist behaviour from men, then it becomes easier to believe that the problem goes beyond iniduals and instead relates to wider cultural forces. The ubiquity of sexual harassment means that an inidual can’t simply avoid it by making the right choices, or by steeling herself with forceful determination the demand that she do so begins to look absurd.Call it, then, a conflict between “inidualist” and “social” feminisms. In part, the rift is between visions of how to undertake the feminist project, of which tactics are best: whether through inidual empowerment, or through collective liberation. But there is a greater moral ide between these two strands of thought, because #MeToo and its critics also disagree over where to locate responsibility for sexual abuse: whether it is a woman’s responsibility to navigate, withstand and overcome the misogyny that she encounters, or whether it is the shared responsibility of all of us to eliminate sexism, so that she never encounters it in the first place.This tension, between inidualist and social feminisms, has dogged the women’s movement since its revival in the mid-20th century. According to the inidualist model of feminism, personal responsibility, inidual freedoms and psychological adjustments offer a woman meaningful routes out of the suffering imposed by patriarchy, and into equality with men. Many of the most famous western feminists have been working in this tradition. For instance, Betty Friedan, author of the hugely influential 1960s feminist text The Feminine Mystique, argued that sexist cultural codes prevent women from achieving personal happiness. Friedan, a psychologist by training, focused on the inner lives of white, American, middle-class women at midcentury. More recently, inidualist feminism found a high-profile advocate when Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer of Facebook, published her memoir-cum-manifesto Lean In in 2013. Sandberg laments the lack of women in leadership positions, and her book is a how-to manual for women with lofty corporate ambitions.Social feminism has a similarly long, if less well-known, history. Soon after Friedan’s book became a bestseller, Italian feminists such as Leopoldina Fortunati and Silvia Federici began to formulate a different way of looking at the problems that women faced. As Marxists, they sought to analyse how men as a class related to women as a class. They were less interested in ideas of empowerment and self-actualisation than they were in isions of labour, living conditions and cold, hard cash. They argued that so-called “women’s work” – everything from mopping floors to dressing wounds to breastfeeding, cooking, prostitution, laundry and tending to the elderly – should not only be seen as work, but as essential to the capitalist wage-labour system. If men did not have these functions performed for them at home, these women argued, they would not be able to return to work and produce effectively. Male work in the factory relied upon female work in the home.When Federici’s Wages for Housework campaign launched in 1972, it attracted fierce public debate – first in Italy, and then in the US after Federici moved to New York and opened a Wages for Housework office in Brooklyn. The political mainstream found Federici’s idea ridiculous. Could she really mean that a woman should be paid for scrubbing the floors in her husband’s house? But the movement relied on the understanding that a wage was necessary for work to be seen as work, and for the people who did it to be seen as worthy of dignity and protection. More a rhetorical device than an immediate policy prescription, the demand “wages for housework” relied on a conception of women as a “class” in the same sense as a class of workers – a group of people with something in common who could organise on behalf of their shared interests.The Wages for Housework movement fizzled out, but its influence has lived on in campaigns for racial justice, gay rights, housing rights and sex workers’ rights. Behind Wages for Housework lay the idea that women’s oppression was widespread, that it had common features even for women who lived very different lives, and that it was more than just a personal experience – it was a political phenomenon. But because sexism beats so many people down, that also meant that there was a community of women who could pull each other up. Those who experience gendered oppression can band together to end it.Something similar is at stake in #MeToo’s assertions that sexual harassment and assault are systemic, and that women can unite to demand an end to them. While inidualist feminists such as Friedan and Sandberg have examined the problem of sexism by zooming in, to consider women’s psyches and attitudes, Wages for Housework zoomed out, to examine how women were oppressed by the economic forces of capitalism. #MeToo has a less ideological, more ad hoc approach to its analysis of patriarchy. But its gesture proceeds from the assumption that misogyny is structural, and that women have a shared interest in fighting it.This does not mean that #MeToo treats all women’s experiences as the same. The movement has included stories from women of different races, orientations and religions. It has brought testimony from women who are rich and poor, healthy and chronically ill, cis and trans, famous and anonymous. This variety has led to an increasing acknowledgment that misogyny takes different forms, and that not all women have access to the same tools used to mitigate it.At its best, #MeToo’s social feminism has been heavily influenced by black American feminist scholars such as Kimberlé Crenshaw, whose work aims to confront the combined nature of racism and sexism in the lives of black women, and to analyse how, for the people who experience both racism and sexism, the phenomena don’t feel distinct at all. In her 1989 legal article Demarginalizing the Intersection of Race and Sex, Crenshaw called for a new way of understanding oppression that she referred to as “intersectionality”. Put very simply, this meant taking into account the ways that oppression looks different for different people, and how iniduals experience oppression along more than one axis at once. In practice, Crenshaw’s approach suggests that an effective movement against patriarchal oppression must also confront other systemic inequalities – ones that lend power and viciousness to many women’s experiences of sexism.Intersectionality has given #MeToo a more expansive understanding of sexual harassment and assault. The gesture of saying “me too” implies solidarity with all women who have had these experiences, but the form the movement has taken has also allowed for it to be a specific, personal declaration, and for those testimonies to come from women with different stories and in different circumstances. For every anti-#MeToo feminist who scornfully asks, “Why didn’t you just leave?”, there have been dozens of women explaining the circumstances of their lives that effectively barred the door. Often, these stories have made it heartbreakingly clear that not everyone can risk their job by giving a firm, uncompromising “no” to a handsy boss or coworker that not everyone can afford to call an emergency cab that not everyone has the privileges that make it easy to act in the ways that the inidualist feminists so often prescribe.#MeToo’s sheer number of testimonies has vindicated theories of sexism as a universal, but not uniform, force –that is, as something that every woman will experience, but that every woman will experience in different ways. But in its solidarity, its public gesture of women coming together to demand an end to harassment and assault, the movement also continues the tradition of women’s class consciousness, unity and need for confrontation with systemic injustice. Call it the “too” of #MeToo: the understanding that meaningful liberation from misogyny will only be achieved collectively, with changes at the structural, cultural and institutional levels. Social feminism does not aspire to enable a few women to gain positions of power in patriarchal systems. It’s not about giving women “a seat at the table”. It’s about taking the table apart, so that we can build a new one together.This is not a simple proposition. As an approach, social feminism has real flaws, though its most significant weaknesses are not the ones that #MeToo’s prominent critics choose to address. The real weakness of social feminism is not that it encourages women to be oversensitive about discomforts, but that it is so broad. The call for women to unite can overlook the kinds of pain and conflict that can exist between them.After all, who do we mean when we talk about “women”? What experiences or conditions, exactly, do we identify as common to all women? It is difficult to generalise about so many people at once, and questions of injustice, inequality and privilege mean that doing so puts us at the risk of ignoring vital differences. Women are a varied bunch, and they encounter intersecting oppressions that are not of patriarchy’s exclusive making: racism, classism, ability and sexuality. Often, these oppressions are enforced by other women. There are vast gulfs that separate women from one another: gulfs of racism and money, of colonialism, bigotry, history, resentment, defensiveness, ignorance and hurt. It can be very hard to see each other across them.#MeToo, however, has made it clear that solidarity among women is possible. The working definition of “women”, as #MeToo has constructed it, can be understood simply: as everyone who has experienced misogyny. It’s a bleak kind of solidarity, this acknowledgment of shared suffering. But #MeToo has transformed that mournful acknowledgment into something much more hopeful. If the #MeToo movement has prompted many women to focus on misogynist behaviour with a unifying grief and anger, it has also led many of them to contemplate our shared power and common vision for a different world. When the social feminists of #MeToo call for changes that would make harassment, assault and other forms of misogyny rare, their very act of collective imagining makes such a world more possible: the more we stand together in this demand, the easier it becomes to imagine a world where respect is common, where cruelty is rare, where all of us think with more empathy and intelligence about the lives of others, and where being women will not doom us to suffering or limitation.Again, this is an old debate: whether feminism’s aim should be to transform society, or to better equip inidual women to navigate within it. But why, then, has this clash been framed as generational, when it is clear that the two visions of feminism have been doing battle for decades? Part of it, of course, is ageism and incuriosity – the reflexive tendency to presume that the old are too timid and the young are too reckless. And there is the idea, unique to feminism among all other strands of political thought, that feminism is a social movement that must occur in discrete, coherent and temporal “waves”.But another reason why #MeToo has been framed as a generational conflict is because the inidualist feminists of the anti-#MeToo backlash have framed their own resistance to the movement as grounded in wisdom, realism and, above all, maturity. To them, all this talk of a reimagined, recreated new world sounds hopelessly naive. Daphne Merkin summed up the tenor of the anti-#MeToo assessment in her article in the New York Times, when she wrote to the women coming forward: “Grow up, this is real life”.This is a common, but still very strange belief: that the epitome of maturity and personal strength is the resigned acceptance that the world cannot be better than it is, that we cannot be kinder to one another, that male entitlement, crassness and predation are permanent and unchangeable and must be endured. It is a bizarre conception of strength, one that dismisses as childish weakness any demand for a better world, any hope that things might one day be different. There is a way of thinking that makes this approach by the anti-#MeToo feminists seem strong and pragmatic. But there is another way of thinking that makes it seem very sad.In her book Trauma and Recovery, about the treatment of rape victims and other psychiatric patients who have undergone horrible abuse, the Harvard psychiatrist Judith Herman writes of the temptation to sympathise with a patient’s abuser. “It is very tempting to take the side of the perpetrator,” she writes. “All the perpetrator asks is that the bystander do nothing. He appeals to the universal desire to see, hear, and speak no evil. The victim, on the contrary, asks the bystander to share the burden of pain.” Something similar may be at work in the anti-#MeToo feminists’ desire to advocate for an inidualist feminism. Their call to sympathise more with the perpetrators of sexual assault, and to place greater responsibility for those assaults on the choices of women who experience them, is part of an effort not to feel implicated in the suffering of others, not to share that burden of pain. #MeToo and the reckoning that it has provoked has given us all knowledge we would rather not have – knowledge of just how normal some terrible things are, of just how much some of us have suffered. The anti-#MeToo feminists of the world are not the only ones who feel tempted to look away.

During the 2011 Libyan revolution, documents came to light revealing MI6’s role in the rendition of Belhaj and Boudchar, and a second Libyan opposition figure Sami al-Saadi, who was kidnapped along with his wife and four young children. At this point Straw gave an interview in which he implied that MI6 had not informed him of its involvement.Straw has said that he is prepared to give evidence to the intelligence and security committee, the panel of MPs and peers that provides oversight of the UK’s intelligence agencies. That would be done behind closed doors, however, and some MPs believe Straw needs to be given a chance to give evidence to a parliamentary committee that sits in public.Abdel Hakim Belhaj\u0026nbspand his wife, Fatima Boudchar,\u0026nbspwere the victims of a so-called rendition operation mounted with the help of\u0026nbspMI6.They have battled for compensation and an apology for more than six years, after papers that came to light during the Libyan revolution revealed the role that British intelligence officers played in their 2004 kidnap in Thailand.The couple were hooded and shackled and flown to one of Muammar Gaddafi’s prisons, where Belhaj was tortured and sentenced to death.They had sued the former foreign secretary Jack Straw, and Sir Mark Allen, the former head of counter-terrorism at MI6, as well as the agency itself and the Foreign Office.\u0026nbspAmong the evidence obtained by Scotland Yard was a faxed letter from Allen to Gaddafi’s intelligence chief, Moussa Koussa, in which he made clear that MI6 had tipped off the Libyans about the couple’s whereabouts.Boudchar was four and a half months pregnant at the time that she was kidnapped. She was set free shortly before giving birth.Two weeks after the couple were renditioned to Libya,\u0026nbspTony Blair paid his first visit\u0026nbspto the country, embracing Gaddafi and declaring that Libya had recognised “a common cause, with us, in the fight against al-Qaida extremism and terrorism”.\u0026nbspOther documents discovered during the Libyan revolution\u0026nbspmake clear that information extracted from Belhaj was used to justify the detention in Britain of members of his Islamist opposition group, the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group, some of whom had settled in the UK as refugees many years earlier.One shadow minister said: “Now this has been exposed and the government’s role admitted, there has to be an explanation from the iniduals then involved – former and serving civil servants and politicians – about what they knew and when about rendition and torture.“I want to know how complicit the government was, who they were talking to and the details of their relationship with the intelligence services. We need to know how was it allowed to continue and the efforts that were subsequently made to cover it up.“Obviously, as the foreign secretary Jack Straw has many questions to answer. He must now explain what he knew, when he knew it and why his story appears to have changed.”Another shadow minister said: “Rendition has been used to outsource torture and any future Labour government should not be tainted by the actions of former Labour ministers. Straw should come forward and explain himself and get this out in the open.”A veteran Labour MP added: “Any minister who was involved in such an obvious breach of human rights should explain themselves.”Following a Scotland Yard investigation, the Crown Prosecution Service concluded that the main suspect – known to be Sir Mark Allen, then head of counter-terrorism at MI6 – had sought political authority for some but not all of his actions. Friends of Straw say that the authorisation that he gave was subsequently “twisted and expanded” by MI6. Human rights groups say there needs to be a broader inquiry, independent of government.Kate Allen, director of Amnesty International UK, called for an independent judicial inquiry into the Libyan renditions and other human rights abuses in the years after 911.“Even now, despite the perseverance and bravery of Mr Belhaj and Ms Boudchar in seeking an apology, we still don’t know the full facts in this deeply troubling affair,” she said.“We’ve still never had the judicial inquiry into the UK’s role in torture carried out by its partners – including the CIA’s extensive programme of rendition and illegal detention – that we were promised under David Cameron’s government. We still need to know the truth.”13 December 2005 To the Commons foreign affairs committee, after the  had reported that CIA rendition aircraft had been refuelling at UK airports:Unless we start to believe in conspiracy theories and that the officials are lying, that I am lying, that behind this there is some kind of secret state which is in league with some dark forces in the United States, and also let me say, we believe that Secretary Rice is lying, there simply is no truth in the claims that the United Kingdom has been involved in rendition full stop, because we have not been, and so what on earth a judicial inquiry would start to do I have no idea5 September 2011 In an interview with the BBC, shortly after documents that detailed MI6’s involvement in the kidnap and rendition of two families emerged during the Libyan revolution:No foreign secretary can know all the details of what its intelligence agencies are doing at any one time10 May 2018 In a statement issued by his lawyers, Kingsley Napley, after Prime Minister Theresa May told Abdel Hakim Belhaj and his wife Fatima Boudchar that she was “profoundly sorry” for the role that MI6 and the British government played in their kidnap, rendition and torture.Although Straw described the authorisation he gave as being sought on 1 March 2004 with “great urgency”, and the couple were kidnapped by the CIA the following day, Sami al-Saadi and his wife and four young children were not kidnapped until 27 March 2004.After a Scotland Yard investigation, the Crown Prosecution Service concluded that Sir Mark Allen of MI6 had “sought political authority” for some, but not all, of his subsequent actions:On 1 March 2004 my approval was sought for some information to be shared with international partners. In almost every case such approvals were made by me in writing, on the basis of written submissions to me. However in rare cases of great urgency, oral submissions could be made and oral approvals given by me.

The 20-year-old scored his third hundred in 10 first-class matches to turn day one against Yorkshire on its head following a sticky start on an unusually green-tinged pitch.At 69 for four and 162 for six either side of lunch Surrey were struggling after Joe Root’s decision to let the toss go uncontested and bowl first - Root is captaining Yorkshire this weekend following illness to Gary Ballance. A score of 200 was in doubt against a team full of confidence having beaten champions Essex last weekend despite posting 50 in the first innings. But Pope, a calm head on young shoulders, guided Surrey to 366 for seven.Having come in at six, the diminutive former England under-19s right-hander battled hard with his fifth-wicket partner, Dean Elgar, (61) to share 68 before Rikki Clarke dominated a key 129-run stand for the seventh wicket either side of tea, taking the score to 291 for seven.It was only once the belligerent Clarke, who passed 10,000 first-class runs, departed for 71 to Jack Brooks with the second new ball that Pope (131) kicked on, showing the flamboyance which has also made him useful against the white ball. Maybe he will take to 100-ball cricket? That is, of course, as long as it goes ahead. Speaking at tea on BBC Rradio, Surrey’s chief executive, Richard Gould, admitted there is plenty of confusion surrounding the ECB’s plans for the new competition. Asked whether he thought it would go ahead in 2020, he said: “I don’t know.”Earlier Mark Stoneman was lbw to Tim Bresnan for 10, Rory Burns was caught at first slip off Brooks - his 400th first-class victim - for nine and Ben Foakes caught behind off Steve Patterson for 18.The Division One leaders, Nottinghamshire, were bowled out for 133 by Lancashire at Trent Bridge, including two wickets for Jimmy Anderson, before the visitors responded with 157 for four. Haseeb Hameed posted a duck.The champions, Essex, having suffered their first Championship defeat in 19 against Yorkshire, are struggling again, away to Worcestershire. They were b owled out for 177 – Alastair Cook hit 37 – before the hosts responded with 47 for no loss. At Taunton rain meant only 58.1 overs were possible between Hampshire and Somerset, with the visitors 198 for eight. James Vince hit a flighty 44 and Tom Abell took three wickets.In Division Two Eoin Morgan’s 76 for Middlesex (356 for six) against Gloucestershire at Lord’s represented his first Championship fifty since September 2014. Dawid Malan matched him.Fourteen wickets fell on a helter-skelter opening day between the leaders, Warwickshire, and Northamptonshire at Edgbaston. The teenage seamer Henry Brookes was shaping to be the headline act for Warwickshire with four wickets, including three in an opening spell that had the visitors 52 for six and 118 for seven by lunch. But Steven Crook (92) and Doug Bracewell (81) changed the complexion as a stand of 122 pushed them up to 256. They also shared three wickets in Warwickshire’s reply of 100 for four.

Thiem, who lost to Nadal in the Monte Carlo quarter-finals last month, was the last player to beat the Spaniard on clay – at last year’s Rome Masters – and he prevailed in the Spanish capital on Friday, winning 7-5, 6-3.Nadal had set a record of winning 50 consecutive sets on a single surface by beating the Argentinian Diego Schwartzman on Thursday but he was undone by Thiem, who broke the 31-year-old’s serve five times before sealing victory with a powerful cross-court winner in just under two hours. The 24-year-old, seeded fifth, will now face the South African Kevin Anderson in the semi-finals on Saturday. “I haven’t been good enough today,” Nadal said. “Some days you don’t play as good as you would like to play. Also when that happens it’s because your opponent is doing really well.”Roger Federer, who is sitting out the clay-court season, will return to world No\u0026nbsp1 on Monday but Nadal could regain top spot with a win at the Rome Masters, which begins on Sunday.Kyle Edmund’s run at the Madrid Open also came to an end at the quarter-final stage after he was beaten by Canada’s Denis Shapovalov.The British No1 saved a match point at the end of a feisty second set which also involved an incident in which he was distracted by a spectator. But Edmund could not hold off his 19-year-old opponent who broke early in the third and served well to triumph 7-5, 6-7, 6-4.Edmund will take heart from his week, though, especially his memorable win over Novak Djokovic in the earlier rounds.On the women’s side of the draw, Kiki Bertens of the Netherlands continued her sparkling week, securing a place in the final with an emphatic 6-2, 6-2 victory over France’s Caroline Garcia.The unseeded world No\u0026nbsp20 blasted her way past Garcia, the seventh seed, in just over an hour, breaking serve four times and never surrendering a break point to move within sight of her second singles title of the year.The 26-year-old had taken some big scalps already in Madrid, defeating Maria Sharapova in the quarter-finals on Thursday, the day after knocking out the world No\u0026nbsp2 and Australian Open champion, Caroline Wozniacki.“I’m really happy with the way I played. I think it was maybe not great tennis, what people want to see with a lot of winners, but Caroline is a great player,” Bertens said. “Garcia likes when the ball comes from the hip so I was just trying to play as many different balls as I could. I think I did it pretty well.”“She played very well, she used the high ball very well,” said Garcia, of Bertens. “I couldn’t do anything about it.“Of course, I’m frustrated. My performance today was not great. But she had a game plan and it worked well.”Bertens will face a tough examination in Saturday’s final against Petra Kvitova after she beat her Czech compatriot Karolina Pliskova 7-6, 6-3 in Friday’s second semi-final. The victory was Kvitova’s 10th in succession and moves her one step closer to a second successive title after her triumph at last week’s Prague Open.

Stuart Lancaster has only to alight from Leinster’s team bus at Bilbao’s San Mamés stadium rather than walk the trail to Santiago de Compostela but, after two-and-a-half years, his journey to professional redemption is finally complete.The Champions Cup final against Racing 92 is not just about one man but it is a particularly resonant day for England’s erstwhile coach. The last must-win showpiece games his family attended were in 2015 when England were bowing out of their home World Cup at Twickenham. A big occasion for rugby lovers in Dublin, Paris and the Basque country also marks a personally significant return to the sunlit uplands for Lancaster and his wife, Nina, their two children, parents and friends.Those who assume sacked English coaches simply shrug their shoulders and ease into another highly paid role are oblivious to the stark reality. Cumbrian farmers’ sons never wallow in self pity but even Lancaster’s positivity drained away during 2016 when he was jobless with no clear route back into top-level rugby. This week, in a small room on Dublin’s south side, it all finally came tumbling out. “The main thing was a lack of purpose. Not having a team to coach was really eating away at me, not being able to put anything right and just having to sit there thinking about it. It is very difficult when you are out of work.”But for a series of unexpected coincidences, he might still be in Leeds agonising over what might have been. The first emerged on the eve of the 2016 domestic season when Leinster’s defence coach, Kurt McQuilkin, headed back to New Zealand at short notice because his sister was ill. By sheer luck Lancaster used to play with Simon Easterby, Ireland’s forwards coach, whose brother Guy was the Leinster manager. When Lancaster’s name first came up in the Ireland office, the nearest man across the desk was Andy Farrell, previously a member of his England coaching staff.Even now Lancaster sounds immensely grateful: “If this role hadn’t come up, I don’t know how it would have played out. There was certainly nothing else in the pipeline. There was no time for ‘Am I or am I not good enough to be coaching at this level?’ It was a case of: ‘You’re in because we’re at Glasgow on Friday.’”The existence of direct flights from Leeds to Dublin also avoided having to uproot his two children, Sophie and Dan, from their A-level studies. All those dawn airport dashes through the snow to catch his twice-weekly flights have been worth it. At his first team meeting, Lancaster told the players they could win in Europe – “My opening line was: ‘I think we can do great things here’”– and now they are 80 minutes from doing so for the first time since 2012. Their still-improving squad are increasingly the envy of Europe and the players are glowing about Lancaster’s technical input. Among the believers is their tactical kingpin Johnny Sexton, another instrumental figure in his recruitment.“Johnny texted me and said: ‘Let me know what you need me to do to help get it over the line.’ That is pretty powerful coming from a guy who we’d played against five times with England.”Which begs several tantalising questions. Could it be that Lancaster would make a better international coach now than the less experienced model hired by England after the incident-packed 2011 World Cup campaign in New Zealand? Ireland have already drafted in Farrell and, after 2019, there are likely to be a number of vacancies in all sorts of interesting places.Alternatively – “I really enjoy the day-to-day element of club coaching” – could this most approachable and personable of sporting figures may yet conclude he is naturally more suited to club and provincial team preparation? As things stand, it gives him the same match-day buzz without the managerial distractions that restricted the amount of hands-on coaching he did with England. Wherever he goes next, he has promised not to make that same mistake again.Not being the formal number one – with Leo Cullen the Leinster director of rugby – also does not bother him. “I am quite happy to take on responsibility and decision-making if needs be but I don’t have to be the number one. Wayne Smith is a good example. He was coaching New Zealand, then he went to Northampton, then he came back and worked under Graham Henry. I don’t want to give the impression I wouldn’t want to go back and be a number one at some point but it works at the moment for me. As long as I’ve got a strong role that would be fine.”He does admit that watching England from afar can still be tricky, particularly when a Leinster-heavy Ireland beat his former charges at Twickenham in March. “You can’t help but look and see how the team are doing. You are so invested in it.” Lancaster’s team never lost three championship games on the trot or finished fifth but he remains faithful to the players.“England are still a great team. I wouldn’t read too much into the Six Nations, it came down to small margins. I would never not want England to do well, particularly when I know how hard the players worked in 2012-15. What happened in the World Cup hurts them just as much as it hurts me.”Ah, the World Cup. Maybe a Leinster win would alleviate some of the pain that clearly lingers. “Obviously I still look back with huge regret that we didn’t do better. Things didn’t go well for about half an hour of the Wales game and that changed everything.”In a results-based business, the fallout was never going to be pretty. “It’s tough, particularly for my parents, when criticism is coming your way. I would look at other coaches and feel for them because it’s difficult to get back.”All of which makes his family’s presence – minus his daughter who turned 18 this week – in the San Mamés stands all the more special. Despite his protests to the contrary – “It’s more about repaying Leinster than vindication” – one of modern sport’s most heart-warming comeback stories now awaits its conclusion."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/99a43d694ecf6e2e168e00f52358176845b7f906/77_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c136b8e25e2cd9c0f2af21504c53701","title":"nine endorphin boosting ideas to get you outdoors this spring and summer","story":"Time outdoors has a hugely positive impact on our mental health and wellbeing. Whether you fancy paddleboarding around the coast or zipwiring across the treetops, here’s how to unlock a healthier, happier you this spring and summerFrom reducing blood pressure to alleviating symptoms of depression, countless studies have proved that being outdoors and in contact with nature is beneficial for both physical and mental health. In these milder months, there’s no excuse not to be outside as much as possible. Here are nine ideas for inspiration.Ride a waveThe north Cornwall coast, with its big Atlantic seas, is Britain’s premier surf destination, with Fistral beach at Newquay probably the country’s best-known surf beach. But there are great places to learn to surf all around the UK. If you’re after a board experience with a less steep learning curve, stand-up paddleboarding offers the chance to take to the water in an easy-to-learn fashion. As well as the exhilaration of surfing the waves, paddleboarding can be a means of exploring the wonders of Britain’s tranquil inland waterways.Get started: Surfing England (surfingengland.org) has information on surf clubs and learning to surf. The British Stand Up Paddle Association website (bsupa.org.uk) has information on where to learn.See colours in bloomSpring and summer are the best times to explore England’s most glorious gardens. Among the Royal Horticultural Society’s (RHS) stunners is its flagship garden, Wisley in Surrey. Home to one of the world’s largest plant collections, it’s a riot of flowering bulbs and blossoms in spring, with fragrant roses and colourful mixed borders in summer. The RHS also runs summer flower shows around the country, including the world-famous Chelsea flower show. The National Trust is  to more than 200 gardens and landscaped parks, many attached to its historic houses, with Studley Royal water gardens at Fountains Abbey, also a world heritage site, among the best known.Freewheel through forest trailsZip along peaceful country lanes between summer hedgerows, pedal past glowering mountains above Scotland’s Glencoe pass as part of a tour or expedition, race with other cyclists, or even head off-road along forest trails on a mountain bike. Cycling can provide high-adrenaline sport or light, relaxing exercise, but whichever way you ride, getting on a bike gives you an up-close view of the countryside that you’d never get from a car.Get started: Cycling UK (cyclinguk.org) can help you get on the road, with advice on everything from buying a bike to cycling groups and routes.Escape to the countryCity dwellers craving a rural fix should seek out one of the many regional annual outdoor shows, a celebration of farming and rural life, with sheep and cattle competitions, horse and dog shows, sheep-shearing contests and farm machinery displays. These days, though, the events are also packed with family-friendly entertainments, ranging from air displays and carriage-driving races to skateboarding and marching bands. Local producers showcase their food and drink, and makers display arts and crafts.Get started:UK County Shows (ukcountyshows) has countrywide information and links to inidual shows.Swim in scenic surroundingsWhat could be a more perfect summer idyll than plunging into a cool lake or river on a hot, sunny day? Wild swimming – taking a dip in rivers, lakes, streams and waterfalls – has a growing number of fans. Popular spots to swim include Ullswater in the Lake District and lochs throughout Scotland, while rivers in the Brecon Beacons are home to stunning waterfall plunge pools. In the south of England, Pangbourne on the river Thames is one of many popular locations, and there are even urban swims to be had in London’s Serpentine and Highgate ponds.Get started: There’s information on locations throughout the UK and all-important safety tips tips at wildswimming.Soar into the treetopsThere’s a special kind of thrill to hurtling through the treetops suspended on a wire. Locations range from urban parks (such as Heaton Park in Manchester and Battersea Park in London) to mountains and forests. Zip World, with locations in Wales, offers a variety of adventures through forest, over a quarry and even – this one’s for the fitter and more adventurous – underground in caverns. Go Ape has locations throughout England, Scotland and Wales, and a collection of mainly forest-based attractions.Kayak along the waterwaysBritain has thousands of miles of rivers, lakes, reservoirs and canals canoeing (single-ended paddle), or kayaking (double-ended paddle), is a great way to explore them. Assuming you don’t have your own canoe, you’ll need to join a club or go to an activity centre, where staff will generally help new paddlers with an induction session. Sea kayaking is a lot of fun, too, and more experienced paddlers may enjoy canoe polo (just as it sounds) or white-water canoeing. Get started: British Canoeing (britishcanoeing.org.uk) has information on canoe clubs and activity centres around the country, and on canoe hire.Walk this wayWhether it’s a Sunday stroll or a serious hike, there’s no simpler – or cheaper – way to explore Britain’s great outdoors than on foot. The British countryside is laced with public footpaths all you need to get going is a pair of walking boots or sturdy trainers (plus a map and weatherproof gear if you’re going far). Among myriad footpaths, 16 national trails pass through some of the country’s most iconic landscapes. They include the South West Coast Path, with 630 miles of trails snaking around the Dorset, Devon, Cornwall and Somerset coasts, and northern England’s hilly Pennine Way.Get started: National Trails (nationaltrail). In addition, Ramblers (ramblers.org.uk) has suggestions for hiking routes on its website.Combine your love of music with the outdoorsPack your tent and wellington boots and head for one of the country’s iconic music festivals this summer. These days the biggest international names (from Beyoncé to Ed Sheeran) vie to play them: there’s no other way to see so many top artists in a single location. Glastonbury is taking a break in 2018, but there are many others picking up the slack, from Bestival to Latitude, the Isle of Wight festival, V and many more.

A good nosy at their previously unseen personal possessions and artefacts, that’s what. This summer, that’s exactly what London’s V\u0026ampA museum delivers in the much-anticipated Frida Kahlo: Making Her Self Up. The majority of this collection of jewellery, letters, photographs and items from her wardrobe (including hand-painted corsets) was only recently discovered, having been shut away for 50 years since her death. Consider this essential for demystifying the Mexican artist and sartorial icon, and it’s a lot cheaper than going all the way to Mexico. Granted, the exhibition is indoors, but you can combine your visit with a stop-off at the V\u0026ampA’s garden cafe, a hidden oasis in the centre of the museum, where you can sit at one of the courtyard tables or picnic on the lawn.vam.ac.uk from 16 JuneArrange a bouquet of flowersYou don’t have to be embarking on a second career as a florist to appreciate a beautifully arranged bunch of flowers, although a workshop at The Narcissus Flower School in Edinburgh could well send you in that direction. From learning to hand-tie a spring wedding bouquet to perfecting a festival-ready floral crown, this is the place to go this summer for cutting-edge botanical design. The highlight in the programme has to be The Foragers Garden Party workshop, which caters to all al fresco needs, from rustic barbecues to afternoon tea. Bring it on.narcissusflowers 21 June (and various dates)Learn a new craftStep away from the sandy beaches and seafood and head straight to The Studio at Burlingham Hall in Norfolk to get your hands – rather than your toes – dirty this summer. Artist Victoria Hall runs a two-day workshop for beginners in the art of paper marbling at this picturesque country estate. You’ll learn about the history, get familiar with watercolours, and tackle various paper patterns (including curl and comb designs). In fact, you’ll have a range of eclectic designs under your belt by the end. And if you don’t leave feeling like a born-again artist, you’ll certainly have the materials to make some pretty alternative Christmas cards.burlinghamhall 16-17 AugustGo down to the woodsHead to the Latitude festival for late-night poetry, light installations, and the biggest comedy, theatre, and arts line up in its 12-year history. Held in Suffolk’s picturesque Henham Park, Latitude is renowned for its eclectic arts programme, with a bit of yoga and lake swimming thrown in for good measure. This year it’s all about Bridget Christie and Tim Key in the comedy selection, while the Killers and Alt-J are definitely headliners to be reckoned with. But it’s the addition of enigmatic music and fashion icon Solange to the bill – her first time heading up a UK festival – that’ll be a real feast of the senses.latitudefestival 12-15 JulyFill up at a foodie festivalIs your idea of heaven on a hot day hitting up a beer garden?

There are four locations – Higginson Park in Marlow, Royal Victoria Park in Bath, Dunorlan Park in Tunbridge Wells and Knutsford, Cheshire – to choose from. Dishes from Kerridge’s own Michelin-starred Marlow pubs The Hand and Flowers and The Coach will pop up at the four festivals, alongside others from throughout Britain, and there’ll be chef demonstrations and a whole foodie village to shop in.

When it’s warm outside (and even when it’s not) there is no shortage of quirky film events, but Picnic Cinema – run by the arts organisation and charity Eden Arts, in Penrith, Cumbria – pulls out all the stops. You can dress up, bring your own picnic (the clue is in the title), and even sleep over. With music, dancing and surprise entertainment, amid spectacular scenic views, you may even forget you’re there to watch a film.

Not that you’ll have much time to sit with your head in a book at Hay festival Wales, where Margaret Atwood leads a stellar line up of about 800 inspirational, thought-provoking discussions and panels. She’ll speak on The Handmaid’s Tale and beyond, while Philip Pullman, joined by Marina Warner and folklore academic Jack Zipes, promise tales of wonder, magic, and hope. Don’t miss the brilliant Letters Live, which returns for a fifth year.hayfestival 24 May-3 JuneWatch iconic bandsWhen it’s live music you want, settling on which summer festival to go to can be tricky, but this year’s Isle of Wight festival will take that decision out of your hands. It’s a special one, marking 50 years since its inauguration, and as a result, the festival has been appealing for stories from anyone who was there in 1968, watching Jefferson Airplane and T Rex et al.

The US embassy Twitter account – previously in Tel Aviv as @usembassytlv – is now @usembassyjlm.All is set for the inauguration on Monday, an opening charged with symbolism that its organisers anticipate will set off a wave of euphoria across the Jewish state 70 years since it declared independence on 14 May 1948.Hundreds of guests will attend, alongside a White House delegation led by John Sullivan, US deputy secretary of state, and including the much higher-profile Ivanka Trump, and her husband, Jared Kushner.For Israel’s prime minister, the embassy move is seen as one of two gifts from Donald Trump to the country, the other being his exit this week from the Iran nuclear deal that will reimpose sanctions on Benjamin Netanyahu’s arch-enemy.Yet a celebratory atmosphere masks a particularly feverish time for Israel, even, some say, by historical standards.To Israel’s south, the army has been lambasted internationally for its lethal response to Palestinian protests that have not relented for weeks. To the north, and for the first time in decades, the country is facing the possibility of on-off interstate war.Trump’s decision to recognise the holy city as Israel’s capital was made in stark defiance of long-held international consensus that the status of ided Jerusalem should be negotiated with the Palestinians.Senior Palestinian official Nabil Shaath, speaking near the site of the new embassy, said Trump was “siding totally with Israeli annexation and Israeli cleansing of our people from Jerusalem”.As the US president’s daughter attends the pomp, less than 60 miles away, a six-week protest spurred on by anger and desperation at Trump’s embassy decision is expected to culminate in a mass demonstration in Gaza.Next week has added significance for millions of Palestinians, who will mark seven decades since the displacement of hundreds of thousands of people who either fled or were forced from their homes during the war surrounding Israel’s creation.Gaza’s protesters have vowed to break through the perimeter fence despite the presence of Israeli snipers deployed on sandbanks behind it.The Gaza-based leader of Hamas, which rules the enclave, said the rallies would be peaceful but would not be held back. “What’s the problem if hundreds of thousands storm this fence which is not a border of a state?” Yahya Sinwar said, claiming the frontier was not internationally recognised.Israel’s use of live ammunition against unarmed masses has killed dozens of Palestinians, including journalists, and wounded around 1,700, including children shot in the legs. On Friday, Israeli troops killed one protester and wounded 49 others, according to Gaza’s health ministry. The Israeli military said 15,000 Palestinian “rioters” had taken part and thrown “pipe bombs and grenades” towards Israeli troops. No Israeli has been wounded during the six-week movement.In stark contrast to that of the White House, the general international reaction to the Israeli army’s actions has been condemnatory. In a separate move defying global allies, Trump effectively pulled out of the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement on Tuesday, a decision that has shaken an already turbulent Middle East.On Thursday, Israel accused Tehran’s forces of launching a barrage of rockets at its troops in the occupied Golan Heights. Iran did not confirm it had fired but the incident follows reports of multiple unclaimed and surreptitious Israeli strikes on Tehran’s outposts in Syria this year.Saying it was retaliating against the rockets, Israel launched a massive operation on its Arab neighbour – the largest in Syria since the early 70s.The Israel Defence Forces claimed its missiles hit nearly all key Iranian military targets in Syria during dozens of strikes. The operation, nicknamed “house of cards”, was lauded by unnamed military officials in local media as a huge success against its enemies.Ahead of the embassy opening, others have cautioned against jubilation over the US pullout of the Iran deal and the Israeli attack in Syria.“In Israel these days, Benjamin Netanyahu is king and Donald Trump is a god. Adrenaline is flowing through the nation’s veins and testosterone could soon spill over,” wrote Chemi Shalev, the US editor for the left-leaning Israeli newspaper Haaretz.Iran’s foreign ministry said the raids in Syria were launched on “invented pretexts” and that Damascus had every right to defend itself. In a more defiant tone, a senior Iranian cleric close to the leadership, Ahmad Khatami, was quoted on state TV as saying: “We will expand our missile capabilities despite western pressure.”Ben Caspit, a prominent Israeli journalist, described a national mindset of elation in Maariv, one of the country’s oldest daily newspapers, saying if Israel were playing a football game, the score would be “10-0 in our favour”.“The problem is that the final whistle can’t be blown any more,” he wrote. “The dangerous game that we have been drawn into can turn against us at any moment. It has no set or clear rules ... The security establishment knows that this wasn’t even the first half of the game. It was barely the start.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea55484ae896a2fbad9794fab145c5c86f60d34e/0_135_4730_2840/master/4730.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2adf3018c138531d6b02c0de23d07d85","title":"ousted malaysian leader najib razak prevented from leaving country","story":"The former PM was not allowed to take a reported flight to Indonesia – and remains in Malaysia where he could face investigation for alleged corruptionThe ousted Malaysian prime minister, Najib Razak, has been prevented from leaving the country after appearing to attempt to take a flight to Indonesia.The country’s immigration department said in a brief statement on Saturday that Najib and his wife, Rosmah Mansor, have “just been blacklisted from leaving the country”.The statement came after a flight schedule had shown that Najib and his wife were due to take a private jet to Jakarta at 10am from on Saturday morning.But Najib, who faces being investigated by the incoming government for alleged corruption, never appeared and the private jet, owned by Indonesian company Premiair, remained on the tarmac at Subang airport near Kuala Lumpur.Following the announcement of the ban, Najib said he and his family would respect it and stay in the country.“I have been informed that the Malaysian immigration department will not allow my family and me to go overseas,” Najib said in a tweet. “I respect the directive and will remain with my family in the country.”After the reports of his flight emerged on Friday night, dozens of people, accompanied by a large pack of journalists, had descended on the small airport just outside the capital in the early hours to protest his departure. Riot police were stationed outside the gate where people believed Najib would enter.After losing the election this week to the opposition, led by former prime minister Mahathir Mohamad, there had been concerns that Najib would try to flee the country to avoid the chance of prosecution for his role in the 1MDB scandal, which he was accused of covering up while in office. Mahathir has pledged a full independent investigation into the billions of embezzled funds and many believe this will implicate Najib.After his flight schedule was made public on Friday night, Najib tweeted that he was taking a “short break” to spend time with his family and apologised for his “shortcomings and mistakes”.“After over four decades in politics and the recent election campaign, which was regrettably personal and perhaps the most intense in Malaysian history, I will take a short break to spend time with my family whom I have not seen enough of in recent years,” Najib said in a tweet. Najib also tweeted that he hoped the “isive period” in the country’s history would end with unity.“My Barisan Nasional colleagues and I are committed to respecting the will of the people and facilitating a smooth transfer of power. The best interests of Malaysia and its people will always be my first priority and I intend to continue serving them in whatever capacity I can,” he tweeted.“I pray that after this isive period, the country will unite. I apologise for any shortcomings and mistakes, and I thank you, the people, for the opportunity to lead our great nation. It has been the honour of my lifetime to serve you and Malaysia.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3492396.1526080098!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"emma mhic mhath%C3%BAna calls for hse to be dismantled","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEmma Mhic Mhathúna: “Talk to cheap.

Photograph: Collins CourtsThe CervicalCheck controversy continues to rumble, developing new threads on an almost daily basis. Comments from the Taoiseach and Minister for Health suggest they are anticipating further revelations as various inquiries get under way.But the fundamental issue – failure of communication – continues to be central other aspects, including those yet to emerge, will likely be peripheral in comparison.This scandal is primarily about the poor flow of information at a number of levels: a complete absence of information from CervicalCheck to patients who had been screened impaired flow of knowledge between CervicalCheck and gynaecologists and general practitioners an astonishing ignorance of open disclosure policy within the health system at senior levels of CervicalCheck management and, as illustrated by the length of time it took to identify all the women involved, frightening evidence at how disjointed various parts of the Health Service Executive (HSE) has become and how it had such difficulty reconciling basic information within its monolithic structure.One of the most disheartening aspects of the destruction of our public health system is how it repeats the same errors. Whether maternity scandals at Portlaoise and Portiuncula hospitals, delayed cancer investigations leading to the premature death of Susie Long, or in the case of Rebecca O’Malley, a delayed breast cancer diagnosis following the misreading of a biopsy, all share a common thread: poor communication resulting in a failure to share important information with patients in a timely manner.For all its fine quality improvement initiatives and repeated commitments to patient safety, the HSE continues to get the basics horribly wrong. And while we rely on courageous women like Vicky Phelan to stand up to confidentiality clauses in order to reveal the truth in the most tragic circumstances, thousands of Irish people silently suffer HSE ineptitude on a daily basis.Here are just a few recent examples: all are relatively low key in the greater scheme of things but telling in that they reveal how the HSE struggles to deliver a basic, uniform standard of care.An inpatient, admitted and treated for a fractured hip, is referred for a home care package. There is a different form to be filled in depending on the county you live in. The forms differ in complexity, the information required and how they are processed in each locality. In parts of Tipperary, for example, a patient requiring home help must make one application for morning home help hours and a separate one for assistance required in the afternoon. His cousin in east Galway, meanwhile, having got approval for home help, is told that the company contracted to provide a carer in his locality has no available home helps or that there are no resources to cover the cost of his home care. Consistency?On appealing the decision, the patient and their relatives are told they must make a separate application to a senior HSE manager. When they ask can their original application not be passed up the chain of internal command in the HSE, they are told no, it cannot. Information flow?Meanwhile, a woman in her 80s who has finished her acute stroke treatment needs a community occupational therapist to assess her need for aids and appliances and to have her home assessed to facilitate discharge. In Kerry, Limerick and Clare, there is a standard referral form. But Galway, Roscommon and Mayo each have separate forms – laid out differently and requiring significantly different levels of information. Uniform standards?A GP refers a patient to see an ENT surgeon in the nearest acute hospital. The referral letter is returned by a secretary saying there is a four-year waiting list and no further patients are being added. Two simple questions: why were local GPs not informed of this so that they could avoid inappropriate referrals? And why no offer of alternative options from the HSE for the patient caught in the middle?None of this is rocket science. Yet some 13 years after the HSE was established, this is the level of basic organisational inconsistency faced by sick people on a daily basis.We have heard many promises since the CervicalCheck fiasco broke. All are “top down” changes. Some will create even more layers of management. But without “bottom up” change first, they are doomed to fail.So here’s a suggestion: pick either a geographic area or a clinical area (as was done with cancer care).Send in an intervention team from outside the health service with experience in change management and a commitment to structured communication. Take everyday referral pathways, similar to those outlined above, and standardise them. Make communication a simple linear process, with the needs of patients paramount. Include suggestions for improvement from patients and motivated staff (and not just those working in the HSE itself).Three months later, ask patient safety experts from the Department of Health to visit. Give them one simple objective: establish if information is flowing freely from patient to local doctor to specialist and back to the patient again. Where it’s not, say so.

Photograph: ReutersYves Herman Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has defended his lack of contact with the British prime minister Theresa May for the past six weeks, despite the ongoing Brexit crisis and the suspended Belfast institutions.Mr Varadkar said that he and Ms May had each other’s mobile numbers and could contact each other whenever they needed to. “Currently the focus is on negotiations in Brussels and on the various cabinet meetings that are happening in the UK to determine what its position will be on the customs union, or a customs union partnership, and how that position might evolve,” he said.A meeting “is under consideration for next week” if they are both in Sofia, Bulgaria at the same time. But “the most useful conversation is the one which will be had once the British government has decided its position on the new customs arrangement”. Until then “it is very hard to make any particular progress at the moment”.Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin, who raised the issue in the Dáil, believed it was probably the only time in the past quarter of a century that leaders on both sides went so long without speaking, particularly during such a period of crisis.He expressed concern at the lack of communication, saying that the absence of the anti-Brexit majority in the North from any major discussions “causes damage every day”.And he said it was very surprising given the threat posed by an absent Northern Executive, and by the British government’s refusal to establish consultation processes with Dublin over the suspension, that the Taoiseach had had no contact with Ms May.Mr Martin, a former minister for foreign affairs, said the British-Irish intergovernmental conference should have been convened by now and the maximum use of the Belfast Agreement was imperative.“Otherwise, elements of the agreement can fall into abeyance and that ultimately brings the agreement itself into disrepute,” he warned.His call was echoed by Sinn Féin president Mary Lou McDonald who said that while it was “no silver bullet”, a forum was needed to provide a roadmap.Green party Eamon Ryan said the lack of contact for six weeks was “remarkable” and he called on the Taoiseach to engage with the smaller parties including his own colleagues in the North. “Relying on the big two” – the DUP and Sinn Féin – “is not clever at this time”, Mr Ryan said.The Taoiseach said there was a lot of contact at official and political levels. He told Mr Ryan he welcomed forces in the North other than unionist or nationalist but said they had to have regard to parties’ mandate when organising meetings.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3491757.1526041787!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"tweet from tony o brien criticised by politicians","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTony O’Brien is to stand aside from his position on Friday after weeks of controversy over the CervicalCheck programme. Photograph: Cyril ByrneThe A tweet from the director general of the Health Service Executive Tony O’Brien has been strongly criticised by politicians.Mr O’Brien is to stand aside from his position on Friday after weeks of controversy over the CervicalCheck programme.On Friday morning, he tweeted: “When I appear in public - say at a Committee I conduct myself against a simple standard. Would I be happy for my children or my mother to see how I behave? I sometimes look across the room and hope their children will never see and hear how they behave.”This appears to be a reference to his appearance before the Oireachtas Public Accounts committee on Thursday morning, where he faced intense questioning from members.However, Mr MacSharry insisted this was not about Mr O’Brien claiming the director general has failed to realise that. “The taxpayer pays my wages. They also pay Mr O’Brien’s. They have a right to criticise, question us and scrutinise the decisions we make. Mr O’Brien does not seem to get that this is about the women involved and not him.”Sinn Féin TD David Cullinane, who is a member of the committee, rejected the criticism of Mr O’Brien.He said members of the Pac “ask the hard questions without fear or favour” and will continue to do so.The party’s health spokeswoman Louise O’Reilly said she did not believe it was a mature thing for Mr O’Brien to have tweeted.-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"dup leader insists free flow with the republic possible after brexit","story":"  May 6, 2018Arlene Foster described as \u0026lsquoreal leader of the Conservative Party\u0026rsquo by senior British Labour figure   May 10, 2018Party publicly panicking as UK plan for EU customs partnership falls apart "},{"url":null,"title":"national geographic travel photographer year 2018 pictures","story":"The competition continues in the 2018 National Geographic Travel Photographer of the Year contest!

The helicopter will have twin, counter-rotating blades which will power through the thin Martian atmosphere at almost 3,000 rpm – about 10 times the rate of a helicopter on Earth.The helicopter has solar cells to charge its lithium-ion batteries, and a heating mechanism to keep it warm through the cold Martian nights.“The altitude record for a helicopter flying here on Earth is about 40,000 feet. The atmosphere of Mars is only one per cent that of Earth, so when our helicopter is on the Martian surface, it’s already at the Earth equivalent of 100,000 feet up,” said Mimi Aung, Mars Helicopter project manager.“To make it fly at that low atmospheric density, we had to scrutinize everything, make it as light as possible while being as strong and as powerful as it can possibly be.”Controllers on Earth will command the Mars Helicopter, through a system of commands send from the ground, rather than a real-time joystick.The full 30-day flight test campaign will include up to five flights of incrementally farther flight distances, up to a few hundred meters, and longer durations as long as 90 seconds. On its first flight, the helicopter will make a short vertical climb to 10 feet, where it will hover for about 30 seconds.Please review our commenting policyRoyal wedding schedule and timings for

champion, taking their causes and putting them on the world stage with a cheeky comment and a photo op.For once, a week from today, the tables will be turned as Prince Harry invites his personal heroes to his wedding, from the stars of Invictus to the man who taught him how to blindfold a rhino.Guests at the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will include Dave Henson, the former Team GB captain at the Invictus Games whose popcorn pinching toddler daughter stole the show in Toronto, the head of a tiny overlooked Welsh charity and the Botswanan friends so discreet even they do not know which others in their set are going.The Prince and Ms Markle have already emphasised their wish to use the wedding to boost the profile of charities and thank their supporters, inviting young leaders, sick children and lifelong volunteers to watch them from the Windsor Castle grounds and asking for donations instead of gifts.Dave Henson (L) with his wife Hayley and daughter Emily with Prince Harry at the Toronto Invictus GamesBut joining them inside St George’s Chapel and at a glamorous lunch reception hosted by the Queen, mingling with the Royal Family and the cast of Suits, will be the conservationists, sportsmen and charity heads closest to the couple’s hearts.Representing the Invictus Games will be Dave Henson and David Wiseman, former team captains who have helped Prince Harry build the competition for wounded and sick veterans, JJ Chalmers, now a broadcaster who has interviewed the Prince, and CEO Dominic Reid.Jaco Van Gass, who first met Harry at Headley Court after being wounded in Afghanistan in 2009 and has gone on to trek to the North Pole and attempt Everest, will also be there. Jaco Van Gass with Prince Harry in 2014Map Ives, the trailblazing director Rhino Conservation Botswana, will be there to support the Prince, who has regularly joined his team to learn to tag rhinos to help save them, as well as trustee Kai Collins.Martin Colclough, head of recovery for Help for Heroes, has been granted the exclusive invitation, along with Colin Dyer of Wellchild and Catherine Ferrier and Johnny Hornby from Sentebale.If Prince Seeiso of Lesotho, cofounder of Sentabale and brother of the country’s king will be among the high and mighty, the other end of the spectrum is also represented with the head of a tiny, little-known Welsh charity Dolen Cymru, which builds literacy and links with Lesotho. Prince Seeiso and Harry in LesothoSeveral friends said that the top secret guest list had left them with their own small conundrum, nervous to ask mutual friends if they had been invited just in case they had been left out.Others were mulling the “massive headache” of trying to think of a suitable personal present for the man who has everything.One, a fan of Ms Markle’s former television show Suits, was left wondering whether a ban on cameras would extend to the guests’ bus trip to the castle, where they might be able to sneak a selfie with some famous faces.Map Ives said he hoped to see many of Prince Harry’s Botswanan friends in the chapel, adding: “ It’s a compliment to me that he wants me to be there. I want to be with him too.Map Ives with Prince Harry Ives said of his work, which has seen the “strong health young” Prince make himself useful in the physical work to keep rhinos safe: “It’s a constant challenge to all of us. Trying to make the world understand requires somebody better known than me and somebody who can grasp the imagination of the world.“That is important, having somebody like Prince Harry.

The cost of the wedding itself – the food, the Ralph \u0026amp Russo Couture dress etc – will be picked by the Royal Family.But the security costs have been estimated at more than £20m. And that will be borne by the public purse.Yet the wedding might also attract additional tourists from abroad, whose expenditure will help defray some of those public costs.Some have even claimed that sales of memorabilia will boost the overall economy.Which leaves us with the perennial questions: How much money do we spend on the British monarchy? How much of an asset is it to the economy? Is the Royal Family really “worth it”?How much does the Royal Family cost the taxpayer?Direct funding to meet the monarchy’s official expenditure is now through something called the “Sovereign Grant”.This replaced the old Civil List and grants-in-aid from government departments in 2012 and is supposed to be reviewed every five years.In 2016-17 the Sovereign Grant was £42.8m, rising to £76m in 2017-18, with the increase difference earmarked for refurbishing Buckingham Palace.Royalists often point out that these costs represent only around £1 a year to every person in the UK.However, this does not include the security costs of looking after the family.One republican pressure group has estimated that these add up to £100m a year and help push the actual annual public cost of the monarchy closer to £350m.So the royals spend that money how they want?No, that’s the funding of their official duties – opening buildings, chairing charities, hosting garden parties, travelling the country and abroad etc.The Queen, Prince Charles and other members of the Royal Family have private incomes too from their private landed estates and financial assets.A sum of money called “The Privy Purse” goes to the Queen as revenue from a landed estate called the Duchy of Lancaster. This was £19.1m in 2016-17.Do the royals pay tax?The Queen has voluntarily paid income and capital gains tax since 1992 on her private income and the revenues not used to finance her official work.Prince Charles has also voluntarily paid income tax on his income from another landed estate, the Duchy of Cornwall, since 1993.In 2016-17 that estate yielded him revenue of £22.5m, on which he paid tax of £4.76m.But the situation is complicated.The majority of Prince Charles’ official duties are financed from the Duchy’s income. This income also covers the costs of the official duties of Camilla, William and Kate and Harry.All this expenditure offsets Charles’ tax liability. And all the “working royals” in Charles’ direct family also get some revenues from the Sovereign Grant too.Meanwhile, some of the Queen’s Privy Purse is also used to fund her official duties, which means she doesn’t pay tax on that element of her income.And what financial benefits do the royals bring?VisitBritain reckons that tourism linked to royal residences such as Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle adds up to 2.7 million visitors a year.And a consultancy called Brand Finance estimated in 2017 that the monarchy’s annual contribution to the UK economy to be around £1.8bn a year, drawing in an additional £550m of tourism revenues a year, and an increase in trade, from the Royal Family acting as ambassadors, supposedly worth £150m a year.That might sound impressive – and it’s certainly more than the higher estimates of the Royal Family’s costs to the public purse – but it’s important to put those numbers in context.Overseas visitors are estimated to have spent £22.5bn in the UK in 2016. And total UK exports summed to £543bn. Viewed from that perspective, the additional royal-related revenues start to look somewhat trivial.Moreover, we should treat even estimates of economic activity linked to the royals with a large dash of scepticism.The only way to reach these numbers is to estimate the counterfactual – what would have happened to UK tourism or trade if the Royal Family didn’t exist? Or if the official Royal Family was significantly smaller and less expensive to run?That’s not easily done. Would foreigners really be less likely to visit the UK’s historic palaces if they were no longer lived in, from time to time, by the Queen, or Prince Charles? Would the monarchy be less of a tourist draw if the likes of lesser working royals such as Princess Alexandra and the Duchess of Kent were no longer funded by the Sovereign Grant?The economic boost from visits and festivities related to royal celebrations should certainly be treated with caution given these can displace economic activity as well as create it.This seems to have happened around Prince William’s wedding in 2011, when many UK residents appear to have left the country. Royalists might make the historic argument that the monarchy brings political stability to the UK, which has a high value to the economy. But, again, this is difficult to put a price on. Especially when the appropriate counterfactual is not anarchy, but a stable republic like France or Germany.In the end, the question of whether the Royal Family is worth it, or not, is probably less a financial question than a political, moral and aesthetic one.Code of ConductInstall our AppsWe use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

The series follows Indian guru Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, also known as Osho, and the free-love community which built up around him in Oregon in the 1980s.It’s perhaps the archetypal image of the cult we’ve come to recognise: the followers of Rajneesh, who died in 1990, dressed in orange their leader was a charismatic Indian guru (who relocated to the US after the Indian government frowned upon his activities) the disciples gave huge amounts of cash to their figurehead, lost contact with their families.But cults don’t have to follow the pattern of Rajneeshpuram, as the Oregon ranch was renamed, or the bloodbaths at Jonestown or Waco, where David Koresh’s sect the Branch Davidians was raided by the FBI in 1993. More often than not, they are more mundane than that… but no less damaging.Rajneesh, also known as Osho, with his ‘Orange People’ followers (Netflix)Katy Morgan-Davies last month published a book about her experiences living in Brixton with the cult leader – and her father – Aravindan Balakrishnan, who was jailed on charges of rape and imprisonment in 2015. Morgan-Davies managed to flee the cult in 2013 after 30 years – her entire life.Cults are back in the news again, but for Ian Haworth they never went away. As the head of the UK-based Cult Information Centre, he spends his life collating information on cults, offering advice and help to those who have escaped – or wish to – and campaigns for stricter legislation to control the reach and influence of these malign groups.“I’ve dealt with more than 1,000 different cults,” says Haworth. “That includes the Rajneesh group. The Netflix documentary series has generated a lot of interest internationally, which can’t be a bad thing.”Katy Morgan-Davies, 33, formerly known as Rosie Davies, who was kept as a prisoner by her father Aravindan Balakrishnan (PA)That interest comes in peaks and troughs, naturally, with particular focus at the moment thanks to Wild Wild Country and Morgan-Davies’ memoir. Haworth says: “I suppose the biggest peak we’ve had began on 1 January 1999, when there was a huge amount of cult activity related to the millennium, when all kinds of things were promised or predicted. Of course, mathematically, the millennium ended at the end of the year 2000, not the end of 1999, but cult leaders don’t really care about such things. They care about money, and controlling people, and power.”Born in Lancashire, the son of a farmer, Haworth emigrated to Canada in 1972 while in his twenties. By 1978 he was working as a communications consultant for a large company, and had never given a thought to cults. Aged 31, he happened to be stopped by a woman with a clipboard in a Toronto street.After fleeing a cult in 1978, Ian Haworth has dedicated his life to helping others in the same situation (Cult Information Centre)“She was very attractive and I was very single,” remembers Haworth. “When she asked me if I had time to answer a few questions for what I thought was market research, I said yes.”But after only half a dozen questions, the tone of the exchange altered. The woman told Haworth that his answers indicated he’d fit in very well with a group she was involved with, and that it would enable him to give something back to society rather than just taking. A meeting was taking place the following week and Haworth was invited along.“I turned up and there were about a hundred people there,” he says. “A woman was talking about her addiction to alcohol and drugs, and how this group had helped her. I was planning to sneak away at the end, because I’d been brought up to be polite and didn’t want to just walk out. Then they brought out drinks and cakes, and as I’d paid $2 (£1.50) to attend I decided I might as well get my money’s worth before leaving.”The world of Cults: in picturesThe world of Cults: in picturesAravindan Balakrishnan, known as ‘Comrade Bala’ within the women-only collective he founded 40 years ago, carried out a brutal campaign of sexual degradation against the women over several decades. In this picture, he stands with some of his cult followers including his daughter. Rexwords by Hardeep Matharu Balakrishnan brainwashed the cult into thinking he had God-like powers and that he could read their minds, as a means of subjecting them to years of abuse.politan Policewords by Hardeep Matharu Katy Morgan-Davies, 33, formerly known as Rosie Davies, who was kept as a prisoner by her father Aravindan Balakrishnan. Revealing her real identity, Miss Morgan-Davies said that waiving her anonymity was an important step – “to retrieve the identity the cult tried to steal from me”.\u0026#13PAwords by Hardeep Matharu Evidence picture showing the bedroom of the imprisoned daughter of Aravindan Balakrishnan. She was banned from leaving the house unaccompanied and routinely psychologically and physically abused.\u0026#13Rexwords by Hardeep Matharu Boarded up windows in Peckford Place, Brixton, south London. Aravindan Balakrishnan was jailed for 23 years in 2016. To keep his devotees in check, Balakrishnan invented \u0027Jackie\u0027, which he said could kill or trigger earthquakes if anyone went against his will. He claimed that a challenge to his leadership resulted in the 1986 space shuttle disaster and Jackie, an invisible war machine, was responsible for the election of Jeremy Corbyn as Labour party leader. PAwords by Hardeep Matharu Jim Jones, founder of the Peoples Temple sect in Jonestown, north Guyana, in 1978. Believers of the Peoples Temple of the Disciples of Christ followed Reverend Jones to Guyana in the Seventies, hoping to create a utopia in the jungle. Jonestown was envisaged as a “rainbow family” of all ages and races, the preacher had promised them: “Divine principles. Total equality. A society where people own all things in common, where there is no rich or poor, where there are no races.” APwords by Adam LusherReverend Jones wanted to create a glorious sacrifice, a defiant act of “revolutionary suicide” that would echo through history. Some disciples willingly colluded, cheering as he exhorted them to kill themselves and their children. But the bodies found with bent needles in their arms testified to the fact that some refused and were forcibly injected. Rexwords by Adam LusherWhen they finally counted the bodies after what would become known as the Jonestown massacre of 18 November 1978, the total came to 918, of whom 304 were children. They had been persuaded to “drink the Kool-Aid”, Flavor Aid, used to mask the bitter taste of cyanide, mixed with a dash of Valium.APwords by Adam LusherMaude Julien, now 60, was forced to hold onto an electric fence for without showing feeling as a child. The ritual was considered to be a test of her willpower by her father, who wanted to make her “superhuman”.\u0026#13Indian guru Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, also known as Osho, and the free-love community which was built up around him in Oregon in the 1980s. Rajneesh, who died in 1990, was a charismatic Indian guru (who relocated to the US after the Indian government frowned upon his activities). His disciples gave huge amounts of cash to their figurehead and lost contact with their families.During a break he went into the corridor for a cigarette, and that’s when the cult members pounced. Haworth had seen his doctor not long before and been told if he carried on smoking like he did he’d be lucky to see 40. The group told him that they would absolutely guarantee he would stop smoking if he attended a further course for $220. He’d already looked into smoking-cessation courses that were of comparable cost, so decided he’d give this one a go.“The course took place in September, 1978,” says Haworth. “By the end of the course I’d given notice at my job, promised to dedicate my life to the cult, and handed over all my savings, which amounted to about $1,500.”Jonestown commune mass suicide in 1978 (AP)Even now, Haworth cannot identify the tipping point that turned him from someone who’d turned up for a meeting at the behest of an attractive woman to someone who gave himself, body and soul, to a cult, other than mid-way through the course when he stopped smoking. “I suppose that was the moment I went over to them – they had done what they said they would do.”Cults often thrive on feeding into people’s desires. Sometimes they will promise success, artistic or creative talent, fulfil a desire in their targets to effect social change or, as with Haworth, to “give something back” to the world. They will promise freedom from addictions or improved physical or mental health. They’re what Haworth calls therapy cults, as opposed to the religious cults that offer more spiritual promises.If you’re born into a cult you don’t have that ‘Real Ian’ vs ‘Cult Ian’ internal battle that I had. You emerge from that and the first question is… who am I? It’s an incredibly difficult and delicate situationOver the next month, Haworth tried to recruit his friends and even neighbours to the group. They were appalled at the change in him, but, he says, “I thought they were wrong, I knew they weren’t part of the elite, like I was.”It was an almost textbook recruitment, and Haworth firmly believes he would have been lost to everyone who knew him but for one error on the part of the cult. “Most cults programme their members against the media very early on. These people didn’t do that,” he says. And that was what saved him.A neighbour gave him a copy of the Toronto Star which had featured a front-page exposé of the group Haworth was involved in, written by the investigative reporter Sidney Katz. Haworth read the piece and contacted Katz immediately to verify his facts. He then, as he describes it, “fell apart at the seams”. Having seen Katz’s research and evidence first hand, at the invitation of the journalist, Haworth angrily confronted the cult’s leaders, and they effectively banished him. He was finally free of them.“That was in October,” he says. “Then, in the November, everything came out about the Jonestown cult. And I knew that could have been me. It took me 11 months to fully recover and get back to myself.”NXIVM (which calls itself a ‘multi-level marketing organisation’) member Allison Mack leaving US District Court after her bail hearing in Brooklyn (Getty)It took that long for the nagging whispers of “Cult Ian”, as Haworth describes the person he was when he was with the group, to be finally silenced, and for “Real Ian” to reassert himself. And good sense would dictate that was the point he turned his back on cults forever and got on with his life.“I come from a farming background in Lancashire,” says Haworth. “People used to say, ‘If there’s summat up, then tha’ does summat about it’. So I did summat about it.”Sidney Katz put Haworth in touch with a TV producer called Peter Scott and together they set up what was first called the Council for Mind Abuse, and which later metamorphosed into the Cult Information Centre in 1987, now run as a charity.I’ve dealt with more than 1,000 different cults. That includes the Rajneesh group. The Netflix documentary series has generated a lot of interest internationally, which can’t be a bad thingHaworth and Scott concentrated on the group he had been involved with, even handing out flyers to a party of new recruits flown into Canada, exhorting them to go back to the airport. Faced with Haworth’s evidence, many of them did. Eventually, the resistance proved too much for the group. “Toronto wasn’t big enough for the both of us,” he smiles. “They got out.”Haworth doesn’t know where they are now, or if they still exist. Cults change their names often, to keep one step ahead of the media or inquisitive minds, and to muddy the paper trail they leave behind. Besides, he soon had more than enough on his plate as more and more people began to get in touch, especially after he had relocated back to the UK.One of the Cult Information Centre’s primary roles is working with ex-cult members. He likens the trauma that recovering cult followers go through to PTSD, and says systems to deal with and help them are variable, if present at all.He would also like to see stronger laws to deal with cults there’s no specific legislation surrounding them, and it’s only when cult leaders are discovered to have committed actual crimes, such as Aravindan Balakrishnan in 2015, that the law can act.Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh surrounded by devotees (Netflix)The Aravindan Balakrishnan case, and the revelations of Katy Morgan-Davies in her new book, add an extra dimension to Haworth’s work. It’s one thing to try to help cult members who have managed to break free return to their old, pre-cult lives, but what of those born into cults?“If you’re born into a cult you don’t have that ‘Real Ian’ vs ‘Cult Ian’ internal battle that I had,” says Haworth. “You emerge from that and the first question is… who am I? It’s an incredibly difficult and delicate situation.”And don’t think it is only stupid people who would fall for a cult. Experts say that cults are most likely to be attractive to intelligent, well-educated people… they have flexible minds can consider and be seduced by the alternative lifestyles offered by cults.Documentary about alleged sex cult NXIVM being producedSmallville actor allegedly tried to recruit Emma Watson to ‘sex cult’Waco: what really happened when David Koresh’s cult faced the FBI?From Jonestown in the Seventies to Rajneeshpuram in the 1980s to Brixton in the 2000s: cults endure, and spring up all across the world. Nothing about modern life and its complexities has inured us against the attractions of a charismatic guru or cult leader.“They start off wanting the usual things,” says Haworth. “Money, sex, power over people. Then, after perhaps about 10 years, they start to believe the things they say, they maybe start to believe they are gods.”And as long as the false gods continue to prey on the innocent, Ian Haworth will continue his 40-years-and-counting battle against the scourge of the cults.For more information on Haworth’s work at the Cult Information Centre go to cultinformation.org.ukor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Communism may have formally collapsed with the downfall of the Soviet Union, yet it has not been extinguished.The world’s most populous state and rising superpower, China, is officially communist, albeit nominally. And socialist ideas remain prevalent throughout the world. The resurgence of socialism could be seen in the Chavismo new left wave of Latin American politics (admittedly now in the process of being rolled back). In the US, self-proclaimed socialist senator Bernie Sanders could well have been as unlikely an occupant of the Oval office as Donald Trump – if the Democratic National Committee had not conspired against him.In the UK, unapologetic socialist Jeremy Corbyn  swept to the leadership of Her Majesty’s opposition, appointed Trotskyist John McDonnell as shadow chancellor (McDonnell recently told the Financial Times that their aims for Britain are socialist), pronounced socialism as no longer a dirty word to a delirious conference, before garnering 40 per cent of the vote in the general election. In France, Jean Luc Mélenchon performed respectably in the first round of the French elections, commanding nearly 20 per cent of the vote. In Greece, the left-wing Syriza government remains in power – even though its manifesto has been crushed by international finance capital.

Socialism does not carry historical baggage for a younger generation left behind by the iniquities of capitalism. A Harvard study found that a majority of millennials reject capitalism and a third are in favour of socialism. This is what might be called the revenge of Marx the rehabilitation of one of the world’s historical philosophers. Marx inverted Hegelian doctrine into dialectical materialism, affirming that it was material relations that were responsible for consciousness and social relations  –  not the other way round. In 2011, back when it was still unfashionable to confess to being Marxist, Oxford University literary theorist Professor Terry Eagleton boldly decreed that the bearded prophet had been right after all. Eagleton is no longer alone.A slew of books herald the end of capitalism, in the words of economic sociologist Wolfgang Streeck, and announce that we are entering the epoch of Postcapitalism, according to the gospel of journalist and author Paul Mason. The most dangerous philosopher in the West, Slavoj Zizek,  according to The New Republic magazine ,  is communist one of his recent tomes, Living in the End Times, conjures up the apocalyptic sense of the death throes of capitalism.Of course, it wasn’t meant to be like this. Marx’s ideas had apparently been discredited with the collapse of communism and consigned to Trotsky’s dustbin of history. Hadn’t history proven that communism was not a historical inevitability? Then came the 2008 financial crash and the demise of political economist Francis Fukuyama’s ‘end of history’. A decade of austerity was the death knell for the ideological vacuum. The fall-out has seen a polarisation between authoritarian nationalism and progressivism between dystopia and NOT dystopia, if you like.Neoliberalism​  always presented itself as depoliticised, in that the free market is akin to an all-enveloping atmosphere and as irresistible as a force of nature. Its allocation of resources and outcomes supposedly only required mere supervision through technocratic managerialism. In reality, it could not have been more ideological, operating through the corporate capture of the state and hollowing out of the institutions of civic society. Global capitalism appeared to be indomitable and impregnable, in so far as it was the hegemonic system. Yet at the same time, the delayed reaction of a series of political earthquakes, in the form of the Arab Spring and a wave of authoritarian populism, has exposed its vulnerabilities. Even if these events have not challenged the fundamental basis of the system, its neoliberal globalisation variant is under attack.Yanis Varoufakis was at the forefront of Greece’s radical left coalition (Getty)Mao Zedong’s description of capitalism as a paper tiger seems as pertinent as ever. Marxism bequeathed a rich legacy of thinkers, ranging from Lenin and Trotsky to the Frankfurt school, as well as the likes of Antonio Gramsci, Fredric Jameson and Alain Badiou. It was once unthinkable to break with Marxist orthodoxy on the left. Until, as American Marxist Marshall Berman relates in his modern classic All that is Solid Melts into Air (taking its cue from the famous phrase in the Communist Manifesto), a group of disaffected French post-structuralists and postmodernists, namely Michel Foucault, Jacques Derrida and Roland Barthes, did just that. Disillusioned by the defeat of May 1968, when an uprising against De Gaulle resulted in his party emerging even stronger than before, they broke ranks.Raoul Peck: I Am Not Your Negro director on his film about Karl MarxPub where Marx and Engels discussed communist theory shuts downKarl Marx is \u0027back in fashion,\u0027 says shadow chancellor John McDonnellIs Jeremy Corbyn, in the words of his favourite philosopher Karl Marx,\u0027We can learn a great deal from Marx\u0027, says Jeremy CorbynIn the intervening decades, the battles of identity politics have been significant but they have also been hampered by the lack of a structural, systemic understanding of how capitalism operates. Where resistance has mirrored the fragmented, atomised, hyper-inidualism of neoliberalism then it has often been doomed to failure. All of which is very much bound up with the Cold War victory of the US empire. The CIA saw its chance, according to a recently declassified research paper. The agency read French postmodern theory, concluding that its questioning of the objective basis of reality could be used to undermine the Marxist doctrine of historical and teleological inevitability. Millions of dollars were pumped into front organisations such as magazines, publishing houses and favoured academics, in order to push postmodern ideas and to create a centre left, thus demarcating the outer boundary of respectable ideas – anything beyond which could be denounced as dangerous and radical lunacy. After all, the strategy of ide and rule has generally been the preferred one of the ruling class.Karl Marx: social, political and economic theorist in picturesKarl Marx: social, political and economic theorist in picturesGerman social, political and economic theorist Karl Marx.

The statues, created by artist Ottmar Hoerl, are part of an exhibition at the Museum Simeonstift Trier that were created to commemorate the 130th anniversary of the death of Marx in 1883. Marx, who was born in Trier, is the author of The Communist Manifesto, and his ideas on the relationship between labour, industry and capital created the ideological foundation for socialist and communist movements across the globe. Marx was familiar with the methods of the ruling class. He was often on the run from European authorities, eventually finding refuge in the relative tolerance of London where he ided up his time between his smoke-filled home (Soho then later Kentish town), the British Library and watering holes. His rebellious life  –  immersed in the struggles of the 19th century, from the 1848 revolutions to the Paris commune  –  lent itself, naturally, to the counterculture of the late 20th century. And now to the glamour of the big screen. A new Marx biopic – The Young Karl Marx   from I Am Not Your Negro director Raoul Peck  –  has been released. Marx’s starting point, outlined in his 1844 letter For A Ruthless Criticism of Everything Existing to fellow philosopher Arnold Ruge, is a philosophical tabula rasa comparable to a Cartesian wiping of the slate clean. This position of ‘Kritik’, adopted by the young Hegelians, gradually evolved into praxis for Marx. Hence, in Theses on Feuerbach (1888), Marx states “the philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways the point, however, is to change it”.The Communist Manifesto itself was not merely a political and economic tract. It is a call to arms, as well as a work of canonical sublimity and literary fecundity by turns poetic, inspired and visionary. Author and journalist Francis Wheen’s biography describes the Damascene moment at which Marx anoints the word ‘proletariat’. It descends on to the page like a thunderclap across the landscape, presaging the revolutions to come of the 20th century. In the wide-ranging debate Die Judenfrage, or The Jewish Question, Marx posits that the liberal definition of freedom is limited. The motto of ‘Liberté, Egalité, Fratérnité’ of the French revolution is just that  –  a good slogan. To take one example, equality does not relate to power or wealth but merely denotes equality before the law.Marx formulates that consciousness is generated by the mode of production, in a classic inversion of the Hegelian system. He defined alienation as the quintessential state of mind and being under capitalism, corresponding to the economic relations of commodification, exploitation and oppression. It is a state of mind that is little understood by the billions who experience it daily. Thus, bourgeois society is predicated on economic inidualism, private ownership and self-interest. The relations between iniduals, including intimate relations, are thus egoistical. Pure self-interest becomes the prime driver of not just economic processes but all relations. Under capitalism, every entity, no matter how sacred, can be transformed, exploited and sold for profit. This is what Marx meant by the intrinsic process of commodification. And it is this limitless commodification which extends into every sphere, including sex, the body and relationships.Lenin (left) and Trotsky were two of the 20th century’s greatest revolutionaries inspired by Marxism (Getty)Online pornography, social media  and dating apps are merely the latest extrapolations of this relentless commodification. Furthermore, social roles and relations are engendered by historical modes of production. Thus, the agrarian, feudal world corresponds to the social strata of monarchy aristocracy and the church dominating and exploiting the peasantry. Similarly, the industrial, urbanised world corresponds to the social structure of the bourgeoisie exploiting the proletariat. In a memorably thunderous passage in The Communist Manifesto, Marx extrapolates this connection between social and economic relations to define free trade: “It has resolved personal worth into exchange value, and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms, has set up that single, unconscionable freedom  –  Free Trade. In one word, for exploitation, veiled by religious and political illusions, it has substituted naked, shameless, direct, brutal exploitation.”Marx outlined the history of mankind as the history of class struggle in which the classes are opposed in a dialectical paradigm. Thus, we move from antiquity with the duality of slave owner and slaves to the feudal age of lord and serf to the capitalist age of the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. It is these same unsustainable contradictions that Marx later proposes will bury capitalism, when the burgeoning proletariat become the ‘gravediggers’ of the bourgeoisie. This ‘final’ stage will usher in communism, completely transforming and reconfiguring the previous relations into a classless society. Marx outlines that communism, in abolishing private property, also abolishes alienation and wage bondage, leading to worker emancipation and, by extension, universal emancipation. Nevertheless, Marx subscribes to the enlightenment belief in the rationality and logic of mankind to create a narrative of progress. The bourgeois capitalist system is perceived as a necessary step in this progression, enabling the transition from a feudal, agrarian society into an urban, industrialised one. Thus, the bourgeoisie is portrayed as having played a revolutionary role in transforming the world. In its propensity for upheaval and turmoil, capitalism never ceases to alter the world.A monument to Karl Marx in the German city Chemnitz, formerly Karl-Marx-Stadt (Getty)The dialectical materialist analysis of the history of class struggle played out in the contradictions of Marx’s own life. Whether in his marriage to the aristocratic Jenny Von Westphalen, or his friendship with industrialist Friedrich Engels, which enabled the genius of Marx and offset the penury of his journalism and political activities. Some of the most switched-on uber capitalists and masters of the universe concede that Marx’s basic analysis of capitalism has never been improved upon. Trump billionaire backer and donor Peter Thiel states that the breakdown of the status quo points either towards libertarianism or Marxism. Billionaire investor Warren Buffett  infamously once said: “There’s class warfare, all right, but it’s my class, the rich class, that’s making war, and we’re winning.”The Marxist critique of capitalism hinges on its innate tendency towards concentration and centralisation of wealth. In Capital Volume 1, Marx fleshes out the M-C-M circuit (in which M is money and C is commodities). This circuit guarantees the expansion of capital, providing the economic basis of capitalism as a mechanism for limitless capital accumulation. The resulting crises of overproduction and capital accumulation are resolved through the enforced destruction of productive forces, the conquest of new markets and more thorough exploitation paving the way for more extensive and destructive crises. Fracking might be viewed as the ultimate metaphor for this process, whilst Uber is emblematic of the same hyper-exploitation.French economist Thomas Piketty’s work, updating the original title to Capital in the Twenty-First Century, using a large amount of historical data, has further corroborated Marx’s theories on the concentration of wealth. Unsurprisingly, several decades of neoliberalism have been the greatest testament to how a deregulated capitalism, red in tooth and claw, siphons wealth to the top 1 per cent or even 0.1 per cent. Recent figures show that the wealthiest eight billionaires in the world (whom you could fit into a people carrier) have as much wealth as the bottom half of the global population, or some 3. 5 billion people. Astonishingly, the equivalent figure was the 62 wealthiest billionaires in 2016. Back in 2010 it was more than 300. This is how rapidly wealth is being sucked up to the top  – this may be termed the vacuum-up effect as opposed to the myth of trickle-down economics.Stefan Konarske, left, as Friedrich Engels and August Diehl as Karl Marx in ‘The Young Karl Marx’ (Rex)Whilst Victorian capitalism was dominated by small-to-medium-sized companies, the middle decades of the 20th century witnessed a shift to statist capitalism. In effect, the Soviet Union and the People’s Republic of China  represented variations on this theme. Since then the age of globalisation has been ushered in with multinational corporations straddling the globe – many of them larger than the states they operate in. The movement of vast pools of capital on a global scale is historically unmatched. Mega mergers seem to be rarely out of the headlines. In other words, the centralisation Marx predicted 150 years ago is panning out.There is a one-way trend towards the control of capital by an ever smaller number of players. Neoliberal doctrine emphasises the virtues of competition. Yet the reality of deregulated free markets, most evidently in financial services, has been monopoly, cartels, collusion and rigging. This is evidenced by the big four dominance in every sector from banking, accountancy, magic circle law firms, to high street supermarkets, energy companies and privatised utilities. The contradictions of the system have now attained a new level of absurdity.Capitalists presently invest in existing money, be it financial instruments, housing or debt, in order to make profit. In fact, this financialisation of the economy has superseded the traditional profit-making processes of manufacturing. Unlike manufacturing, this financialisation does not create value. Instead it creates asset bubbles of financial and housing speculation, which eventually burst, as happened on a seismic scale in the 2008 crash. Since the 1970s there have been a series of escalating market crises  – yet even this volatility is profitable for hedge funds.Civil unrest in France in 1968 was described as a social revolution against capitialism (Getty)So if late capitalism is economically, socially and ecologically unsustainable, not to mention bankrupt, then whither to from here? One of the obtuse criticisms of Marx has been the lack of a blueprint, despite the fact that a participatory, truly democratic society would need to emerge organically rather than following a roadmap. Marx posited revolution as “the driving force of history”. The overthrow of the existing state and the dissolution of property would lead to liberation extending to the dissolution of the bourgeois conceptions of family, marriage and all nation states. This liberation from national barriers would then bring everyone into connection with the production of the whole world for the pleasure of their consumption.Under communism, Marx daintily describes how one would be able to hunt in the morning, fish in the afternoon, rear cattle in the evening and criticise after dinner (naturally). Communism would appear to truly represent the end of the history, or at least the end of history, as class struggle :  “Communism is the riddle of history solved and it knows itself to be this solution.” Marx formulates that human emancipation can only be achieved by going beyond the bourgeois framework material emancipation translates into spiritual and sensuous emancipation. Only the resolution of the material modes of production, beyond the paradigm of economic inidualism, private property and self-interest, can liberate consciousness and revolutionise social relations  –  such that there is the capacity, the capability and propensity for free behaviour and genuine ties between iniduals based on love, warmth and affection, rather than purely calculating and cold self-interest.The exultant victory lap of all-singing, all-dancing capitalism has been remarkably brief the unipolar moment of American triumphalism short-lived. Only recently, US defence secretary Jim Mattis  announced that the era of great power politics has returned. Undoubtedly, a set of progressive ideas is coalescing amongst the new left  –  a green economy, public and democratic control of the economy, full automation. This 21st century manifesto is embodied in such books as Inventing the Future. The critical question remains of the vehicle necessary to bring about this transition.There is no doubt that 21st-century global capitalism is far more sophisticated and resilient than that of pre-revolutionary Tsarist Russia. The transition of capitalism to an alternative political and economic system will likely play out over a protracted period, even if it is catalysed by revolution. Much in the same way that feudalism evolved into capitalism through the dual industrial (economic) and French revolutions (political), in which the bourgeoisie superseded the aristocratic order preceded by the 17th-century English civil war.Or to leave the last word to Marx: “No social order is ever destroyed before all the productive forces for which it is sufficient have been developed, and new superior relations of production never replace older ones before the material conditions for their existence have matured within the framework of the old society.”Youssef El-Gingihy is the author of ‘How to Dismantle the NHS in 10 Easy Steps’, published by Zero booksor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

They did so this year with added piquancy because it was the 50th anniversary of the famous “Mai 68” when, in the Latin Quarter of Paris, the Left Bank, the whole month was devoted to riotous assembly led by students. In contemplating these events, I recall Wordsworth’s often quoted phrase: “Bliss it was in that dawn to be alive” – unless, of course, you were struck by a cobblestone hurled by a student demonstrator or soaked and knocked off balance by a police water cannon.Presumably those who were demonstrating in Paris last Tuesday have now resumed their normal lives. The point about May 1968, however, is that they didn’t go back to college or to work the next day, they carried on, some of them for the whole month. Why was that? After all, economic growth had been unusually strong, the country was calm, both politically and socially, inflation was weak, living standards had been rising and there was little unemployment.Was it in a way a very 1960s thing? That question is prompted by a French historian of the period, Éric Alary, who observes that “May 68 is seen as a period when audacious moves seemed possible and during which society profoundly changed”. For that is an accurate description of the nature of the 1960s, whether in Western Europe or in North America.At the same time, there was a big rise in the sheer number of young people as a result of an increase in the birth rate in the closing stages of the Second World War and for some years afterwards. Thus, in France, the under-20 cohort rose from 30.7 per cent of the population in 1954 to 33.8 per cent in 1968. At the same time in France (1967), the school leaving age was raised from 14 to 16.  Two men take evasive action during a Paris street riot on 30 May (Getty)This required a massive expansion of teaching staff and building. As a result, students often found themselves being taught by hastily trained teachers in hastily built class rooms. In France, as in Britain, this was followed by a big expansion of the university sector. There was inevitably something ramshackle about it all, and students noticed. Yet the command structures of educational establishments remained unchanged. Nonetheless, universities are never just academic establishments full stop. For their campuses and their indoor and outdoor spaces lend themselves to meetings and debates and even to organising mini demonstrations. The intellectual gods of these 1960s students were Marx, Freud and Sartre, the French existentialist philosopher. In a famous passage, Sartre wrote that “God does not exist, and as a result man is forlorn, because neither within himself nor without does he find anything to cling to”. This struck home. For as Bob Dylan sang in 1965 – “How does it feelHow does it feelTo be on your ownWith no direction homeLike a complete unknownLike a rolling stone?”One had either to start things on one’s own without adult backing, or not at all. This was an unprecedented and intoxicating freedom. As the French student leader Dany Cohn-Bendit told the Paris demonstrators in May 1968: “There are no marshals and leaders today. Nobody is responsible for you. You are responsible for yourselves.”In fact, as is the way of things, Mai 68 began not in central Paris, but in Nanterre, a suburb seven miles to the northwest, and not in May but on 22 March. The construction of the university of Nanterre campus in a bleak shanty town had begun in 1962. In the spring of 1968 it was still not finished. The building were exceedingly functional and contained some 12,000 students. They were particularly shocked to find themselves living and doing their studies in what was in effect a building site. They demanded, too, the right to circulate freely between the residences of males and female students, still forbidden in what one might call pre-1960s style. There was a lot of justified discontent.Daniel Cohn-Bendit  was known as ‘Dany le Rouge’ because of his politics as well as the colour of his hair (Getty)Some 150 students, including far-left groups together with a small number of poets and musicians, occupied a building. The police surrounded it. After publication of the students’ wishes, they left the building without any trouble. But then they took their protest movement to the Sorbonne in the very middle of the Latin Quarter. That was how Mai 68 started.In a drastic action, the authorities shut down the University of Nanterre on 2 May. The students who had decamped to the Sorbonne were bound to think that this was a hostile act, an outbreak of war between the university authorities and the student body. It had been natural to head to the Sorbonne, France’s premier university, which had the prestige of its ancient foundation 700 years earlier. This meant nothing to the police, of course, who invaded the Sorbonne the next day.In response, on 6 May the national students’ union and the union of university teachers organised a protest march. It was one of the key events of the month. The head of the Paris police was obsessed by the need to protect the Sorbonne and its surroundings from a massive invasion by the students. He placed 1,500 officers in defence. But then came 6,000 protesters in waves. Overnight the confrontation was particularly violent. Thousands of cobblestones were ripped up and used as projectiles by the demonstrators. The police responded with teargas grenades. Dozens of gendarmes were taken to hospitals. Students were wrenched from the arms of the police by their colleagues.The next day, students, teachers and increasing numbers of young workers gathered at the Arc de Triomphe to demand that all criminal charges against arrested students be dropped, that the police leave the university and that the authorities reopen Nanterre and the Sorbonne. But negotiations broke down. When the students returned to their campuses to find that the police were still in occupation, a near revolutionary fervour began to grip them.The lyrics of Bob Dylan captured the sense of isolation and alienation felt by many young people (Redferns)The events were broadcast on radio as they occurred, and the aftermath was shown on television the following day. This demonstration of heavy handed police brutality brought on a wave of sympathy for the strikers. Moreover, in a highly significant move, the major union federations called a one-day strike and demonstration for Monday, 13 May. The workers were going to march with the students.They had their own grievances. There had been sporadic industrial trouble since the beginning of the year. More than half of them put in a 48-hour week. They feared that their standard of living had ceased to improve. Unemployment, albeit from a low base, was beginning to rise. As a result this was no longer a Paris event, for workers took to the streets throughout France. Their slogan was “Ten years! That’s enough!” referred to Charles de Gaulle’s long period as president.French politicians Michel Debre and Andre Malraux at the tomb of the unknown soldier, demonstrating their support for De Gaulle (Getty)The events the next day, 14 May, were as important. For workers began occupying factories, starting with a sit-down strike at the Sud Aviation plants near the city of Nantes. If students could occupy their universities, then workers could seize control of their factories. By 16 May, workers had occupied roughly 50 factories throughout France and 200,000 were on strike by 17 May. That figure snowballed to two million workers on strike the following day (18 May) and then ten million, or roughly two thirds of the French workforce on strike the following week (23 May).The unions assumed that the workers simply wanted more pay. So, when they were able to negotiate substantial pay increases with employers’ associations, they thought their job was done. But workers had also demanded the ousting of the De Gaulle government and in some cases demanded to run their own factories.The demonstrations and the strikes went on. Meanwhile on the morning of 29 May, De Gaulle suddenly boarded a helicopter and left the country. He went to the headquarters of the French military in Germany and called a meeting of Council of Ministers for 30 May back in Paris. On that same day, the unions led 400,000 to 500,000 protesters through Paris chanting “Adieu, De Gaulle”. The head of the Paris police carefully avoided the use of force.Sensibly De Gaulle responded by dissolving the National Assembly and calling a new election for 23 June. He ordered the workers to return to work immediately, threatening to institute a state of emergency if they did not. The Communist Party agreed to the holding of the election. Immediately revolutionary feelings began to fade away. The police retook the Sorbonne on 16 June. And the Gaullists won the greatest victory in French parliamentary history.The May days of 1968, it turned out, had been a convulsive moment, nothing more enduring than that.

Scientists want to test how “heavier-than-air vehicles” will operate on the red planet, Nasa said in a release. “The idea of a helicopter flying the skies of another planet is thrilling. The Mars Helicopter holds much promise for our future science, discovery, and exploration missions to Mars.” Nasa Administrator Jim Bridenstine said about the drone-like machine. What fake Mars colony Biosphere 2 looks like today “After the Wright Brothers proved 117 years ago that powered, sustained, and controlled flight was possible here on Earth, another group of American pioneers may prove the same can be done on another world,” Thomas Zurbuchen, Associate Administrator for NASA’s Science Mission Directorate, said at the agency headquarters in Washington.The Mars Helicopter will not be manned but operated autonomously similar to how a drone is here on Earth. It has the potential to be much faster - and more complicated to pull off - than traveling the rocky and dirt-covered surface of Mars. However, unlike a drone “we don’t have a pilot and Earth will be several light minutes away, so there is no way to joystick this mission in real time,” MiMi Aung, the Mars Helicopter Project Manager at the agency’s Jet Propulsion Lab said. Instead, the helicopter will be able to receive a set of commands for flying a mission and carry them out on its own, Ms Aung explained. Nasa\u0027s canny decision to commission sumptuous vintage-inspired posters by Seattle design firm Invisible Creature has firmly placed space travel back where it belongs: in the imagination of travellersIt is particularly fitting that the Nasa commission went to Don and Ryan Clark, who have been running Invisible Creature since 2006, undertaking projects for the likes of Nike and TargetWe were ecstatic, just because our grandfather was an illustrator at Nasa for 30 years, says ClarkThe artwork harks back to the Jet Age-era posters commissioned by Howard Hughes\u0027 Trans World Airlines and its rival United in the 1950s and 1960s, when the work of David Klein (for TWA) and Stan Galli (for United) glamorised and essentially branded this new age of air travelIt doesn\u0027t matter that Nasa has no plans for a Grand Tour of Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune and UranusIf global travel is for daydreamers, going beyond the atmosphere is for true space cadetsOne of the main challenges is that helicopters here on Earth have only reached an altitude of 40,000 feet (12,192 meters), but Mars’ atmosphere is one per cent that of Earth’s. That means the new helicopter is on the surface of the planet, it will already be the equivalent of 100,000 feet up in the Earth’s atmosphere. “To make it fly at that low atmospheric density, we had to scrutinize everything, make it as light as possible while being as strong and as powerful as it can possibly be,” Ms Aung said. Nasa lander to dig into the Mars surface to answer deepest mysteriesNasa and ESA to bring soil from Mars to try and find aliensMission to Mars will launch within a decade, says SpaceX president“NASA has a proud history of firsts,” Mr Bridenstine said. According to Nasa, “the full 30-day flight test campaign will include up to five flights of incrementally farther flight distances, up to a few hundred meters, and longer durations as long as 90 seconds, over a period.

Austerity measures have been disproportionately detrimental to racial and ethnic minority communities ... making women of colour the worst affected.”She called on the government to subject all proposed fiscal policies to equality impact assessments that could flag any racial imbalances before they are brought in.Weeks after a UN panel raised serious concern over the deaths of a “disproportionate number” of black and minority ethnic people in police custody, Ms Achiume hit out at inequality in the criminal justice system.She also said a “national panic” over terrorism was driving Islamophobia and called for the government’s Prevent counter-extremism programme to be suspended and reviewed.Ms Achiume concluded that although the UK had shown leadership in some areas of racial equality, including the prime minister’s race disparity audit, the government still has “much to do”.“I hope that this is only the first step towards transforming formal government commitments into reality, especially for those who experience the highest levels of exclusion, subordination and discrimination on the basis of their race or ethnicity,” she said. or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

But I have also said that the virtue, in excess, fills graveyards.“In this case, not continuing in the EEA would mean endangering – sacrificing – thousands of skilled and decently paid jobs and, with them, the life chances of countless families and communities.”May has found another way to stall making a decision on BrexitThis is the truth about the politics behind EurovisionWill Sainsbury’s-Asda sell 73 stores or more than 200? We can’t let the Home Office threaten migrants’ right to strikePolice look at evidence Brexit campaign chief committed crimesEarlier this week Mr Corbyn’s office reiterated arguments previously set out by the leader that remaining in the single market as it stands would hamper his interventionist industrial agenda if he won power.In particular, Mr Corbyn has concerns about what he sees as restrictive state aid rules and regulations that might interfere with his plans to reverse the privatization of public services.But Lord Kinnock rubbished the claims as being “based on falsehood”, adding: “Neither the EEA nor the EU are part of the socialist superstate of neocon delusion, or of the global capitalist adventure playground of infantile leftist illusion.“The EEA is a mixed-economy agreement of 31 democracies ‘to promote continuous and balanced strengthening of trade and economic relations between the contracting parties with equal conditions of competition and the respect of the same rules’.Brexit so far: in picturesBrexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

She has made some positive noises, and so far there has been restraint about appointing new peers.“But until there is a commitment to an overall cap on the size of the House there is a limit to what we can do.House of Lords votes out prospect of UK leaving EU with ‘no deal’“Once we have a number we can make real proactive efforts to persuade people they should go. There has been some proactive work going on, but we could write to all peers who do not attend often and suggest it is time for them to leave.”Decades of attempts to reform the Lords have failed for political reasons, with a clear chance missed in 2012 due to squabbling between Liberal Democrats and Tory MPs.May can reverse most of the Lords defeats – except on a customs unionLord speaker confirms Trump could speak in parliament despite banThe House of Lords helps to uphold our democracyLords plan to let Trump address Parliament in defiance of Bercow’s banMay vows to overturn Lords plan which could stop BrexitMay will take a risk if she overturns the Lords’ decision on BrexitAs a result, the Lord Speaker’s Committee spent a year to October 2017 forming a plan to at least reduce the chamber’s size without the need to pass new laws – the idea being it would be easier for any PM to push through.The committee published a 40-page report recommending slashing the number of peers to 600 in a decade, limiting any peer’s term to 15 years and a new “two out, one in” system to accelerate a reduction in size.  But in February, Ms May said they needed “further careful thought” and instead highlighted her restraint in appointing new peers since arriving in Downing Street, though she also announced a handful of new Tory lords. Overall, numbers on Ms May’s watch have fallen from 812 to 792.At the time the PM’s response was welcomed as positive, but there are concerns in parliament that more needs to be done to drive the process forward.Lords plan to let Trump address Parliament in defiance of Bercow’s banA Downing Street source said the government is “working through” the reform plans. The Independent understands the focus will be on restraint in appointing new peers rather than a cap, however.Senior sources in the Lords also suggested that removing peers proportionately in order to maintain the overall political balance of the house could help persuade peers they would not be disadvantaging their party by leaving.Another idea to reduce members coming in could be to introduce a new kind of peerage that does not involve membership of the house.The source said: “Someone like Sir James Dyson could become Lord Dyson – but you don’t want him working in the Lords, you want him developing new technology and running business. That kind of peerage could have very wide appeal.”UK news in picturesUK news in picturesJeremy Corbyn with shipbuilding apprentices at the Fairfield Ship Building Museum in Govan.

That is not what the public voted for.Tory MP Heidi Allen signalled her support for the Lords amendments - and warned that the Commons would reject any no deal scenario.The passage of the Great Repeal Bill was always going to be turbulent, but the Lords are merely reflecting what the majority of MPs believe - that Parliament must have a say in whether the deal is good enough, and no deal never will be, she said.Best for Britain, the pro-EU campaign, have dismissed Liam Fox\u0027s remarks earlier today about the House of Lords.\u0026nbspEloise Todd, the chief executive, said:\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspLiam Fox is throwing his toys out of the pram like a petulant child. Fox just looks silly threatening the Lords every time they defeat the Government.\u0026nbspThe London Evening Standard has a report suggesting Theresa May personally vetoed pleas in the Cabinet for visas for NHS doctors.Two polls have been released on Westminster voting intention in the last 24 hours -\u0026nbspgiving Theresa May\u0027s Conservatives a 5-point and 3-point lead over Jeremy Corbyn\u0027s Labour. Both were conducted before Amber Rudd\u0027s resignation, but during the height of the Windrush scandal.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe Cabinet expressed its strong disappointment at the Lords defeats during its weekly meeting, Downing Street said.The Prime Minister\u0027s official spokesman said the defeats risked tying the Government\u0027s hands behind its back in negotiations with Brussels.Theresa May promised that when the Bill returned to the House of Commons the Government would be robust and it was vital to ensure that the legislation is able to deliver the smooth Brexit which is in the interests of everybody in the UK.More here from the Press Association on Downing Street\u0027s response to the Lord\u0027s vote on Monday evening.\u0026nbspThe Prime Minister\u0027s official spokesman would not be drawn on the approach to inidual amendments but said the Government believed the Bill had left the House of Commons in a state which will deliver what the British public voted for.He said: We wish for the Bill to go through in the same form that it left the House of Commons, in a way that does deliver on that smooth Brexit.Asked if the Prime Minister was confident that the changes imposed by the Lords could be reversed, the spokesman said: What we believe is that the country wants us to deliver on smooth Brexit, which the public voted for.That is in the interests of the Houses of Parliament to allow us to deliver that.Asked about Liam Fox\u0027s comments on the House of Lords, the spokesman said: There is a role for it to play in providing scrutiny, but the British public have voted to leave the European Union and Parliament needs to get on and deliver that.Load morePlease allow a moment for the live blog to load.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Don’t stop on the side of the road,” Doug Bos, the owner of the zoo, told CBC News in January, when the footage was shared. “If everybody would listen to the video, that’s what the message was – don’t do this.”Where not to visit if you love animalsWhere not to visit if you love animalsChimpanzees are forced to perform demeaning tricks on leashes and are often subject to cruel training techniques. Animals who are confined to small, barren enclosures and forced to perform unsurprisingly show symptoms of stress and depression. Chimpanzees have been documented rocking back and forth, sucking their lips, salivating and swaying against enclosure perimeters in distress.Some marine parks use bottlenose dolphins in performances and offer visitors the opportunity to swim with dolphins. Unfortunately, people are often unaware that these animals are captured in the wild and torn from their families or traded between different parks around the world.Tigers are forced to live in an unnatural and barren environment and have to endure interactions with a constant stream of tourists. Since tigers never lose their wild instincts, across the world they are reportedly drugged, mutilated and restrained in order to make them “safe” for the public. However, every year, incidents of tiger maulings are reported at this type of tourist attraction.Sunning on the beach is great for humans – we can take a quick dip or catch a bite to eat when we get too hot or hungry. But it\u0027s pure hell for donkeys who are confined to the beach and forced to cart children around on the hot sand. Some donkey-ride operators at beach resorts in the UK even keep the animals chained together at all times. Some parks confine orcas to concrete tanks and force them to perform meaningless tricks for food - many die in captivity. Orcas are highly intelligent and social mammals who may suffer immensely, both physically and mentally, when they\u0027re held in captivity.Lions are confined to fenced areas so that they can easily be cornered, with no chance of escape. Most of them will have been bred in captivity and then taken from their mothers to be hand-reared by the cub-petting industry. When they get too big, they may be drugged before they are released into a hunting enclosure. Because these animals are usually kept in fenced enclosures (ranging in size from just a few square yards to thousands of acres), they never stand a chance of surviving.Every year, tourists travel to Pamplona for the Running of the Bulls. The bulls who are forced to slip and slide down the town\u0027s narrow cobblestone streets are chased straight into the bullring. They are then taunted, stabbed repeatedly and finally killed by the matador in front of a jeering crowd. The majority of Spaniards reject bullfighting, but tourists are keeping the cruel industry on its last legs. City streets are no place for horses. The animals toil in all weather extremes, suffering from respiratory distress from breathing in exhaust fumes as well as numerous hoof, leg and back problems from walking on pavement all day long. As easily spooked prey animals, horses subjected to the loud noises and unexpected sounds of city streets are likely to be involved in accidents, even deadly ones. The zoo community regards the animals it keeps as commodities, and animals are regularly bought, sold, borrowed and traded without any regard for established relationships. Zoos breed animals because the presence of babies draws visitors and boosts revenue, yet often, there\u0027s nowhere to put the offspring as they grow, and they are killed, as we recently saw with Marius the giraffe in Denmark. Some zoos have introduced evening events with loud music and alcohol which disrupt the incarcerated animals even further. At the time, a trainer said there were no safety concerns, as the bear was secured by a chain and the film had been taken before the Dairy Queen had opened for the day. Football team condemned after muzzled bear forced to deliver ballMan ‘trying to take selfie’ with bear is mauled to deathFirst polar bear bred in Singapore dies after five-year health battlePark staff accidentally kill one of world’s rarest bearsFemale bears evolve to hunting threat by raising cubs for longerThe zoo, located in Innisfail, Alberta, has now been charged under the Wildlife Act for taking the bear out without informing the authorities – one count relates to the ice cream excursion and the other for failing to inform officials the bear was being taken home nightly for bottle-feeding in 2017.The owners of the wildlife park, Mr Bos and Debbie Rowland, have said they plan to plead guilty. “We made a mistake. I’m embarrassed about it,” Mr Bos told . “Every time we take an animal off the property, we’re supposed to notify Fish and Wildlife, send them an email, and we forgot to do that in both instances.”The zoo’s permit has also been revised to include new conditions requiring the zoo to provide more details when transporting animals and to keep them in a cage, crate or kennel while in a vehicle.Members of the public will also be barred from having any contact with animals, including bears. or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Shame on them.More MPs backed away from Tom Watson’s sinister “Section 40” bid to force papers into the death grip of Max Mosley’s Press-hating Impress crew.Watson’s sole aim was revenge against papers critical of Labour. He finally bottled out of a vote he knew he would lose. A malevolent conspiracy theorist, bully and liar . . . now a coward to boot.But the Labour lardbucket ­will not give up. Nor will his orgy-loving benefactor Mosley, nor Miliband, nor Hacked Off Hugh nor their weird, obsessive acolytes.The Tories will have to defend Press freedom again. They can begin by repealing Section 40, as their manifesto pledged.THE Lords’ latest sickening insult to democracy has surely hammered the final nail in the unelected chamber’s coffin.Their vote to stay in the single market is beyond belief in its stupidity, arrogance and insane ­willingness to expose the country to dangerous instability.It would mean surrendering control over immigration for ever — and never actually “leaving” the EU.The Lords’ role is to tweak and advise on laws, not impose entirely contrary policies because they don’t like how the country votes. They are telling 17.4million people: “You don’t count. We do.”How do they imagine Leavers would react if the biggest vote in our history was negated by unelected, ermine-clad party stooges, some on EU pensions?We genuinely fear the consequences.It was the Lords, too, who began the attempt to muzzle the Press. They are rotting our democracy from within.IT is appalling that the Government is ­considering a new witch-hunt into Army veterans of the Troubles.The vast majority of unsolved murders were by terrorists, mostly since given immunity by the Labour Government.Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley has been advised she cannot legally exclude veterans.

stuck","story":"The man went to a clinic in Leicestershire complaining of pain and limited hearing in his right ear.He told doctors at the Hear Clinic he had got a cotton bud stuck in his ear two years ago but he believed it had fallen out on its own.But, after recently going swimming, the water that entered the man’s ear caused the cotton bud to swell and cause him pain.The wad of cotton was removed by Neel Raithatha at the clinic on June 6Neel said: “The client reported muffled hearing in the right ear.“Fortunately, the eardrum was healthy and intact and it took around a minute to remove.“It was a delicate procedure given the cotton bud was pushed right up against the eardrum.“I had to ensure I did not exert any force whilst removing as I could have easily have perforated the eardrum in doing so.”Experts have previously warned against using cotton buds to clean your ears.Inserting cotton buds in your ear could push wax even further into the ear canal and even damage your eardrum, according to draft guidance from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice).Instead, they suggest ear irrigation should be used to help those who are experiencing hearing problems due to wax build-up.This involves an electronic machine safely pumping water into the ear to remove wax under the guidance of a GP.This mans case is not the first time Neel, who calls himself the wax whisperer, has had to remove an unusual object from a patient’s ear.“I have previously removed a pen cap and earring from the ear,” he added.Earwax, also called cerumen, is a naturally occurring substance that protects the skin of the ear canal, helps keep it clean and protects against bacteria.It can build-up over time but usually excess earwax falls out on its own.But if it doesnt, you should visit your GP or pharmacist."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict0004030209981.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"uk faces weekend weather

back.The moves come after the school took part in a project with charity Children North East to stop poorer pupils being stigmatised.Pauline added: There was a culture within the school, within pupils, that noticed those children who were never in on PE days for example.Part of our uniform policy is a standard backpack so we dont have any designer goods.The project, which over 100 schools took part in, has led to higher attendance and better results.Behaviour has reportedly improved and more pupils are taking part in extracurricular activities.Burnside College in Wallsend, North

You could tell she was a nice person.“She would laugh at my corny jokes. I remember flirting with her, cracking jokes and her laughing. My ego loved that, of course.“I don’t believe in love at first sight but I believe in lust at first sight and she was really attractive. She’s a beautiful girl.”By the last day of filming Simon decided he wanted a date and plucked up the courage to ask Meghan out.He said: “I worked up enough nerve to give her my number.“This is pre-smartphones and social media. It might be one of the last times I wrote my number on a napkin.”Meghan quickly got in touch and he asked her out for dinner.The pair went to the Woo Lae Oak, a Korean barbecue restaurant in Beverly Hills. Simon had chopsticks with his name on brought out because he was such a regular there. He ordered a beef dish and another of chicken.He said: “We had a great time. she wouldn’t drink, I had wine but she had water or Coke.“A lot of actresses tend to be divas but she was the opposite. She was sweet to the waiter.“She looked really beautiful. I was like, sign me up, man!”But one of the other dishes Simon ordered was garlic noodles — which proved to be a mistake after he drove her home.He recalls: “We were in the car and as I started kissing her it was obvious that I had garlic breath.“She pulled back. It was so embarrassing.“She said something like, ‘Oh boy, garlic’.“I just felt so dumb. We laughed about it. She wasn’t rude about it or anything. She was honest. She was turned off. It was an awkward moment.”Simon asked Meghan to go to a bar or a club with him after their meal but she declined.He said: “I remember her saying something like, ‘I’ve got to get up early’. She had to work the next day or something.”At the end of their date, crestfallen Simon jumped out of his black Cadillac and opened the door for Meghan to let her out.He hugged her and she went into her home.Simon texted Meghan a couple of days later but admits: “I didn’t get a second date.“I think she even said something along the lines of, ‘We could just be friends’, which was like a dagger to the heart.Meghan — who The Sun revealed used dating guide The Rules to fix her love life — stuck to one of the book’s principles with Simon — “no more than casual kissing on the first date”.Simon said with a laugh: “Looks like she stuck to her rule book. This is all news to me!”The Sun’s revelations about performer Simon’s past date with Meghan have caused a sensation — just a week before she is due to marry Prince Harry at Windsor Castle.A decade before their date Simon had performed a sex act on himself for a porn movie at age 18 after being persuaded to do it by an adult film actress he was dating.To pay his rent, he starred as mystery hunk “Sebastian” in three solo nude sex films which went straight to video. He said: “I never had sex with anybody on camera. It was just me standing there naked.“To me it doesn’t mean s*** but I could see why some people get their feathers ruffled about it, especially the Royal Family.”Simon has had a string of stunning exes including Jaime Pressly from TV’s My Name Is Earl and Twin Peaks’ actress Lara Flynn Boyle.He is also pals with Brit celebrities Calum Best and super producer Mark Ronson. It wasn’t long after his date with Meghan that he started seeing heiress Paris.The blonde reality TV star had shot to fame after footage of her having sex with US poker player Rick Salomon was leaked on the internet. Simon said: “I did a movie, Pledge This with Paris.“Me and Paris were casually dating but it was not like I couldn’t take a girl out on a date, we weren’t exclusive.“This was when she was at the top of her fame. It was like Kim Kardashian. You couldn’t just go to get a drink or dinner because she was swarmed.“It was non-stop. I don’t know how she does it.“It was out of control with Paris, totally exhausting.“It is ironic, as that’s now Meghan Markle’s world.”The comic and rapper — whose hip-hop alter-ego is Dirt Nasty — said he believes he would get on with Prince Harry and was impressed by his naked antics in Las Vegas.He said: “I like the dude — he’s the one royal I like. I swear me and him, under different circumstances, would have a beer and a laugh. I really think that.“You can tell Harry has a sense of humour. He might even be a Dirt Nasty fan, I know he’s in to hip-hop.”Speaking of the upcoming wedding, Simon, who is now in a new relationship, added: “I’ve got nothing but love for both of them.“She made the better move to go with him in the long run. I think she’ll be a great princess.“I hope they have a lot of babies and make America proud. Good on them.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

one of which is given some money.But while the person with the cash is obligated to share some of the loot with other player that portion can be as small as zero.And the Dutch scientists found that small men act more aggressively when there is no threat of repercussions, reports The New Scientist.Experts believe this proves that short man syndrome, also known as Napoleon Complex, is real and factors into the everyday lives of vertically-challenged males.In the study, the 42 volunteers were split into pairs and allowed to meet their partners – who were either little or large depending on their own stature.After allowing the tiny test subjects to see their physically dominant opponents, each player was given a separate room where they were asked to give up some cash.The shortest men in the study, measuring around 5ft7in kept 14 of their 18 tokens to themselves on average while the tall men, measuring about 6ft6in in height, only kept nine of their 18 credits.But when the small gents were faced with the threat of repercussion, they did not display aggressive behaviour and were more willing to share with their opponents.Lead researcher Jill Knapen said: “It’s probably smart for short men to be like this because they have less opportunities to get resources.Short blokes on average are less wealthy, less successful and less healthy than their taller counterparts, according to studies.Bigger men also enjoy better sex and love lives than small guys.Little men may also have to adopt a more defensive stance because of aggression from their larger peers.Mike Eslea at the University of Central Lancashire is sceptical about whether the type of behaviour displayed by small males can be explained by the Napoleon Complex.Speaking to New Scientist, he said: “They’re supposed to be publicly advertising their aggressiveness to compensate for their lack of stature.“To me this doesn’t suggest the Napoleon Complex exactly, it suggests something else.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000405240436.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"newlywed couple china honeymoon preston","story":"Legend Liang, 33 and his new wife Carmen, travelled 6,000 miles to spend their holiday not on a sandy beach under a palm tree but in the Lancashire city.He whisked Carmen from their home and spent three days in the town - even posing for photographs in their wedding attires at various landmarks.The couple proudly posed outside the citys Fishergate shopping centre, a university campus, outside a bus-stop, the Media factory building and in a park.Journalist Legend choose the former cotton mill town as he had studied there at the University of Central Lancashire campus ten years ago.He was keen to show Carmen some of his old haunts during a two week honeymoon in the UK during which they also visited Brighton and London.Legend, who studied international journalism for a year at the uni in 2008, decided no other place was going to bring the wow-factor than Preston.Legend, from Guandong in southern China, said: Preston is a very important place for me.I wanted to show my wife where I studied, where I lived in Whitendale Halls and on Fishergate, and how lucky I was to have the opportunity to live in a lovely small city which had an international perspective.It had been 10 years since the uni grad had stepped foot in the city famed for its 94 metre spire at St Walburges Church - which is the tallest in Britain.But Legend was amazed at the difference a decade made - with the campus now including its Xbox building - a green, grey and black-coloured media centre.He added: The Media Factory was a building site so its nice to see that looking so good, Fylde Building has gone and theres others being built while in the city centre the market has changed so much.The pair spent the last two weeks also visiting London, Brighton and Edinburgh as they flew back home to their native China on Thursday.Legend, a Guangzhou Yangcheng Evening News reporter, said his wife had enjoyed her trip to Preston as much as him - proving the 14 hour flight was worth it.He said: She thought London was a huge city, just like we have back home but Preston was really nice because she could see how UK people live and work in a small city with everything they need being close by.Legend studied at Guangdong University of Foreign Study, an international partner of UCLan since 1986, for two years before his move to Preston.He was taught in his home country by Matt Horn - the course leader of the international journalism franchise programme since it began in 2005.Matt said: Legend always showed the natural instincts required of a good journalist and is well respected in the city.UCLan and GDUFS have a long and happy history together and so I was delighted when Legend introduced his bride to be as I had taught her for GDUFS a couple of years after I was Legends teacher.Preston is famous as the location for the opening of the first KFC in the UK in 1965 and as the home of Preston North End FC."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000395754020.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"rubbish fly tipped england stretch 1600 miles moscow","story":"The bill for taxpayers rocketed 13 per cent last year, councils said.They revealed that in 2016/17 there were 492,139 cases where waste the size of a small van or tipper truck was illegally dumped.Put together the vehicles would form a 1,459-mile queue, with the amount of fly-tipped rubbish circling the M25 12 times.

Scott might be 26 years her junior but he always strikes me as the “older” one in the relationship.It’s that sheer zest for life that Barbara has, even at 80, that makes this diagnosis so very sad and hard to bear.Scott decided to speak out because he felt he could no longer protect his beloved wife from people outside their close circle of friends and family hearing the truth.He became worried her illness would make her do or say something out of ­character that could upset her and others.He wants to be able to take his wife on ­ outings, and for her to still meet the public who love her and who will now ­hopefully understand if she’s having a “foggy” day.Scott also needs to make sure he takes care of himself and doesn’t get completely worn out looking after his wife.He hasn’t been able to leave her alone in the house recently, but now the truth is out he can let others take over while he at least has half an hour to himself.Anyone who cares for someone with dementia knows it is utterly exhausting, stressful and worrying, no matter how much you love them.I salute everyone who quietly and patiently deals with these day-to-day ­struggles. Scott is now free of the burden of keeping the secret and I hope he is finding strength from all of the messages of support for Barbara.She’s been part of many of our most-loved shows and we’ve grown up with “Our Babs”.I remember watching her wiggle and giggle her way through the Carry On films, where her sheer talent and perfect comic timing marked her out as a little superstar.Who could forget her enthusiastic arm flinging exercise routine in Carry On Camping that ended with her bra pinging off?And that incredible bikini made up of three shiny red hearts in Carry On Again Doctor made my pal Dr Hilary Jones decide to take up a career in medicine.As she more than proved during her reign in EastEnders, Barbara has always been so much more than a bubbly blonde dolly bird.She is one hell of an actress and was in her element behind the bar of The Queen Vic.It was her and Scott’s decision to kill off Peggy Mitchell when her memory began to fade.Barbara was having difficulty ­learning lines so felt she couldn’t give her very best performance.As it so happens, the scenes leading up to her character’s death were some of the best that ­Barbara, or any soap actress, has ever given on the small screen. Quite simply she is the real deal.I’ve been lucky enough to ­interview her many times over the years and it’s like catching up with an old friend.She’s open and honest and has never tried to cover up her ­mistakes or to sugar-coat the ups and downs of her life.When work was thin on the ground she painted on a smile, climbed into her shiny fairy godmother outfit and worked her backside off in provincial pantos.She was always quick to credit EastEnders for giving her a career comeback.I’ve seen her talking to fans outside the ­studio, always happy to pose for pictures, sign autographs and have a chat.She would leave everyone with a smile on their face and some happy memories.Her own powers of recall and her very bright light may be diminishing, but Scott and all her friends and family, and the public who adore her, will ensure she is wrapped in a soft blanket of love.She’s a class act and a very special woman.TAKE a bow Shayne Ward and all concerned with the deeply moving and hugely important storyline of Aidan’s suicide in Coronation Street.The subject was handled with great sensitivity.We saw Aidan feeling isolated and alone in the crowded Rovers, witnessed his fearful despair and heard his father’s anguished screams of grief through the closed bedroom door.There was no need to see his cold, dead body to understand what had happened. This really was Corrie at its finest.Richard Hawley as devastated dad Johnny and Catherine Tyldesley as poor bereaved Eva were exceptional, but what made me really blub was the authentic speech by Gail (Helen Worth) looking out of her window on to the iconic cobbled street, talking about how we all need to look after each other and that no one should suffer in silence.It was beautifully written and impeccably delivered.That’s what Corrie is all about.IT’S the one time of the year when our inevitable failure to win a massive trophy in Europe is a source of fun and amusement rather than humiliation. Because tonight is Eurovision.Our plucky Brit doomed to failure this time is SuRie, above, who is actually a good performer with a perfectly acceptable song, but even if the UK entry was Robbie Williams belting out Angels, we would still be near the bottom of the table or even doomed to the dreaded “nul points”.Many theories are put forward for our dire results over the past two decades.Some believe there are too many countries taking part (Australia and Israel are bizarrely considered part of Europe) which makes for more tactical voting, combined with an anti- British backlash made worse by Brexit.I reckon it’s simply because we don’t take it seriously enough, for which I’m very grateful, because I truly love Eurovision.We know we won’t win so it’s just an excuse for a party, a chance to wallow in the whole wonderful campfest and to chortle at Graham Norton’s snarky comments.My perfect evening.WHEN Kim Kardashian is the most elegant and tastefully dressed woman in the room, you know that something has gone horribly awry.So it was at the ludicrous Met Gala in New York, which saw a procession of show-offs dressing up like extras from the Monty Python sketch about the Spanish Inquisition.Madonna looked like Dracula’s mad old aunty, Sarah Jessica Parker had a nativity scene on her head, and don’t get me started on Rihanna, who came as some sort of sexy bishop mashed up with a pearly queen.It made Kim’s skin-tight gold sheath Versace dress appear to be the epitome of class.We are told the Pope approved this farrago, which was pompously entitled Heavenly Bodies: Fashion And The Catholic Imagination.His endorsement should make you shudder – until you realise that’s how he always dresses.He’s also a man with a passion for red leather Prada slip-ons, so I suppose he is more connected to the weird world of fashion than your average parish priest.A great deal of money is raised for good causes at this tacky celebration of fame and fortune, and that’s all well and good. But maybe next year they should stay at home and write a cheque.One thing is certain. You can be darned sure they won’t follow up the Catholic theme by making a mockery of Islam or Judaism.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The world\u0026#8217s worst Ebola outbreak took the lives of 11,000 people in Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia in 2014 after the virus spread from a young boy living in a village in rural Guinea. Poorly equipped and understaffed medical workers turned down infected patients and when the disease spread to the densely populated Liberian capital of Monrovia a health crisis turned into a catastrophe.In early 2016, the WHO said the outbreak had been contained and eliminated but 17,000 survivors were left traumatised and fearful of the future.Over the past few days, the DRC\u0026#8217s near-neighbours like Nigeria have taken steps to prevent the spread of the virus by introducing checks and health screening at its airports.Meanwhile, the Trump administration signalled its disinterest when it asked for ebola-related funding cuts of US$252 million, as part of a package aimed at reigning in government spending."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/05/2048x1152/skynews-mars-small-helicopter_4307344.jpg?20180512014309 ","title":"nasa to send helicopter to mars","story":"Controllers on Earth will command the Mars Helicopter, which is designed to receive and interpret commands from the ground.\"The ability to see clearly what lies beyond the next hill is crucial for future explorers,\" said NASA\u0027s Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for the science mission directorate.\"We already have great views of Mars from the surface as well as from orbit.

In Labour strongholds, you\u0027d be hard pressed to find any.But after the PM lost her Commons majority in last year\u0027s general election, she doesn\u0027t have the votes in the Commons for a widespread expansion of the grammar school system.So she\u0027s now attempting to boost the ones that are there already, with a \u0026#16350m fund to create thousands of extra places, many for pupils from poorer backgrounds.She has found a willing accomplice in Damian Hinds, a grammar school boy from Altrincham in Manchester\u0027s leafier suburbs, who was promoted to Education Secretary in the January reshuffle.His two predecessors in the job, Justine Greening and Nicky Morgan, both of whom were sacked by Mrs May, didn\u0027t care for grammar schools at all.Ms Greening, who last week urged employers to discriminate against applicants from Eton, is a steelworker\u0027s daughter from Rotherham who went to the town\u0027s Oakwood Comprehensive School.As the Lib Dem education spokeswoman Layla Moran put it, rather colourfully: \"We now know what we suspected. Justine Greening was moved on to make way for a lap dog for Theresa May\u0027s pet projects.\"So why the PM\u0027s enthusiasm for grammars? She and other supporters claim they\u0027re good for social mobility. Opponents say they do the exact opposite.After all, a grammar school in every town suggests a secondary modern in every town too. But you won\u0027t find many Tory MPs who support grammar schools backing a return of secondary moderns for children who fail the 11-plus.Ah yes, Tory MPs! Looking at the politics of all this, surely a big motive for the PM in the Government\u0027s \u0026#16350m handout to grammar schools is pleasing Conservative backbenchers. or at least those on the Tory Right.That\u0027s because Conservative MPs who love grammar schools are largely the same ones who hate the European Union.They\u0027re also the same MPs who are currently holding the PM to ransom on Brexit and threatening to topple her if she caves in to Remainers. So cynics will regard the latest boost for grammar schools as a sop to the Tory Right, a bone tossed in their direction in the increasingly bitter Brexit dogfight - even if the Prime Minister does indeed appear to have an obsession with grammar schools.According to political journalist Rosa Prince\u0027s biography of Theresa May, The Enigmatic Prime Minister, it was at school that she became interested in politics.By the time she was in the sixth form she was apparently confident enough to announce that she intended to become Britain\u0027s first woman Prime Minister."},{"url":null,"title":"more half britains richest hedge","story":"NewsMore than half of Britain\u0027s richest hedge fund managers have donated to the ToriesCity financiers who have given a combined £15.6million to the Conservatives named among 21 wealthiest fund managers in latest Sunday Times Rich List\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByGraham HiscottHead of Business17:50, 11 MAY 2018Updated20:21, 11 MAY 2018NewsTheresa May\u0027s Conservative Party has received big donations from hedge fund bosses over the years (Image: AFP)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet politics updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTwelve of Britain’s 21 richest hedge fund fat cats are Tory donors.

Ronald Russell, 49, passed away at his home in Cumbernauld, North Lanarkshire, on July 4 last year. His family say that the landscape gardener lived alone and suffered from mental health issues. A transcript of the call was released by relatives of Mr Russell and reveals how his pleas for help went ignored by staff from the Scottish Ambulance Service. Medics finally arrived at his address 17 hours after the call – and only after a concerned neighbour contacted them.  According to the transcript, Mr Russell made the call from his mobile at 5.45pm on July 4, 2017 and requested an ambulance to bring him to hosptial. The call handler repeatedly asks “What’s the telephone number you’re calling from please?” despite being aware that the phone number was being displayed from their terminal. Mr Russell replied: Can you hold on until I get that? The call handler says Sorry? and he continues: “I’ve got this, I’ve I’ve got this, got it written down.”  The caller was heard moaning loudly throughout the call and his response is recorded as Ooooooh ohhh (incomprehensible sound from caller).” The call handler once again asks if he wanted an ambulance, ignoring his previous requests. Finally, after saying “hello?” five times without a reply, the call handler hangs up. In all, the conversation lasted three minutes.  The Ambulance Service rang his number three times to get Mr Russell back on the line but did not try to trace his address. They have admitted more should have been done to track Mr Russell’s whereabouts.  A Scottish Ambulance Service report said: “It is evident on listening to the call that the call handler can hear noises and moaning. The correct process was followed by providing three calls back, however, due to the call handler knowing that the caller was on the line before it disconnects, there could have been more attempts to confirm the address - or for this to be highlighted to a supervisor.” Ronald’s sister Margo Cassidy, 52, said: “It was really devastating to read that, especially because I think most people imagine that when you phone an ambulance the first thing they will ask is, “Where are you?” “We knew he had phoned an ambulance because we had his mobile.

The imaginary cool white sports car - dubbed the \u0027Royal Roadster\u0027 - merges the best of British and American motoring – an Aston Martin DB11 and the iconic Ford Mustang. And it topped a survey of more than 2,000 adults to uncover the top choices for the wedding vehicle. It is also thought the motor will feature neutral ribbons and elegant white flowers for a simple and classy look.  The research, commissioned by webuyanycar , revealed 86 per cent of Brits believe Harry and Meghan will hop into a British car on their big day, while one in 10 imagine the motor could be a half and half American-British hybrid.  The DB11 shape forms the base of webuyanycar’s imaginary Windsor wedding car, adapted with the wheels and arches of the iconic Mustang. The eye-catching car also sports the rear end of a classic Mustang, with a Ford bumper, chrome protection bar and two side exhausts.  The final design also reflects some more distinctive details – since four in 10 of those surveyed think the happy couple’s car will feature a personalised number plate. One in 10 even hope the royal wedding coup\u0026eacute will include a special side car for Meghan’s beloved pet Beagle, Guy.  Richard Evans, head of technical services at webuyanycar , said: “Everything about Harry and Meghan’s wedding, from the bridesmaids and cake, to the invitation and entertainment, has been speculated on by the public.  “Of course, travelling in style is a key part of a wedding day, so we decided to find out what the public thought the royals would choose for their wedding car.  “The fact that Harry and Meghan are a modern couple, with classic style, has been reflected in our unique design, which has been crowned the ‘Royal Roadster’. “We do live by our name of buying any car on the market and we purchase a fine selection of wedding cars and stretch limos every year. “I doubt we will ever see one as unique as the Royal Roadster, however. “Now we just can’t wait to see how close we got to the actual car the couple choose for their big day next week.” The car’s name, Royal Roadster, was a clear winner, with almost 60 per cent of the vote, beating off other potential suggestions including the ‘Monarch’s Motor’ and ‘Prince’s Pit Stop’.  One in twenty of those polled think the car will be decorated in celebration of the two nations, donning star-spangled banners and union jacks. And after tying the knot at Windsor Castle, 80 per cent of people said Harry would be the one to open the car door for Meghan like a true gent. In true royal fashion, three in five think the car will be driven by a member of the Royal Household Staff. But nearly one quarter believe all tradition will go out the window with Prince Harry sitting behind the wheel on his big day. Following their reception, many think the couple will head back to Buckingham Palace to greet their adoring fans. And one in 10 toyed with the notion that the newlyweds will head up to Balmoral to enjoy married life away from the public eye.  During their journey to their next destination as husband and wife, half agreed ‘Perfect’ by Ed Sheeran is the top choice of song to play in the wedding car. While 14 per cent named ‘Endless Love’ by Lionel Richie and Diana Ross as the driving theme tune Harry and Meghan will choose to start their new lives together. Nearly a third of people believe the couple will stash USB chargers in their wedding car to charge their phones so they can catch up on congratulatory texts after the drive. While nearly one quarter are in high hopes that the royal love birds will have a selfie stick on board to take snaps of their big day. The research also found that 63 per cent will be tuning into the big day.

Karlah Daly said she confronted the pervert and asked him to stop - but claims that when she reported it to the driver, he simply told her to \u0027switch seats\u0027. The disturbing incident happened on the top deck of a bus bound for Leeds city centre in Yorkshire at around 6.30pm on Thursday. The 22-year-old has bravely waived her anonymity to help catch him.  She told  the man, wearing a red tracksuit, had been sitting at the back of the First UK vehicle when she got on, but moved forward as people started to get off. She realised something was wrong when she saw his reflection in the window. Karlah said: He came and sat opposite me on the bus. I could see something moving in the window, like someone was waving, but at first I didn\u0027t think anything of it. I turned around and the guy was looking right at me, dead in the eye.  He was staring at me with his belly out and he had his hands on his private area. Horrified by what was happening, she took out her film and recorded what happened. She continued: I said \u0027can you stop it please\u0027, he didn\u0027t say anything, he was still looking me in the eyes. I got up to leave and he said: \u0027I love you\u0027. I was really scared. She said there was one other passenger, a man, on the top deck of the bus when it happened, but he did not intervene. Karlah said she went downstairs and reported what had happened to the bus driver - but was stunned by his reaction.  He told me to sit downstairs, he didn\u0027t take down any details, she said. He just asked if it was the man in the red tracksuit. Karlah got off the bus two stops later, and said the man was still on the bus after her exit. He could have carried on doing it after I went, she said. The victim posted the video on Twitter, and was contacted by West Yorkshire Police, who asked her to give a statement about what happened. Officers are now investigating, but no arrests have been made.

A C-section was then carried out on the first-time mother to remove the infant\u0027s head. It was re-attached to his body so she could hold him before she said goodbye.

And while Ms King may have a name \u0026shyworthy of royalty, that’s not her only \u0026shyconnection to the Duchess-in-waiting. Like the Suits star, Vicki is also 36 and, following a whirlwind romance with her own Prince Charming, is also set to tie the knot this summer. Now, after shedding 3st 3lb and four dress sizes, dark-haired Vicki has more than a sprinkle of Ms Markle’s sparkle. Still in shock at her fairy-tale \u0026shytransformation, Vicki, who has adopted Meghan’s style for our photo shoot, says: “I really can’t wait for my own wedding now. Watching the royal wedding will really get me excited, although no doubt they will have had a much bigger budget than us!” Vicki has gone from 12st 7lb to 9st 4lb and a dress size 16 to size eight, which means she now needs to have her wedding dress taken in.  “I bought it when I had only lost a stone,” she laughs. “Now it needs taking in and a huge chunk taken out of it. It feels fantastic as I’m so much happier and more relaxed. And now I picture myself in the dress and I know I will feel like a princess.” Administration officer Vicki had spent years lacking the confidence to dream of walking down the aisle – after trying to lose weight seven years ago. She had given up smoking at the age of 29 and had really seen the weight pile on as a result. A break-up led to a crash diet that helped her initially lose two stone but when Vicki met now-fiance Ross Miller, 39, on a dating website in 2014, she fell into a familiar trap... ending up putting even more weight back on. At 5ft 3in, she was 12st 7lb and a size 16. It wasn’t just that she felt unhappy in her clothes, it was knocking her confidence and increasing her anxiety. She says: “I lost weight too quickly after a stressful split and then, over time, I met Ross. As you do when you start dating, we were going drinking a lot and eating out.  “I found that I started to get really stressed and unhappy at work and, as the weight piled on, anxiety kicked in.  “Putting on weight was a mental and physical strain because I had no \u0026shyconfidence. I said to Ross, ‘I need to  do something, no one else is going to do  it for me’.”  The moment Vicki realised she really needed help was one day in June 2016, when she burst into tears after seeing herself in the mirror.  This time, Vicki, of Brighton, East Sussex, knew she had to lose the weight properly if she was going to keep it off. Having struggled with previous diets, she decided to go to a local Slimming World group after it was suggested by a colleague. And she was pleased to see losing the pounds didn’t mean going hungry. “Straight away, I couldn’t believe how much you can eat and what you can eat compared to what I was eating,” she says. “I’m a foodie and I wanted a plan where I could eat what I wanted – and I do. “When I was overweight, I never ate breakfast. I barely ate before lunchtime but I was eating all the wrong foods and too much food at the wrong times. Now I eat all day but it’s the right things.”  Vicki admits that before she started the diet she’d go for easy foods like a burger and chips or fried chicken, often washed down with half a bottle of wine. She also used to have an addiction to crisps, so decided she needed to completely cut them out. “I look back and think, ‘Oh my God, how did I eat that?’ I was eating crisps all the time. Now I just don’t buy them because I know I’ll eat them all and feel rubbish. It’s not worth it.” Instead, Vicki grazes on fruit and vegetables, has a healthy veggie lunch and still has a satisfying dinner such as homemade pasta, homemade chicken curry or a healthy roast. She is often eating more food than she did so previously.  “I have bigger portions than Ross! It’s all about loading up on lots of \u0026shyvegetables rather than just having the pasta,” she explains. “Sometimes I cut the pasta out completely.” And she hasn’t had to cut back on going out either. She still loves trips to Nando’s but will just choose skinless chicken options instead. Alongside her new food plan, Vicki took up running and signed up to her first half-marathon earlier this year but had to pull out due to injury. Just the thought of taking on such a challenge marks a massive change.  “When I was overweight, I really wanted to go to the gym but didn’t feel comfortable or confident,” she says. “So Ross got us an exercise bike and I started going on it three to four times a week for half an hour – it was great because no one could watch me. Then, in April last year, Ross and I signed up to the gym together. I started running four to five times a week.” Vicki found time for exercise by running to appointments instead of driving, and going to the gym early. “All I used to do was go to work, get home, sit down, eat and sleep,” she admits. “Now after work I will go to the gym or for a swim. It’s all about learning to make the time you have worthwhile.” But the biggest change was not just being able to buy a smaller dress size, she had won back her \u0026shyconfidence. She said goodbye to her anxiety and was back to being the warm, engaging person operations manager Ross had fallen for. Vicki even believes this new-found confidence is what inspired Ross to pop the question, six weeks after she started Slimming World.  “I remember how quickly I started to feel better about myself,” she says. “Every week I could see the numbers going down on the scales and that keeps you so motivated. “I knew I couldn’t miss a week because if I slipped up I wouldn’t go back. The progress keeps you going. “I think I was happier in myself and that made Ross feel happier. Although he’d never say that was what made him pick the timing, I think it played a part.” Vicki has two months before she and Ross follow in Meghan and Harry’s footsteps. While her wedding won’t be broadcast for millions to see, Ms King will no doubt feel like royalty.  Diet before   Breakfast: Nothing.

Luke Hicks burned two vibrators - worth \u0026pound66 - in anger because Danielle Gillies was away on a women-only night out. A court heard the 24-year-old found the two sex toys in a bedroom in a chest of drawers and set them alight in his rage. Hicks had downed 15 pints of lager as well as vodka and champagne during an all day drinking session at horse racing before heading to his girlfriend\u0027s flat. And he started a vibrator bonfire in fury at realising Danielle, 23, had gone out was out with the girls. His outraged girlfriend came home from the Cardiff night out to find the sex toys destroyed as well as fire damage to a cupboard.  Prosecutor Vaughan Pritchard-Jones said Ms Gillies dumped Hicks straight away and he spent the next nine days begging her to get back with him. But many of Hicks\u0027 messages turned abusive and he was charged with harassment. Mr Pritchard-Jones said: He let himself into the flat and burned two sex toys that she had in the bedroom, and made a small burn mark on the chest of drawers. He sent her a constant stream of texts over the next nine days. Some were abusive, but mainly they were trying to persuade her to get back with him.” Hicks was warned any further contact would be considered harassment, but Haverfordwest Magistrates heard he continued to message Ms Gillies anyway.  Insurance worker Hicks, of Kilgetty, Pembrokeshire, admitted criminal damage and harassment. Mike Kelleher, defending, said Hicks was extremely drunk when he entered the woman\u0027s flat. He added: “He had not expected his girlfriend to go out as well. He let himself into her property and found that she was not there. He had drunk far too much than was good for him. Mr Kelleher said Hicks continued to message the woman because she hadn\u0027t blocked his number. In his eyes, because he had not been blocked, he saw a glimmer of hope, he said. He accepts that the relationship is over. The texts were born out of a sense of frustration, which grew and grew.

After a heated argument, a fight broke out and Dunkley made lunges towards the man with a knife. The unknown man ran away and Dunkley walked into Brixton station, heading towards a Victoria Line train. Meanwhile, a group of males, including 18-year-old Samuel Gbo, entered the same station. On a northbound service, Dunkley confused Gbo with someone else and became violent.  During the journey towards Stockwell, Dunkley threatened the group of men with a knife and then stabbed Gbo. The teenager then produced a knife and stabbed Dunkley twice on the arm. At Stockwell, the disorder spilled onto the platform where police and paramedics attended. Investigating officer Pc Neil Lane, from BTP, said: Knife crime will never be tolerated on the London Underground network, and today\u0027s sentence shows the consequence of knife crime. The Tube network is rich with CCTV, and we use this vital evidence to identify offenders and bring them before the courts. Those individuals who are intent on carrying knives should see this sentence as a deterrent to this reckless behaviour.

The founder of Net World Sports has found his way on to the Sunday Times Rich List, after his wealth rose from \u0026pound28 million last year.  The youngster sold his first sport item to his pals at school, after bagging himself a cricket bat on eBay.

Glamourous three-year-old Afghan Hound AJ Nirvana Battle turns heads wherever he goes and has flowing locks that a model would be proud of. His owner Kevin Chan spends six to eight hours bathing his beloved pet, then piles on a number of products, including baby powder and hairspray. Marketing director Kevin, who lives in Beijing, China, has spent \u0026pound11,600 to date on grooming equipment and coughs up \u0026pound525 a month on bathing products to keep his pup\u0027s pristine floor-length mane perfectly preened.  The Hong Kong-born 29-year-old spends six to eight hours a week brushing the hairy hound and claims Battle is the most beautiful animal on the globe. Kevin said: Since the moment I decided to take Battle home, he was already the most beautiful dog in the world. He is a family member now, so I don\u0027t mind spending time and money on him. I need to bathe him regularly every seven to 10 days - it takes six to eight hours to bathe and groom him every time.  I do all the grooming myself and have spent about 100,000 CNY (\u0026pound11,600) to date on grooming equipment. I spend another 4,000 to 5,000 CNY (\u0026pound535) on the best bathing products every month. Afghan hounds were born as models and have their own unique characters. I don\u0027t style him deliberately, I just follow my heart.  I always tell people I didn\u0027t choose the dog but was chosen by him, therefore I have to try my best to give him the best treatment I can. Every day, Kevin, who adopted Battle two years and eight months ago, sprays a nutritious solution on the pooch\u0027s fur to smooth it before letting this sink in for one minute. Then he uses a bristle brush to ease out any knots in the pooch\u0027s mane - using talcum or baby powder to remove tangles. The 29-year-old has even bought a camera and taken up photography lessons so he can share the best photos of his pampered pet on social media.  Kevin said: Every day, I spray a special nutritious solution on Battle\u0027s fur and comb him. I have to brush him every day, to keep his fur from knotting together. When he was younger it would take me two hours a day to groom him, but now I only have to do this for an hour a time. The only thing, which is the hardest, is to skilfully comb him - then you can get the nicest shots. I began to film and shoot him from the first day I got him because I wanted to keep every single moment.

A community gardens project, a bread-baking initiative to help older people living in care homes and sheltered housing, and a children’s drama group are among those who will benefit this year. Up to \u0026pound3million has been awarded to 57 causes across the UK, making a massive impact on each deserving cause. It follows months of planning for the campaign, which led to a 2 week voting window to decide which which groups and organisations would finally be declared winners out of a shortlist of 95 projects across all 19 regions.  In each region, the three projects with the most public votes received grants of up to \u0026pound50,000 to help them continue their work to bring people together, build stronger communities and improve the lives of thousands of people across the country. So to show just how much you are helping incredible community groups make a difference with National Lottery funding, here’s a look at just some of this year’s The People’s Projects winners.... Learning for the Fourth Age – Baking A Difference A Leicester-based baking project pioneered by Learning for the Fourth Age (L4A) is raising the roof after receiving \u0026pound43,000 of National Lottery funding having been voted one of the regional winners of The People\u0027s Projects 2018. The Baking A Difference scheme, which started last year, uses bread baking to bring older people in care homes and sheltered \u2028housing together with local communities. “We are excited to get this funding because, although it is a simple idea, there are so many ways to explore it,” says project manager Fiona Smith. “Creative bread making sparks conversations, it keeps hands and minds busy, it offers physical activity and fun.” The money will help widen the project to other care homes and sheltered housing in Leicestershire, pay for the time and materials of a professional baker and train and mentor volunteers. “The idea is to create bonds of friendship and reduce feelings of loneliness, isolation or boredom,” adds Fiona. Shining Stars ASN Theatre School - Shining Stars Community Adventure  Theatre project Shining Stars Community Adventures is centre stage after receiving \u0026pound43,000 of National Lottery funding having been voted one of the regional winners of The People\u0027s Projects 2018. The money will allow the group, based in Coatbridge near Glasgow, to take inspirational performances across the country. Shining Stars ASN (Additional Support Needs) Theatre School was started by Katie Slavin for children, young people and adults with additional support needs. There are lessons in drama, musical theatre and dance, sensory drama, drama therapy, a film club and Makaton signing choir. Katie says: “Now we can travel across the country to perform and go on days out. The children and adults who come here are amazing. It makes my life so happy.” Billingham Environmental Link Programme LTD - Growing Our Community  Stockton-on-Tees can create vibrant green space for all ages after winning almost \u0026pound50,000 of National Lottery funding thanks to the members of the public who voted for them to be one of the regional winners of The People\u0027s Projects 2018.

At first, Jo Naylor told her sporty daughter Amelia, 10, to ‘stop being silly’ when she fell on the grass after crossing the finish line following the 2km run. But when she saw her daughter’s eyes roll back in her head and noticed that she was not breathing, the nurse and mum-of-two quickly went into first aid mode. Mrs Naylor said that it had just been a normal day before the terrifying incident at Swithland St Leonard’s CofE School in Loughborough. “I thought she was a bit slow, I seem to remember shouting ‘pick up your pace,’” she said.  During the race, Amelia, who was house captain of the running team, had slowed down to help a friend who was struggling. But after she crossed the finish line, it was Amelia who suddenly needed urgent, life-saving help. “She lay down on the grass and said, ‘Oh mummy I can’t breathe.’ “She became unresponsive. Her eyes were rolling back and she wasn’t answering me. It was clear she was not messing around,” Mrs Naylor said. She called for an ambulance and then realised that her daughter was not breathing. With tears in her eyes recounting the incident, Jo continued: “I laid her on her back, lifted her chin and double checked to see if she was breathing then, but she definitely was not.  “I gave her mouth to mouth, and she didn’t respond. So I checked for a pulse, I could not feel one so I started chest compressions. After one minute I thought she’d sit up,” Mrs Naylor said. But when her young daughter remained slumped and unresponsive, the nurse knew she was in cardiac arrest. In a cardiac arrest, the heart suddenly stops pumping blood around the body, quickly starving the brain of oxygen and causing the patient to fall unconscious and stop breathing. Without CPR or urgent medical attention, a cardiac arrest quickly proves fatal. So Mrs Naylor gave her daughter chest compressions and mouth-to-mouth for 20 long minutes which kept her oxygenated and alive while they waited for help.  When the ambulance arrived, paramedics grabbed a defibrillator to shock her heart in the hope that it would reestablish Amelia’s normal rhythm. “The ambulance guy gave her a single shock. Her heartbeat stopped. And then it restarted. It was so exciting,” Mrs Naylor said through tears of emotion. Amelia was rushed to hospital where surgeons discovered that her left coronary artery was connected in the wrong place. She was operated on at Glenfield hospital in Leicester where doctors corrected the faulty connection, and Amelia, who collapsed on September 13 last year, was well enough to return to school last November. But Mrs Naylor knows that without the bystander CPR her daughter received, she would have died before the ambulance arrived that day. She said that CPR is a simple but life-saving skill that everyone can and should learn and she has shared her story ahead of the fifth annual Restart a Heart Day on October 16 which aims to teach a record-breaking 200,000 people life saving skills. Mrs Naylor said: “Doing something is better than doing nothing. I remember as a student nurse saying ‘you can’t get any deader than dead.’  “If someone has collapsed and their heart has stopped you cannot do any harm but you can help. “Simple skills save lives. Everybody in the family now knows how to do CPR. Everyone in the whole world should know how to do it. You never know when you’re going to need it. If you give it a try you might just save a life. Every year, there are more than 30,000 cardiac arrests outside of hospitals in the UK and less than 10% of these people will survive. But if CPR is started early, it can double a person’s chance of survival. The Restart a Heart campaign, led by Resuscitation Council (UK), St John Ambulance, and other organisations aims to improve these shockingly low survival rates. On Tuesday 16 October, organisations all over the world will join forces to increase public awareness of cardiac arrests and increase the number of people trained in CPR. Events will be hosted in schools, community centres, hospitals and emergency service stations to train people in essential life saving skills.

The Ryanair employee was seriously injured after the commander of flight FR-3247 from Stuttgart, Germany, attempted to correct an overspeed, UK investigators have found. The plane was at 40,000ft and the pilot was about to bring the plane into land last January when a strong wind sent the Boeing 737’s speed up from 600 to 630mph in just than 30 seconds - setting off a warning alarm. According to the Air Accidents Investigation Branch report, he reacted by applying ‘double the pressure needed’ on the control. The sudden movement made two flight attendants working in the galley - the plane’s kitchen - fall and one was left with a broken ankle. The 31-year-old commander later said he’d suffered a ‘startle effect’ - when a pilot makes a ‘reflex reaction due to exposure to a sudden, intense event that violates their expectations’. It was around 4.45pm last January when the pilot was preparing to descend with both the autopilot and autothrottle engaged. There was no turbulence and the seatbelt signs were off, the Manchester Evening News reports . When the windspeed display started to rise, the pilot later reported, the autopilot ‘appeared not to be correcting the condition, and thinking that he had little time to react, he simultaneously pressed the autopilot disengage button his control wheel and pulled back on the control column. “His intention was to avoid the overspeed as smoothly as possible using manual control inputs.”   Luton Airport workers vote in favour of strikes meaning potential travel chaos for Brits over the bank holiday weekend and school half term  But data analysis showed the pilot’s pressure on the control column increased from 0.51lbs to 42.76lbs. This was ‘double the pressure required’ to disconnect the autopilot. All 89 passengers were unharmed and the plane went on to have a safe landing in Manchester. Afterwards, the pilot - who had been flying with Ryanair since 2010 and had recorded 4,997 flight hours - reported that he was aware of the possibility of encountering a jetstream in the descent but had not seen the airspeed increase to this extent before. “At the time he thought he was managing the manoeuvre gently but with hindsight he suspected that startle effect caused him to exert more force on the control panel than intended,” said investigators in the report, adding: “The commander commented that he learned from his experience, particularly in relation to managing the reduced operational margins and handling sensitivities of the aircraft at high altitudes.” Related video - Woman has mid-flight tantrum as passengers demand her removal "},{"url":null,"title":"school bans pencil cases fancy","story":"NewsSchool bans pencil cases and fancy backpacks to stop \u0027stigma\u0027 for poorer childrenThe school was poverty proofed by a charity who found it costs £581 a year for each pupil to attend\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByTom WilkinsonKelly-Ann Mills17:05, 11 MAY 2018NewsPencil cases are banned (Image: Creatas Video+)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA headteacher has banned fancy pencil and posh backpacks after experts claimed it costs children almost \u0026pound600 a year to join in. Pauline Johnstone, head at at St Wilfrid\u0027s Primary School in Blyth, Northumberland, aims to minimise the stigma poorer pupils face. The measure were introduced after the charity Children North East carried out a \u0027poverty-proofing\u0027 audit of the school. It found that including uniform, meals, trips and optional after-school event, parents would need to fork out \u0026pound581 for each of their children.  During the audit pupils of all ages gave their feedback about their experiences. Mrs Johnstone said: As a school we had thought we did OK, it was all very equal and children didn\u0027t feel disadvantaged. It was quite difficult to listen to some of the feedback. Children reported it was very obvious that some of them did not have the same things everyone else had, she said. The school took the decision to ban designer pencil cases - some of which can cost more than \u0026pound10 - as well as no longer demanding parents make donations for pupils\u0027 dress down days and introducing a standard backpack. She added: There was a culture within the school, within pupils, that noticed those children who were never in on PE days for example.  While children who receive free school meals usually went unnoticed, they were identifiable to others on trips out as their packed lunches came in a brown paper bag, the head said. Mrs Johnstone said there was initial anxiety from parents about the pencil case ban, but the majority could see why we were doing it. She added: We don\u0027t lose out on the lovely things we do, we make sure they are much more cost effective. Children North East\u0027s chief executive Jeremy Cripps told the BBC the project had improved behaviour and helped more pupils take part in extra-curricular activities.

Forecasters are keeping watch of a ridge of high pressure on course to skirt the British Isles and lure warm and sunny weather back towards the country. Values are expected to rise up to 4-8C above normal for the time of year on Monday and Tuesday as warm air from the south dislodges the current cool and unsettled westerly airflow. Some computer models are indicating highs could reach close to 20C in north-east England by Tuesday, and up to 15-19C elsewhere. The best of the weather will be in central and north-east England where high pressure will supply a brief window of sunshine and high temperatures.  However, scattered showers are still likely in the south and west on Monday, followed by further outbreaks on Tuesday - although these will be largely confined to north-east Scotland. The balmy outlook comes after forecasts of heavy rain and thunder in parts of the west this weekend as a series of lows from the Atlantic take charge. Temperatures will also dip below average in places over the two days, with risk of frost in Northern Ireland and Wales, before rising sharply from Monday.  Katie Greening, forecaster of The Weather Channel , said the mercury will spike early next week after a bout of cool and unsettled weather over the weekend.

The bud was removed by Neel Raithatha, at the Hear Clinic in Oadby, Leicestershire. He filmed the removal, which makes for grim watching. Neel said: The client reported muffled hearing in the right ear.  Fortunately, the eardrum was healthy and intact and it took around a minute to remove. It was a delicate procedure given the cotton bud was pushed right up against the eardrum. I had to ensure I did not exert any force whilst removing as I could have easily have perforated the eardrum in doing so.

Even before their wedding seven years ago, Kate was a fixture in the public eye, popping in and out of Mahiki, shopping on the King\u0027s Road and being spotted skiing with William and their aristo chums. The couple dated for 10 years prior to getting engaged, and even squeezed in one break-up. While we know William had ex girlfriends , little is known about Kate\u0027s romantic history. But, believe it or not, she does have one... There are some very handsome men lurking in her past, and it definitely looks like she had a type. Willem Marx The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge met at university, meaning they\u0027ve known each other for pretty much all of their adult lives.  However, before university, Kate dated Willem Marx, who is now a reporter and, according to his Twitter bio, author of Balochistan at a Crossroads (the proceeds of which going to Polio eradication). London-based Willem works for CNBC and covers geopolitical and company news across Europe including Brexit , US-Europe relations and international security. Now happily married to Italian TV presenter Johanna Botta with whom he has one son, Willem was Kate\u0027s first love, as one friend told the . Henry Ropner News in 2007 that William and Kate had split shocked the British public, who\u0027d assumed they\u0027d soon be announcing their engagement. While this separation was short-lived, Kate reportedly didn\u0027t waste her time moping into a bottle of cheap Chardonnay like the rest of us would.  As well as becoming a firm fixture on the London nightclub scene, she was also rumoured to have dated Henry Ropner. Another tall, handsome and wealthy man, Henry\u0027s family own a \u0026pound33.7 million shipping management firm.  Henry has since married Natasha Sinclair, a businessman’s daughter, and now lives in Somerset.  Rupert Finch William wasn\u0027t Kate\u0027s only university romance. Step forward another tall and impossibly handsome man - Rupert Finch - who was in his final year of studying law when he and Kate met. The pair dated for just under a year. He is now a solicitor in London and married to the Marquess of Reading\u0027s daughter, Lady Natasha Rufus Isaacs.

Pamela and Chad Holbrook caught the creature in Charleston Harbour, South Carolina, and shared the finding online. Mrs Holbrook, 32, said it was a sheepshead fish, which are tough to catch, often stealing bait from the line. They crush barnacles, oysters, and crabs with those teeth, she said. They are not sharp like what we think of as incisors. But some of the teeth toward the front are skinnier like our incisors and then they go backwards to molars - well, kind of like molars. They have to have teeth to be able to rip out and then crush down the shell of oysters and barnacles.  Pamela, a marine biologist, said that one key difference between the sheepshead\u0027s teeth and human teeth was that the fish\u0027s came in rows. They don\u0027t have sets where they have \u0027baby\u0027 teeth then permanent ones come in, she said. They can hurt and crush your fingernail if they\u0027re bigger. So you\u0027ll never see a seasoned fisherman with his fingers in a sheepshead mouth. She added that the fish was delicious to eat, for those able to catch it. She said: They\u0027re fun but tricky to catch, because you can\u0027t feel them so it\u0027s hard to know sometimes. They are also really good bait snatchers! It\u0027s my favorite fish to eat hands down. It\u0027s firm, white meat with no fishy taste.

Dramatic video captured from the vehicle behind the family, believed to be from France, shows the big cats dashing towards the family at Beekse Bergen in the Netherlands. Seconds before the near horrifying encounter, a woman and whom appears to be a teenage boy were filmed leaving their black-coloured car to photograph cheetahs lying down in the park.

It was a horrible thing to experience and you start to panic.”Lewis Campbell, the Scottish Ambulance Service’s east regional director, said: “Our crews are highly trained in keeping their cool and dealing with these kinds of emergency situations.“While this may have been a routine call for them, Irena and Valerie, the two paramedics who helped Ms Grant, did a great job – we’re very proud of them and we’re grateful for Ms Grant’s thanks.“The crew arrived within minutes of the Scottish Ambulance Service receiving the emergency call and did a magnificent job.“It’s great to know Ms Grant and baby Rosie are doing well.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5af41287f04c1-846x564.jpg ","title":"dundee waterfront office blocks attracting international attention but business park snubbed","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe leader of Dundee City Council has expressed his disappointment at the state of disrepair parts of the technology park have fallen into, describing some areas as an “eyesore”.John Alexander was speaking at a meeting of West End Community Council when he addressed questions from members of the public.Topics included Site 6 and the Dundee One building, as well as the empty units at the Technology Park.Mr Alexander said while there were international investors looking to occupy the new Dundee One building, next to City Quay and the Apex Hotel, the technology park was being largely overlooked.He added that companies were choosing to ignore premises on the edge of the city in preference for central locations.He said: “The conversations I’ve had seem to suggest companies aren’t looking for sites on the edge of the city.“Dundee One has received inquiries from agents in Edinburgh, Glasgow and London with an active interest in going in there.“We are receiving international attention and those international investors are looking at places such as Dundee One and the city centre — they are not looking at the technology park.“I wish they were, because some of these sites are an eyesore at the moment but we can’t make people go into these premises.”Winston Phair, a director of Bawnmeadows Ltd, which owns North Shore House in the technology park, said there had been interest in the site in the last 12 months.He said: “A planning application for a car dealership was submitted but based on the feedback the application was withdrawn.“There are still notes of interest in the site and we hope for updates on future developments within the next year.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5af2bdd4a9e6e-900x564.jpg ","title":"magnificent back line delights dundee boss mccann","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee manager Neil McCann hailed a “magnificent” defensive display from his side as they laid to rest any relegation worries with a 1-0 win at Ross County.Going into the game in Dingwall, the Dark Blues were still not mathematically assured of survival, with Partick Thistle six points behind with two games to play.In the end, Thistle’s defeat at home to Motherwell meant Dundee would be safe anyway.However, Neil and his players wanted to get the job done themselves and did so thanks to Simon Murray’s 51st-minute header.Neil said: “It’s always a horrible position to be in.“I came into the job in this sort of position last season and it wasn’t enjoyable but we did the business pretty quickly in our first three games but Tuesday night it was still rolling on.“We wanted to do it off our own back, under our own steam and win the game.“I felt Ross County were the better side in the first 20 minutes, we started getting our foot on the ball and began to play a wee bit.“I was unhappy with them at half-time with the start of the game and, indeed, at the start of the second we coughed up a chance.“However, when we play we know we are a difficult side to contain and we were always looking to hit them on the break once we got the first goal.”With their own survival at stake, the Staggies were desperate for a goal that could give them a lifeline.The Dundee defence, though, held firm.Neil added: “I thought we defended magnificently well in the second half as they threw everything at it. There’s a few dodgy ones with the ball bouncing around and maybe a suggestion of a penalty but I felt we were well worth our three points.”County were furious at referee Andrew Dallas’ decision to book Michael Gardyne for diving with five minutes to go.Co-manager Stuart Kettlewell said: “I know there is human error in football but at the end of the day these decisions are massive.“But if you get a penalty at that stage of the game who knows what happens, you have an opportunity to get level and build momentum to win the game.“We would love to know who is accountable because we just get fobbed off all the time.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5af41231a61f5.jpg ","title":"mind your own business travellers move in to car park outside closed dundee toys r us","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA group of travellers have moved into the car park outside Dundee’s former Toys ‘R’ Us store, just weeks after the shop closed.Two motorhomes and three caravans appeared at the Kingsway West Retail Park on Wednesday night, occupying the car park immediately outside the toy store that closed last month.The three caravans are parked directly across the store entrance, occupying disabled parking spaces.Cars have been parked alongside the motorhomes and there were also installations such as barbecue grills set up by those living there.The Tele approached those living in the caravans. Only one resident opened their door – and immediately closed it after being shown press identification.Another man swore and said “mind your own business” through a crack in his window when asked why he had parked on the site.City council officers are monitoring the situation but are yet to confirm whether they will visit.The Kingsway West Retail Park is owned by fund manager ARES, and managed by the commercial property firm GVA.Dundee City Council offers travellers a dedicated campsite on the outskirts of the city at Balmuir Wood, near Tealing.The site is six miles outside Dundee and has 20 pitches, each with its own utility unit with bathroom and shower and dedicated electricity supply.However, in the past, travellers have chosen to ignore this site and set up in areas closer to the city centre.Under current legislation, travellers can usually park on unauthorised council-owned land without issue, but may be visited by council officers to discuss their intentions.However, private landowners, such as the owners of the Kingsway West Retail Park, can call in the council or seek a court order to have travellers evicted. As a last resort, the police can also be called in.A police spokesman said: “Police Scotland can confirm it is aware of the situation and we will continue to monitor and liaise with Dundee City Council.”Dundee City Council said: “We are monitoring the situation.”The Dundee branch of Toys ‘R’ Us closed on April 24 after the company went into administration.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"ross county wide man michael gardyne on dundee and uniteds radar","story":"\t\t\t\t\tWIth survival assured on Tuesday night, Dundee boss Neil McCann’s “recruitment drive” for next season is up and running.And one possible arrival could be Ross County playmaker Michael Gardyne – though, the Dark Blues may well have competition from across the city on their hands.The Dundonian is out of contract at the end of this season and, with his roots down here, a move back might be on the cards.His history with Dundee United – where he played 37 times in season 2012/13 – however, makes Tannadice a more likely destination for the 32-year-old.That’s likely to be dependent on whether Csaba Laszlo’s men can win promotion to the top flight via the play-offs.The Dark Blues won’t comment on any possible signings but gaffer Neil has been able to get working on improving his squad for next season after the 1-0 win at Ross County saw them guaranteed a ninth-place finish.He said: “The plans we’ve been looking at over the past five or six months in terms of recruitment we can actually start to push forward with now and start a bit of a recruitment drive.“I don’t think you can ever push on it 100% until you know you’re going to be safe.“Tuesday’s win allows us to start forward thinking but there’s still business to be done.“I’m not going to disrespect Ross County by going into Saturday (against Partick) and taking the foot off the gas and go through the motions, because we have to be professional.”Partick sit two points ahead of the Staggies in 11th spot and still with the possibility of catching Hamilton and jumping to safety. That’ll take a swing of 13 goals, however.With Thistle at risk of automatic relegation if they are beaten by the Dark Blues on Saturday, Neil knows his side will have to be on their game if they are to finish the season off on a high at Dens Park.He added: “We have to look to win it and, if we do our business right, we can hold our heads high.“We want to win at home. We’ve got back-to-back wins in the split and we’re looking for three.“I charged the boys with the task of getting five wins from five games – we’ve had three out of four and we’ll look to go into Partick and make it four out of five.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/09/bowman-390x575.jpg ","title":"tannadice game chance for arabs","story":"\t\t\t\t\tBids are now being taken for fans wanting the chance to play at Tannadice in Dundee United legend Dave Bowman’s ninth annual charity match to raise funds for skin cancer and dementia charities.The game between fans making successful bids and a team of past tangerine greats takes place on Friday week with a 6.30pm kick-off.This year the fans’ team will be turning out in a special kit in honour of United’s roots as Dundee Hibernian.“This is now the ninth year of these games taking place and there is no doubt I am getting slower,” said Bowman.“The old fire is still burning so nobody better try to beat me on the park.“Seriously, this is always a great evening and a lot of fun and every year it makes me happy that players from all ability levels take part in the game.“It is all about enjoying the game.

However, they are not mathematically safe from falling into the play-off spot which Partick Thistle currently occupy.The Dee host Thistle in the last game of the season and are currently six ahead with a better goal difference – meaning they are practically safe. However, Neil is not taking anything for granted.He added: “Clearly we’re safe from the automatic spot but there’s still work to be done.
