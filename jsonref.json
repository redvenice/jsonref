There\u0027s no way there can be parity between the two.\u0027In terms of ruthlessness, I wouldn\u0027t expect anything less from the US, just to bang in goals.\u0027And, if anything, if I\u0027m going to be honest it\u0027s probably a good thing that it happened because now we understand there needs to be an improvement here, or perhaps the Thai federation will invest a bit more to grow the team.

An international study by a researcher in the Netherlands set out to examine just that.“My aim was not to find the best-known photograph in the world,” said Rutger van der Hoeven, a lecturer at the University of Utrecht. “My aim was to establish whether I could find evidence of a global visual memory – photographs of the past that are recognised by people all over the world.”The research was based on online surveys distributed via an international sampling company. A total of about 3,000 people – 250 iniduals representative of the national demographic in each of 12 countries, including the UK, US, China, Turkey, Brazil, India and Russia – completed the survey.Participants were shown 25 photographs tied to history and widely considered “iconic”, and asked if they had seen them before. The images included Migrant Mother by Dorothea Lange, Alberto Korda’s portrait of Che Guevara and Jeff Widener’s picture of the so-called Tank Man in Tiananmen Square.Van der Hoeven said he was not able to unpick whether people recognised a particular image or the event itself, something particularly relevant in the case of 911. While the photo used in the survey was widely published, the media also used many stills from video footage. For many of the images, patterns of recognition were not that different across various age groups, possibly because many of them are still commonly reproduced today.He said it was striking that of the 36 participants in China who could name the event to which the Tank Man image related, 24 said it conveyed a pro-democracy message – something others have suggested is a western interpretation.Other images included in the study included Abu Ghraib prisoner by Ivan Frederick, and Kevin Carter’s Vulture and Child – an image van der Hoeven found was far more widely recognised in countries in the global south, despite having won a Pulitzer prize in the US. While van der Hoeven noted the sample sizes were not large for each country, he said a tradeoff had to be made to reach a wide range of countries, and he hoped to repeat some of the research with larger groups."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b37cdc1cc5214ad0e1ef707e14aa7446e204bc3/0_0_3543_2126/master/3543.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=252fc9b7b22207bcd3cb340e79ddfe4a","title":"photographer stephen dupont looks back a picture essay","story":"The renowned Australian photographer chooses 10 of his most memorable images and explains why they had an impact. He is talking at Aperture, the southern hemisphere’s largest photography conference, held from 22 to 23 June in SydneyWhenever I travelled to Afghanistan I was always looking to tell the human stories of Afghans and how they cope with life under constant war. When I was covering the civil war between the Northern Alliance and the Taliban in late 1998, I came across this soldier along a front line near Bagram airfield, just north of the capital Kabul. When I saw his prosthetic arms I was compelled to make a rare (for me) set-up portrait. He then told me his story:I was not a soldier before I used to work for an international NGO de-mining company trying to rid the country of landmines. One day I was de-mining when one blew off my arms – a mine that had been planted by the Taliban. It was then that I decided to join up with the Northern Alliance and learned to shoot an AK-47 with my new arms so I could take revenge.For me photography has always been about having fun and there’s no better enjoyment then street photography. I have been going to Havana for many years now and it was and still is one of the best places in the world for street photography. The old-world charm of Cuba oozes through every crack and along every street corner. Also in public view are most people’s interiors. When you’re walking along the street you’re watching out for any moment outdoors but you are also drawn into the more private spaces as well. I saw this woman sitting just as she was from the street looking in. I stopped in my tracks and thought, should I? I walked to the door and through my very broken Spanish I asked if I could take her photograph. She said yes. The lighting was perfect, the setting incredible, everything was there for the taking. You don’t take photographs, you’re given them. Photography is a gift.Aside from Afghanistan, Papua New Guinea is the one country I have travelled in and photographed most. I had been inspired to go by the films by friend and colleague Bob Connolly and late-night stories from Mark Worth who sadly passed away some years ago. This photograph was taken on my first trip to PNG at an annual cultural festival in the Western Highlands capital Mount Hagen. I paid some locals to build me a makeshift grass hut studio and I invited sitters to be photographed.I was in Srinagar working on a story around war trauma. Kashmir is one of the world’s longest-running conflicts that dates back to the British partition of India and Pakistan. I wanted to look at the consequences of human suffering from the Indian side of Kashmir. I’d already been to the Pakistan side a year earlier. I covered the weekly protests, mainly young Muslim youths against Indian soldiers. Very similar to what I’d witnessed on many occasions in Israel and Palestine, a kind of David v Goliath scenario. I received a minor injury when an Indian soldier shot a stun grenade directly at me and it hit the top of my foot. I photographed them dragging off protestors into trucks. At some point I found myself inside the main psychiatric hospital. I had a really good fixer who got me in and I worked frantically knowing that my access was unique and that I would be tossed out or worse at any time. It was visually strong and many of the patients were in there because of the effects of war.For me a good war photograph must be an anti-war photograph. War is a nasty business and traumatises both the killers and the victims. While embedded with the US marines in Kunar province in 2005 I was out on a routine patrol with them as they searched for insurgents or weapons caches. I noticed that the marine in front of me stopped at the corner of a mud wall, trigger ready. As I framed my picture I could see an incredibly intense gaze from a young boy with other gazes and interesting compositions spilling the frame. For me this young boy summed up an entire nation’s feeling towards a foreign occupation. War also makes the youth fearless.Lately I have been digging through my archive looking for broken frames. These are photographs that have been unintentionally messed up, double exposed, light or emulsion leakage and x-ray damaged. This portrait I took of Tim Page is a personal favourite. Tim is a very close friend and I grew up wanting to be a photographer through his words and photographs. He was one of the inspirations for me to cover war. Tim is most famous for his coverage of the Vietnam war and I feel quite blessed not to just know the man but be invited right now to collaborate with him on a kind of retrospective book of his Nam pictures and contact sheets.In 2009 I had the fortune to be an artist in residence with the Sydney festival. A festival highlight was one of my all-time favourite bands Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds who would play Cockatoo Island. As I had an all-access pass, I found Nick Cave and Warren Ellis backstage before one of their gigs. I asked if I could take some portraits and Nick and Warren posed in a back room. After not even finishing a roll of 12 frames, Nick said “I think you got the shot” and they walked away. Happily I did get the shot, thank you Nick, you were right.I was covering the chaos and aftermath from the 1999 East Timorese referendum for independence. Pro-Indonesian militia were roaming streets killing people, soldiers were looting and burning down buildings as they prepared to depart by ships. I was among the first wave of journalists to arrive as the international community sent in foreign forces to bring stability and peace to the world’s newest nation. I flew in with the British on C130 Hercules and was met with total chaos throughout the city. Most folks had fled the city before we arrived and were still hiding in the nearby jungles. But slowly they returned as more and more foreign soldiers arrived, many from Australia. I took this photograph as a man was pushing a cart with a child inside of it and passed a former Indonesian military barracks that was on fire. I liked the caged symbolism of the child against the inferno-esque backdrop. I remember thinking it reminded me of scenes I had often seen from photographs taken in Cambodia during the genocide there.I can never forget this photograph because soon after I took the frame I was mugged. I was in Bucharest shooting a story around stray dogs (there were 300,000 in the city alone). Whenever I go to a new city I like to walk around and get a feel for the place and shoot street pictures. It was mid winter, snowing with that eastern European grey tinge to the place, when suddenly I was cornered by four men in trenchcoats. I had my Leica around my neck and my Hasselblad Xpan over my shoulder, maybe even a Rolleiflex as well. They asked for my wallet, took out all my cash and handed it back to me before moving on. All I could think about at that moment was what I was prepared to do if they went for my cameras. It was not even so much the cameras but the unexposed rolls of film I had inside them that I would have done pretty much any crazy thing to keep. I knew I had some great pictures and that is all my mind was focused on. I practically threw my wallet at them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/72fafac2b6991fb05a175660b5e8f5ca0b9e2421/0_0_3508_2466/master/3508.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=782fe7dc16da8b19a31fc7bf2f3eadf8","title":"observer new review summer book clinic send us your questions","story":"Heading on holiday but no idea what to read?

Wolf has already acknowledged that the book contains two errors, after an on-air challenge on BBC Radio 3 during which the writer and broadcaster Matthew Sweet told her that she had misunderstood the term “death recorded” in historical records as signifying an execution. In fact it denotes the opposite, Sweet pointed out, highlighting that a teenager she said had been “actually executed for sodomy” in 1859 was paroled two years after being convicted. Wolf said last month that she had thanked Sweet for highlighting the mistakes, and was correcting future editions.Houghton Mifflin Harcourt initially stood by plans to publish the book on 18 June in the US, describing the mistake over the executions as an unfortunate error, and declaring: “We believe the overall thesis of the book Outrages still holds.” But the publisher told the New York Times on Thursday that the book will be delayed. “As we have been working with Naomi Wolf to make corrections to Outrages, new questions have arisen that require more time to explore,” it said in a statement. “We are postponing publication and requesting that all copies be returned from retail accounts while we work to resolve those questions.”Wolf said on Friday morning that she strongly objected to the decision to postpone and recall, and that she would “do all I can to bring Outrages to American readers”.She said she had made necessary changes immediately following her BBC interview, adding that critics had “also introduced errors of their own”. The heart of her book, she said, was “not criminology … but censorship”, and “the chill felt by pioneers such as John Addington Symonds who tried to speak out about love”.Wolf’s UK publisher Virago confirmed on Friday that their edition would remain on sale. “Though the book received excellent reviews it also attracted criticism,” it said, adding that any necessary corrections would be made to future reprints.

And as the huge stock of second homes, buy-to-let and overseas properties starts to be passed on to younger generations, Britain risks becoming a country where getting ahead in life depends as much on what you inherit as what you earn.”Almost 2 million people own rental properties, up from about 1.2 million in 2008, while the total number of buy-to-let mortgages has risen by about 15 times since the turn of the millennium.A lack of new council homes being built to replace those sold under Margaret Thatcher’s right to buy policy has contributed to an imbalanced housing market, with a dearth of affordable homes, while increasing numbers live in private-rented accommodation.There are also concerns over the isions of wealth in modern Britain. House prices have boomed over the past decade since the financial crisis, while wage growth has stalled.The research, funded by the Nuffield Foundation, found that older generations in particular had benefited from the rise in property values, as property wealth typically takes years to accumulate. Around one in six people born in the 1950s report additional property wealth, the highest of any cohort.The rise in buy-to-let home ownership has led to the increasing transfer of wealth across the generational ide, as younger private renters line the pockets of older landlords. The research showed that the baby boomer generation born around the time of the second world war received more than half of all rental income in Britain.Although the figures provide the latest available snapshot of additional UK property wealth, the study paints a picture of a moment just before significant policy changes were introduced to clamp down on the boom in buy-to-let ownership.Against a backdrop of mounting concern over the falling number of homeowners in Britain, who are more likely to be Conservative voters, the former chancellor George Osborne introduced a range of tax relief and stamp duty reforms, as well as council tax exemption changes covering second homes.﻿"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6f86ca8064c265a195c4b6de22b6da677f16c256/0_325_6935_4160/master/6935.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=433a52b338d6ee1ac51db3291d3926fb","title":"the tokyo neighbourhood where people come to disappear","story":"For hundreds of years people have come to Sanya in search of labouring jobs, shelter and a sense of belonging – but the area is changing fast, and its residents are struggling to adaptAt first sight, Sanya looks much like any other Tokyo suburb: well-appointed homes, supermarkets and fast-food restaurants. In the distance, soaring above the rooftops and mesh of overhead power lines is the unmistakable shape of the Tokyo Skytree.But its proximity to the ultra-modern landmark is deceptive. Older men in well-worn tracksuits, baseball caps and plastic slippers clutch cans of early-afternoon chu-hi alcopops, and dozens of no-frills hostels advertise rooms with easily the lowest rates in the city – clues to Sanya’s status as a Tokyo neighbourhood like no other, but one that is struggling to adapt to irresistible change.In Tamahime park “Katchan” – an affectionate abbreviation of his name – is preparing to meet a friend. Nearby, beyond a makeshift tarpaulin home that boasts a flat-screen TV powered by solar panels, men pair up for games of shogi, their chessboard placed on an old filing cabinet. Behind them, a younger man removes all of his clothes and stares into the middle distance.“I’ve come here to drink, chat and enjoy the weather – sunlight is free after all,” says Katchan, a day labourer who moved to Sanya 16 years ago. “I only get very occasional work, but I’ve stayed here because this is where my friends are.”Katchan is among the last in a line of men who have come to Sanya for hundreds of years in search of jobs, shelter, and a sense of belonging.During the Edo period (1603-1868), itinerant workers who couldn’t afford regular inns elsewhere in the city took advantage of Sanya’s cheap kichinyado lodgings. After the war, it became home to tent villages for people who had been made homeless by US bombing raids.The military-issue tents, donated by Occupation forces, gradually made way for wooden hostels. By 1953, around 6,000 people lived in 100 hostels at its peak a decade later, the day labourer population had reached 15,000 people, scattered among more than 220 accommodations.But you won’t find Sanya on any modern maps. In 1966, the government ordered the name Sanya to be expunged from official records – it’s now ided into two districts, Kiyokawa and Zutsumi – in an attempt to camouflage its association with poverty, alcoholism, violence and the hiyatoi rodosha – day labourers.These are the men who built modern Japan in the decades after the war: Tokyo Tower, facilities for the 1964 Summer Olympics, the metropolitan expressway and other infrastructure that lay the foundations for the megalopolis of today.But the labourers and their home are undergoing changes that promise to transform the area beyond recognition.Like many other communities in Japan, Sanya is feeling the effects of the country’s skewed demographics. Most of the estimated 1,500 former labourers who live here are in their 60s and 70s, with a small number in their 80s and 90s. As they enter their twilight years, the hostels once occupied by exhausted manual workers have turned into de facto retirement homes for men surviving on meagre pensions and benefits.While violence is rare these days, Sanya’s increasingly erse inhabitants are dealing with new sources of tension, says Magokoro Yoshihira, the managing director of YUI Associates, a local community development group.The dwindling population of ageing labourers has an uneasy co-existence with established families who run factories and other small businesses, together with a rising number of younger people on benefits and foreign backpackers who stay at about 20 of the area’s 140 hostels, attracted by clean and comfortable rooms for a little over ¥2,000 (£15) a night.While travellers have softened the area’s image, a modest form of gentrification is also underway. Local authorities have long resisted major commercial developments, but they are powerless to prevent private landowners from demolishing their ageing hostels – many of which are considered a fire risk – to make way for more lucrative apartment blocks.“I can understand the landowners’ thinking,” says Yoshihira, “They believe they can make more money that way. But it’s not just changing the landscape. It means the area is slowly losing its old atmosphere. Sanya isn’t like other parts of Tokyo, so we need to retain some of its original feel.”There are frequent complaints about noise, drunken behaviour, rough sleeping and, the most common gripe - piles of litter, according to Yoshihira, who says Sanya’s unlikely mix of inhabitants exist in a state of “cold war”.“It’s turned into an ‘us versus them’ situation,” says Yoshihira, who runs three hotels in Sanya, two for backpackers and one for welfare recipients. Last year, her group opened Sanya Café to encourage residents and visitors to mix over reasonably priced food and drinks. “The cafe’s name is our way of taking back the Sanya name,” she says.“The former day labourers should be proud of themselves – they’re the men who rebuilt Tokyo, after all. But Japan as a nation has forgotten about them, and people around here are too quick to look down on them. We’re trying to show that ersity is a good thing, and that there’s nothing good about putting other people down to make you feel better about yourself.”Every Friday, Yoshihira and her colleagues encourage former labourers to join them collecting rubbish in exchange for a meal or drink at the cafe. “We eat together and chat, and it gives everyone a sense of belonging,” she says. “At the same time it’s important for Sanya to prepare for the next stage in its history.”That future is looking increasingly uncertain for former casual labourers who, forced to leave their condemned hostels, must either find another or be placed in state-subsidised housing, often in distant parts of the city.Some, like “Aizawa-san” – a Sanya resident, on and off, for three decades – simply end up spending occasional nights sleeping on the street.The 64-year-old is preparing for an afternoon looking for discarded aluminium cans that he will load into a sack on the back of his bicycle and exchange for cash – ¥100 for every kilogram he collects.“I don’t have any money left, which is why I have to collect cans,” says Aizawa, who complains that there is little left of his state pension once he has paid for hostel accommodation.“I’ve seen lots of changes over that time. There used to be riots, but it’s a more peaceful place these days, probably because we’re all too old to fight. Life is hard, but I can be a free spirit here.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8791ab025773bc8eea843f00f9b07911e301a3b7/0_102_5382_3229/master/5382.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6576025556bac123b920d38b0593e2eb","title":"brexit britain national humiliation uk eu","story":"The UK can only feel humiliated by the EU if it expects to be superior. This poisonous idea should be banishedLaunching his bid for the Tory leadership this week, Dominic Raab announced, histrionically: “We’ve been humiliated as a country.” For those of us who do not live on planet Brexit, this might have been mistaken for a belated reaction to the genuinely demeaning spectacle of Donald Trump’s state visit a week earlier. But, of course, like almost all of his fellow contenders to be the next prime minister, Raab was playing his part in a strange performance in which the national honour has been so horribly besmirched by the European Union that it can be salved only by taking the pain of a no-deal Brexit.Perhaps if you keep acting out phoney feelings, you end up not being able to recognise the real thing. Brexit Britain has been wallowing in a hyped-up psychodrama of national humiliation. It is, indeed, one of the very few things that remainers and leavers still share, even if they feel mortified for very different reasons. In relation to the EU, this sense of humiliation is wildly overplayed. But when Trump comes to town and really does degrade Britain, the sense of wounded dignity that ought to be felt seems curiously absent.Trump’s state visit sure looked like an episode of national humiliation. From the gratuitous insults tweeted about Sadiq Khan and the blatant interference in internal UK politics, to the sweeping demands as to what must be on the table in a prospective trade deal, to his openly patronising attitude to the serving prime minister, he acted like he was visiting one of his own resorts rather than a respected foreign country. And, even worse, the British state literally made a show of itself for him, rolling out its monarchy and its military as performers to entertain the emperor and his royal family of Trumps.Now, in a way, this is fine. Humiliation is not an objective reality. It is calibrated against one’s sense of one’s own status. If you’re used to travelling business class, you may feel humiliated by having to sit in economy but if you’ve always sat in economy, it’s just normal. So perhaps the willingness to suck up Trump’s domineering boorishness is a sign of realism, even of maturity – this is what’s it’s like to be a medium-sized country dependent on a superpower. Standing on one’s dignity is an indulgence Britain can no longer afford.Fair enough. But then how come the idea of national humiliation has loomed so large in Brexit? Shortly before the missed departure date of 29 March, a Sky Data poll asked: “Is the way Britain is dealing with Brexit a national humiliation?” Ninety per cent of respondents said yes. This idea of collective abasement is everywhere in the Brexit narrative. A random sample of headlines from across the spectrum tells the story: “Brexit and the prospect of national humiliation” (Financial Times) “Voice of the Mirror: Theresa May’s Brexit is a national humiliation” “A national humiliation: Never was so much embarrassment caused to so many by so few” () “‘Humiliating to have to beg’ for EU exit, says Arlene Foster” (). And so, endlessly, on.There is something hysterical in this constant evocation of humiliation. It is a cry of outraged self-regard: how dare they treat us like this?Yes, of course, the Brexit debacle has reduced Britain’s prestige around the world. And the withdrawal agreement negotiated by Theresa May is indeed a miserable thing when compared with the glorious visions that preceded it. But Britain has not been humiliated by the EU – the deal was shaped by May’s (and Arlene Foster’s) red lines. Britain did not get what the Brexiters fantasised about, but it did get what it actually asked for. That’s not humiliation.There is, of course, a long British tradition of phoney affront. When Britain was an aggressive imperial power, it was always on the lookout for intolerable slights to the national honour – think of the War of Jenkins’ Ear in the 18th century, when an assault on an English smuggler was the excuse for war with Spain. Perhaps when you are truly powerful, there is even a certain pleasure in imagining the opposite. As the poet and critic Wayne Koestenbaum has written: “Humiliation is bliss if the experience of largeness or magnitude has become overwhelming and unpleasant and you need relief.”But a feeling that provided relief from the overwhelming greatness of empire becomes ridiculous when you are no longer a great power. It becomes a mere posture. This is what happened to the idea of national humiliation in the Brexit mentality. At its heart, Brexit depends on the idea that Britain cannot be an ordinary European country and, therefore, that equality within the EU is inherently humiliating. The EU traps a business-class country in economy class, where it must writhe in resentment, hemmed in between lesser nations and tormented by visions of the silver service and fine wines it should be getting instead of “chicken or beef”.And yet we have the apparently untroubled self-abasement towards Trump. National humiliation, it seems, depends on which nation or group of nations is inflicting the offence. Mere equality with France and Germany and Spain is intolerably demeaning. Subservience to a loutish US president is not. Honour is impugned when the EU negotiates realistically but not when Trump casually abuses elected English politicians and interferes in the selection of the next prime minister.Britain is humiliated by the EU because it expects to be superior. It is not humiliated by Trump because, for all the illusion of a special relationship, it accepts that it is a junior partner. In one context, dominance is demanded in the other, subservience is accepted. So much for honour. “What,” Shakespeare’s Falstaff asks, “is honour?”, and he answers: “a word”. And so is its opposite, humiliation. But a dangerous word. It may have no substance, but it has the power to harm. It brings down with it an acid rain of corrosive emotions: the need, at all costs, not to lose face, the indulgence of self-pity, the demented idea that national pride can be restored only by the endurance of great pain.It needs to be banished from the Brexit discourse. Acknowledging reality is not humiliating. Accepting that you have made a mistake is not humiliating. If this poisonous word can be avoided when it has no meaning, perhaps it can be used when it really is called for.• Fintan O’Toole is a columnist with the  and author of Heroic Failure: Brexit and the Politics of Pain "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6f7057d2fabbe8ef8f6b948eb4e2e98b68890fb/0_24_5600_3360/master/5600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=37bc70582d5eafc2a887e4807cb93ab0","title":"the guardian view on the bbc a broadcaster not a welfare agency","story":"This week the BBC announced that next year most over-75s will have to pay to watch television. This is a wrongheaded and mean policy forced upon the BBC by former Conservative chancellor George Osborne, who should not have been allowed to load the cost of his damaging social and economic policies on to the corporation. Even worse, the Conservative government has broken a 2017 election promise that the licence fee would remain free to pensioners over the age of 75 for the duration of this parliament. It is the politics of the absurd for Downing Street to ask the BBC to revisit a “disappointing” decision after forcing the broadcaster to enact a policy the Conservative party had promised it would block.Unless the policy is reversed, the BBC will become a welfare agency that means-tests elderly people. It will be obliged to push through a cruel and unnecessary benefit cut that will affect 4.6m households which have no way of increasing their income to pay for it. Even taking into account those rich enough to pay and those exempted through pension credit, at least 2.5 million poor pensioners face an annual £150 bill. For more than a million of the oldest people in our country, television is their main form of company.Mr Osborne’s licence fee wheeze was to compel the corporation to agree to shouldering the expense out of its own £4bn licence fee income. But handing out free licences would have placed an ever-growing burden on the BBC’s finances. If it were to allow over-75s to continue watching for free then the BBC would have to have found about half a billion pounds in savings. That figure alone should put pay to the idea that somehow a few celebrity salaries could be cut to fill the gap. Mr Osborne and his ilk in the Conservative party do not care one jot for the potential extraordinary reputational risk the BBC faces. Such Tories perhaps have never thought much of the idea of universal public services cared little about enriching democratic debate and informing citizens or about the cultural consumption patterns of the nation.They perhaps could not see the problem if the BBC ends up taking a frail pensioner to court for not possessing a TV licence that for years they have had for free. This is a blindness brought on by ideology. This crude piece of politicking compromises the BBC’s independence. Of all the possible candidates for leadership of the Tory party, it seems only Sajid Javid’s team has understood this. This will not be lost on the Conservative members due to elect the next prime minister, who are likely to be closer to 75 than most of the population.About half a million people have already signed the Age UK online petition demanding the government takes back responsibility for funding free TV licences. There is an obvious opportunity to do so. Although the funding of the free TV licence regime ends in June 2020, the government will begin discussing the BBC’s funding settlement in 2021. Any costs incurred because of the over-75 strategy by the corporation between June 2020 and April 2022, when the new licence fee begins, should be covered by the government without jeopardising BBC services.From then onwards, if the state believes that pensioners should have free services, it ought to pay for them. The UK’s licence fee model, in which advertisements or subscription fees are not part of funding, is also present – but far more expensive – in Denmark, Sweden and Norway. Britain’s media market is large enough to make investment here worthwhile, but not so big that there’s no reason to export. Netflix will set up a UK office Apple TV will launch and Amazon is hiring. It’s true that the BBC can loom too large in parts of the media landscape, but it faces being shrunk by US media giants and a politics inimical to public service broadcasting."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de35b4fb7de02f4129f49c906334a451a85169d6/0_495_7350_4410/master/7350.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1270266831fdac3cf9eb08ebbc925633","title":"the rise of the conscious consumer how to shop responsibly","story":"The way we shop is changing for the better, helped by a new breed of independent brands and carefully curated retail destinations, such as Coal Drops Yard, providing a thoughtful, ethical approach to consumptionWhen it comes to shopping, sustainability has never been more front and centre in our minds – from Adidas committing to using only recycled plastic by 2024 to Elle magazine dedicating last year’s September issue to sustainable fashion, and the ’s associate fashion editor Jess Cartner-Morley stating: “I’m going to change what I wear and what I write about”. Garment production has doubled in the past 15 years, with £140m worth of clothes a year ending up in landfill – and it’s a situation shoppers are very mindful of.And, in these times of digital overload, we’re rediscovering the joy of a bricks-and-mortar experience. Forward-thinking new retail districts are reimagining the traditional high street, putting an emphasis on storytelling and craftsmanship with stores for customers to spend time in. Coal Drops Yard is one such destination. As the name suggests, the warren of Victorian brick viaducts was originally built to house coal. In the 1990s, the warehouses became a new home for the clubbing scene, and now the area has reinvented itself once again as London’s most progressive shopping and restaurant district, home to a new crop of fashion and lifestyle brands encouraging shoppers to practise a more mindful kind of consumption.Tracey Neuls, a cult footwear designer who has been producing handmade shoes for the past 19 years, is just one example of a craftsperson pushing for conscious consumption. Each new design is sculpted by Neuls in clay, then produced by a Portuguese atelier using Italian leather from ethical tanneries. In her Coal Drops Yard boutique, shoes hang from the ceiling on ribbons, to be admired and encircled like mini works of art.“The rise in disposable fashion is having a wonderful knock-on effect of creating a new shopper who is more interested in quality than quantity,” explains Neuls. “Excess and choice are being replaced by emotive purchases that people intend to have around for years. We have customers who have described our shoes that they bought some 10 years ago as if they were talking about their pets – with the same attachment and love.”Neuls’ philosophy is shared by her Coal Drops Yard neighbour, leather goods brand LPOL. Founded by husband and wife team Katy Bell and John Maskell, they put responsible material sourcing and zero waste at the centre of everything they do. “As designers, we’re concerned with three things: fabric, form and function,” they explain. “The sole aim is to combine them effortlessly, sustainably and desirably in the best traditions and progression of our craft.”Meanwhile, clothes that haven’t found such long-term relationships (yet) are welcomed at Boutique by Shelter, where secondhand garments get a new lease of life. Furnished with salvaged materials and stocked with a covetable pick-and-mix of designer, high street and vintage donations, all at a fraction of the original price. But the store’s appeal goes far beyond bargains – it’s a community hub, a volunteering scheme, a source of vital funds to end homelessness and a way to tackle fashion’s waste problem.The new wave of conscious consumption doesn’t only mean caring for the planet it’s about the human impact, too, supporting businesses that strive to do good on both sides of the counter, and this is reflected in Coal Drop Yard’s retailers. Form\u0026ampThread champions fair pay for its factory workers Beija London strives to make more inclusive underwear, designed for women of all sizes with comfort and empowerment at heart and design practice and community space STORE Store addresses social imbalance within art, design and architecture by hosting creative courses for the general public, with a special focus on creating new opportunities for young people from disadvantaged backgrounds.Trying harder is something we could surely all be doing. But while responsible shopping is just that – a responsibility, to do our due diligence and look a little harder at our habits – it’s not to say it shouldn’t be a pleasure, too. Neuls feels that the secret to more conscious shopping is foregoing trends and following your instinct. “If you shop with the view to invest in footwear that doesn’t go out of fashion, that makes you feel confident and makes you smile, then you are on the right track,” she says. And that’s an emotional investment as much as a financial one.In fact, most sustainability champions agree that it’s positivity – not guilt, shame or scary statistics – that drives the best trade. Make people feel bad about themselves, and they seek solace in a high street binge. But make us feel good about ourselves, and we’ll make good choices. The Coal Drops Yard approach might just be the future of shopping – do it slowly, and do it in style.To find out more about Coal Drops Yard’s carefully curated offerings, head to coaldropsyardshop-eat-drink"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4dea982eea6d40444a947b589fb5a717ba3d8fb4/0_229_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aad3dcb7fd4ac23d8925c6c5b5b31d35","title":"pope francis declares climate emergency and urges action","story":"Addressing energy leaders, pope warns of ‘catastrophic’ effects of global heatingPope Francis has declared a global “climate emergency”, warning of the dangers of global heating and that a failure to act urgently to reduce greenhouse gases would be “a brutal act of injustice toward the poor and future generations”.He also endorsed the 1.5C limit on temperature rises that some countries are now aiming for, referring to warnings from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change of “catastrophic” effects if we crossed such a threshold. He said a “radical energy transition” would be needed to stay within that limit, and urged young people and businesses to take a leading role.“Future generations stand to inherit a greatly spoiled world.

It followed a similar meeting last year, but this time the Pope’s stance was tougher as he warned that time was running out and urged them to hear “the increasingly desperate cries of the earth and its poor”.The chief executives or chairs of BP, ExxonMobil, Shell, Total, ConocoPhilips, Chevron and several major investors including BlackRock and Hermes, responded by calling on governments to put in place carbon pricing to encourage low-carbon innovation, and called for greater financial transparency to aid investors.However, they made no pledges to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, and set no timetable for action.In two statements, which came at the end of a two-day meeting in the Vatican that was addressed by the pope and led by senior Vatican churchmen, the signatories called for a “combination of policies and carbon pricing mechanisms … designed in a way that simultaneously delivers innovation and investment in low-carbon solutions while assisting those least able to pay”.The oil companies’ pledges did not go far enough, said Mel Evans, climate campaigner for Greenpeace UK. “The oil majors knew all about the risk from climate change many years before most of us first heard about it. They knew where we were heading, they knew their products were the cause, and yet they kept it quiet and lobbied for business as usual,” said Evans. “And they’re still lobbying for business as usual. When it comes to saving the planet they will do what they are forced to do, and no more, which is why we’re having to block them from drilling new oil wells as we speak. Expecting leadership from them is a path to certain disaster.”Emissions are rising at their fastest level in close to a decade, BP said this week, leaving an ever shorter period to prevent dangerous levels of global heating. Every year of high emissions takes the world closer to the brink, because it adds to the stock of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which can take a century to dissipate. Last month, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere showed the second highest annual increase since continuous records began more than 60 years ago.On Friday, BP served an injunction on the Greenpeace ship Arctic Sunrise to try to prevent it joining the activists occupying the oil company’s rig in Cromarty, Scotland. Greenpeace is trying to highlight the dangers of new oil drilling, which it says will gravely worsen the climate emergency.In previous speeches, the pope has slammed “the continued search for new fossil fuel reserves” and said “fossil fuels should remain underground”.Bob Dudley, chief executive of BP, said after the Vatican meeting: “The world needs to take urgent action to get us on a more sustainable path and it is critical that everyone plays their part – companies and investors, governments and iniduals. This requires all of us to come together, build understanding and collaborate to find solutions. Constructive dialogues such as this meeting are essential in aligning key players on the steps needed to accelerate the energy transition while still enabling advances in human prosperity. I am grateful to his Holiness for continuing to support this critical engagement.”BP’s chief economist warned this week that the world “should not rely on the generosity of the private sector” when it came to investing in key clean technologies such as carbon capture and storage, and called for the government to use taxpayers’ money to fund such initiatives instead.BP’s profits doubled last year to a five-year high as its output of oil and gas soared.Mark Campanale, founder and executive director of the Carbon Tracker, said: “We must forego business-as-usual protocols and short-term market-driven goals or face environmental and financial ruin of catastrophic proportions. Oil and gas companies have a crucial role to play in transitioning to a low-carbon economy but must today collectively take those hard decisions in the wake of determined investor and public pressure, and unambiguous scientific evidence.”The IPCC warned last year that the world had about a decade to bring greenhouse gases under control, or face a probable rise in temperatures well beyond the 1.5C above pre-industrial levels they warned would bring devastating effects such as droughts, floods, heatwaves and damage to agriculture."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c1b5d2d8b972e2616bb82625957a6132fbe3ecc5/0_98_5184_3111/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6f1b48e0b72a949fc212e88ee7c3b5ae","title":"australias oldest things how mind boggling timelines meet the climate emergency","story":"They were here before us and should live on long afterwards. With 12 years to avert catastrophe, we need to imagine the aeons to come and consider the creatures that outlive usWilbur the tortoise has, in all probability, lived more than a hundred years.“From his size and weight and general health,” says Adam Lee, a reptile keeper at the Melbourne zoo, “we put him at about 110 but there’s no real way of telling with giant tortoises unless you have them from birth or as a hatchling.”Lee holds out a carrot and Wilbur snaps at it.He seems, in certain respects, even older than that – ancient, even prehistoric. He scrabbles on the concrete floor with ungainly dinosaur feet. When I stroke his massive shell, I can feel the scratches on the keratin. He snuffles as he eats, his leathery jaw jutting irritably, as if he were an aggrieved pensioner discussing franking credits.Yet the idea that this creature, happily munching his carrot, predates the first world war astonishes me.Lee explains that giant tortoises (or “GTs”, as he calls them) can live more than 200 years, perhaps reaching 250.This sounds preposterous. But I already know of Jonathan, a giant tortoise estimated to have been born in 1832 but still alive and well on the island of St Helena in the South Atlantic.And there, at the feet of those long-dead gentlemen, stands Jonathan, looking entirely the same as he does in photos from 2019.On the day of my visit, Melbourne is blustery, so much so that Lee warns via email not to expect “much GT action”, since Wilbur and his slightly younger companion (perhaps 90), Little John, both dislike the cold.I can’t bring myself to complain, given the prolonged warmth of Victoria’s autumn.In our times, unseasonal temperatures – even when pleasant – fill me with a vague dread. The novelist Delia Falconer discusses climate change ushering in “a new age of signs and wonders”, in which the most commonplace occurrences (a warm evening, the absence of birdlife at a particular spot, an unexpected change in vegetation) feel fraught with ecological portent.“As the world becomes more unstable in the grip of vast and all-pervasive change,” Falconer writes, “it’s difficult to discern exact chronologies, relationships and meaning.”More than anything, I think, climate change politicises time.Lord Byron considered the sea “the image of eternity”. For us, however, it means flux and uncertainty, with new research suggesting the oceans could rise as much as two metres by 2100.“Time is money,” warned Benjamin Franklin, and the extractive industries built fortunes taking him at his word. Fossil fuels depend on million-year old geological processes so that, in a sense, industrial society runs by burning natural history.The emergence of Greta Thunberg as a global leader highlights the temporal inequity of climate change, a burden shrugged off by the old on to the young.According to the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, we have, perhaps, 12 years to avoid catastrophe – and one of those years has nearly passed. Yet, though we must act immediately, we need to imagine the aeons to come, planning for outcomes well beyond the threescore years and ten that scripture allots to a man.Hence my interest in Wilbur and the other creatures whose lives extend longer than our own.In 2007 biologists identified a 50-ton bowhead whale caught near Alaska as more than 115 years old by examining pieces of a particular harpoon stuck in its shoulder bone. Because whalers only used that patented variety of exploding lance for a brief window in the late 1880s, the fragments confirmed scientists’ suspicion that bowheads could live several centuries – providing, of course, they weren’t harpooned first.Three years ago researchers from the University of Copenhagen dated a female Greenland shark as 392 years old.As the ’s Nicola Davis explained, that means the animal “was born during the reign of James I, was a youngster when René Descartes set out his rules of thought and the great fire of London raged, saw out her adolescent years as George II ascended the throne, reached adulthood around the time that the American revolution kicked off, and lived through two world wars”.It’s a mind-boggling chronology, an illustration of just how wondrous our planet remains.Yet there’s a less ennobling aspect to the story.Where the Alaskan whale was classified by a projectile scar, scientists established the shark’s age because of an atomic bomb. The nuclear tests conducted in the 1950s sent spikes of carbon-14 into the food chain of the North Atlantic, which then provided a kind of date stamp, marking a particular layer of proteins as they grew on the poor fish’s eye.The oldest creatures carry marks from the people of the past and so remind us of the scars we’re already leaving on lives in the future. That becomes even more obvious when we turn from the animal kingdom to the realm of plants, the demesne in which the true ancients reside.When I ask the Australian National University’s Dr Matthew Brookhouse, an academic and forester, about the longest living trees in Australia, he tells me that a great deal depends on what classifies as life.“What we need to define is the age of what we’re interested in: is it the age of the organism or is it the age of the stem?”If we focus on the stem – the bit that looks like our traditional notion of a tree – then certain Huon pines can be dated as 2,000 years old, making them more or less contemporaneous with Jesus.“But what we see as the tree,” Brookhouse continues, “is really just the current aerial projection of the organism, like a potato or like a daffodil bulb. What’s lying below the ground is the longer term embodiment of that organism.”On that basis, particular clumps of Huon pine could be said to have lived for perhaps 11,000 years, with vegetative cloning rendering the “inidual” trees genetically identical.Other forms of clonal life stretch way back into deep time. A stand of king’s holly in Tasmania has been alive for an unthinkable 43,000 years, while the Wollemi pine of the Blue Mountains west of Sydney seems to have been cloning itself for even longer.There is, Shakespeare said, “no clock in the forest” and the Wollemi pine proves his point.Brookhouse specialises in dendrochronology, the science of tree rings. The field itself stretches way back in history, with the ancient Greeks aware that trees produced new rings each year and Leonardo da Vinci describing the correlation between ring thickness and climate.“Except for those very long records from ice cores, the temperature reconstructions ning thousands of years come from tree rings,” Brookhouse says. “Much of what we know about how unusual the current temperatures are comes from trees.”Experts described this year’s bushfires in Tasmania as “unprecedented”, with the blazes devastating some of the oldest forests in the state. King’s holly will, in all likelihood, become extinct in the wild, partly because of fires and partly from an introduced pathogen called phytophthora, something that also menaces the Wollemi pine.Does Brookhouse feel an emotional tug when studying such ancient trees?“Absolutely. I have a sense of quiet respect for an organism that predates us all.” He hesitates. “Actually, the emotional response to plants of that age is strongest when you see them deteriorating or when you see one die as a consequence of something we’ve done – really, in the blink of an eye, relative to the tree’s experience.”The Melbourne keeper explains that the reptiles and amphibians with which he works have been hit hard by the environmental emergency, with frogs, in particular, in the midst of a mass extinction.The giant tortoises once roamed in great herds (known, delightfully, as “creeps”) across the volcanic atolls around the Seychelles.“I wish I could have been there,” says Lee, giving Wilbur’s long neck a rub. “It is like a dream.”But sailors on the long voyages necessitated by the spice trade seized the giant tortoises as living meat stores, and now conservationists classify all the species as endangered.Wilbur came to the zoo from the Seychelles in 1965, back in an era when keepers could casually swap a koala for a tortoise.Since then, much has changed but Wilbur retains a long memory for his friends and for his enemies.“I spent a lot of time bonding with him,” says Lee. “At the start he’d be trying to bite me and over time the aggression diminished to the point where, when I came in, he would walk over and rest his head on my arm and let me give him a little scratch. He’s much better these days but there used to be two or three keepers that he was friendly with – and with all the rest he was aggressive.”“Well, as aggressive as a giant tortoise can be.”Without question, Wilbur’s age lends him a certain gravitas. He could, after all, live for another century or more – and, because of that, he seems almost a proxy for nature as a whole, separate from humanity and yet now dependent upon us.“We have pets and you generally know you are going to outlive your pet,” Lee says. “It is weird to think that here is another animal with which I have a bond and it’s going to outlive me. It’s humbling.”A single reptile or an organism as massive as the Great Barrier Reef: the fates of those other lives is now entwined with our own.Lee rubs the tortoise’s head once more.“I am here with Wilbur now I will do what I can to make his life positive. And then it will be someone else’s turn.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/11ee30f93631b009c8b248b626049e433ac38ba2/0_0_5380_3470/master/5380.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=c3e6d964354daafdd380774877c131c2","title":"get on board with boat shoes would be tory leaders","story":"A nostalgic trend could be just the thing for wannabe captains of the Brexit shipLong associated with yachts and men in their 60s, boat shoes are enjoying a surge in popularity thanks to influential fashion designers putting them on the catwalk. Prada, Gucci and Saint Laurent all gave the leather drawstring style a contemporary update in new fabrics and bright colours at their springsummer 2019 collections, prompting high-street options to pop up at Kurt Geiger, River Island and New Look. The popular online retailer Asos currently has 37 styles for sale.At the Pitti Uomo menswear showcase in Florence this week, they were also spotted at MSGM, Grenson and Fratelli Rossetti - meaning that this is a trend that is likely to run into next year too.It was John F Kennedy who first gave the boat shoe fashion credentials. “JFK did for boat shoes then what Obama did for black nylon bombers at last week’s North Carolina vs Duke basketball game,” wrote GQ’s style and grooming director, Teo van den Broeke, recently. “He made them look not only cool, but presidential too, a trick only a specifically handsome leader of the free world can ever truly achieve.”While there’s no suggestion that any of the Tory leadership candidates possess the pizazz of the famed American president, they might want to consider an up-to-date style, that also shows approachability. As footwear messaging goes, it couldn’t be further away from Theresa May’s spiky leopard-print kitten heels.“Boat shoes could be a useful ploy for these male candidates,” said fashion psychologist Dr Carolyn Mair. “They suggest relaxed confidence, which is an attractive characteristic for a future PM, and they are a way to show their pedigree subtly, without flaunting luxury which would be in poor taste. I would imagine that Eton alumni have several pairs already.”Mair also notes the nostalgic appeal of a boat shoe – a sentiment that will surely appeal to the hardwired Brexiters among the candidates. “Nostalgia conjures bittersweet memories of the ‘good old days’ when life was less complex and more pleasant. Of course, nostalgia is a perception of life through rose-tinted glasses.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a738a9fad0ce63f344e3b6fe6ba110b9c76691b/0_0_7111_4267/master/7111.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2054f2204af79f8c137b1b893e6fe981","title":"from goldfinger to scarface how to get this summers movie star look","story":"Whether it’s Sean Connery’s Bond in a blue playsuit, Tilda Swinton’s rock star look in A Bigger Splash or Michelle Pfeiffer’s disco glitz in Scarface, the movies are the inspiration for this season’s style"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/caac8ed1cab32bd89283e96b89d11e42ec8fe3d8/0_264_4928_2959/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=28d6bf92ce88a8a164c41d87a98d736c","title":"heatwave florence plays host to ss20 menswear shows in pictures","story":"Givenchy’s elegant villa takeover, artist Sterling Ruby’s debut collection and a pool party celebration for MSGM – here are the highlights from the Pitti Immagine Uomo showcase"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3caa50505c88d84738fc07a30bae7177469b0eeb/0_217_3400_2040/master/3400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=baed98681e884c25b6c8a9bae4a8c526","title":"west coast california us wines less than 20 pounds fiona beckett","story":"Finding West Coast wines with character for less than £20 is tricky, but there are gems for UK drinkers among the chardonnay, cabernet, pinot noir and zinfandelSince the 1970s, Californian food has had the reputation for being ahead of the pack – fresh, local and plant-based long before the rest of the world went green – yet Californian wine is a quite different beast.Like many Californian wines (including two I hadn’t realised), Apothic is owned by the near-ubiquitous Gallo, which has 15 wineries across California and Washington state, including Barefoot.

These days, it’s no easier to buy a thrilling Californian wine for less than £20 (and that’s quite a high bar) than it was 15 or 20 years ago.Overall, however, you’ll still find much better value for money pound for pound from Chile and Argentina.

The former England midfielder enjoyed a glittering 13-year stint as a player at Chelsea, establishing himself as the club’s record goalscorer, and although he accepts his coaching career is in its infancy, the opportunity to take over in south-west London would surely be hard to resist.The Europa League winners will be keen to secure a replacement for Sarri – for whom compensation potentially worth more than £5m has been agreed with Juve – well before pre-season training starts in the first week of July.Even if there had been understandable reservations over Lampard’s lack of managerial experience – he guided Derby to the Championship play-offs in his first season as a coach – there has always been support from key members of the hierarchy to restore him to a club which, as it operates under a Fifa-imposed transfer ban, could be more reliant on younger personnel for the foreseeable future.Players such as Tammy Abraham, Reece James, Mason Mount, Fikayo Tomori and Callum Hudson-Odoi are expected to play significant roles in the senior set-up next season, when the team will return to the Champions League after a year’s absence. Lampard, who has been assisted by the former Chelsea midfielder and under‑18s’ coach Jody Morris, is seen as a figure who could coax the best from the academy graduates and returning loanees of whom two, Mount and Tomori, excelled under his management at Derby.Chelsea enjoy a fine relationship with the Championship club whose chief executive, Stephen Pearce, left his role as a finance director at Stamford Bridge in 2013. Lampard has been preparing Derby’s pre-season, and discussions have taken place over contract extensions and transfer plans.The board at Stamford Bridge are aware Lampard’s appointment would constitute a risk given the basic demand of every Chelsea head coach – Champions League qualification – cannot be relaxed with the need to comply with Uefa’s financial fair play regulations. However, the hope is that his arrival would galvanise a young squad and be restorative in terms of a support horribly ided and disillusioned at times over Sarri’s brief tenure.Just as significant has been the reality that alternative options appear to be dwindling. Massimiliano Allegri, whom Sarri is to replace at Juve, has indicated he will take a sabbatical “to recharge the batteries and take my personal life back in hand”. Erik ten Hag is apparently committed to Ajax, and Nuno Espírito Santo and Javi Gracia, who have been mentioned in dispatches, would cost considerably more in terms of compensation to extract from Wolves and Watford respectively.Laurent Blanc is available but may be considered an uninspiring choice, not least for fans who made their frustration with Sarri all too obvious. The Italian, secured from Napoli last summer, was close to being sacked this year after results deteriorated dramatically following a promising start. Chelsea were surprised and dismayed at the breakdown in the relationship with a vocal section of the club’s support disenchanted with the lack of drive and urgency in much of the team’s football.An upturn in results – which culminated with a third-place finish and the Europa League success – left Chelsea reluctant to dismiss Sarri, only for him to make clear his desire to return to Italy, citing family reasons. Agreement was reached with Juve late on Thursday over compensation for a head coach who had 12 months to run on his £5m-a-year contract. Chelsea had resisted the Serie A champions’ attempts to secure the 60-year-old for nothing and could end up banking more than that amount, dependent on what Sarri achieves in Turin."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/33b8352034537b39b9a28ff980b86f46af458f83/0_151_4421_2652/master/4421.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=86bda812ef35fcebaa737928d52b48a3","title":"england argentina womens world cup match report","story":"Jodie Taylor jogged a few memories with a criticism deflecting counter-attacking goal as England guaranteed themselves a place in the knockout stages of the World Cup on a clear Normandy night when Argentina again confounded the supposed experts.Carlos Borrello’s side had been depicted as utterly hopeless and potentially the tournament’s weakest nation but, admittedly thanks partly to some atrocious time wasting and cynical fouling, they were well on course to embarrass Phil Neville’s Lionesses before Taylor’s first international goal for 14 months changed the narrative.“Jodie’s a massive player, a big a game player and I told her before the game she’d score,” said Neville. “She thrives off through-balls and, during my time as manager, we probably haven’t given her the service she had before with England. It’s something we’re working hard on.”Argentina have traditionally conceded hatfuls of goals whenever they have met European opposition but their opening game of France 2019 saw Borrello’s players hold the 2011 winners and 2015 runners-up, Japan, to a shock draw. In securing their first ever World Cup point it made plenty of people, Neville included, sit up and take notice.Not that, initially, it did his side much good on an evening when Vanina Correa served as a human magnetic force field in the course of a brilliant goalkeeping performance and Lorena Benítez provided a masterclass in midfield enforcement.“It’s a South American trait to win at all costs and it’s something I admire. I didn’t mind their tactics too much,” said Neville. “And their goalkeeper was sensational. Women keepers get a lot of criticism but she’s world-class.”Estefania Banini is Argentina’s star but the No 10 dubbed “La Messi” was deployed in more of a spoiling role wide on the left of a midfield five here with several of Borrello’s players assigned specialist minding jobs.Lucy Bronze, such a dynamic influence when overlapping from right-back, was singled out for particularly abrasive treatment. Bronze is tough but even she was reduced to tears after being sent crashing on to her back following a wince inducing challenge from Ruth Bravo.Jill Scott, meanwhile, repeatedly had her toes stamped on as her marker backed into her and barely 10 minutes had elapsed before Argentina had resorted to extreme time-wasting tactics. Scott reacted to her aggressor with a shove unseen by the referee and the worry for Neville was that Borrello’s players would provoke a retaliatory red card inside a bright blue stadium which, from the outside, resembles a giant paddling pool.Sympathy for Argentina’s under-resourced squad and their struggles to command attention amid a still machismo national culture was running high at kick-off but now seemed to be diminishing by the minute, particularly when Aldana Cometti was booked for a startling rugby style tackle on Bronze.In between all the snide fouls and inordinate stoppages there were some decent England cameos - the odd Jade Moore pass here, a few sharp Fran Kirby swivels there - but in a city built by that poet of reinforced concrete, Auguste Perret, Borrello’s backline repeatedly resisted virtually all attempted attacking manoeuvres. The term ‘packed defence’ does not really do it justice on a night when Borrello redefined the concept of the low block.England needed to start moving the ball much faster but they eventually won a penalty after Bravo felled Alex Greenwood in the area. Nikita Parris stepped forward but her side-foot dispatch was delivered at a saveable height and, sure enough, Correa stopped it. That said, she still had quite a bit of work to do in order to ert the ball one-handed at full stretch. Small wonder she was mobbed by team-mates celebrating as if they had won the World Cup.Lorena Benítez, a positionally astute holding midfielder, was playing a hugely influential role in disrupting England’s flow and, as the second-half minutes ticked by, Neville looked increasingly tense.It did not help that Correa and her adhesive hands seemed to be operating behind a set of geometry specialists taking a fiendish delight in narrowing their opponents’ angles of attack. Then, finally, and fatally, Argentina tired of defending and ventured upfield. Once that extremely rare attack broke down, the Lionesses pounced, seizing the moment and remembering they used to be a very good counter-attacking team.Breaking at speed, Jill Scott and Kirby bamboozled Benítez and co and Beth Mead’s fabulous first time cross caught Correa, for once, stranded, allowing Taylor to make the most of an intelligent blindside run to turn the ball into the net. Taylor won the golden boot at Euro 2017 and celebrated like a striker vindicated.She has left England on course to top Group D and, with only a draw against Japan in Nice on Wednesday, they could enjoy a theoretically straightforward route to the semi-finals."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d5728a905bd737dd3fa6b84825b44dfbb05db19c/56_79_3444_2068/master/3444.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=472ead331da26dba58b9680fb65e721b","title":"10 biggest stories e3 2019 cyberpunk 2077 final fantasy vii project scarlett","story":"Keanu Reeves lent Hollywood glamour to Cyberpunk 2077, Final Fantasy VII wowed everyone and Microsoft revealed (limited) details about Xbox One successor Project ScarlettNext to some of the games console announcements of E3s past – such as Sony’s $599 PlayStation 3, or the Wii U’s confusing reveal, which left attendees wondering whether it actually was a new console – Microsoft’s Project Scarlett announcement went pretty well. It’s coming late next year, it’s a new Xbox with four times the power of the current one, and it’ll launch with Halo Infinite. But the absence of a name for the thing, or a fancy box to look at, felt strange. Instead, we got a lot of tech specs and a video of the product team talking up the machine’s capabilities. It’s good to know a new console is coming, but what we really want to know is how much it will cost and what it can do.Developer CD Projekt Red had a weird E3. On the one hand, Keanu Reeves turning up to introduce the game and announce his role in it made easily the biggest splash of the entire show, generating further excitement for what was already a highly anticipated game. On the other hand, the company was dragged all week on Twitter over the irony of making a supposedly anti-corporate cyberpunk game when it is known for overwork practices. And for worrisome racial representation gaffes pointed out by journalists who’d played the demo. And for an in-game advertisement featuring a sexualised transgender model. Cyberpunk 2077 perfectly encapsulates the culture surrounding big games in 2019: the hype may be huge but so is the scrutiny – long before a game is actually released.The other cyberpunk game of the show was Ubisoft’s Watch Dogs Legion, set in a post-Brexit, corporate-dystopia future London where you can recruit any citizen to the hacker resistance: a tribute to the power of collective action, perhaps, but with elderly-lady assassins, drones, face-hugging killer robots and comical violence. The game looked properly impressive, not least because being able to play as any person in a whole city is unprecedented. It also features a geographically accurate London populated by people of all races, ages and genders, instead of some cartoonishly simplified version of the city inhabited entirely by cockney gangsters. (The cockney gangsters are nonetheless present – what would any pop-culture depiction of London be without some dodgy accents?) The indications are promising that this is a game with something to say.Good news, everyone: it looks as though you’ll soon be able to add a raft of slightly confusing video-game options to your Spotify, Netflix, Amazon Prime and PlayStation Plus subscriptions. From Ubisoft’s Uplay+ and Xbox Game Pass Ultimate to Google Stadia, it seems everyone is desperate for you to set up a direct debit in return for access to a back catalogue of games and some new releases. Theoretically these subscriptions could offer great value – games are expensive after all – but not if you have four of them at once. And there are still many unanswered questions: how will this affect developers’ revenues long-term, after Google and Microsoft are done propping up the finances? Might it rescue the games industry from the games-as-service model, where behemoths like Fortnite dominate, or make it worse?E3 always involves a certain amount of massaging when it comes to video game footage. Trailers are almost always pre-rendered, not actual, in-game action. Gameplay demos, meanwhile, are carefully managed so that things are unlikely to go wrong. Of all the games shown prominently at the press conferences this year, very few featured in-game footage. The worst offender was Square-Enix’s Avengers, hyped up for a big reveal and then shown in the form of a three-minute trailer featuring three seconds of what might have been actual play. The thing is, most of these games are playable on the show floor, and you can find long demonstrations on YouTube and gaming sites. So why the aversion to showing them in a form that’s closer to how we’ll be playing them?Nintendo has become a refreshing presence at E3, eschewing the bombastic press conferences for playful videos in which its executives banter with a CG Bowser and its developers talk through games about moving to a desert island and establishing a village full of weird animals. There’s nothing revolutionary about Animal Crossing, Zelda and Pokémon, but these games still have such emotional power, and in this age of subscriptions, optional purchases and continual online updates, there is something comforting about knowing exactly what a game is and what it will want from you. The rest of the Nintendo Switch’s slate comprised Japanese role-playing games, mech action games and ports of some of the best games of the last few years, giving the whole event a bit of a throwback vibe. Nintendo withdrew from the technological arms race years ago, investing instead in a convenient, clever console and quirky concepts like Nintendo Labo. Long may it continue.Would it be possible to please everyone with a remake of the 22-year-old Final Fantasy VII? Yes, it turns out. People are obsessed with it. Looking amazing and playing just as beautifully, this meticulous remake has brought every Final Fantasy fan on the internet out of the woodwork to sing the praises of everything from the fashion and character designs to the reimagined combat. This is the most ambitious remake in video game history, no question: the city of Midgar alone will take up two Blu-Ray discs and tens of hours, necessitating an episodic release for the rest of the game.Last year, it was greatly encouraging to see women represented in most of the biggest games at the show, including The Last of Us 2, Battlefield V and Assassin’s Creed Odyssey. Female body types and different skin tones are now standard in any game in which you can create your own character. This year we learned that Animal Crossing will let you choose your character’s skin tone and has made its hairstyles gender-neutral. But in real life at E3, nothing much is changing: the developers and executives we see speaking about games are overwhelmingly white men. Pop-culture critics Feminist Frequency have been tallying E3 ersity stats for five years now: this year, of the 68 people on stage at E3’s various press conferences (among them Keanu Reeves and Jon Bernthal), just 14 were women.When the Game of Thrones author mentioned in an interview he was consulting on “a video game out of Japan”, the rumours started flying. How happy we were to discover it was a game by FromSoftware, makers of Dark Souls. Even without Martin’s involvement, any game from one of gaming’s great creative visionaries, Hidetaka Miyazaki, would be big news. Miyazaki is a devotee of fantasy (and Martin’s work), and after From’s last beautiful, action-heavy samurai game, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, Elden Ring is a return to more familiar thematic territory. “I loved A Song of Ice and Fire as well as the Tuf Voyaging series … I personally see Fevre Dream as a masterpiece among vampire fantasy,” Miyazaki told Xbox Wire. “Aside from the world of fresh stimulus thanks to our collaboration with Mr Martin, I would have to say the biggest difference is the scale of the world and its narrative … the depth and freedom of exploration have increased dramatically. It is without a doubt our biggest title yet in terms of sheer volume. It is a world full of danger and threats, as well as many areas ripe for exploration.”Gaming has been intergenerational for a while, since many of us in our 30s and 40s refuse to age out of them, and now it feels as though every major games company is reviving its past. Some beloved older games are being remastered or rereleased: Final Fantasy VIII, whose source code was long thought lost Age of Empires 2 Trials of Mana, which never made it out of Japan in the 1990s. Others are being reimagined with the help of modern game technology: Zelda: Link’s Awakening and Destroy All Humans. And other series are being brought back from the dead with totally new instalments: Panzer Dragoon, Shenmue, Contra, Commander Keen, Psychonauts and, for some reason, Battletoads. In a neophile artform that has traditionally had little regard for its history, this is a positive development."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45ccb9e20ecdab57671159f625bf51894eac0b97/0_190_5700_3420/master/5700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c6e7363c927b96a6b0f5d53b005880c","title":"tell us who do you share your home with","story":"As part of a new series in the ’s Weekend magazine we are looking for interesting pairs who live togetherWe’re looking for unusual partnerships – two people who live together in a way that shows the changing nature of the traditional household – for our new series that seeks to reflect how the place we call home can now include extended family, friends and even strangers.In the first piece in a series talking to pairs of people who live together we met the McPhersons, a grandmother and grandson living together who tell us their story.

Is there a solution?You needn’t spend long in a city where the honking of car horns is out of control – New York or Delhi, say – before you notice something: in practical terms, almost every honk is pointless. Every driver is stuck in the same traffic, with the same desire to make progress and the same inability to do so. Surely no honker believes their honk will make the critical difference and get things moving honking simply provides drivers with brief cathartic relief from their fury that things aren’t moving faster. This is the modern epidemic of impatience in a pure form. You want reality to be one way, but it stubbornly insists on being the other way, so you make a loud noise to express your anger – thereby ensuring everyone in earshot is annoyed, so at least you don’t have to feel so alone.This year marks the 20th anniversary of the publication of Faster: The Acceleration Of Just About Everything, by the science writer James Gleick, which first introduced me to a truth that has grown truer in the decades since: the faster life moves, the worse impatience gets. Rationally, it shouldn’t be that way. In a world of dishwashers and jet engines, time ought to feel more expansive, thanks to all the hours freed up for more meaningful matters. But, of course, that’s not how it feels. Instead, we grow more agitated with even the smallest delay. As the speed with which we feel our desires ought to be gratified tends toward zero, every wait becomes an affront. If you knew a journey would take for ever – because you were a medieval cattle drover or a passenger on a 19th-century transatlantic steamship, maybe – you wouldn’t mind so much. It’s because cars can move so fast that it’s annoying when they don’t.Rereading Gleick today is unsettling because he was writing before smartphones and broadband became ubiquitous, and the trends he identifies have since reached warp speed. Online, it’s easy to feel independent from the constraints of reality – as if you could be anyone, know everything and visit any location on the planet, all instantaneously. So every time you realise you aren’t, it feels worse. The problem isn’t limited to impatience. The rage that’s often unleashed on social media towards dissenting opinions betrays the same indignation: how dare anyone challenge my power to lay down the law? We live as if we are just on the verge of becoming gods, but never quite get there. No wonder we take it badly when reminded we never will.All this helps explain the true appeal of what is misleadingly called the “slow movement” – typified by those “slow TV” programmes featuring the whole journey of the 830 Dalesman bus trundling across North Yorkshire, or the seven-hour train ride from Bergen to Oslo. Why do we call these “slow”? The Dalesman doesn’t dawdle, and Norwegian trains move fast. We’re responding to something deeper than slowness: the idea of letting things take the time they take.This is what I’m forgetting when I get antsy waiting for a toddler who is intently studying the hinges of a neighbour’s front gate: not that “slow is better”, but that reality has its own speed – sometimes slow, sometimes fast – and railing against the facts is a foolish and self-defeating way to use up your life.In 1999’s Faster, James Gleick examines the near-universal illness of “hurry sickness”, and how our increasingly efficient society makes us prone to greater impatience and boredom."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5326eba626078cbaa8d00e7734dfed8fe7dbed79/707_1395_790_474/master/790.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=41e085aef0c607012a2cc8c00ff28e96","title":"the mindfulness conspiracy capitalist spirituality","story":"It is sold as a force that can help us cope with the ravages of capitalism, but with its inward focus, mindful meditation may be the enemy of activism. By  Ronald PurserMindfulness has gone mainstream, with celebrity endorsement from Oprah Winfrey and Goldie Hawn. Meditation coaches, monks and neuroscientists went to Davos to impart the finer points to CEOs attending the World Economic Forum. The founders of the mindfulness movement have grown evangelical. Prophesying that its hybrid of science and meditative discipline “has the potential to ignite a universal or global renaissance”, the inventor of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR), Jon Kabat-Zinn, has bigger ambitions than conquering stress. Mindfulness, he proclaims, “may actually be the only promise the species and the planet have for making it through the next couple of hundred years”.So, what exactly is this magic panacea? In 2014, Time magazine put a youthful blonde woman on its cover, blissing out above the words: “The Mindful Revolution.” The accompanying feature described a signature scene from the standardised course teaching MBSR: eating a raisin very slowly. “The ability to focus for a few minutes on a single raisin isn’t silly if the skills it requires are the keys to surviving and succeeding in the 21st century,” the author explained.But anything that offers success in our unjust society without trying to change it is not revolutionary – it just helps people cope. In fact, it could also be making things worse. Instead of encouraging radical action, mindfulness says the causes of suffering are disproportionately inside us, not in the political and economic frameworks that shape how we live. And yet mindfulness zealots believe that paying closer attention to the present moment without passing judgment has the revolutionary power to transform the whole world. It’s magical thinking on steroids.There are certainly worthy dimensions to mindfulness practice. Tuning out mental rumination does help reduce stress, as well as chronic anxiety and many other maladies. Becoming more aware of automatic reactions can make people calmer and potentially kinder. Most of the promoters of mindfulness are nice, and having personally met many of them, including the leaders of the movement, I have no doubt that their hearts are in the right place. But that isn’t the issue here. The problem is the product they’re selling, and how it’s been packaged. Mindfulness is nothing more than basic concentration training. Although derived from Buddhism, it’s been stripped of the teachings on ethics that accompanied it, as well as the liberating aim of dissolving attachment to a false sense of self while enacting compassion for all other beings.What remains is a tool of self-discipline, disguised as self-help. Instead of setting practitioners free, it helps them adjust to the very conditions that caused their problems. A truly revolutionary movement would seek to overturn this dysfunctional system, but mindfulness only serves to reinforce its destructive logic. The neoliberal order has imposed itself by stealth in the past few decades, widening inequality in pursuit of corporate wealth. People are expected to adapt to what this model demands of them. Stress has been pathologised and privatised, and the burden of managing it outsourced to iniduals. Hence the pedlars of mindfulness step in to save the day.But none of this means that mindfulness ought to be banned, or that anyone who finds it useful is deluded. Reducing suffering is a noble aim and it should be encouraged. But to do this effectively, teachers of mindfulness need to acknowledge that personal stress also has societal causes. By failing to address collective suffering, and systemic change that might remove it, they rob mindfulness of its real revolutionary potential, reducing it to something banal that keeps people focused on themselves.The fundamental message of the mindfulness movement is that the underlying cause of dissatisfaction and distress is in our heads. By failing to pay attention to what actually happens in each moment, we get lost in regrets about the past and fears for the future, which make us unhappy. Kabat-Zinn, who is often labelled the father of modern mindfulness, calls this a “thinking disease”. Learning to focus turns down the volume on circular thought, so Kabat-Zinn’s diagnosis is that our “entire society is suffering from attention deficit disorder – big time”. Other sources of cultural malaise are not discussed. The only mention of the word “capitalist” in Kabat-Zinn’s book Coming to Our Senses: Healing Ourselves and the World Through Mindfulness occurs in an anecdote about a stressed investor who says: “We all suffer a kind of ADD.”Mindfulness advocates, perhaps unwittingly, are providing support for the status quo. Rather than discussing how attention is monetised and manipulated by corporations such as Google, Facebook, Twitter and Apple, they locate the crisis in our minds. It is not the nature of the capitalist system that is inherently problematic rather, it is the failure of iniduals to be mindful and resilient in a precarious and uncertain economy. Then they sell us solutions that make us contented, mindful capitalists.By practising mindfulness, inidual freedom is supposedly found within “pure awareness”, undistracted by external corrupting influences. All we need to do is close our eyes and watch our breath. And that’s the crux of the supposed revolution: the world is slowly changed, one mindful inidual at a time. This political philosophy is oddly reminiscent of George W Bush’s “compassionate conservatism”. With the retreat to the private sphere, mindfulness becomes a religion of the self. The idea of a public sphere is being eroded, and any trickledown effect of compassion is by chance. As a result, notes the political theorist Wendy Brown, “the body politic ceases to be a body, but is, rather, a group of inidual entrepreneurs and consumers”.Mindfulness, like positive psychology and the broader happiness industry, has depoliticised stress. If we are unhappy about being unemployed, losing our health insurance, and seeing our children incur massive debt through college loans, it is our responsibility to learn to be more mindful. Kabat-Zinn assures us that “happiness is an inside job” that simply requires us to attend to the present moment mindfully and purposely without judgment. Another vocal promoter of meditative practice, the neuroscientist Richard Davidson, contends that “wellbeing is a skill” that can be trained, like working out one’s biceps at the gym. The so-called mindfulness revolution meekly accepts the dictates of the marketplace. Guided by a therapeutic ethos aimed at enhancing the mental and emotional resilience of iniduals, it endorses neoliberal assumptions that everyone is free to choose their responses, manage negative emotions, and “flourish” through various modes of self-care. Framing what they offer in this way, most teachers of mindfulness rule out a curriculum that critically engages with causes of suffering in the structures of power and economic systems of capitalist society.The term “McMindfulness” was coined by Miles Neale, a Buddhist teacher and psychotherapist, who described “a feeding frenzy of spiritual practices that provide immediate nutrition but no long-term sustenance”. The contemporary mindfulness fad is the entrepreneurial equal of McDonald’s. The founder of McDonald’s, Ray Kroc, created the fast food industry. Very early on, when he was selling milkshakes, Kroc spotted the franchising potential of a restaurant chain in San Bernadino, California. He made a deal to serve as the franchising agent for the McDonald brothers. Soon afterwards, he bought them out, and grew the chain into a global empire. Kabat-Zinn, a dedicated meditator, had a vision in the midst of a retreat: he could adapt Buddhist teachings and practices to help hospital patients deal with physical pain, stress and anxiety. His masterstroke was the branding of mindfulness as a secular spirituality.Kroc saw his chance to provide busy Americans with instant access to food that would be delivered consistently through automation, standardisation and discipline. Kabat-Zinn perceived the opportunity to give stressed-out Americans easy access to MBSR through an eight-week mindfulness course for stress reduction that would be taught consistently using a standardised curriculum. MBSR teachers would gain certification by attending programmes at Kabat-Zinn’s Center for Mindfulness in Worcester, Massachusetts. He continued to expand the reach of MBSR by identifying new markets such as corporations, schools, government and the military, and endorsing other forms of “mindfulness-based interventions” (MBIs).Both men took measures to ensure that their products would not vary in quality or content across franchises. Burgers and fries at McDonald’s are the same whether one is eating them in Dubai or in Dubuque. Similarly, there is little variation in the content, structuring and curriculum of MBSR courses around the world.Mindfulness has been oversold and commodified, reduced to a technique for just about any instrumental purpose. It can give inner-city kids a calming time-out, or hedge-fund traders a mental edge, or reduce the stress of military drone pilots. Void of a moral compass or ethical commitments, unmoored from a vision of the social good, the commodification of mindfulness keeps it anchored in the ethos of the market.This has come about partly because proponents of mindfulness believe that the practice is apolitical, and so the avoidance of moral inquiry and the reluctance to consider a vision of the social good are intertwined. It is simply assumed that ethical behaviour will arise “naturally” from practice and the teacher’s “embodiment” of soft-spoken niceness, or through the happenstance of self-discovery. However, the claim that major ethical changes will follow from “paying attention to the present moment, non-judgmentally” is patently flawed. The emphasis on “non-judgmental awareness” can just as easily disable one’s moral intelligence.In Selling Spirituality: The Silent Takeover of Religion, Jeremy Carrette and Richard King argue that traditions of Asian wisdom have been subject to colonisation and commodification since the 18th century, producing a highly inidualistic spirituality, perfectly accommodated to dominant cultural values and requiring no substantive change in lifestyle. Such an inidualistic spirituality is clearly linked with the neoliberal agenda of privatisation, especially when masked by the ambiguous language used in mindfulness. Market forces are already exploiting the momentum of the mindfulness movement, reorienting its goals to a highly circumscribed inidual realm.Mindfulness is easily co-opted and reduced to merely “pacifying feelings of anxiety and disquiet at the inidual level, rather than seeking to challenge the social, political and economic inequalities that cause such distress”, write Carrette and King. But a commitment to this kind of privatised and psychologised mindfulness is political – therapeutically optimising iniduals to make them “mentally fit”, attentive and resilient, so they may keep functioning within the system. Such capitulation seems like the farthest thing from a revolution – more like a quietist surrender.Mindfulness is positioned as a force that can help us cope with the noxious influences of capitalism. But because what it offers is so easily assimilated by the market, its potential for social and political transformation is neutered. Leaders in the mindfulness movement believe that capitalism and spirituality can be reconciled they want to relieve the stress of iniduals without having to look deeper and more broadly at its causes.A truly revolutionary mindfulness would challenge the western sense of entitlement to happiness irrespective of ethical conduct. However, mindfulness programmes do not ask executives to examine how their managerial decisions and corporate policies have institutionalised greed, ill will and delusion. Instead, the practice is being sold to executives as a way to de-stress, improve productivity and focus, and bounce back from working 80-hour weeks. They may well be “meditating”, but it works like taking an aspirin for a headache. Once the pain goes away, it is business as usual. Even if iniduals become nicer people, the corporate agenda of maximising profits does not change.If mindfulness just helps people cope with the toxic conditions that make them stressed in the first place, then perhaps we could aim a bit higher. Should we celebrate the fact that this perversion is helping people to “auto-exploit” themselves? This is the core of the problem. The internalisation of focus for mindfulness practice also leads to other things being internalised, from corporate requirements to structures of dominance in society. Perhaps worst of all, this submissive position is framed as freedom. Indeed, mindfulness thrives on doublespeak about freedom, celebrating self-centered “freedoms” while paying no attention to civic responsibility, or the cultivation of a collective mindfulness that finds genuine freedom within a co-operative and just society.Of course, reductions in stress and increases in personal happiness and wellbeing are much easier to sell than serious questions about injustice, inequity and environmental devastation. The latter involve a challenge to the social order, while the former play directly to mindfulness’s priorities – sharpening people’s focus, improving their performance at work and in exams, and even promising better sex lives. Not only has mindfulness been repackaged as a novel technique of psychotherapy, but its utility is commercially marketed as self-help. This branding reinforces the notion that spiritual practices are indeed an inidual’s private concern. And once privatised, these practices are easily co-opted for social, economic and political control.Rather than being used as a means to awaken iniduals and organisations to the unwholesome roots of greed, ill will and delusion, mindfulness is more often refashioned into a banal, therapeutic, self-help technique that can actually reinforce those roots.Mindfulness is said to be a $4bn industry. More than 60,000 books for sale on Amazon have a variant of “mindfulness” in their title, touting the benefits of Mindful Parenting, Mindful Eating, Mindful Teaching, Mindful Therapy, Mindful Leadership, Mindful Finance, a Mindful Nation, and Mindful Dog Owners, to name just a few. There is also The Mindfulness Colouring Book, part of a bestselling subgenre in itself. Besides books, there are workshops, online courses, glossy magazines, documentary films, smartphone apps, bells, cushions, bracelets, beauty products and other paraphernalia, as well as a lucrative and burgeoning conference circuit. Mindfulness programmes have made their way into schools, Wall Street and Silicon Valley corporations, law firms, and government agencies, including the US military.The presentation of mindfulness as a market-friendly palliative explains its warm reception in popular culture. It slots so neatly into the mindset of the workplace that its only real threat to the status quo is to offer people ways to become more skilful at the rat race. Modern society’s neoliberal consensus argues that those who enjoy power and wealth should be given free rein to accumulate more. It’s perhaps no surprise that those mindfulness merchants who accept market logic are a hit with the CEOs in Davos, where Kabat-Zinn has no qualms about preaching the gospel of competitive advantage from meditative practice.Over the past few decades, neoliberalism has outgrown its conservative roots. It has hijacked public discourse to the extent that even self-professed progressives, such as Kabat-Zinn, think in neoliberal terms. Market values have invaded every corner of human life, defining how most of us are forced to interpret and live in the world.Perhaps the most straightforward definition of neoliberalism comes from the French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu, who calls it “a programme for destroying collective structures that may impede the pure market logic”. We are generally conditioned to think that a market-based society provides us with ample (if not equal) opportunities for increasing the value of our “human capital” and self-worth. And in order to fully actualise personal freedom and potential, we need to maximise our own welfare, freedom, and happiness by deftly managing internal resources.Since competition is so central, neoliberal ideology holds that all decisions about how society is run should be left to the workings of the marketplace, the most efficient mechanism for allowing competitors to maximise their own good. Other social actors – including the state, voluntary associations, and the like – are just obstacles to the smooth operation of market logic.For an actor in neoliberal society, mindfulness is a skill to be cultivated, or a resource to be put to use. When mastered, it helps you to navigate the capitalist ocean’s tricky currents, keeping your attention “present-centred and non-judgmental” to deal with the inevitable stress and anxiety from competition. Mindfulness helps you to maximise your personal wellbeing.All of this may help you to sleep better at night. But the consequences for society are potentially dire. The Slovenian philosopher Slavoj Žižek has analysed this trend. As he sees it, mindfulness is “establishing itself as the hegemonic ideology of global capitalism”, by helping people “to fully participate in the capitalist dynamic while retaining the appearance of mental sanity”.By deflecting attention from the social structures and material conditions in a capitalist culture, mindfulness is easily co-opted. Celebrity role models bless and endorse it, while Californian companies including Google, Facebook, Twitter, Apple and Zynga have embraced it as an adjunct to their brand. Google’s former in-house mindfulness tsar Chade-Meng Tan had the actual job title Jolly Good Fellow. “Search inside yourself,” he counselled colleagues and readers – for there, not in corporate culture – lies the source of your problems.The rhetoric of “self-mastery”, “resilience” and “happiness” assumes wellbeing is simply a matter of developing a skill. Mindfulness cheerleaders are particularly fond of this trope, saying we can train our brains to be happy, like exercising muscles. Happiness, freedom and wellbeing become the products of inidual effort. Such so-called “skills” can be developed without reliance on external factors, relationships or social conditions. Underneath its therapeutic discourse, mindfulness subtly reframes problems as the outcomes of choices. Personal troubles are never attributed to political or socioeconomic conditions, but are always psychological in nature and diagnosed as pathologies. Society therefore needs therapy, not radical change. This is perhaps why mindfulness initiatives have become so attractive to government policymakers. Societal problems rooted in inequality, racism, poverty, addiction and deteriorating mental health can be reframed in terms of inidual psychology, requiring therapeutic help. Vulnerable subjects can even be told to provide this themselves.Neoliberalism ides the world into winners and losers. It accomplishes this task through its ideological linchpin: the inidualisation of all social phenomena. Since the autonomous (and free) inidual is the primary focal point for society, social change is achieved not through political protest, organising and collective action, but via the free market and atomised actions of iniduals. Any effort to change this through collective structures is generally troublesome to the neoliberal order. It is therefore discouraged.An illustrative example is the practice of recycling. The real problem is the mass production of plastics by corporations, and their overuse in retail. However, consumers are led to believe that being personally wasteful is the underlying issue, which can be fixed if they change their habits. As a recent essay in Scientific American scoffs: “Recycling plastic is to saving the Earth what hammering a nail is to halting a falling skyscraper.” Yet the neoliberal doctrine of inidual responsibility has performed its sleight-of-hand, distracting us from the real culprit. This is far from new. In the 1950s, the “Keep America Beautiful” campaign urged iniduals to pick up their trash. The project was bankrolled by corporations such as Coca-Cola, Anheuser-Busch and Phillip Morris, in partnership with the public service announcement Ad Council, which coined the term “litterbug” to shame miscreants. Two decades later, a famous TV ad featured a Native American man weeping at the sight of a motorist dumping garbage. “People Start Pollution. People Can Stop It,” was the slogan. The essay in Scientific American, by Matt Wilkins, sees through such charades.At face value, these efforts seem benevolent, but they obscure the real problem, which is the role that corporate polluters play in the plastic problem. This clever misdirection has led journalist and author Heather Rogers to describe Keep America Beautiful as the first corporate greenwashing front, as it has helped shift the public focus to consumer recycling behaviour and thwarted legislation that would increase extended producer responsibility for waste management.We are repeatedly sold the same message: that inidual action is the only real way to solve social problems, so we should take responsibility. We are trapped in a neoliberal trance by what the education scholar Henry Giroux calls a “disimagination machine”, because it stifles critical and radical thinking. We are admonished to look inward, and to manage ourselves. Disimagination impels us to abandon creative ideas about new possibilities. Instead of seeking to dismantle capitalism, or rein in its excesses, we should accept its demands and use self-discipline to be more effective in the market. To change the world, we are told to work on ourselves — to change our minds by being more mindful, nonjudgmental, and accepting of circumstances.It is a fundamental tenet of neoliberal mindfulness, that the source of people’s problems is found in their heads. This has been accentuated by the pathologising and medicalisation of stress, which then requires a remedy and expert treatment – in the form of mindfulness interventions. The ideological message is that if you cannot alter the circumstances causing distress, you can change your reactions to your circumstances. In some ways, this can be helpful, since many things are not in our control. But to abandon all efforts to fix them seems excessive. Mindfulness practices do not permit critique or debate of what might be unjust, culturally toxic or environmentally destructive. Rather, the mindful imperative to “accept things as they are” while practising “nonjudgmental, present moment awareness” acts as a social anesthesia, preserving the status quo.The mindfulness movement’s promise of “human flourishing” (which is also the rallying cry of positive psychology) is the closest it comes to defining a vision of social change. However, this vision remains inidualised and depends on the personal choice to be more mindful. Mindfulness practitioners may of course have a very different political agenda to that of neoliberalism, but the risk is that they start to retreat into their own private worlds and particular identities — which is just where the neoliberal power structures want them.Mindfulness practice is embedded in what Jennifer Silva calls the “mood economy”. In Coming Up Short: Working-Class Adulthood in an Age of Uncertainty, Silva explains that, like the privatisation of risk, a mood economy makes “iniduals solely responsible for their emotional fates”. In such a political economy of affect, emotions are regulated as a means to enhance one’s “emotional capital”. At Google’s Search Inside Yourself mindfulness programme, emotional intelligence (EI) figures prominently in the curriculum. The programme is marketed to Google engineers as instrumental to their career success — by engaging in mindfulness practice, managing emotions generates surplus economic value, equivalent to the acquisition of capital. The mood economy also demands the ability to bounce back from setbacks to stay productive in a precarious economic context. Like positive psychology, the mindfulness movement has merged with the “science of happiness”. Once packaged in this way, it can be sold as a technique for personal life-hacking optimisation, disembedding iniduals from social worlds.All the promises of mindfulness resonate with what the University of Chicago cultural theorist Lauren Berlant calls “cruel optimism”, a defining neoliberal characteristic. It is cruel in that one makes affective investments in what amount to fantasies. We are told that if we practice mindfulness, and get our inidual lives in order, we can be happy and secure. It is therefore implied that stable employment, home ownership, social mobility, career success and equality will naturally follow. We are also promised that we can gain self-mastery, controlling our minds and emotions so we can thrive and flourish amid the vagaries of capitalism.As Joshua Eisen, the author of Mindful Calculations, puts it: “Like kale, acai berries, gym memberships, vitamin water, and other new year’s resolutions, mindfulness indexes a profound desire to change, but one premised on a fundamental reassertion of neoliberal fantasies of self-control and unfettered agency.” We just have to sit in silence, watching our breath, and wait. It is doubly cruel because these normative fantasies of the “good life” are already crumbling under neoliberalism, and we make it worse if we focus inidually on our feelings. Neglecting shared vulnerabilities and interdependence, we disimagine the collective ways we might protect ourselves. And despite the emptiness of nurturing fantasies, we continue to cling to them.Mindfulness isn’t cruel in and of itself. It’s only cruel when fetishised and attached to inflated promises. It is then, as Berlant points out, that “the object that draws your attachment actively impedes the aim that brought you to it initially”. The cruelty lies in supporting the status quo while using the language of transformation. This is how neoliberal mindfulness promotes an inidualistic vision of human flourishing, enticing us to accept things as they are, mindfully enduring the ravages of capitalism.Adapted from McMindfulness: How Mindfulness Became the New Capitalist Spirituality by Ronald Purser, published by Repeater Books on 9 July and available at bookshop• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/665865c6e3ba6d5bd7c0728d74e15d830bfa2614/0_0_1280_768/master/1280.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fd2dbb13e594f4e1a4298fec147c62c9","title":"think mother and sister are autistic annalisa barbieri","story":"It’s important to ask yourself whose agenda this is, says Annalisa Barbieri, and whether they really want helpI have often wondered whether we have undiagnosed adult autism in our family. All my life, I have felt I have greater emotional intelligence, in terms of understanding the world and other people, than my elder sister and mother. Our mother, in particular, finds it difficult to read social signals and fit into social circles. She often speaks about her disappointment in life, in not having had a fulfilling career, and I have been affected by this in wanting to overcompensate in mine. Listening to her consistently lamenting her failures is an emotional strain and I feel some responsibility for her sadness, which I know is irrational.My sister has also struggled with relationships. Although she is trying to climb the career ladder, she has been unsuccessful at many interviews. Outside work, she always has an overbubbling enthusiasm for a subject matter or hobby, which I think puts people off becoming friends with her. I find myself wanting to hide my successes from her.Recently, I moved to be closer to my parents. I feel really sad about this situation, as I can see once again that making friends is very difficult for them, but I can’t fix it, however much I try. I want to maintain my own life without feeling guilty that theirs is not so fulfilled. Should I raise this issue with my family, and potentially label and hurt them, or just let it be and risk them never knowing why they find it so difficult to navigate the world?I can see you are trying to make things better for your mother and sister, and that is commendable. However, it is not unusual for family members to be vastly different from one another. Your mother may indeed struggle with social situations, and your sister may have learned patterns of behaviour from her (being the eldest, her time with your mother will have been more intense) that have nothing to do with autism spectrum disorder. It is important to ask yourself whose agenda this is: have they asked for help? Do they want it? Many women of your mother’s generation lament the lack of a career, but sometimes it is done from the safety of no longer having to do anything about it.Many people with siblings would probably say they feel like different beings from them, despite having been brought up in the same household. It is also not unusual to feel as you do: the guilt and the need to hide achievements. I think part of what may be going on is that, having moved to be closer to your family, you can’t ignore certain things you may have pushed into the background, and the guilt you mention is driving you to find a solution. I think you need to look at why you feel the need to do this, separately from whether or not your mother and sister get an assessment and diagnosis.What would happen next depends on where you live and how they present themselves. Remember, they may not get a diagnosis – or not the one you have in mind – and, even if they do, it may not bring about the resolution you think. Some people are diagnosed in their later years and find it enormously helpful others do not. If it becomes relevant, your mother and sister may find it interesting to look at autism.org.ukaboutstories.Ask them if they want help and, if so, what sort (it may not be what you think). If they don’t, let them be who they are, because they may be more content than you realise. After all, to them, it may be you who is the odd one.•Send your problem to annalisa.barbieri@mac.

Auld Grey Town, they call it, and under a heavy blanket of cloud and drizzle rolled in from the fells, it sure is, though the cheerier among you may notice the light sparkle in the stones of its limestone streets, and the fact that the steeply sloping sides of the town mean the lush green fields of the countryside are never far from sight. (You have the luxury of not one but two of the most magnificent national parks – the Lake District and Yorkshire Dales – at the edge of town.) What Kendal lacks in colour, though, it makes up for with joie de vivre, seemingly permanently in festival mode. The tweeness that bedevils much of the Lake District is absent.

But the Labour leader is facing a pincer movement from both sides of his deeply ided party.Another Europe is Possible, the anti-Brexit campaign group that works closely with leftwing Labour MPs including Clive Lewis and Lloyd Russell-Moyle, has announced that it plans a “summer of resistance”.Alena Ivanova, from the group, said: “What we’re witnessing this summer is the growth of a mass and plural movement against Brexit, with mass demonstrations announced for both July and October, and lots of different organisations holding speaker tours and preparing for a referendum.”She added: “But this movement needs to be radical, both tactically and politically – it has to become a hot summer of resistance, willing to disrupt the status quo.”Meanwhile Tom Watson, Corbyn’s deputy, has continued to push for a People’s Vote, and will make a major speech on the issue on Monday.Recriminations from the party’s poll performance have continued. Some shadow ministers, including some on the left, lament what one called the “malign influence” of Corbyn’s advisers, in particular his key confidant, Seumas Milne, and chief of staff, Karie Murphy, complaining that the pair insulate Corbyn from criticism and challenge.Several shadow cabinet members have told the  that Corbyn himself was uncomfortable with the party’s message in the run-up to the European elections, which he felt was insufficiently clear.“They’re clearly under pressure: I don’t think he’s happy with the way it’s working,” one said. Another claimed: “Even Jeremy, who has always held Seumas in awe, is increasingly dissatisfied with the messaging”.The shadow cabinet was not consulted about the expulsion of former New Labour spin doctor Alistair Campbell for publicly admitting he had voted Lib Dem at the European elections. “No politician was involved in that decision,” said one senior party source.John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, was said by allies to have been particularly irked about Campbell’s expulsion, fearing it made the leadership look vindictive.The decision to drop shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry from prime minister’s questions at short notice last week, after she spoke out about Labour’s Brexit policy, also raised eyebrows.Corbyn was lambasted by colleagues at Monday’s meeting of the parliamentary Labour party (PLP), with one veteran of the Blair and Brown eras saying it was the worst they had witnessed, with Corbyn reading from a prepared script and failing to take on hecklers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57af62abd60cfe4974f44d748f4a9bc41c1bdba8/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c1d9a8b3a1102280e292121059f041ab","title":"change uk how not to set up a political party podcast","story":"With six of its 11 MPs having quit, Heather Stewart, the ’s political editor, charts what went wrong.

Two putts from 30 feet and that’s a difficult hole navigated in par. He’s -3. Then DJ finally makes a birdie putt! Naturally, it’s one of the harder one’s he’s faced today, a tricky left-to-right downhill slider, but he’s kept his cool, refused to get flustered, and now he’s got his reward. He’s -2. Bogey for Lefty, though, the result of sending his tee shot into the wrong part of the huge hourglass green. Back on 7, Woodland sends a tee shot into the short par-three to a similar distance. No interest in taking on the pin with all that trouble just behind it. He can’t quite drain the birdie putt, but he remains in the lead at -8. Not a blemish on his card today, and just two holes to go.McIlroy faces a 30-foot birdie attempt from just off the front of 18. He races it four feet past the hole. Still work to do for par. But in it goes. He’ll feel a little deflated after events at 13 and 14, but it’s still a 69, and he’s right in this tournament, without having to worry about the pressure of front-running. Rahm’s next, with his 40-foot eagle attempt. A huge left-to-right curl, but he doesn’t give it enough and it’s always slipping by on the low side. But he’ll make birdie and sign for a one-under 70. That’s a result after his woeful start to the round. Rory’s -5, Rahm’s -3.Woodland’s eagle putt doesn’t look like dropping, but no matter. He taps in for birdie, and takes sole ownership of the lead.A stunning 3-iron fired straight into 18 by Jon Rahm. He’s gone under the radar today, after those bogeys at 1, 3 and 6, but he’s bounced back with birdies at 7, 9 and 13. Now he’s got an eagle putt from 30 feet, which would instantly turn a garden-variety day into a banner one. Rory’s wedge in however is no good, spinning back off the front. Par most likely when a birdie was desirable. And a birdie for Oosthuizen on 14, and he’s back to -5.Gary Woodland is threatening to take charge here. He smashes a big drive down 6, then lashes an iron from 250 yards into the heart of the green. One of those that felt so good, he’s walking after it the second he’s completed his follow-through. He’s pin high, with a 20-footer across the green for an eagle and a two-shot lead. Elsewhere McIlroy takes his medicine and bashes back out onto the 18th fairway. Some big moments going into the weekend coming up right here.McIlroy’s driver has let him down on more than one occasion today, and on 18 he sends his tee shot sailing wide right of the big tree. At least he’s not wet, and the decision about laying up or not has been taken out of his hands. He’s in thick rough. “Same again!” is his plaintive cry. Birdie for the amateur Brandon Wu at 4, a McIlroyesque response to a double bogey at 2 and bogey at 3. He’s still very nicely placed at -2.Sergio nearly drains a birdie putt from off the front at 14, but it somehow lips out just as it looked like surely dropping. He stays at -3. Elsewhere, Matt Wallace calmed himself down and lifted a careful wedge to four feet, cleaning up for bounce-back birdie. He’s -2 again. It’s back-to-back bogeys for Oosthuizen, the latest at 13. And Rory can’t roll in his putt on 17, the ball always breaking to the right.Gary Woodland joins Justin Rose in the lead at -7! His tee shot into 5 isn’t the greatest, but it is dead in the middle of the green, and he’s got a chance to tickle one in from 20 feet. He judges it perfectly! Not so perfect is Mickelson’s chip from the edge of 15. Almost a whiff, his ball, sitting up on the cabbage, only just topples onto the green, three feet away. He can’t make the par putt, and slips back to -2. G-Mac hits an eight-foot birdie attempt too hard, and it horseshoes out. He’s -3. Then DJ misses yet another birdie putt, a seven-footer slipping by on the right. This is farcical. He’s had birdie chance after birdie chance, but nothing’s dropped! He’s -1.McIlroy’s tee shot at the iconic 17th. It’s not quite the Golden Bear in 1972, but it is very good. Straight at the flag, and he’ll have a look at a third birdie in a row from eight feet.Another birdie for McIlroy, who is repairing his round apace! His second into 16 doesn’t bite and spin back as he’d like, which means the ball rolls into the fringe at the back. But he strokes home a 17-foot left-to-right curler, and pumps the air with great feeling! His last six holes: 3-3-5-7-3-3. What he’d give to have 13 and 14 again.G-Mac sends his third at 14 over the back. He gets relief from the grandstand, and very nearly gets up and down from the drop zone, but the mistake was the approach. It’s a six and he’s heading backwards. He’s -3 and beginning to look a little frustrated, so much good work undone in the last four holes. Meanwhile yet another birdie putt for DJ goes sailing by. He’s -1, but really should be much further up the rankings. But his flat stick is stone cold. However another birdie for Mickelson, his sixth today, and he’s -3. This couldn’t be on, could it? Not entirely sure I’ll be able to cope if the great entertainer’s in the mix for a much-deserved career slam on Sunday afternoon. Just warning you.Louis Oosthuizen has made one par in the last eight holes. He’s been yo-yoing this way and that. This time it’s a bogey at 12, following a failure to find the putting surface from the tee. He’s -5. Gary Woodland stays at -6 after doing well to get up and down from the bank at the back of 4. Meanwhile Sergio leaves a birdie putt at 13 a couple of inches short. He’s done that a few times today, failing to get the speed of these greens.It’s been a tough grind for Xander Schauffele since those bogeys at 13 and 14. But he’s finally moving in the right direction again, taking advantage of a friendly bounce off the bank to the right of the 3rd. The ball kicks left, having had a fair bit of speed removed from it by the cushion of rough, and stops six feet short. He rolls in for birdie that takes him back to -4. Meanwhile all of Matt Wallace’s momentum is lost, hitting two weak chips into 2 and then 3, both leading to needless bogeys. He flings his putter down with great intensity after the second bogey, a full-scale meltdown. He’ll do well to calm down after that miserable show.McIlroy makes his birdie putt at 15. That’s a stunning response to a very worrying situation plenty of his fans will have feared the worst after his drive found a bunker following bogey and a double-bogey seven. But that’s got him back on the horse. He’s -4. Meanwhile Woodland’s second into 4 takes a hot bounce and buries itself into the thick nonsense at the back.Birdie for Oosthuizen at 11, taking advantage of a big stroke of luck. His approach looked like snagging on a rough-covered bank, but his ball kicked abruptly left and ended up six feet from the flag. If he was unfortunate earlier when his approach to 8 stayed on the bank, inches from perfection, this is payback time. He returns to a share of second at -6. Meanwhile McIlroy arrests his slide in sensational fashion. He clips a 9-iron off the sand and arrows his ball straight at the flag. It comes to a screeching halt six feet short, and he’ll have a chance to start repairing some of the damage of the previous two holes immediately.Lefty rattles a 35-foot birdie putt up the 13th green and into the cup! One of those that was always going to get swallowed up by the hole from the second it left the face of the flat stick! He’s back to -2 and simply refusing to let his career-slam dream die. G-Mac’s effort from 10 feet shaves the high side, but he remains at -4. Par for DJ as well, as he lets another birdie chance slip by. He stays at -1. But McIlroy’s round is threatening to totally unravel, as he sends his drive at 15 into sand down the left.The highly regarded amateur Brandon Wu continues to rip the place up. Having played the harder back nine in 33, he’s started working his way through the front with birdie at 1. He’s -4 for both his round and the tournament. A local lad doing extremely well. Meanwhile it’s three shots gone in two holes for Rory McIlroy, who can’t knock in his bogey putt on 14. He leaves the scene of the par-five having run up seven. He clatters down the standings to -3.If Rory’s wedge into 14 was a bad mistake, this next chip is a potential catastrophe. He flips weakly into the air and dumps his fourth into the big bunker. He’ll be doing well to get up and down for a bogey six. He whips out to eight feet, but this is a big putt coming up.McIlroy’s wedge into 14 is dismal. He lifts it high into the air, the ball biting on the green and spinning hysterically back off the false front. He’s left with a tricky chip over a bunker, and not much in the way of green to play with. That’s a bad mistake. Meanwhile two birdies in four holes for Li Haotong, at 2 and 4, and he’s putting together a lovely round here. Four under today, and -4 for the tournament as well. With the two cute par threes to come!DJ misses another fine birdie chance. A straight 13-footer on the par-three 12th slips by the left of the cup. And one goes begging on 2, where Gary Woodland sticks his approach to 12 feet, but can’t guide in the left-to-right curler. A putt missed at 10, meanwhile, as Louis Oosthuizen drops another. And while we’re on this subject, Phil misses another short one, this time at 12, and he’s back down to -1.Rickie Fowler continues to suffer. Bogey at 1, and he’s currently four over for his round. Just not at the races today. He’s currently -1, just three shots above the projected cut at +2. Having started the day harbouring dreams of glory, it’s a sad state of affairs. Meanwhile G-Mac whips a gorgeous shot out of the bunker at the front of 12, nearly holing it, but happy to escape with his par. And on the par-five 14th, McIlroy’s drive slips into the thick stuff down the left, meaning he’s got to lay up as opposed to going for it. He lays up and will be wedging in from 100 yards or so.Matt Wallace is coming of age in the majors. The 29-year-old Englishman finished the recent PGA in a tie for third, and now he’s taking a proper tilt at the US Open. He’s just made back-to-back birdies at 18 and 1, and he’s -3 with plenty of birdie opportunities on the front nine to come.Jon Rahm rolls a 30-foot birdie effort into the cup at 13. He’s only five behind at -2. Fellow big hitter Dustin Johnson should be joining him there, but he doesn’t give a four-foot birdie putt enough on the high side, and it dies away. Par. He remains at -1. And McIlroy can’t make his par saver on 13.Birdie for Gary Woodland at 1. He joins McIlroy in second place at -6 ... but he might not have Rory for company in a minute, as the 2011 champ has plugged his approach to 13 in sand, and not gone particularly close with the splash out. Meanwhile on 11, G-Mac drops back to -4, the result of sending his tee shot into the thick stuff on the right.Carlos Ortiz creams his second shot into the par-five 6th. He lands it on the front of the green, his ball rolling up to ten inches or so. Less than a foot from an albatross! A tap-in for eagle. The 28-year-old Mexican has only competed in one major before, missing the cut in the US Open at Oakmont in 2016. He’s got a fair chance of making this one now, though. He’s currently got two holes left to play, and he’s -2 for the tournament.Louis Oosthuizen chipped in from the bunker guarding the front of 9 yesterday. He very nearly does it again today, but will be more than happy to escape with par. He should aim there tomorrow and Sunday. A distinctly Ulster feel to the US Open leader board, so much so that you’d wish it was being read out by Julian Simmons.Pars That Feel Like Birdies (No1 in an occasional series): Rory McIlroy at the par-three 12th. His tee shot finds a deep bunker and with not too much in the way of green to play with, it’s all he can do to send his second 20 feet past the flag. No matter! He races in the par saver, and that keeps him within a shot of Justin Rose. He punches the air modestly, knowing how precious every shot can be in the chase of a major championship ... especially a US Open.Graeme McDowell is one inch away from holing out from 199 yards on 10! That’s a kick-in birdie that’ll take him to -5, just two shots off the lead. His playing partner DJ eases a 7-iron to six feet, a shot that would normally send the crowd wild, but it’s nothing compared to G-Mac’s astonishing approach. Lefty’s second is bang average, but he’s not to be denied, rattling in a 30-footer to get the gallery going. He’s -2 again. And finally DJ converts to rise to -1. Three birdies at 10! You’ll not see many groups doing that again in the US Open at Pebble Beach.It’s all change near the top! Louis Oosthuizen slips out of the lead after failing to get up and down from thick rough at the front of the green. He’s unfortunate, because his approach was just a few feet short of perfection. Gary Woodland very nearly drains a birdie putt from Matt Kuchar Country at the back of 18, but it’s just par for a player who is enjoying a mid-career boost, having recently recorded a couple of top-ten finishes at the PGA. Good news for Rory though: he curls in a 12-footer on 11, and he’s just a shot off the lead! This is hotting up nicely.Scott Piercy is going the wrong way. Bogey at 18 followed by another at 2, and he’s over par for his round today and -3 overall. Fowler tries his best to get up and down from the drop zone at 18 but that’s another shot gone he’s -2. Meanwhile on 9 Mickelson takes his drop then trundles a chip 15 feet past the flag. He does extremely well to steer in a left-to-right curler to limit the damage to bogey. He slips to -1, but that could have been a whole lot worse. And birdie for DJ, his second in four holes, and he’s turning in level-par 35. He’s level for the tournament as well.Oh Phil! He tugs his second shot at 9, from the centre of the fairway, over the edge running down the right of the hole. That’s almost certainly going to put the kibosh on his momentum. Meanwhile par for McIlroy at 10. He’d sent his drive into sand down the left, but creamed his second to 15 feet. The birdie putt nearly dropped, only to horseshoe out at the last. Slightly frustrating, but it looks like on balance he’ll take it. He wanders off happy enough, still just a couple behind the leading pair. “Like Mickelson at the US Open and Lee Trevino at the Masters, some other things just aren’t meant to be,” suggests Simon McMahon, before trotting out a few more examples. “Safe passage for Scotland through a World Cup group stage. Tim Henman and the Wimbledon final. Jimmy White and the World Snooker Championship. Buffalo Bills and the Super Bowl. Socks and sandals. Whisky with mixer. Peanut butter and jelly.”Rickie Fowler decides to force things on 18. Bad idea. He crashes a big drive down the track, then sends a huge hook into the Pacific. He looks on the verge of tears, poor chap, as he sees his latest bid for a major hit the rocks ... literally, his ball bouncing all over the beach en route to the briny. But there’s plenty of time to salvage the situation. Things change quickly in championship golf. Exhibit A: Louis Oosthuizen, who follows his bogey at 5 with back-to-back birdies at 6 and 7, the latter after clipping his wedge to tap-in distance, one of the shots of the week so far. Suddenly the 2015 runner-up is tied for the lead!G-Mac’s run of birdies comes to an end at 8. But he’s happy enough, getting up and down having left himself well short of the green in two. Meanwhile on the practice area, Jordan Spieth and his caddie and pal Michael Greller appear to be having some sort of clear-the-air discussion. A casual sit-down pow-wow that has reportedly been going on for some time. They look happy and relaxed enough when they eventually get up and amble off. There’s nice. All friends again, we hope, after that moment on 18 yesterday.Sergio spins his tee shot at 7 to five feet, and makes no mistake with the putt. He’s suddenly just three off the lead at -4. Li Haotong curls in a 20-footer on 18 to complete the back nine in 33 strokes: he’s -3. And the 22-year-old Californian amateur Brandon Wu chips in from the fairway at 15! A birdie, his third of the day already after picking up strokes at 10 and 14. He’s -3. With the equally sensational Viktor Hovland already home and hosed at level par, the race for low amateur over the weekend is going to be worth the price of admission on its own.Rickie Fowler is desperate for his maiden major. But he’s going in the wrong direction this afternoon. A bogey at 14, and now another at 17 after sending his tee shot into sand. He slips to -3, and will be hoping his fortunes change on the slightly easier front nine. A garden-variety par for McIlroy at 9, and he’s turning in 33 strokes. Meanwhile his partner Jon Rahm is beginning to piece his round back together after that appalling start. The damage of bogeys at 1, 3 and 6 has been almost repaired by birdies at 7 and now 9, where he chips in from the fringe at the back, a good 40 feet away. He’s back to -1.Having dropped a stroke at 5, Sergio picks it straight back up at the par-five 6th. Almost a carbon copy of G-Mac’s flop from a tight spot to the left of the green. He’s -3. Speaking of the 2010 champion, McDowell rolls in his birdie putt on 7 and that’s four in a row! This is astonishing! Gary Woodland’s going along well, too, with birdies at 12 and 16, and the leader board is beginning to look very interesting indeed!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/157173dd14451b60dc7acad09f59b636f1834cfb/283_451_4503_2701/master/4503.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a2ee27bf031c827cf2afae51534d4825","title":"yellow is the colour of sunshine review tutti frutti","story":"Seven Arts, LeedsChildren’s theatre company Tutti Frutti use physical playfulness and ingenuity to tell a story about the importance of communication and friendshipsFriendship, as adults and children all know, is not always easy. Brendan Murray’s new play for the company Tutti Frutti is all about how we make and break friends, as well as how to deal with the stew of emotions involved. Like Disney’s brilliant Inside Out, Yellow Is the Colour of Sunshine teaches kids how to recognise and talk about their feelings – both good and bad.Hani (Phoebe Stapleton) is lonely and wishes for a friend. When Yoshi (Connor Bryson) appears, it seems her wish has come true, but reality turns out to be more complicated than that. The pair play, squabble and sulk, gradually figuring out how to be together and apart. Lurking in the background, the shapeshifting Holly Irving alternately embodies a watching magpie, a fought-over kite, and the sky they both soar through.At just shy of an hour, Wendy Harris’s production stretches this material to breaking point. It’s a slight story and there is only so much it can be embellished. The tireless performers run, leap and dance all over Kate Bunce’s colourful set, showing off the physical playfulness and ingenuity that Tutti Frutti are known for. Folded scraps of paper transform into fluttering butterflies sequined gloves become bright bursts of fireworks. But after a while the show starts to get repetitive and young audience members begin shuffling in their seats.Where this production succeeds is in its seamless integration of the British Sign Language that Yoshi uses throughout. It’s a lesson in how accessibility can be embedded in the creative process, as well as how – with minimal fuss or fanfare – children can be introduced to different forms of communication.• At the Old Town Hall, Hemel Hempstead, 15 June.

Three creatives explain how their old man has inspired them throughout their livesThere are few experiences more bonding than sharing a drink with your dad. Over a glass, or two, of Tobermory 12 Year Old whisky, a writer, photographer and magazine journalist, give a frank glimpse into their relationships with the men who raised themWhen I first told my dad about the subject of this piece, how his creativity has inspired my writing, he responded with the traditional Druker facial expression (somewhere between a sneer and a shrug).“Pheh,” he said. “It doesn’t even inspire me.”It’s taken us a long while to get to this point, sat across a table from each other, talking like a pair of adults. Mostly over coffee. Occasionally something stronger.My dad has a huge personality, but he’s not a big drinker. Two wine gums and a glass of water and he’s pissed, he says. I used to drink a bit too much. Now we meet somewhere in the middle. We used to be too different, too much the same to do this. We had rows, we didn’t get on. But times change. Times change people. And now we have moments.My dad retired around the time I was stumbling into adulthood. After a life of work and activism, he took up creative pursuits, playing in bands and DJing world music, funk and jump blues, expanding on his lifelong passion for music. As funny as he is, he takes it all very seriously.I notice the ways I’m like him, now. And the ways I want to be like him. He’s probably the funniest person I know. Cutting, absurdist and lightning quick. He’s got a sharp reply before you’ve finished talking. And when chatter falls to quiet, he’ll point strangers out, invent stories about them, tell me who they’ve just had a row with.He’s also a walking encyclopedia for film, music and literature. Pick out an old soul single and he’ll tell you who played bass on the B-side.His morality is like a lodestone to me. My understanding of the world was forged by anti-apartheid fundraisers, picket lines and marches before I could walk, and it’s informed by him to this day.It’s only now, as I pick it all apart, I realise how much of him is in everything I write. Sometimes behind the words on the page or the mouths of characters. Sometimes just kibitzing in my ear, telling me to lighten up and try putting a joke in for once.So now we have fleeting moments of connection I treasure. Something he never got to do with his dad. Something that will always be with me.He can also be a bit of a putz, to be fair.My dad and I haven’t always gotten on, with my stubborn teenage behaviour and his old-fashioned views. But as my mum doesn’t really drink, my dad had someone to share a tipple with when I started drinking. Even now when I go home he jokingly asks when I’m moving back to be his drinking buddy. We found out about one another’s likes, pet peeves and favourite drinks (mine: tequila, his: whisky). I got to know about his fascinating life and him as a person, rather than just my dad. You think you would know these things about your parent, but over a drink, this authority figure fades and a friend emerges.Being someone who studied fashion and has always been obsessed with clothes, we often find ourselves chatting about the topic. You’d never know to look at him in his home-knitted vests, but my 76-year-old dad was quite the fashionista back in the day! He showed me his old Dior suits, bought with his first paychecks, and that ignited my interest in vintage fashion – which was a step outside of all my high-fashion magazines. I make my own clothes as much as possible, and when video-calling my seamstress of a mum for help, my dad is often in the background ready to pipe in with some advice – a longer hem, more fitted, a different button – and I hate to admit it, but a lot of the time he’s spot on.I know every child says this, but my dad is one of the best cooks on this earth (owning a successful takeaway for 20 years might have something to do with it). But one thing that’s certain to come up when we meet up is talk about food. I’m always bugging him about how he made a dish while I ply him with a drink, hoping for him to spill his secrets. As someone who could only boil pasta when I left home, I now make dishes from around the world. My love for cooking and fascination for flavours is down to him.I’m now an entertainment journalist at a leading women’s magazine. He may not know the people I write about in my job, but he’s always been supportive of me and keen to learn more about the industry I’m in. It wasn’t easy to get into, and I know that my perseverance in my career is the same as my dad’s “never quit” work ethic that got him from Hong Kong to the UK in his 20s, and got him his successful business after many less successful ones. And that’s certainly something to say cheers to.My dad, David, inspired my passion for both photography and Scotland – which I’ve had a lifelong love affair with.He’s Scottish, in fact he’s very Scottish – he’d play the bagpipes at my school and my two brothers and I would often wear kilts – but his work as a doctor meant I was born and raised in the East Midlands, which is billiard table flatness.When we would visit my granny in Forres as a kid my brain would be absolutely fried by the beauty of the place, I just always had an affinity and always felt Scottish – although when I moved there when I was 18 I was constantly and very much reminded that I wasn’t!My parents enrolled me at the Findhorn Foundation in Forres, which is a spiritual community, where I did something called the Youth Programme, which enabled me to develop my photography and led to my career, and had me moving back to Scotland as soon as I could.Dad loves my work and is so proud. He was an amateur photographer and had a dark room at our home, and I used his Rolleiflex as my first camera I’ve been lucky to have a dad who is so supportive.My two brothers are very academic, and obviously my dad is too, being a doctor – plus my grandparents were doctors, so I had a lot of pressure to “do something”. I’m dyslexic, and at school I just wasn’t academic, so photography really opened up so much.The Isle of Mull is both one of my and my dad’s favourite places in Scotland, and I love exploring every nook and cranny with my camera. It’s incredible and erse, a bit like a mini Scotland in one. It’s mountainous and moory and it has breathtaking beaches.It’s wild but it’s got towns like Tobermory where there’s theatre, and there’s a real sense of community about it, yet it still has this complete remoteness, which is what I love most about it.And of course, there’s the distillery in Tobermory. The whisky somehow manages to taste like Mull by encapsulating its myriad qualities. It’s beautiful, peaty and completely an island whisky.To learn more about the art of the Hebridean distillers visit tobermorydistillery"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/94814201448a1649af10cc16d17966d97bb67917/0_286_4284_2570/master/4284.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=05d9f8267d998988279d0a4129c5aa3e","title":"i can go for that the smooth world of yacht rock review katie puckrik bbc four","story":"Katie Puckrik takes a leisurely voyage through the suave micro-genre of pop pioneered in the 70s by Hall and Oates and the Doobie BrothersFriday night on BBC Four: time for a documentary aimed at the sort of music fan who, when it comes to genre categorisation, appreciates the finer things. It’s important to separate, for example, yacht rock from the slightly but crucially different sounds of soft rock, smooth rock, FM rock, AOR, MOR, cocaine rock and wine-bar pop. To do that, Katie Puckrik moseyed through the cultural shifts in America in the 70s in part one of I Can Go for That: The Smooth World of Yacht Rock.A good genre-based rockumentary is always about the social change that brought about the new style, and if that part’s done well it can compensate for any shortcomings of the musical appreciation itself. We heard how the death of 60s mass-movement idealism led, in the new decade, to introspective inidualism, personified by the solo singer-songwriters who congregated in Laurel Canyon, Los Angeles. Then bands came back in vogue, retaining the lush, laid-back sound while dialling down the navel-gazing lyrics to create the perfect soundtrack for listeners trying to ignore Watergate and Vietnam.This reassuringly vague escapism spread into middle America, helped by the rise of FM radio and boosted by the idea that women were now controlling household spending and would enjoy smooth but heartfelt ballads, with the flipside of that gender emancipation being that men felt freer to convey their emotions in song. Meanwhile, Reaganite consumerism was looming, and pop production was becoming more sophisticated, yet Californian pop was still expected to offer some token counterculturalism.What did all this amount to? Essentially, the Doobie Brothers. Puckrik majored on the “lovely, comforting, furry vocals” of hairy Doobies singer Michael McDonald but, despite all the Spotify playlists and not-ironic club nights that have retrospectively made it a thing, comprehensively defining yacht rock – aspirational but not luxurious, jaunty but lonely, pained but polished – is hard. Then again, part of the glory of micro-genres is the way certain records are arbitrarily ruled in or out. So here, Michael Jackson’s Thriller: yacht. Fleetwood Mac’s Rumours: not yacht. What?Hall and Oates gave the show its title and they were definitely canon, performing the coolly anguished She’s Gone in a 1976 archive clip that must have been a formative influence on Flight of the Conchords. John Oates was interviewed in the present day but was, amid a sea of yacht-rock bloggers and semi-interested rock critics, one of very few contributors who had set sail themselves.Puckrik filled the gaps, more essayist than presenter as she applied her hazy intelligence to Steely Dan, America and the Eagles, while nailing the overall feel of yacht rock with the phrase “ennui deluxe”. There’s a touch of ennui deluxe about I Can Go for That, stretched as it is across two languid episodes (next week: the 80s) when one would have sufficed. But who cares that these Friday-night BBC Four rockumentaries have been mining that era of pop for so long, it’s turned to sparkling dust? Letting it lazily run through our fingers feels good.

A bottle shortage swept the country due to the rate at which beer was being consumed to quench the overheated nation’s thirst.But it wasn’t the demand for their classic range of beers that surprised the brewery bosses most, rather the rate at which its alcohol-free varieties were being drunk.Founded in 1827, Störtebeker, which is in the northern port city of Stralsund on Germany’s Baltic coast and built its reputation as a purveyor to holidaying royals, boasts no fewer than three non-alcoholic varieties among its considerable range of beers. Bernstein, a wheat beer, came out in 2007, then followed Frei, an isotonic pils, and the most recent, Atlantic Ale, last August. Its brewers are working on a fourth in their subterranean testing lab, but the details of that are secret.According to the German Association of Brewers (DBB), now as many as one in 15 beers of the estimated annual 6.2 million hectolitres consumed in Germany contains no alcohol. This is being put down to an increase in health awareness as well as an improvement in the quality of a beverage with a reputation for being flat and tasteless, typically drunk only out of necessity.“It’s no longer considered shameful to ask for an alcohol-free beer,” says Marc Oliver Huhnholz of the DBB. “On the contrary, it seems it’s even becoming something of an accepted lifestyle drink and the stigma is more or less gone.”Germany’s 1,500 breweries, he says, now produce between 400 to 500 alcohol-free varieties of beer, with new ones emerging all the time as the brands compete to improve taste, head and consistency.The growth in their popularity has even gone some way to stem a year-on-year fall in standard beer sales.Improvements in both taste and variety and the fact that most bars in Germany will stock at least one type, says Huhnholz, “means that people are increasing enjoying alcohol-free beers out of choice”.In the second, which applies to the Frei and Atlantic, after the completed fermentation process, the beer flows through a closed system and evaporates, with vacuum enabling the ethanol to boil off at a lower temperature. The flavour from the alcohol vapour is added back into the beer to retain its hoppy flavour.Christopher Puttnies, chief brewer at Störtebeker, proudly shows off his gleaming Entalkoholisierungsanlage or de-alcoholisation facility, a 500-metre sea of twisting stainless steel pipes. It’s part of the brewery’s recent multimillion-euro investment programme and, says Puttnies, a reflection of its long-term commitment to alcohol-free varieties, which now make up one in 10 of the brewery’s sales.“We evaporate it as slowly as possible so as to retain the taste as best we can – there’s a lot of technical fine-tuning involved,” he says. This way just 10 hectolitres of beer can be produced an hour, compared to 100 hectolitres for conventional beer. The factory turns out 50,000 half litre bottles of alcohol-free beer a day in addition to 450,000 bottles of its other beers.Factory workers are allowed to drink the non-alcoholic beers as a refreshment during working hours. Increasingly, says Puttnies, the younger ones in particular even drink it off-duty at home. “It’s a far cry from the days when you wouldn’t be seen dead drinking a non-alcoholic beer,” he adds, recalling the first of its kind which was invented in communist East Germany in the early 1970s by a Berlin brewer. It was called AuBi (Auto Bier). “It was like dish water,” Puttnies says.The number of German bars that are increasingly stocking one or more types of alcohol-free beer is on the rise. Only in Spain is the interest in it as high as in Germany. Though not everyone is convinced.His wife, Ellen, wonders what the point is. “You might as well drink water if you’re not going to drink the real thing,” she says.But Rachel Hundt, sitting outside Cafe am Markt drawing on a non-alcoholic pils from a Bavarian brewery, says: “It’s just what I want in this heat. I like the slightly bitter taste and it might be psychological, but I get a buzz. I suppose it’s from the hops.”Bianca Kison, a waiter, says: “I’d estimate that every fourth beer I sell these days is non-alcoholic. That’s a big change even from two, three years ago. Men, women, young, old, even kids like to sip it. There’s no typical customer.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/13865b7f154c059ab1f7751e53bb3c93e884bed9/0_173_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d4214e1616e1d531624dce4d2d3da933","title":"kensington and chelsea vetoes flagship road safety scheme","story":"Walking and cycling initiative shelved after objections from tiny minority of residentsOne of the UK’s richest boroughs has been accused of jeopardising people’s lives after it unilaterally vetoed a flagship scheme for safer walking and cycling under pressure from a tiny minority of residents.The decision was announced on the eve of the second anniversary of the Grenfell Tower fire in the borough, in which 72 people were killed. Kensington and Chelsea has faced sustained condemnation over its stewardship of the block and its response to the disaster.The scheme, which would introduce new pedestrian crossings and install protected bike routes along some of inner London’s more perilous roads, including Notting Hill Gate and Shepherd’s Bush, was being planned by the office of London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, and Transport for London (TfL).It would run on council roads though, meaning the authority had an effective veto. The council initially said it would take a neutral view before a consultation on the scheme, run by TfL, and then listen to the views of residents.However, at a public meeting on Thursday evening attended by TfL officials, the council announced without warning it was opposing the plan, meaning it will not go ahead, without waiting for the results of the TfL consultation.Will Norman, Khan’s commissioner for walking and cycling, said it was “a disgrace” for the borough to unilaterally veto a scheme on roads on which there had been 275 collisions in the last three years, with the vast majority of serious injuries being to pedestrians and cyclists.“They originally supported consulting the public on the plans, and now midway have shamelessly decided to ditch their support, making a mockery of the idea of listening to the public,” Norman said.“People will die and suffer serious injuries as a direct result of this cynical political stunt. The council’s stubborn opposition to making the borough safer for cyclists and pedestrians is putting residents at risk.”Johnny Thalassites, the councillor who leads on transport and planning for Kensington and Chelsea, said the council was “surprised that TfL have taken such an aggressive tone”.He said: “It is not a political stunt to listen to local residents and businesses, reflect their views, and ask for a rethink on their behalf.”But when asked how many objections had been received, the council said it was about 450 emails, out of a population of 155,000, and “hundreds” of other messages. A council spokesman was unable to say how it was able to determine that the emails and other interactions reflected the overall opinion in the borough, or whether it attempted to do so.Several of the objectors have been high-profile, including the TV presenter Jeremy Clarkson and actor Felicity Kendal.The council has argued on the basis that vehicle journey times in one direction were modelled to be slightly slower with the cycle lane installed, and that this would cause slower traffic speeds and thus extra pollution.Such claims are disputed and not seemingly backed by evidence. Readings at other London routes with protected bike lanes installed have shown significant falls in emissions.Other objections included the loss or moving of two bus stops, and the removal of 23 trees for the scheme. TfL says two trees would be affected.Kensington and Chelsea said it would submit its own plans for different cycle routes, which would not involve separated lanes and would send riders along back streets. There is no final timetable as to when this might potentially be built."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3919980.1560097910!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"government vows to help teachers abroad return home","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWhen asked if the Government would consider more pay for teachers based in the greater Dublin area, the Minister replied that the cost of living was also an issue for other professions. File photograph: GettyMinister for Education Joe McHugh has pledged to tackle barriers preventing emigrant teachers returning home but has warned he does not have “any quick-fix ideas”.Mr McHugh is due to visit the United Arab Emirates this week to host a series of town hall-style meetings with teachers. The initiative is part of a drive to make it easier for them to return to Ireland.School management bodies say a shortage of teachers is causing a “crisis” due to a lack of substitute cover at primary level and qualified teachers in key subjects at second level.Speaking in advance of his visit, Mr McHugh said he wants to identify practical steps that could make it easier for teachers to return home.A key area he says he will examine is providing a mechanism to recognise teachers’ middle-management experience in schools abroad. Many emigrant teachers express frustration that, despite serving as heads of department, this experience is often not recognised here.“We have to look at the progression of teachers, what new skills, what experience they build up in terms of responsibility,” said Mr McHugh. “We have to open up a wider conversation over the roles of responsibility teachers have abroad and how we incorporate that into the system when they return home. I don’t have any quick-fix ideas around it . . . but those teachers bring experience, talent, insight and new perspectives.”Among the obstacles regularly cited by emigrant teachers include difficulties securing full-time posts at home, red-tape involving the Teaching Council as well as the cost of living.Online portalMr McHugh said a representative from the council will join him for the visit to take on board any ideas for streamlining registration or other issues. He said a new online portal, which opened last week, is an example of the kind of practical steps that would assist emigrant teachers.The portal – which operates under the title turasabhaile or “journey home” – will give teachers the opportunity to register their contact details, CVs, preferred employment location and specialist subjects.Mr McHugh, a former teacher who spent a year teaching in the UAE in the mid-1990s, said the visit also aimed to pay tribute to the contribution of Irish teachers abroad. He said teachers were magnificent ambassadors for the State and were boosting the country’s reputation wherever they go.There are an estimated 2,000 Irish-qualified teachers based in the UAE and hundreds have signed up for three meetings with the Minister in Abu Dhabi, El Ain and Dubai.When asked if the Government would consider additional pay for teachers based in the greater Dublin area – which faces some of the most acute shortages – Mr McHugh replied that the cost of living was also an issue for other professions.He is primarily concerned with looking at the kind of practical steps that can be taken in the short to medium term."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3926164.1560538073!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"tree numbers affected by busconnects can be reduced nta believes","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tOver 1,400 properties stand to lose part of their front gardens to accommodate the proposed plans while between 1,500 and 1,600 trees would be lost. Photograph: Dara Mac DonaillThe The National Transport Authority (NTA) has said it believes it can reduce the number of trees that would be impacted by the BusConnects plan following local engagement.It said there is a general sense from meetings and engagements with the public in recent months that limiting parking space is “becoming part of the conversation” along with one-way systems for private cars and traffic restrictions.“We are open to exploring all viable and realistic options where we can get bus and cycling priority and still retain trees – these will form all part of the design work which is being carried out over the summer,” a spokeswoman for the NTA said.BusConnects aims to overhaul the current bus system in the Dublin region by creating 230km of dedicated bus lanes and 200km of cycle tracks along 16 of the busiest corridors along with a redesign of the network.Over 1,400 properties stand to lose part of their front gardens to accommodate the proposed plans while between 1,500 and 1,600 trees would be lost.The NTA said following local engagement it believes it can reduce that figure, adding “we will replace more trees than we remove”.CompensationAffected property owners are expected to receive an average compensation payment of about €25,000 while the NTA said where trees are removed “a comprehensive replanting programme” would be put in place.In its submission to the NTA, the Irish Georgian Society asked the NTA to consider reducing access to the city centre by private cars “before considering undermining the integrity of the historic environment through the removal of historic fabric and street trees”.The society said while it welcomes the potential of the project to “significantly improve the quality of the urban environment” it has reservations about the impact of the removal of “historic boundaries, railings, gates, pavement and street furniture on sensitive historic streets”."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Houses of the Oireachtas Commission has invested heavily in fitness for its members and staff since private gym opened in 2005Plane being used for training flight appears to have broken in two on impact in a fieldAffected property owners expected to receive average compensation payment of \u0026euro25,000Mary Mitchell O\u0026rsquoConnor says proposals are \u0026lsquonot worth sacrificing a community for\u0026rsquoLatest figures show six criminal investigations into false claims opened every monthOPW chairman stresses increases not comparable to children\u0026rsquos hospital overrunsNew HSE boss, who is seen as accountable, tough and innovative, faces a daunting taskIFPO seeking legal advice on overturning agreement between Ireland and UKGovernment will have to deal with next UK PM and \u0026lsquoget on with it\u0026rsquo, Enda Kenny saysMinisters deny that decision to give \u0026euro5m to airport was \u0026lsquoparish-pump politics\u0026rsquoCharity Irish Community Rapid Response \u0026euro400,000 for air base in Co CorkBusy stretch near Killarney Lakes off-limits for two weeks, at height of tourist seasonPair told Irish women almost form queues to volunteer TV watching husbands for the initiativeNUI Galway and Blood Cancer Network team up to find treatment for multiple myelomaFianna F\u0026aacuteil says figures \u0026lsquoa disgrace\u0026rsquo despite small fall in patients waiting for operationsPre-emptive anti-retroviral drugs regime to be introduced to combat rise in infections"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3926106.1560535928!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dutch royals to consider bringing men s sheds to the netherlands","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tQueen Maxima of the Netherlands pictured at Cobh pier during the Dutch King and Queen’s three-day State visit to Ireland. Photograph: Daragh Mc SweeneyProvisionThe Dutch Royals are to explore the possibility of bringing Men’s Sheds to the Netherlands after being told how Irish women nearly form queues to volunteer their retired husbands who spend “all day at home watching television.”Former councillor Barry Cogan of Carrigaline Men’s Sheds told King Willem-Alexander and Queen Maxima in Cork on Friday that women often send their spouses to take part in the community-based initiative. “They say ‘he is driving himself mad and he is driving us mad.’ So they send them to us.”Speaking during a visit to Fort Camden, in Crosshaven, Queen Maxima told Mr Cogan that it was “important to have a second life” following retirement.The king said he could “well imagine” that women would want their husbands out from under their feet and praised the sheds for tackling social isolation amongst older men.King Willem-Alexander asked if the sheds were purely a rural initiative and seemed particularly interested to know that they also operate in cities.The royal couple said they were interested in setting up sheds in the Netherlands through their Orange Foundation and praised the sheds for the immense contribution they make to the community.Men’s sheds are a network of community non-profit groups with facilities where men can gather to work on projects. Mr Cogan, who is involved in a multitude of activities with the sheds, said when they started in Carrigaline a few years ago, they were the 29th shed in Ireland. Now there are more than 400 sheds across the State. Meanwhile, the under 14s Sarsfield Camogie Club gave the royal couple a demonstration of the sport in Crosshaven. They presented them with hurleys made of Dutch ash and jerseys for their children Amalia, Alexia and Arianne. The queen told the players that their teenage daughters train with the Dutch junior hockey team every year in Ireland.Ciara Rice (13) said the Royals were “really lovely’ whilst Liadan Shepherd (14) said the royal couple were genuinely appreciative of and interested in their gifts.The royals also met a trade delegation in Cobh. They were greeted by Tánaiste Simon Coveney at the port side, avoiding the torrential downpours that had plagued the morning.The Port of Cork and the Port of Amsterdam International have signed a collaboration agreement to strengthen and support each other, to coincide with the royal visit. A Dutch cruiseliner Prinsendam was docked in the town and sounded its horn as the king and queen disembarked their boat to meet dignitaries at the Sirius Arts Centre.The couple started their morning at Cork City Hall where they were greeted by the new Lord Mayor Dr John Sheehan and were presented with a poem titled In Cork, Waiting for the Dutch, by poet Thomas McCarthy.They were also greeted by a sprinkling of enthusiastic Dutch tourists in the city.Amongst the crowd was Wouter Groendijk, who is originally from the Netherlands but has lived in Ireland for 20 years. He says he never expected that the king and queen would turn up on his doorstep.“It is such a great occasion. People like them because they are so approachable. So down to earth. They are part of the nation. They don’t have anything of elevation that you see in other royal families. .”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3926224.1560544471!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"rockall was handed over to uk in 2013 say irish fishers","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIrish naval vessel LÉ Róisín on a routine patrol off Rockall. Photograph: Irish Naval ServiceIrish fisheries organisations are seeking legal advice about overturning a 2013 agreement between Ireland and the UK that includes Rockall in Britain’s exclusive economic zone.Chief executive of the Irish Fish Producers Organisation (IFPO) Francis O’Donnell said the agreement effectively conceded the rock and its surrounding fisheries area in the North Atlantic to the UK.Mr O’Donnell believes that after Brexit “we will be losing a fishing zone we have fished for the last 200 years”.But the Department of Foreign Affairs has insisted the agreement does not affect the entitlement of the Irish fisheries sector to work at the outcrop. The bilateral agreement established a single maritime boundary between the exclusive economic zones and continental shelves of Ireland and the UK, putting Rockall on the UK side of the boundary.It was signed by then tánaiste Eamon Gilmore, who said at the time the agreement established “a clear framework for the government’s efforts to encourage and facilitate the sustainable development of our marine resources in the seafood, oil and gas, renewable energy and biotechnology sectors”.Concerns about the bilateral agreement are the latest element in a dispute that flared late last week when Scotland threatened to take enforcement action against “illegal activity” by Irish vessels fishing within the 19km zone around Rockall.EU watersIreland does not recognise the claim over the disputed territory 386km from the Scottish mainland but has never sought to claim sovereignty itself and, like Iceland and Denmark, considers it part of EU waters.Contacts between Irish and Scottish officials have been stepped up to “de-escalate” the row.The spokesman stressed that “the issue with Rockall isn’t economic zones. It’s whether the Scottish can claim it as sovereign territory and draw a fishing boundary around it.”“We say that’s not the case and a sea stack can’t be tested in this way,” he added.But Mr O’Donnell said “it doesn’t matter how anyone dresses this up”, it is a territorial issue for Irish fisheries, and Rockall “has effectively been handed over to the UK”.He said “if the Government was strategic it would have registered a claim for Rockall but we’ve never been strategic about natural resources”.Reciprocal rightsSinn Féin senator Pádraig Mac Lochlainn, who raised the issue in the Seanad, asked whether the threat this month from Scotland was linked to controversial legislation restoring reciprocal fishing rights to fishermen from Northern Ireland in the Republic’s waters.He said the legislation was pushed through the Oireachtas on the basis of building good relationships between the Republic and the UK for access to fishing waters after Brexit.“Everybody was puzzled as to why a usually prudent Scottish National Party government in Scotland is taking these measures. It turns out they are based on a 2013 agreement” that he said was done without Iceland’s approval.In effect, he said, “government representatives vindicated the British claim to the fisheries around Rockall and gave the Scottish government the legal basis to threaten to remove Irish boats”.He called on Minister for the Marine Michael Creed to come into the Seanad and clarify when that correspondence started.However, the Department of the Marine said it was a matter for the Department of Foreign Affairs."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3926042.1560527692!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"the outsider candidate with a vital message for democrats","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDemocratic presidential candidate and former Colorado governor John Hickenlooper speaks during the California Democratic Convention in San Francisco, California on June 1st. Photograph: Stephen LamReutersThe next US presidential election may be 17 months away, but the race to become the Democratic nominee is well under way.In echoes of the Republican campaign for 2016, which saw dozens compete to become the party’s nominee, this time it’s Democrats who are jostling in a crowded field. Twenty-four candidates have thrown their hat in the ring, arguing that they are the right person to take on Donald Trump in 2020.Although the entry of Joe Biden into the race in April changed the dynamic of the contest as he rapidly became the frontrunner, it’s early days.One of the presidential hopefuls is John Hickenlooper. This week the former Colorado governor brought his wares to Washington, where he addressed the National Press Club.In such a crowded field it’s tricky to stand out from the crowd. Hickenlooper can’t even depend on being the candidate with the unusual name – he has tough competition in this regard from Pete Buttigieg, the youthful mayor of South Bend, Indiana, who is now widely known as “Mayor Pete” such is the confusion about the pronunciation of his Maltese surname.But while Hickenlooper may not be a household name, he comes to the table with a respectable political record.Walked the walkA former two-term mayor of Denver who was governor of Colorado between 2011 and 2018, Hickenlooper is popular in his home state. He presided over a strong economy and left office having implemented a range of progressive social measures such as the legalisation of marijuana and the expansion of pre-kindergarten education.He has an interesting personal story to boot – having been made redundant as a geologist in the 1980s, he started a brewery business in a neglected area of downtown Denver, before running for mayor.Though the genial 67-year-old is trailing at about 1 per cent in the polls, he made no apologies about his decision at his event in Washington. “I am the only person running who has actually done what everyone else is talking about.”He promptly turned his attention to Bernie Sanders, lambasting the vision of “democratic socialism” outlined by the Vermont senator earlier in the week.“I fundamentally disagree that we should do away with the Democratic regulated capitalism that has guided this country for over 200 years,” he said, criticising his colleagues for not calling Sanders out.“Democrats must say loudly and clearly that we are not socialists. If we do not we will end up helping to re-elect the worst president in American history,” he said, correctly pointing out that Republicans are effectively using the socialist label to attack Democrats in the run-up to the election.Refreshing optimismInstead, Hickenlooper, a self-made millionaire, is firmly positioning himself as a centrist. Pointing to his experience in governing Colorado, he said that “sometimes you have to talk to Republicans”. American capitalism has to be reformed, he said, but this can’t be done by “endlessly expanding government or by demonising the private sector”.His message is that Medicare for all – the idea of a universal, government-paid healthcare programme – and the Green New Deal – a climate-conscious government investment programme – are pie-in-the-sky policies which won’t wash with most Americans.Nonetheless, for all his big ideas, Hickenlooper is unlikely to make the cut when the Democratic field whittles down. Though he just reached the threshold to qualify as one of the 20 Democratic candidates taking part in the first debate later this month in Miami, he faces formidable competition from better-known candidates such as Biden, senators Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren and former Texas congressman Beto O’Rourke.This is not stopping him from trying, however. He has made several trips to early-voting states like Iowa, New Hampshire and North Carolina since announcing his candidacy in March.His sunny brand of optimism is refreshing. It also offers some lessons for those who are more likely to be in the race for the long haul.Over the past few months, he said, he has been struck by how consistent voters’ concerns are in each state – healthcare is the top-ranking issue, he says, followed by climate change and economic stability. “We’ve gotten to a place in this country that a majority of Americans don’t think they’re going to be better off than they are in 10 years than they are today,” he says.As Democrats begin the process of deciding who is best-positioned to win back the White House in 2020, taking those concerns on board is vital if the party wants to connect with voters."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/05/17/TELEMMGLPICT000147339863_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"judges given new expenses policy telegraph discovers judiciary","story":"The Ministry of Justice approved expenses including shampoo and crockery.  Lord Chief Justice, Lord Ian Burnett, pictured, claimed for multiple journeys to and from his homeMinistry of JusticeThe judiciary are to be given a new expenses policy after The Daily  found that Britain\u0027s most senior judges have claimed for crockery, shampoo and a taxi to transport ceremonial robes on taxpayer-funded expenses.Expenses data released under the Freedom of Information Act shows how some of the most high-profile members of the judiciary in England and Wales have had claims for everyday items as well first-class trains approved, even though they receive a salary of at least £180,000.At present, judges are encouraged to follow the expenses policy for Ministry of Justice (MOJ) civil servants, and the judiciary has also set out specific guidance relating to travel, accommodation and relocation....To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletMinistry of JusticeRAF sergeant jailed for role in £1 million drug smuggling ringRussian bots tried to influence EU elections, says BrusselsRoyals give seed fund to wounded warriors helping medical scienceOne in six baby boomers has second home, Resolution Foundation report findsBlue badges for anxiety to be given go ahead as \u0026#39hidden disabilities\u0026#39 to be counted for first time Cricket chiefs plan alcohol free stadia for new event in bid to lure younger fans from migrant communitiesDavid Bowie thanked me for punching him in the face, says childhood friend whose blow gave star his different coloured eyesChuka Umunna is expected to want to run to be LibDem leader within 12 months, LibDem MPs sayCyclist who left pensioner with life-threatening injuries after crash convicted under Victorian lawPensioners to march on BBC offices across Britain in protest against plan to axe licences for over-75sAngry parents write to Nicola Sturgeon and John Swinney over \u0026#39deplorable\u0026#39 school subject choicePolice officer cleared of using his dog as a weapon to \u0026#39vent his contempt\u0026#39 for criminalsJo Brand will be back on Radio 4 next week, as police say they will take no further action over her commentsNHS is turning away blood donors as online booking service causes chaosRevealed: secret Tory plan for members to crown Boris Johnson as new leader unopposedDominic Raab: Tories have more chance of winning election with me than the \u0026#39privileged elite\u0026#39Comment: The Tory survival instinct has finally kicked in: only Boris can deliver BrexitGravel is back in fashion, says plant expert, as gardeners try to save waterBritain\u0026#39s biggest banks considering introducing carers cards in attempt to stop cashpoint fraudDuchess of Sussex\u0026#39s cookbook sells 130,000 copies to make £557,638 for Grenfell community kitchenAfrica\u0026#39s Great Green Wall: Can an ambitious project bring life back to the desert?We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"expenses podcast lone campaigner took whole parliament","story":"Journalist and freedom of information campaigner, Heather BrookeTucked away in the back of New Labour’s 1997 manifesto is a promise.

An accompanying message invited students to get in touch via a direct message “if you want tomorrow’s A-level maths, stats and mechanics paper 3 exam”.Others claimed that the entire paper had been leaked and was circulating in group message conversations on the morning of the exam.This is the third consecutive year that questions from Edexcel’s Maths A-level papers have surfaced online ahead of the exam.Police launched an investigation last summer after questions were reportedly circulating online where they were being auctioned off for hundreds of pounds the night before around 50,000 students sat the A-level exam. In 2017, last minute changes were made to the exam paper at some schools after it emerged that questions had been disseminated ahead of the exam.Pearson said that a total of 29 candidates have been disqualified over the two leaks, and police investigating the 2017 breach have now passed a file to prosecutors.This is the first cohort of pupils to take the reformed Maths A-levelA possible criminal offence would be theft, if the exam paper had been improperly obtained from the exam board. Earlier this year, Pearson announced that some of this summer’s exam papers will be micro- in an attempt to combat online leaks. Under the new security initiative, micro-chips were inserted into packs of A-level and GCSE questions, allowing Pearson to track the time, date and location of an exam pack if it is opened prematurely.This means that the school or exam centre in question can immediately be alerted to the breach, which should make it easier for officials to swiftly identify the perpetrator and contain any potential leak before information is circulated more widely.  Some of this summer\u0027s A-level Maths papers were micro-chipped, The Daily  understands, but it is unclear whether the questions that were were leaked online had been included in the pilot. Roughly 60,000 students took EdExcel’s Maths A-level, which consisted of three exam papers spread over last week and this week.    This is the first cohort of pupils to take the reformed Maths A-level, which was designed to be more challenging and better prepare sixth form students for university.Pupils set up a petition to demand “some form of compensation” or “special consideration” after finding the exam “extremely difficult and unreasonable”.The petition, which by Friday night had accrued over 11,000 signatures, complained that the questions on the exam board Edexcel’s Maths A-level papers were “unlike any specimen, past or textbook questions”.A separate petition claimed that students’ hopes of attending university have been “shattered” thanks to the Maths exams.But Pearson, which owns the exam board, said that students should be “reassured” that grade boundaries are set depending on the difficulty of each exam.They explained that this “ensures a fair system, so that students of the same ability will be awarded the same grade in different years, even if there are differences in the demand of papers”.Ofqual, the exams watchdog, uses a system called “comparable outcomes” to ensure that roughly the same proportion of pupils get similar grades each year, and those who are the first to take the new, reformed courses are not at a disadvantage compared to other cohorts. “All students should be reassured we have well-established processes in place to ensure no-one will be advantaged or disadvantaged, and this paper will not have to be resat.”An Ofqual spokesperson said they are aware of “allegations of malpractice or wrongdoing in relation to Edexcel’s maths paper” and are working with Pearson to establish the facts.Russian bots tried to influence EU elections, says BrusselsRoyals give seed fund to wounded warriors helping medical scienceOne in six baby boomers has second home, Resolution Foundation report findsBlue badges for anxiety to be given go ahead as \u0026#39hidden disabilities\u0026#39 to be counted for first time Cricket chiefs plan alcohol free stadia for new event in bid to lure younger fans from migrant communitiesDavid Bowie thanked me for punching him in the face, says childhood friend whose blow gave star his different coloured eyesChuka Umunna is expected to want to run to be LibDem leader within 12 months, LibDem MPs sayCyclist who left pensioner with life-threatening injuries after crash convicted under Victorian lawPensioners to march on BBC offices across Britain in protest against plan to axe licences for over-75sAngry parents write to Nicola Sturgeon and John Swinney over \u0026#39deplorable\u0026#39 school subject choicePolice officer cleared of using his dog as a weapon to \u0026#39vent his contempt\u0026#39 for criminalsJo Brand will be back on Radio 4 next week, as police say they will take no further action over her commentsNHS is turning away blood donors as online booking service causes chaosDominic Raab: Tories have more chance of winning election with me than the \u0026#39privileged elite\u0026#39Revealed: secret Tory plan for members to crown Boris Johnson as new leader unopposedComment: The Tory survival instinct has finally kicked in: only Boris can deliver BrexitGravel is back in fashion, says plant expert, as gardeners try to save waterBritain\u0026#39s biggest banks considering introducing carers cards in attempt to stop cashpoint fraudDuchess of Sussex\u0026#39s cookbook sells 130,000 copies to make £557,638 for Grenfell community kitchenAfrica\u0026#39s Great Green Wall: Can an ambitious project bring life back to the desert?Chinese-owned company makes parts for British F-35 fighter jets, MoD revealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/06/14/TELEMMGLPICT000022087709_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqz0FILhSVaz4BDNEYZVm_87z8rEz4KCJvYv6wucCHBrI.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"one six baby boomers has second home resolution foundation report","story":"Baby boomers are largely buying up second properties in the UK to rent out, the report foundBuy to letOne in six baby boomers now has a second home, analysis by the Resolution Foundation has found. More than 1.2 million people born in the 1950s reported owning an additional property - including buy-to-let and overseas - between 2014 and 2016.The number of British adults who own a second property has grown by 53 per cent since 2001, sitting at 5.5 million people and a total value of £941 billion.The figures come despite the overall decline of home ownership across the UK, which peaked in 2003 at 58 per cent of families but then continued falling until 2016.The rise in multiple property ownership is down to a “rapid growth” in the number of people buying houses in Britain to rent out, the report said, with almost two million people - the majority being older, higher income and southern - owning buy-to-lets.The second home boom has also benefited millennials, with seven per cent of those born in the 1960s and 1980s having additional property wealth by the age of 29,  the Foundation’s Game of Homes report found.The “surprisingly rapid rise” of multiple property ownership among the young generation could mean that those currently in their 30s may be on the way to similar rates of additional property ownership as today’s middle-aged cohorts.“If we were to redraw the chart of additional property ownership by age in thirty years’ time, there is a chance it might not look particularly different from today,” the report said.Buy to letThe  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

on Friday that it says shows Iran\u0027s Revolutionary Guard removing an unexploded mine from one of the oil tankers targeted near the Strait of Hormuz.It suggested the Iran had sought to remove evidence of its involvement from the scene.US Central Command also released photographs showing the apparent mine, which attaches to the side of a ship magnetically.Release of the classified black-and-white images showed US determination to convince the international community that Iran was responsible for Thursday\u0027s attacks on the Japanese-owned Kokuka Courageous, and the Norwegian-owned Front Altair.However, the Japanese operator of Kokuka Courageous said the crew saw flying objects just before the attack, suggesting the tanker was damaged by something other than mines. Yutaka Katada, the company president, said reports of a mine attack were false.Both vessels suffered explosions, forcing crews to abandon ship and leave them adrift in waters between Gulf Arab states and Iran. All crew members were safely evacuated.Navy Captain Bill Urban, a Central Command spokesman, said the Revolutionary Guard vessel was observed at 4.10pm local time approaching the Kokuka Courageous.He said: It was observed and recorded removing the unexploded limpet mine from the Kokuka Courageous.He added: The United States has no interest in engaging in a new conflict in the Middle East. However, we will defend our interests. Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, said: Taken as a whole these unprovoked attacks present a clear threat to international peace and security, a blatant assault on the freedom of navigation and an unacceptable campaign of escalating tension by Iran.Mr Pompeo said American assessment of Iran\u0027s responsibility was based on intelligence sources, the weapons used and the level of expertise, saying no proxy group operating in the area has the resources and proficiency to act with such a high degree of sophistication.In a statement the Iranian mission to the United Nations said Tehran categorically rejects the US unfounded claim with regard to 13 June oil tanker incidents and condemns it in the strongest possible terms.It accused the United States and its allies, including Saudi Arabia, of warmongering.Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, said the UK believed the US assessment that Iran was responsible but repeated his warning there was a serious danger of the US and Iran stumbling into an unwanted war. “We have no reason not to believe the American assessment and our instinct is to believe it because they are our closest ally, Mr Hunt told the Today programme. “We are very worried about the situation in Iran because at the moment both sides in this dispute think the other side doesn’t want war and the risk you have is that then they doing something provocative that leads to catastrophic consequences that weren’t intended.” The explosions, which left one of the oil tankers burning outside the strategic Strait of Hormuz waterway, marked the most serious incident since the White House warned in early May that Iran was plotting attacks in the region.    The incident came one month after Iranian forces allegedly used naval mines to blow holes in two oil tankers and two smaller ships off the Emirati port of Fujairah. The US publicly said Iran was behind that attack, while Tehran denied responsibility. Javad Zarif, the Iranian foreign minister, said “suspicious doesn’t begin to describe” the incident in Gulf of Oman. He previously suggested without evidence that Israel was staging the attacks to undermine Iran.   Responding to Mr Zarif\u0027s comments, Mr Pompeo said:  Foreign Minister Zarif may think this is funny but no one else in the world does.The explosions at sea came hours before Shinzo Abe, Japan’s prime minister, met with Ayatollah Khamenei, the supreme leader of Iran, on a diplomatic mission intended to try to ease tensions between Iran and the US.But the Japanese leader’s efforts appeared to bear little fruit. Ayatollah Khamenei refused to hear any messages from Donald Trump delivered by Mr Abe, the Iranian government said. The ayatollah also said Iran was not seeking nuclear weapons but “America could not do anything” to stop Tehran if it did decide to pursue a nuclear course. Mr Trump on Thursday ruled out the possibility of making a deal with Iran, saying: While I very much appreciate PM Abe going to Iran to meet with Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, I personally feel that it is too soon to even think about making a deal. They are not ready, and neither are we!Both tankers were carrying “Japanese-related” cargo, according to Japan’s government. It was not clear if that was a coincidence or if the targeting of the ships was done deliberately to coincide with Mr Abe’s visit to Tehran.   While Iran’s civilian government denies responsibility for any of the attacks, it is possible that the Revolutionary Guard, who answer directly to the supreme leader, are carrying out operations without the government’s knowledge or consent. Iran tries to keep tensions between the two sides concealed but they spilled into the open early this year when Mr Zarif threatened to resign after he was left out of a key meeting while a senior Revolutionary Guard commander was invited.Markets Hub I Brent SpotThe attacks capped six weeks of building tensions between Iran and the US during which time Mr Trump has ordered an aircraft carrier, a bomber taskforce and 1,500 additional troops to the Middle East.  Both the US and Iran say they are not looking for war but Britain and other countries have warned of the danger that the two sides could stumble into an unintended conflict. Antonio Gutteres, the UN secretary general, condemned the attack and warned that the world cannot afford “a major confrontation in the Gulf region”. Any fighting near the Strait of Hormuz, the waterway which transports 20 per cent of the world’s oil, would likely cause serious damage to global energy supplies.Analysts said that Iran appeared to be lashing out in order to send a message in response to crippling US sanctions imposed by Mr Trump after he withdrew the US from the 2015 nuclear deal.“I think Iran is showing that it has teeth,” said Charles Hollis, a former British diplomat in Tehran who is now managing director of the Falanx Assynt consultancy. “It’s a way of showing that if they are backed into a corner they are not without means of causing grief.” Iran has warned that it will begin enriching high-grade uranium, the kind that could be used for a nuclear weapon, in July unless Europe finds a way to get around US sanctions and prop up the Iranian oil and banking sectors.  The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

And thatthey didn’t do it, they’d have to close some channels down.Really  How about sacking Gary Lineker  Does he really deserve almost million quid a year for whining about Brexit and telling you what’s coming next on Match Of The Day There are plenty more big-star salaries that could be sacriced, too.But how about getting rid of the vast swathe of middle managers in the BBC When I was a journo there I had to answer to about  bosses, most of who were inept and who usually disagreed with each other.

dioptres – a measurement of the focusing power of the lenses needed to correct her eyesight.A person with mild myopia registers somewhere between -. and -D.He told Wired this was due to the eyeball growing, especially in populations of Asian descent, and causing severe visual impairment, through glaucoma retinal detachment and other retinal problems.He said: The initial theory for this is that people are doing more near-plane reading activity with smartphones which is encouraging the eye to become myopic to meet that environmental need.Mr Bastawrous added that another factor was that people are now spending less time outdoors than we did previously.He suggested that people were not getting enough UV light exposure, which was a likely predictive factor for becoming very shortsighted.The eye specialist added: So spending time looking at near targets like smartphones may be contributing but that also means that children are not spending time outside, playing outdoors and kicking a football around, which is having a knock-on effect of not looking out into infinity very often.Many people no longer spend time looking at the stars and the mountains, theyre looking at screens more often instead.Dr Liu Wei, at the Yangzhou Maternal and Child Care Service Centre, said the girl’s case was down to prolonged and premature usage of electronic devices.A report from the World Health Organisation in April recommended toddlers under the age of one should not be exposed to electronic screens and that kids between the age of two and four should be limited to no more than one hour of “sedentary screen time” a day.According to figures released by China’s National Health Commission, the overall myopia rate in kids and adolescents was . per cent in  and in high school students it was  per cent."},{"url":null,"title":"hunters mountain lion wyoming yellowstone","story":"Austin Peterson, , Trey Juhnke, , and Corbin Simmons, , were sentenced last month to a three-year worldwide hunting ban after authorities tracked them down via social media.According to investigation documents, other hunters alerted game wardens to photos of the three men from Montana posing with their illegal mountain lion kill, which had been shared to Instagram, Snapchat and Facebook.In one of the photos posted to social media, two of the men are standing behind a horizontal tree branch that the dead animal is draped over.In another, one of the young men is holding up the leless dead animal with a smile on his face.After the arrest, Yellowstone special agent Jake Olson told reporters: “We ended up getting a lot of this information from a guy in Bozeman off of Facebook because of a bunch of stuff on social media.Fox reports that each of the men admitted to shooting the mountain lion in the park on December  of last year, before taking it back to their vehicle across the border.But they later changed their story when authorities interviewed them separately.The three men contradicted details in each other’s accounts, including details of the location of the boundary posts, the colour of Peterson’s GPS screen when it supposedly maled and who shot at the lion.Authorities learned that all three men had fired at the mature male lion, which was shot eight times and killed it after it crossed the border into Yellowstone.The men’s actions were found to be in violation of the Lacey Act of , per the National Park Service, which prohibits the taking, selling or purchasing of wildle from protected areas.Hunting mountain lions is legal in the state of Wyoming and Yellowstone National Park, but the trio had deliberately crossed the parks borders and killed the animal in a protected area.They also tried to sneak the animal back to their car without telling authorities -

I was doing my job. I was ordered to go there, so I went. I wasnt afraid,” he said, the MailOnline reported.“Immediately I heard a noise that meant the water was draining.

He looked like he had the worries of the world on his shoulders.”But after news came through that a deal — which will still see around  of his UK stores close and around , jobs at risk — had been agreed, Green could at least unwind on his £million superyacht moored nearby.It has been a tumultuous week in a scandal-hit few years for the retail magnate. On Tuesday another woman broke cover in the US to accuse him of sexual harassment.Fitness instructor Jenner McAmis claimed she had to wear several jackets to deter the “grabby” businessman from trying to grope her.Jenner, , told The Sun she was speaking out for the women in the UK who were muzzled by a court order brought by the tycoon last year.Croydon-born Green, , has separately been charged with four counts of assault for allegedly groping Pilates instructor Katie Surridge.The case is due to be heard on Wednesday but Green, who denies the claims, is not expected to attend.The business boss has also been engulfed by accusations of sexist, racist and bullying behaviour towards staff.Some alleged victims have been prevented from speaking out due to controversial non-disclosure agreements.In May the man once celebrated for his Midas touch was again accused of groping his female staff.Under protection of Parliamentary privilege, Lord Hain revealed that an alleged whistleblower had told him Green was “touching and repeatedly slapping women staff’s bottoms, grabbing thighs and touching legs”.The series of scandals has led to growing demands that he be stripped of his knighthood from, among others, Lib Dem leader Vince Cable and MPs Frank Field and Jess Phillips.Downing Street insists it is a matter for independent review.Green’s fall from grace began after BHS, the retail chain he sold in March  for £, went into administration leaving a £million hole in its pension fund.He later agreed a £million cash settlement to plug the gap.The businessman has spent years commuting to work in Britain, flying in on a £million Gulfstream private jet and staying at Mayfair’s luxury Dorchester Hotel before ing to Monaco for the weekend.But now it seems he wants to move to the French principality for good.A friend said recently: “He doesn’t want to be in Britainhe’s not wanted here. He feels he’s been treated appallingly and has no desire to come back.”The Met police has been under pressure to launch an investigation into Green’s alleged sexual harassment, and friends believe he could be targeted more easilyhe s.In Monaco, Green lives in a -storey tower where Beatle Ringo Starr once owned an apartment and where the cheapest flats sell for £million.According to locals, Green is often seen strolling down Avenue Princesse Grace on the seafront, one of the most expensive streets in the world.After the BHS scandal broke, there were reports that some of his Monaco friends had cooled on him.One prominent resident was “thoroughly p***ed off” with him, saying that he had dragged “the whole principality into the dirt”.Another neighbour claimed “people don’t want to be associated with him in the way they used to be”.Few of those names would want to be pictured with him now, and it is doubtful we will again witness scenes as extravagant as his £million th birthday party back in .For that celebration he was joined in Mexico by guests including Kate Hudson, Leonardo DiCaprio, Simon Cowell and Naomi Campbell.Music came from Robbie Williams and The Beach Boys, while Michael Buble duetted with his daughter Chloe.Since then Simon Cowell has made his change of feelings perfectly clear — in November last year he paid around £million to buy back Green’s five per cent stake in his company Syco.The tycoon has also lost several female aides in the wake of the #MeToo scandal.In February Baroness Karren Brady, a columnist on The Sun On Sunday, quit as chairman of Taveta Investments, the holding company which owns Arcadia.Non-executive director Sharon Brown and in-house solicitor Deborah Cooper also left the company.In March Green was dumped by PR firm Maitland AMO after they decided his reputation was “too toxic”.And according to The Sunday Times Rich List, he has lost his coveted billionaire status, with his fortune dropping from £.billion to £million over the past  months.Green, who is married to Tina and has children Chloe and Brandon, is now th on the list.Daughter Chloe has also been making headlines lately.Her relationship with “Hot Felon” Jeremy Meeks is reportedly on the rocks after she posed without her engagement ring at a charity gala this month.The -year-old heiress was said to be upset that Meeks did not attend their son Jayden’s first birthday party, and was instead pictured in Calornia a few days previously.Meeks, who has been snapped cosying up to other women in the past few weeks, is also refusing to sign a pre-nup agreement that the Greens requested.It seems Green has plenty to think about as he strolls in the Monaco sunshine.The rump of his retail empire, which also includes Burton, Wallis and Evans, may have been saved for now, but it is under pressure from online competition, hefty business rates and changing fashion tastes.At one of his doomed UK stores, Topshop in Ashton-under-Lyne, Gtr Manchester, signs were advertising reductions of up to  per cent.Asked about the reported store closure, one young employee said: “We’ve been told not to say anything.”Passing shoppers said they had been put off buying from Topshop by Green’s alleged behaviour.Jessica Gregson, a -year-old carer, said: “I wouldn’t shop there as it’s expensive and I’m really put off by Sir Philip Green and how he’s accused of acting towards women. It’s all horribly sleazy.” Her mum Jo, , said: “It’s not what it used to be. It’s a shame as people are losing jobs.”Simone Clutton, , who works in a cosmetics shop, was coming out of the store having not bought anything.The mum of two said: “I think it is a bit old fashioned now and they haven’t really kept up with the age of internet shopping.“Less and less people go to his shops but I think Sir Philip’s reputation has something to do with that. He’s seen as sleazy and a bully and that does put women off especially.”The day after the vote to save his empire, Green’s ft superyacht Lionheart steamed into Monaco after coming down the coast from Italy.Its arrival will make a welcome distraction for a man whose world is in turmoil.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The big dference being everyone with a phone can eventually vote on the BGT freak-fest, whereas only .% of the electorate, a section comprising like-minded, wild-eyed aliens, gets the final say on the country’s next leader. As we challenged them to tell usthey’d ever taken drugs, outsiders must surely have been asking what kind of mind-bending substances the British have been on these past few years to end up having to choose one of these fth-rate Tory chancers to lead us out of the monumental morass their party has dropped us in. I genuinely don’t know how  of them had the gall to stand before us and big themselves up as the next Prime Minister.    They were basically saying we put the country in a coma by crashing the businto a brick wall, then drove through the wall into a field of stinking cow manure until it became completely stuck.Yet despite all that we believe we’re the best people available to drive the bus out of the quagmire, even though we don’t have a workable plan to do so. Jeremy Hunt told us he’d never been a naughty boy despite failing to declare a % share in a property firm used to buy himself seven luxury flats.Boris Johnson, shameless as ever, hid from scrutiny, bribed high-earning Tory members with tax cuts and lied about everything .

At least that ventriloquist’s dummy in an ill-fitting suit, Rory Stewart, had the balls to admit his party had royally screwed this country, and his fellow contenders didn’t have a clue how to unscrew it. He’s right. Instead of begging for forgiveness they’re selling themselves as our saviours, banging on about carrying out the will of the people when the will of a ­minuscule percentage of their ageing members will decide our future. They are intellectually and morally bankrupt – haunted by Nigel Farage, petried of Jeremy Corbyn, with no policies, energy or direction and no reason to exist other than self-preservation.

He added: I havenapost had people in the street and having a go at me there might be the odd Momentum Corbynite but I can live with that. He defended his decision to abandon the Labour Party saying the easy thing is to sit in your comfort zone.The former shadow business secretary was one of a number of Labour and Tory MPs who quit the parties in February to form the anti-Brexit Change UK, which was originally known as the Independent Group and has now applied to change its name to The Independent Group for Change.He quit Change UK earlier this month to sit as an Independent before announcing he had joined the Lib Dems on Thursday.Since he has joined the party he has been haunted by  comments where he claimed the Lib Dems were “trying to bury their recent past as the enablers of Tory austerity, but working people will not forget or forgive the damage they did in government and what it is still doing to our communities”.  But today he joked that he had never been a particularly tribal person politically - having moved from Labour to the Independent Group, and now to the Lib Dems. And he said: I am absolutely delighted to be part of the Liberal Democrat team and a member of this party, and Iaposm incredibly grateful for the wonderful warm welcome that I have had since the news broke last night. Mr Umunna continued: My values and my principles come first in all of this: they are the reason why I started a political journey in leaving the Labour Party earlier this year. I am a social democrat with liberal values... and those values revolve around a fair and open Britain, one with a mixed economy which enables everybody to achieve their dreams and aspirations regardless of their background. Asked whether other Independent MPs might join the Liberal Democrats, Sir Vince Cable said: I didnapost brow beat him into doing it but I made it very clear there was an open door and thataposs the same message to people who are still in the wilderness.Challenged on his refusal to hold a by election, Mr Umunna said: Ian Lavery the chair of the Labour Party loves to talk about a Peopleaposs Vote when it comes to a by-election but heaposs somehow allergic to the idea of having a Peopleaposs Vote when it comes to the biggest issue facing this country since the Second World War which is Brexit .First and foremost Under our constitution you elect iniduals - unlike Ian Lavery Iaposd like to change our constitution. Secondly the biggest issue facing my constituency - which scored the highest Remain vote in the land in  - is Brexit and a large part of what drove me to leave the Labour Party is Brexit and the fact that Iaposm opposed to it.And a large part of what has driven me to join the Liberal Democrats is that it opposes Brexit too.My constituents on the whole the overwhelming amount of correspondence Iaposve had today and in addition since Iaposve left the Labour Party has commended me for what Iaposve done which is a dficult thing. Mr Umunna says it finds it bemusing that he gets labelled a careerist.    You donapost leave the political security of one of the two main parties to further your career anyone can tell you that. The Labour Partyaposs position hasnapost changed in the last couple of years as far as I can make out. It has a Brexiter leading the party who refuses to unequivocally commit in every single circumstance to a Peopleaposs Vote on the Brexit deal and to remaining in the European Union and that hasnapost changed. Tonally arguably the biggest sht that came from the Labour Party came when a number of us left the Labour party in February but people shouldnapost kid themselves. I sense weaposve probably topped out in terms of the number of Labour MPs we can get to vote for a Peopleaposs Vote. I think where the additional numbers will come from is from Conservatives. Asked about what illegal drugs he has taken, Mr Umunna said: I have admitted to having smoked cannabis, weed. I havenapost taken any other drug, I havenapost taken cocaine. Vince Cable joked: You havenapost asked me but Iaposm an extreme Puritan and not guilty on all counts. Mr Umunna confirmed that he did not have his sights set on the top job in his new party. He said: Iaposm not going to become the leader of the Liberal Democrats. And added: Iaposm not going to endorse either of the two excellent candidates who are standing to be leader of the Liberal Democrats.

The astonishing strike features in a fantastic new video celebrating the £m raised by The National Lottery for grassroots football. It sees a mystery youngster unleash a rocket from just inside her own half, which wrong-foots the boy in the opposition net and flies in. But what caught our eye was the looks of utter shock on the faces of the boys who canapost quite believe what has happened. Football has the power to change lives - but moments like this prove it’s not just the players at the top of the game who are making a dference.  It’s on the local parks and playing fields where le-changing moments are happening everyday, right across the UK.  Since , players of The National Lottery have raised £billion for good causes, with over £ million being used to support grassroots football initiatives. That’s money that has been raised by you. For every ticket sold, a slice of the money received goes to a huge iety of projects, big and small.  From building new football venues, to inspiring future generations to participate, projects like these have helped thousands of people improve their lives, and made Britain’s communities a better place to live and work.  It’s thanks to National Lottery funding that young players like -year-old Charlie Fryhas found a route into football - despite his disability. Charlie was devastated when he was told he was unable to play mainstream football after being diagnosed with Asperger’s Syndrome seven years ago.  Then his mother Rachel and father Lee discovered Team United, a Scottish-based charity which has received National Lottery funding and offers young players with disabilities a route back into the game. As mum Rachel explains, the results have been le-changing. “Charlie was seven when he was diagnosed. “We were told that because of his sensory issues, he’ll wouldn’t be able to play football which was devastating for him.  “But Team United came at just the right time. The coaches there can read his body language, and understand it. They know how to coach children with Autistic Spectrum Disorder. “He’s now back playing mainstream football with Bathgate Thistle Whites  and they won West Lothian County Cup final last year, with Charlie being voted the team’s player of the year.” Another youngster to benefit is Sophie Brett , who has been able to turn her le around thanks to National Lottery funding.  The -year-old battled PTSD and turned to self-harming after a dficult childhood saw her taken into foster care. But thanks to Swansea-based charity Street Football Wales, which received £k of National Lottery funding in March, Sophie has started to turn her le around. “I’d always had a passion for football and in  my support worker put me in touch with Street Football Wales, who brought me along to a match day once a month, she explained.  “The staff there have all the time in the world to help anyone and everyone – it’s a safe environment to be in. I’m a much better person and my le is much brighter. “There’s light at the end of the tunnel now.” - An average of  National Lottery grants in every UK postcode district - £bn raised for good causes since - Around £m a week to good causes- Over  local football projects supported across the UK   Former army medic and computer engineer Bahman Jamalaldini is another deserving benefactor of lottery funding. His le was turned upside-down when he contracted meningococcal meningitis in  and had to undergo a series of amputations – but National Lottery-funded charity LimbPower soon helped him back on to his new prosthetic feet. “I’ve always loved playing football but I thought my playing days were over,” says Bahman, , from Milton Keynes.  “After weeks in hospital I thought what sort of le is a quadruple amputee like me going to lead  Then I heard about LimbPower which helps amputees and those with physical impairments take part in sports and other activities. “We all bonded with each other playing football, which amazingly I discovered I was still able to do with prosthetic legs. “I’ve discovered, thanks in large part to LimbPower, that I can pretty much do all the sports I did before and live le again to the full.” Hayley Stringfellow, Head of Brand Marketing at Camelot, commented: “Players of National Lottery games raise around £m for good causes every week. We have thousands of stories to tell about the amazing things that are happening thanks to National Lottery funding.  “It’s great to shine a spotlight on the funding of local football projects and the positive impact it has on iniduals and communities.” Over the past  years more than , projects have been funded across the UK - the equivalent of around  National Lottery grants in every UK postcode district.

Geoff Smith, , had his demonstration livestreamed on Facebook in a bid to fight for Bobbiemayaposs legal right to an education. The -year-old was allegedly sent home from Cockburn John Charles Academy in Belle Isle, Leeds for wearing the discreet, clear earring, which her family says helps ease her migraines.So Geoff, a self-employed roofer, covered his hands with glue and a type of plaster called Polyfilla and stuck them to two metal bars outside the school. His protest lasted around one hour but he eventually pulled his hands free when ordered to do so by police. A layer of skin remained attached to the bars.    During the standoff, the father said: I have superglued myself to the gate. My daughter has got a legal right to an education. The superglue is burning my hands at the minute... but I would put myself through any pain so my daughter can live le without pain. After less than a minute a worker from the school comes over and asks: What are you doing . Geoff, who works as a roofer, instructs the man to call the fire brigade.   West Yorkshire Police and the fire service attended the scene during lunchtime. When Geoff yanked himself free, he entered the school to talk to senior staff.Bobbiemay got the piercing in her tragus - the middle part of the outer ear - five weeks ago. Alternative medicine proponents argue some ear piercings stimulate nerves under the skin and muscle tissues, thereby producing pain-relieving substances, such as endorphins. Geoff says the piece of jewellery is not a fashion statement and that he bought the smallest, most inconspicuous stud he could to avoid it being an issue at school.  Speaking yesterday, he said: Itaposs awful for a school to deprive a child of their education for something so minor. We tried everything to stop Bobbiemayaposs migraines - she can be in agonising pain for a week at a time with them. But she hasnapost had one since getting the piercing five weeks ago. The piercing is working, itaposs not coming out. He added: Bobbiemay was doing really well at that school so thataposs where I want her go go back to. Sheaposs missed a lot of school now and itaposs not fair. Sheaposs an intelligent child and they have had no other issues with her until now.  Cockburn John Charles Academy, which serves more than , children, opened in April last year. It is yet to have an OFSTED inspection as a result. In a statement this week, it said: We would like to make it clear Bobbiemay Smith has not been excluded from the academy. She is welcome back at any time, as long as the earring is removed. Students and parents are aware of our clear unorm policy which is applied consistently. In this particular case, medical evidence or a doctoraposs note has not been provided to suggest exceptional circumstances.

If it was not for them I would have given up straight away but there is no point in just giving up, she told Hull Daily Mail .In primary I used to really like school and I did it one year not having a day off and it is just something I have kept up with. I liked primary school more than I liked secondary. I think it is less important and less stressful and you can just chillax in primary, but secondary is more uptight.    If I feel ill I go to school and I feel better. I don’t feel bad when I’m at school. The dedicated teenager, of Greatfield, Hull, is expected to achieve mostly  to  grades in her GCSE’s, with  to ’s in photography and drama. She intends to go to college and possibly join the armed forces as a combat medic. The pupil continued: Geography is one of my favourite subjects because my teacher Mr Greenhough is really good. I also enjoy photography, Mr Capper used to be my form teacher and he is head of photographer and also a good teacher. I also like English and I do cadets and drama after-school.    I want to go into public services. I really want to go in the army one day as a combat medic and then become a paramedic when I come out. I want to do stuff like forensic science and work in a psychiatric hospital trying to people through their struggles. But I want to go into the army first to get my confidence up and work from there.  Parisapos father, John Manolasses, said: It is a great achievement. I said to heryou can do it one year you can do it another and keep going. The more you go to school the more you learn. I don’t think they will see kids like her again and I don’t just mean with her going to school I mean with her commitment with going to school. There was one day where her mum said she had to get up for school and Paris thought it was time to go. As she was heading to school there was no children and she thought she was late and started running.  By the time she got through the school gates the caretaker said to her ‘you do know it is only seven o’clock’. She arrived one hour and  minutes before she was meant to be there. She never realised. Archbishop Sentamu Academy Principal Chay Bell described Paris’ % attendance record as a fantastic achievement. He said: To achieve  per cent attendance throughout your time in school is a fantastic achievement. It shows your commitment and fortitude. Studies show that good attendance, more often than not, lead to excellent outcomes.   We are all incredibly proud of Paris at the Academy and look forward to having many more students with  per cent in the coming years. Her family are rightly sharing her story with the city of Hull.  Christy Coulter has been the headteacher at Stockwell Primary School for nine years and has fond memories of Paris’ ‘unique’ attendance record in primary school and was not surprised she managed to keep it going. He said: “I remember the occasion well, we marked it by buying Paris a bike. It is not something we have done before or since. “It is one of those unique achievements and I am not surprised she has carried it on.  “She was a lovely child, always happy. A very determined inidual and this is part of her character. She was strongly supported by her family who were always proud of her achievements. “It is quite dficult to not be off because children get ill and it is part of growing up. Children need to build up that resilience and she is a great example to children to keep on going. “I’m really proud and Paris’ achievement reflects on the whole community of Greatfield and east Hull.” "},{"url":null,"title":"eczema treatment uk cream cure","story":"NewsMum begs for help for son with such bad eczema he cant sleep more than  hoursTwo-year-old Theo Burchells skin condition is so bad his mum says people mistake him for a burns victimShareCommentsByJack Longstaff:,  JUN News \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA mum says her two-year-old sonaposs skin condition is so bad he aposscreams out in agonyapos and is unable to sleep for more than four hours at night.

Rock Hugo Basil Feilding-Mellen’s th birthday bash saw a who’s who of socialites and stars descend on Stanway House in Gloucestershire, including actress Rosamund Pike and John Lennon’s musician son Sean. Photos on social media showed millionaires rubbing shoulders at his mum’s ,-acre Jacobean manor as families prepared themselves to commemorate the tragedy that killed . Grenfell United, the survivors and bereaved families group, said: “Seeing these pictures is like a gut punch. “We are no closer to justice, yet people that should be answering questions for the deaths of  people and the devastation of our community are living without consequence. It’s disgraceful. “Because of what was done to us there are  birthdays we didn’t celebrate this year and two children who never made it to their first.”    Edward Daffarn lived in Grenfell Tower and almost lost his le in the fire. He said: “It makes me feel like I did when reading the following quote from the Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald: ‘they were careless people...they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness or whatever it was that kept them together and let other people clear up the mess that they made’.” A source who revealed the party had taken place said: “I’m just appalled at the arrogance of these people revelling in the run-up to the Grenfell anniversary. “There are seventy-two people who’ll never have another birthday.” Moyra Samuels, of the Justice  Grenfell campaign, said Rock Feilding-Mellen’s decision to hold a party with his rich and famous pals just three weeks before the two year anniversary of the fire showed he was “morally bankrupt”. She said “He’s quite indferent to the impact that such a thing might have on a grieving and quite sensitive community. He’s oblivious.  “He lives in an elite and removed world, and always has, even though he was he was based not far from the tower. “He’s been raised, nurtured and brought up with this entitled attitude. “It comes as no surprise, but it is indicative of the fact that actually people like him who were involved in the council at the time of the fire and made some serious decisions that influenced what happened are still continuing to act asit is of no consequence that  people died. “They think this should not change their lives, and they will continue to indulge.” She added: “You would have thought this would be a time to show some sensitivity and some subtlety.” Moyra, a teacher, said as the inquiry into the fire dragged on slowly the community felt justice was being denied as key decision makers like Mr Feilding-Mellen moved on with their lives and escaped sanction. She said: “Every aspect of the procedure of justice and truth has been thwarted, in all sorts of ways, by a ruling, privileged elite who indicate to this community and, quite frankly, the rest of the country, that they don’t have any shame in them.”  She added: “He’s completely morally bankrupt. But people like him have the audacity to lecture younger generations.” Fielding-Mellen did not comment when approached by the Mirror. Mr Feilding-Mellen was deputy mayor of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Cha during the refurbishment of the tower, and was the chairman of the housing committee. He reportedly urged refurbishment consultants in  to reduce costs on cladding. At that point £, was cut from a £ million budget and now-banned flammable aluminium  were to be installed, rather than the zinc cladding which was originally planned. After being elected to Kensington in  Mr Feilding-Mellen became deputy leader in  and took a seat on the powerful major planning development committee. In  he warned that the council’s housing redevelopment programme would need to be completed “with no recurrent cost to the general council taxpayer”.  After news of his involvement in the Grenfell refit emerged he was forced to flee his family’s £.million Kensington home in the wake of the fire, fearing for his family’s safety. He stood down as deputy mayor of the borough after the fire, and left the council at last year’s local elections. Days after Grenfell, in , he told friends he was cancelling plans to visit Stanway House for the th birthday of his step-sister Mary Charteris, who is a model and member of the band The Big Pink. Those who did go to Mary’s party included Cara Delevingne, actor Jaime Winstone and aristocrats including Scarlett Spencer-Churchill. Mr Feilding-Mellen, known as Rocky, is the son of Amanda Feilding, the Countess of Wemyss and March. He is the great-great-great-grandson of the seventh Earl of Denbigh and a direct descendant of the Hapsburgs. Amanda Feilding is an outspoken critic of drugs policy, and campaigns on the benefits of LSD and cannabis.Sign the petition: Grenfell Never Again: Keep our buildings safe"},{"url":null,"title":"level maths exam paper leaked","story":"NewsA-Level maths exam paper leaked online ahead of test todayEdexcel is investigating after two questions from the exam paper appeared online - with the whole paper offered for saleShareCommentsByTom DavidsonSenior Reporter:,  JUN Updated:,  JUN NewsPupils sat their A-Level maths exam today \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailQuestions from todayaposs A-Level exam leaked online before the test.Two exam questions from Edexcelaposs maths paper  appeared on Twitter last night.Pearson, the firm which operates the board, has launched an investigation.

And in April last year the force put out a wanted appeal for Fox, , after they received allegations he had incited a child to engage in sexual activity.  Officers visited Woodleyaposs home five times as part of their search for Fox but he remained on the run for four months.

Earlier in the flight a man was filmed swearing at another traveller several rows behind him before being urged to sit down by a woman. The recipient of his verbal barrage was stood next to an air steward who tried to calm the passenger down, only to be blasted with another volley of abuse as she walked towards the cockpit.    The woman who posted the footage said in a message: “Off to a eerrmmmm interesting start with this idiot abusing easyJet staff on our Ibiza flight. “Staff handled it very well and he was removed by police.” The incident happened on board easyJet flight EZY from London Stansted to Ibiza on Friday morning.

A spokesman for easyJet said: “We can confirm that flight EZY from London Stansted to Ibiza on  June was met by police on arrival in Ibiza due to a group of passengers behaving disruptively on board. “Our cabin crew are highly trained to assess and evaluate all situations and to act quickly and appropriately to ensure that the safety of the flight and other passengers is not compromised at any time.    “Whilst such incidents are rare, we take them very seriously and do not tolerate abusive or threatening behaviour on board. “The safety and wellbeing of passengers and crew is always our highest priority.” The Civil Guard is not thought to have made any arrests.

I originally saw an advertisement from local adoption social services looking for adoptive parents and I thought, well, theyaposre not going to want me as a single guy.    But I told them who I was and where I worked and they were really positive and quite enthusiastic about me adopting a child. Nine years on, I have five children and I wouldnapost change a thing. Jack has autism, Ruby has Pierre Robin syndrome and limited use of her arms because of missing bones, Lily is deaf and Joseph has Down Syndrome. Noah has Cornelia de Lange syndrome which affect both his arms and legs. Ben says since he become part of the family itaposs like heaposs aposalways been thereapos.    The dad said: Noah is great and has fit in to our family just perfectly and, to be honest, itaposs like always been there. His new brothers and sisters are great with him, Lily in particular is extremely maternal and helps me feed Noah and things. The full time dad was never bothered about having biological children as he says adopting is just as good. Ben added: Iaposve never wanted biological children because thereaposs much, much more than just being biologically linked to a child. My children are my children - for example they have the same mannerisms as me.    Yes, the might not have the same blood as me, but who cares. I donapost currently plan on adopting more children but Iaposm one of these people who never says never. If in the future a child really needed me and my help, Iaposm sure I would end up adopting them. I definitely see myself fostering more children though - I just love being a dad. Ben explained how he instantly aposfell in loveapos with Noah when he first saw him and knew he needed to join his family.    The dad-of-five said: I was flicking through an adoption magazine that comes from monthly featuring children who are deemed as aposhard to placeapos children, when I came across this picture of a little baby boy who quite clearly had severe complex needs. I thought to myself aposthis little boy needs to join our family where he can be part of something specialapos, but more importantly someone who can accept him and his disability. I instantly fell in love with him what with his mass of brown hair and his beautul blue eyes I knew instantly I wanted him to be by son. Ben has remained single since the young age of  and doesnapost plan on looking for a relationship any time soon, with his dad duties being the most important thing to him.    He added: I have never sought a relationship, as I am happy on my own. Whenever I have at times visualised myself in a relationship and each time I have it always leads to the same conclusion: that my children will always come first. I would literally walk over hot coals to protect them and provide for them so itaposs very easy decision. Anyone can be a father but it takes someone special to be a dad.Ben is raising money for a sensory room for the children - visit his JustGiving page here."},{"url":null,"title":"three teenage girls sentenced gang","story":"NewsThree teenage girls sentenced for gang attack on Egyptian student who later diedThe trio attacked Mariam Moustafa, , near a bus stop in Nottingham and she later died from a strokeShareByTalia Shadwell:,  JUN NewsMariam Moustafa died last year after the attack\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThree teens have been sentenced over an attack on a university student who later had a stoke and died.

This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 13","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWe could be wrong, but the confusion over Minard war memorial seems to be nothing a sit-down over a cup of tea couldn#t fix.It#s a pity the community missed out on the centenary fund, but there are general UK funds available for war memorials.

An implementation plan was produced in December  to cover the years -. Who in Argyll and Bute is responsible for this plan  How many of the outcomes have been achieved As someone who has been involved with autism personally and professionally for many years, I find it extremely disappointing there seems to be an inability by those in authority to get organised enough to address the issues and provide services for autistic people and their families.There is no need for further drafts and consultations.Someone in the authority needs to take responsibility for the existing strategy and implementation plan and get on with it.Maureen Mackintosh, Ardrishaig.Sir,Scotland’s small building firms had a strong start to , in contrast to the UK construction small and medium sized enterprisesector, according to the Federation of Master BuildersScotland.The FMB State of Trade Survey for the first quarter of , the only quarterly assessment of the UK-wide SME construction sector, showed SME workloads declined for the first time in six years.In Scotland, however, there was a jump of  per cent compared with the previous quarter. Thirty per cent of weighted responses were positive, up from  per cent from the fourth quarter of .It is encouraging the Scottish construction industry is bucking the wider Brexit trend with workloads and enquires in rude health. The UK-wide picture is very dferent, with the construction SME sector overall contracting for the first time in six years.Scotland’s good fortune could be due to fewer EU workers being based north of the border compared with other parts of the country, like in London where one in three construction workers are from the EU.Relying less heavily on migrant workers has meant the Scottish construction industry hasn’t fallen foul of thousands of EU workers ing home during the long march to Brexit due to no longer feeling welcome in the UK or sure of their future here.Scotland’s builders, however, must not be complacent. Looking ahead, the First Minister has indicated thatthe UK does leave the EU later this year, she wants a second independence referendum before the next Scottish Parliament election in . This additional political uncertainty, on top of the continued uncertainty stemming from Brexit, could impact on the construction sector in Scotland.The fear is a looming second referendum could test consumer confidence this year and next. For construction SMEs, this is particularly concerning as their prospects are vulnerable to dips in consumer confidence as so much work comes from the private domestic sector.Gordon Nelson, Director of FMB Scotland.Sir,I was joined by my fellow Conservative councillors in Kilmory recently as we discussed atthe numerous challenges facing Argyll and Bute.Ferry sailings, roads, education and the SNP#s late single farm payments were all mentioned.With the SNP hammering local authority spending and cutting our budgets, challenges in delivering services will become more prevalent.Despite this climate of cuts from the separatists, Conservative councillors are delivering for Argyll. This includes extra funding for the Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund, more funding for infrastructure and an increase in roads winter maintenance resources across Argyll.As ever, my fellow Conservatives and I will continue to fight non stop to make sure our rural constituency is not sidelined by this unceasingly urban and separatism-obsessed over centralising Scottish Government.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and Islands ward.Sir,I photographed this unusual visitor to Kilduskland Road, Ardrishaig, on April .

Design fleets comprising the Sigma s, Sonatas, Etchells and Hunter s joined the racing at Tarbert.Amid a flurry of rib activity laying and moving marks, it was not long before the CYCA  passage race fleet approached the finish line.The teams later caught up in the bar for the day one prize giving as new event chairman Glenn Porter welcomed everyone to Tarbert. With a number of races omitted due to protests, it was a nice easy start for Glenn.The Hunter s and Sonatas saw a spread of results after some close racing. The CYCA class  fleet on the Largs passage race was won on corrected time by Celtic Spirit. Additional prizes were awarded to Encore for the passage race line honours and Shona of Ashton for toughing it out at the rear of the passage race.Saturday was a much more challenging day on the water with a light wind and dreich drizzle.

Finally, the CYCA restricted sail fleet saw Celtic Spirit take first place.The  event saw the marquee remain open for the Sunday evening as part of additional shoreside activities supported by Event Scotland.An earlier start on Monday was greeted with sunshine and no wind. This time the challenge was just too much for race officers who had to abandon racing for the day.

It was recommended that for approval.A report for the meeting, prepared by executive director of development and infrastructure Pippa Milne said: #Officers are of the view that the primary benefit to the council in having this site designated as a Centenary Fields site is more in the symbolic sense – that the site is officially recognised by both Fields in Trust and the Royal British Legion as space to be protected for future generations to enjoy.#[It would also be] to commemorate those servicemen and women, as well as civilians, who played their part in the First World War.#There may also be the opportunity to use Centenary Fields status to help lever in external funding for the site.#Every site receives a commemorative plaque to display on site, as well as receiving associated signage, the display of which is optional. There is no requirement for an actual name change.#This status does not prevent disposal at a future point in time, as long as disposal is of a clear advantage to, and in the best interests of, the community from a recreational perspective.#Ms Milne’s report also stated that the council would continue to manage and maintain the park, with Fields in Trust’s role purely an advisory one.There would be no minimum expectation for maintenance requirements, or pressure to make money as a result of any Centenary Fields status.Ms Milne added: #To achieve Centenary Fields status, the site must have a link to World War One and be suitable for sport, recreation and or play.#The only two sites which appear to officers to meet this criteria are Kinloch Park in Campbeltown and Hermitage Park in Helensburgh.#Given that the profile of Hermitage Park is being raised through the £ million restoration project, officers are of the view that, on balance, it would be more appropriate to put Kinloch Park forward.#This is on the basis that Kinloch Park is likely to derive greater benefit from this enhanced status and protection.#"},{"url":null,"title":"beautiful meal accompanies swi agm","story":"President Jean Ives welcomed the members to the tearoom where Frances Hill provided the sustenance.The formal business included a review of the previous year’s events in which Southend#s SWI excelled, winning several events including bowls and a quiz.After a very successful year, the winter competitions# winner was Alison Eynon, who received the trophy, with Jen Ronald second and Fiona Rowland third.The retiring committee of Jean Ives, Fiona Rowland and Trish Jones were thanked for their hard work over the previous three years.

The day after the crash, Superintendent Jim Guy of Strathclyde Police said there had been no evidence from the crew of any problems before the tragedy.He said the evidence available suggested an accident rather than terrorist attack. The scene of the crash was sealed off almost immediately and an air exclusion zone was imposed.Although most of the wreckage was left for accident investigators to examine, it is understood Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch officers removed boxes and cases containing secret papers on Friday morning.On Saturday,  personnel from RAF Machrihanish were drafted in to help find and catalogue debris from the crash.FIFTY YEARS AGOKintyre could be surfers# MeccaKintyre could become the major centre in Britain for surfingthe enthusiasm of two young men gets the encouragement it deserves.One of them, George Raynes, of Bishopbriggs in Lanarkshire, is secretary of the Scottish Surf Club, and with his treasurer, James Short of Glasgow, has just completed a preliminary survey of several of the Kintyre beaches with a view to exploiting them for the sport of surfing.George has surfed on beaches all over Britain and also in the Channel Isles and in Europe and he thinks that the beaches at Machrihanish and Southend could become the Mecca for British surfers and the venue for the British Championships.He was particularly impressed with the waves at Machrihanish but thinks Southend has great potential as well.He told the Courier: #The possibilities here are tremendous. These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area. In the winter one would have to wear a wetsuit, of course, but the conditions are ideal and the wave forms have great potential # after all, they are coming straight in from the Atlantic over the north of Ireland.#What I#d like to see is a surf club established in Campbeltown. It could become a great asset from a tourist and amenity point of view.#And any Kintyre people who really took up the sport would have a great advantage over other surfers when it comes to competition because they have the benefit of readily available beaches all year round.#If this club gets going, the chances are that the British surf champions in the years to come will be Kintyre people.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOOrr Ewing CupFootballers were favoured with beautul weather last Saturday and the games played on Kinloch Park in the Orr Ewing Cup competition brought together very large gatherings of spectators.The match in the afternoon was brought to a sudden termination by an unfortunate dispute over the award of a goal. The opposing teams were Kintyre and HMS Thames.Kintyre opened strongly and after  minutes# play had scored twice. The dispute arose over the award of the second goal, which Thames claimed to be offside.The referee, Mr Duncan McCallum, an old Hearts player, was of a dferent opinion, and on his allowing Kintyre the goal, the naval team without more do walked off the field.It is understood that the Thames team intimated to the league at the weekly meeting on Monday night their withdrawal from the competition.The teams were: Kintyre # Jas McKinlay: James Black and Archd Sharp: M Muir, A McCrank and T Cameron: R McGeachy and D Brown: Dan McNaughton: N Scally and J Donaldson.HMS Thames # Meese: Jesseman and Love: McCloud, Hirst and Fernie: Dunnell and Weekes: McGeachy: Slynn and Segrott.Referee # Mr D McCallum.In the evening, the opposing teams were Campbeltown and Kilbrannan. A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week june 7 2019","story":"As I retreat into the comfort of a warm house and an even warmer coffee, I wonder what it must have been like for Columba and his fellow monks as they made their way from the shores of Ireland to the wilds of Argyll.The fragile shell of a coracle was not the most effective shelter against the wildness of our coastline.Yet they came.

Itrsquos in such a beautul part of our county that the journey there was an adventure in itself.The loch is hidden, surrounded by a wood which embraces its secrets. Irsquod never visited it before, but Irsquod been told how magical this place is and that it has a story attached to it.Finding an appropriate place to park was our first challenge. There is no direct access to the loch and no car park with signposts, so care is needed in finding a suitable place. A private farm road that takes you to the entrance gate is not an option, so initially I struggled to find a suitable place, but some kind advice from a friendly farmer helped us out.Itrsquos a perfect time of year for such an adventure. The woods are fully clothed and still echoing with birdsong. I like to explore new places initially without a map or guide. It adds to the adventure, as we had to decide which way to go and initially wonderedwersquod taken the wrong route. But there is a circular walk around the loch, so once the path is discovered there isnrsquot a wrong way.It is a beautul and tranquil place, and as we wandered along the tree-lined loch I thought about the story of the man responsible for its creation.That man was Harry Younger, of the well-known brewing family. His ancestor, William Younger, had been the man who had built up the famous brewing business which produced Youngerrsquos Ale. A huge chunk of the Canongate in Edinburgh was taken over by their Holyrood brewery, including the site where the Scottish Parliament now sits.When William Younger died in , he was a hugely wealthy and successful businessman but also, it seems, exhausted and overworked. The empire he left was continued by the family but eventually in , the Younger enterprise was merged with rivals McEwanrsquos, to form Scottish Brewers Ltd.This merger, the reasons for which are another story, meant the Younger family branched out into other ventures. In the s, Harry Younger, the then head of the family, bought the land at Baro and began transforming it into the haven of nature it now is.Harry led an interesting and privileged le. He was an internationally known curler who regularly competed and won trophies. His intention was to create a new home amid the beauty of this area of East Lothian. He set about building a house, but also developed Bara Loch as it now exists and surrounded it with an embrace of trees.But the dark clouds of the Second World War intervened in his plans to enjoy this paradise. He had attended Sandhurst in his earlier years and seen the last months of the First World War. He remained involved in the Territorial Army and in January  he was sent to France as commander of a mechanised unit.It is recorded that he was killed in action on June  at St Valery-en-Caux. His unit, the Lothian and Border Horse, had been part of the brave and ferocious defence of the Dunkirk beaches. Anyone with knowledge of this action will understand the hell and desperation of that defence, and the supreme courage and sacrice of the defenders.Harry died on the day these brave defenders had to finally surrender, after over , had been evacuated from the beaches. How he died, what horrors he witnessed, we can only guess. He lies buried in the St Valery-en-Caux Franco-British Cemetery.And so this is the story attached to this beautul place. The man who began its creation never got the chance to enjoy it.In our walk, we arrived at a stone seat overlooking the loch. It had a worn inscription on it. We could make out the words lsquoin memoryrsquo or lsquomemorialrsquo and lsquoYoungerrsquo, but the rest was too worn.But I knew this must be a memorial to Harry Younger, which was later confirmed when I found a wonderful blog called Walking East Lothian in which the author explained he had traced the inscription to reveal Harryrsquos name and the date , the year of the lochrsquos creation.I sat on the seat and watched my kids play in the wood. The trees on the north side arch over the waterline to catch the sunlight, creating a canopy which dips into the loch. The serene tranquillity and beauty of the place is no doubt what Harry intended.But that in a sense is part of the magic of this place. As the pioneer Nelson Henderson once said to his son: ldquoThe true meaning of le is to plant trees under whose shade you do not expect to sit.It was these words I was reflecting on as I watched my children play. Harry was of course wealthy but we can all plant trees, either real ones or metaphorical ones, as a legacy for others.The recent death of a fellow storyteller and all-round wonderful woman, Ros Parkyn, was also on my mind. I had spoken about this place to her and of my intention to visit it. She loved nature too and would have gladly come along with me. But I sadly left it too late.Ros encapsulated all that was good and compassionate about humanity and she also planted many trees, some in the ground for she was a nature lover, but even more were planted in the hearts of those who knew her. They all now will grown as part of her wonderful legacy.As we left the wood, butterflies and blue dragonflies accompanied me, along with thoughts of my friend Ros and a man I didnrsquot know but whose trees shaded us.I willin autumn to see the colours and pay quiet homage to those who leave this world having made a positive dference."},{"url":null,"title":"new-primary-school-at-letham-mains-starting-to-take-shape","story":"Work began on Letham Mains Primary School, on Haddingtonrsquos western edge, earlier this year.The

Tranentrsquos eastern edge, despite the land being earmarked solely for economic development.Developers insisted that the only way to bring businesses onto the site was by generating funds from the sale of the new homes.They argued that making the site suitable for development would cost pound.million and it was not viable without housing.However, East Lothian Council rejected their plans at a meeting in August when officers insisted the site should be retained for employment use.Councillor John McMillan, economic spokesperson, referenced the Kevin Costner movie Field of Dreams when he told colleagues: ldquoIf we build it, they will come.Developers appealed to the Scottish Government to overturn their decision, insisting the local authority had failed to acknowledge the evidence they had provided which, they said, demonstrated the need for enabling residential development on the land.However, the Scottish Government Reporter appointed to investigate the appeal has now rejected their argument, siding with the council.He said that the Local Development Plan for East Lothian had set aside the land at Kingslaw for economic development and it should be retained as such.And he pointed out that the housing proposed by Barratt,which was described as lsquowindfallrsquo housing ndash which refers to a site which becomes available unexpectedly ndash would ldquosimply supplement an already generous housing land supply.Despite rejecting the appeal, the reporter said that he accepted the views of the developers and the District Valuer that the site was not financially viable as employment land in the current market conditions.He said: ldquoWhile I cannot be certain that there is no prospect of a business or industrial use being realised on the whole site, the information for this appeal indicates that, in the current economic conditions, it would be unlikely.However, he questioned whether the plans to build  houses and provide the local authority with . hectares of ldquoserviced land to build business units on it were possible, with no evidence the units would be created or could operate next to the new residential development.The reporter said: ldquoI find that the housing proposed would not directly enable commercial development to take place.ldquoAlthough not likely to be currently viable, the site would be removed as a strategic long-term employment option.East Lothian Council welcomed the ruling which is the first housing appeal to have been ruled in their favour since their new Local Development Plan was adopted.Councillor Norman Hampshire, planning convenor, said: ldquoWe welcome the outcome of this appeal both in the context of the Scottish Government Reporter upholding a decision that was carefully considered by East Lothianrsquos

Trees emit chemicals too, and darken the land, thus absorbing heat. But letrsquos not quibble. The Committee on Climate Changewhich inspired last weekrsquos landmark target, is in no doubt that mass reforestation ndash and wersquore talking billions of trees ndash will be one of the major methods of scrubbing CO from the atmosphere.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeScotland is well placed to deliver on this at least. Those barren hills and glens used to be under a dense covering of foliage. The forests were cleared for agriculture and charcoal in the south, and latterly for sheep and deer in the north. So mass forestation is only restoring the ecological default in Scotland.Nice to know, too, that Scotland, on paper at least, is leading the way on meeting climate change targets, having reduced emissions by a creditable % since . This is better than the UK as a whole, which is itself a world-leader in climate control. Scotlandrsquos abundant renewable energy is going to play a major role in transforming the UK economy.Transport is one of the main areas yet to be decarbonised, and every watt of that green energy is needed to make the switch from petrol and diesel in the next decade. Itrsquos long overdue. The internal combustion engine is th-century technology, horribly complex, unreliable and inefficient. Future generations will be astonished that we allowed our city streets to remain sewers of toxic chemicals.Mind you, the Scottish Government needs to put its foot on the environmental accelerator pedal. It is three years since I wrote a series of articles on electric cars after being allowed to drive some of them around Scotland. There were precious few charging points back then, and therersquos scarcely any more now. Yet, the electrication of transport should be a relatively simple exercise.Every petrol station should be a charging station, every supermarket car park, every school and hospital. Wherever cars congregate, in fact. The good news is that no-one who tries a modern electric car will want to drive anything , because they are faster, cheaper, safer and more reliable.Of course, manufacturing any car uses prodigious amounts of energy too, requires many costly materials and produces toxic waste. Electric cars arenrsquot a solution to climate change, but electrication of transport must be, especially micro-transportation. Every city in Europe seem to be turning to those electric scooters ndash except in the UK where they are illegal. Half of the bicycles sold in Germany now are electric. People are turning naturally to more energy-efficient transport so why not give them a push :Climate clock is ticking and now is time for politicians to fightThe CCC report was rather benign on flying. Yoursquoll be pleased to know that itrsquos not being phased out. This is probably because reducing aviation requires international agreement. However, cuts in air passenger duty seem dficult to justy. The Scottish Government wants APD cut by % to attract more business and tourists to Scotland. But Nicola Sturgeon is going to have to bite the environmental bullet here. The optics are wrong. It looks too much like a middle-class subsidy, even though many working-class people swear by Ryanair.Then therersquos the nuclear conundrum. Scotlandrsquos nuclear power stations account for % of electricity generation ndash a large proportion of our nominally clean energy. But they are old and unreliable and in need of replacement. However, nuclear power stations are regardedas a safety issue following Fukushima. They are also ruinously expensive and damage the environment by producing toxic waste which needs to be stored for thousands of years.The nuclear industry leapt upon last weekrsquos CCC report as a vindication of nuclear as part of the de-carbon equation. Big money is going into painting the atom green. But the prospect of the Scottish Government commissioning a new nuclear plant, given the explosive cost of Hinkley Point C, Englandrsquos first new nuclear power station in decades, seem remote. Renewable energy is much cheaper, joule for joule,it can be brought to grid fast enough. We are in a race against time to seeTorness and Hunterston can be made redundant before they fall apart.There are other issues too. Homes need to be insulated, gas boilers are going to have to go. Wersquore told to keep our home thermostats at  degrees, when most of us donrsquot have them. Itrsquos all expected to cost -% of GDP. But what was remarkable about last weekrsquos much-anticipated report was how doable it all appeared. By comparison with the apocalyptic forecasts of the climate Cassandras, like -year-old school striker Greta Thunberg, the CCC sounded like a walk in the environmental park. Nicola Sturgeon insists that cutting carbon will improve our health and wellbeing and the quality of le. Wersquoll all be happier, cleaner and probably working less in our new habitable planet.I hope shersquos right. There was an air of wishful thinking about last weekrsquos pronouncements. But therersquos nothing wrong with accentuating the positive. The problem with the more alarmist forecasts of Extinction Rebellion, who want net zero by , is that they induce not willingness to change, but a sense of futility and public apathy. If addressing climate change is going to involve banning travel, eating no meat, digging for vegan victory and plunging the economy into a biblical recession, as we close down whole sectors of industry, then people will not buy into it. The Yellow Vest movement was ignited by an environmental tax.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeIt may well be that the climate change targets are still too conservative. According to the UNrsquos International Panel on Climate Change, CO emissions need to be cut faster to prevent the planet warming by more than .C ndash the new tipping point. But the Scottish and UK governments have consistently outperformed their targets since they started making them seriously over a decade ago. They can do so again.Much of climate hygiene is self-evident. The public are morally signed up to it, and while abandoning their petrol and diesel cars may seem a grim prospect now, in practice it is likely to be a liberation. Most cars spend their lives sitting near a pavement losing value through depreciation. With proper public transport and urban alternatives, everyone wins.Vested interests are always a block on progress, but there is now a remarkable consensus, from the CBI to the GMB, BP to the NFU, the BMA to BMW. Addressing climate change need not take us back to a pre-industrial world of squalor, disease and hardship.

This could take the form of increased headage payments under the existing beef calf support scheme.The SBA, along with NFU Scotland and other industry stakeholders, have been pressing Mr Ewing on the issue and SBA chairman, Neil McCorkindale, was hoping for an announcement by the Cabinet Secretary at the event.This didn’t materialise but Mr Ewing indicated he was sympathetic to the plea and accepted the argument that headage payments would be a more effective approach than area based support which would simply encourage inertia in the industry.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Owners Jonny and Ali Aspden\"  Popular Ellon coffee shop extends opening hoursviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Aby Wilson, Stuart Wood, Elaine Lownds, George Laing, and Director Nicola Alexander of Bethan Customs Consultancy\"  Oldmeldrum start-up doubles team viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"explorer scouts raise over 1k at fun dog show event","story":"The Daviot and Oldmeldrum Explorer Scouts kicked off fundraising for their second trip to volunteer at a school in Uganda at the weekend.The group held their annual Fun Dog Show in Oldmeldrum on Sunday, June .The event raised around £,.At the Fun Dog Show there was a choice of ten classes and over  dogs took part.The DOM Explorer Scouts ran a tea and cake tent whilst a number of local pet-related businesses had stalls.The Scratch Club from Inverurie ran Flyball demonstations and also let people try with their own dogs.The DOM Explorer Scouts were supported by a number of local businesses who sponsored the event.They hope to hold the next Fun Dog Show on Sunday, June  .In July  the DOM Explorer Scouts visited Ruhanga in SW Uganda to help finish building a School  Scout Hall that they had funded.

While this trend is apparent across many ­sectors, one industry that we’ve had first-hand experience of is music. In , the music event sector was worth a whopping £. billion to the UK economy and with the new wave of experience-led events, that figure is set to increase. Music psychology researchers have found that the desire to escape reality in a setting that offers novelty is a key driver for attending a music event. The rising popularity of immersive one-day festivals and the ‘day gig’ is testament to this demand, providing people with the ultimate escape and the chance to party all day long, ­usually from noon to pm. Unlike the daylight raves that took place in fields and warehouses in the s and s, today’s official events benefit from safe spaces, first-rate sound systems and excellent amenities such as those offered by the Royal Highland Centre .The growth of day gigs can be ­evidenced by some of the events held at the RHC such as Terminal V and elrow whichyear after year and attract more than , attendees each. Freddie Norris, UK bookings and karketing manager at club party organisers elrow said: “Promoters like Terminal V and Fly are really pushing the boundaries bringing world class talent to the city. “We made our Edinburgh debut with elrow in  at Hallowe’en, bringing a massive Haunted House at the RHC. The audience response was really positive, and we made a connection both with the crowd and the city which is really important because Edinburgh’s RHC is an ideal location for music events.”Events such as these are bolstering the reputation of Edinburgh as a city that welcomes the day gig. The quality of the event organiser and the suitability of host space is ­crucial to getting the backing from City of Edinburgh Council, that ­ultimately determines whether an event can go ahead.Clearly what’s important is that events of this scale can demonstrate robust health and safety processes and an infrastructure that can cope with such numbers.It’s never been more prevalent to have high security standards for large scale events. The future of events in the city relies on event organisers and venues putting in these procedures to minimise risk to event-goers. At the RHC we work closely with health, safety and ­security ­agencies, including Police Scotland, to plan, manage and reduce incidents. The continuing investment in the RHC as Scotland’s leading events ­venue is ushering in a new age of music events with a capacity of more than , in the main hall, ­combined with  acres of outdoor space and parking space for , vehicles. Freddie added: “We are very excited to be ing to the RHC with our debut festival elrowTown in Scotland. There is so much space for activities at the RHC, and this is a key part of the elrow festival experience, plus it gives us scope to grow the event in the future.”According to EventBrite,  per cent of music festival-goers tweet or post to social media during a live concert. This trend for real-time updates and sharing of experiences has resulted in consumer demand for high-speed WiFi access to be bigger than before. That’s why at RHC we have invested in our infrastructure over the last few years to ensure we can meet this demand at the events we host. Showcasing the need for strong transport links, a survey conducted by EventBrite found that  per cent of millennialswould travel for a concert or festival, and  per cent would stay an extra night after that music event in the area. Boasting direct links to the city centre by tram and a prime location next to the airport and motorway, the RHC is also located nearby to overnight accommodation. Venues like the RHC are leading the charge and helping to put Edinburgh on the map when it comes to music events of all shapes and sizes, thus bringing an influx of vital economic benefits to the city.Lorne Scott, commercial director RHASS.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"div","story":"A DIVE vessel with  women on board was escorted into port after she began taking in water off Shetland on Sunday. issued a mayday call in bad weather soon after midday when she was approximately eight miles east of Sumburgh Head.

OK, yes it isspeeding.Surely the issue is appropriate speed # like doing  mph when there are pedestrians or next to schools, built up areas, where there is a limit etc Kat is so right to complain about dangerous driving.It has become an unwanted fad amongst young menwho must be so stupid and so bored that they are prepared to risk le and limbto get their kicks. My belief is that the pointless and brainless cavortings of silly,silly moronic types on programmes like Top Gear are partly to blame.In addition , street racing in cities like London take place late at night driving people to distraction.Police keep an eye on proceedings but it still goes on. Not easy for police cars to safely keep up with idiots in illegally souped up cars travelling , as reported, at  mph.I understand people that have the need for speed. But keep in mind, just because you think you#re a confident driver, that you are safe because you can drive. Doesn#t mean you#re safe. Just recently there was a news report about a drunk driver going off the road and hitting another car. If you#re going at a high speed and that thing comes at you, what can you do  Swerve  There#s a good chance you#re dead, in hospital or best case scenario, your car is totalled.Just because you think you#re a competent driver, doesn#t mean everyone  is. Drive safe.Of course, accidents do happen even to competent,confident, safe drivers but there are people who cast aside such standards in favour of dangerous, unlawful behaviour.These are the ones who need to be severely apprehended.Try to be less pedantic when reading comments.Johan, youseemto have missed the point of Kat’s letter.Nobody has said that overtaking is illegal or wrong but It was estimated that the Audi was travelling at around  to  mph. An offence.In addition , about six or more cars were overtaken in one fell swoop.Not advisable by any stretch of the imagination. Suppose there had been a need to suddenly pull in due to an unforeseen hazard.Something would have had to give , possibly causingan accident.My father used to say to me when I was learning to drive “ always drive asother drivers are stupid”.In short, drive defensively NOT offensively.It seems to me that the Audi driver falls into the stupid category.Better to be ten minutes late in this world than fty years too early in the next.Have you seen this stretch of road  It is the only place in Shetland where there is a lane for overtaking # that is two lanes going up a hill.Very often you are overtaking quite a few things even at  mph going up because of slow things and other cars not overtaking.Unless she actually had a speed gun she cannot judge the speed of things. I regularly see traffic pouring down Herrislea hill and I know that although it looks fast, some of them are actually sticking to the  mph limit.I maintain that it’s better to be safe than sorry.Ease off and keep the undertaker waiting !! Or,you feel so inclined, speed up and become a statistic.Your choice.You need a fair few horses to go up some of our hills at  mph.

Even England has some pretty steep examples in the Lake District.The sharpest inclines I’ve experienced in Shetlandare on Foula.I doubt that quad bikes would be much use on the hills though I have seenthem being driven on the low level road.What does horses have to do with speedsterIm not defending speeding. Im saying this is the safest bit of road we have for overtaking and saying that youcannot possibly know the speed of the other cars without measuring equipment.Engine power is expressed in horsepower and lots of horsepower enables some to be faster than others going up hills than others.Haydn I have driven small cars which feel like they need a push going up our hills, that is all..."},{"url":null,"title":"general manager at streamline ","story":"We have an exciting opportunity for a self-motivated and results-driven General Manager to join our Operations team at our Lerwick Depot.

As a result of its strategic importance both sides concentrated some of their best armoured regiments and equipment in this area. The Guards Armoured Brigade comprised of three tank battalions and had been set up and trained in England. The three battalions were the nd Battalion of the Grenadier Guards, the st Battalion of the Coldstream Guards and the nd Battalion of the Irish Guards. The Irish Guards were recruited from Northern Ireland and the nd Battalion contained men from the Province. You can see it in the tank commanders names. We have Agnew, Brennan, Carson, Connolly, Healy, Harbinson, Mahoney, McCorkell, McGuire, McHugh and Robinson amongst others.The nd Battalion Irish Guards was equipped with American Sherman tanks. These were  ton Medium tanks and mainly equipped with a  mm gun, a useful weapon against infantry but not entirely satisfactory against tanks. The battalion was organised into sub units. There were three squadrons in the battalion, each composed of four troops and each troop had four tanks. The Irish Guards named their tanks after towns and the nd Squadron named theirs with B’s. So we have Ballina, Bangor, Bantry, Belfast, Benbane and Ballynahinch. We also have Ballyraggett and BallymenaBallymena was a special Sherman tank. Ballymena did not have the standard  mm gun. The inconvenient truth for the Allied tank crews was that their tanks were not as good as the best of German ones. A German Tiger tank, for example could destroy a Sherman tank at a distance of over a mile. A Sherman on the other hand would be lucky to harm a Tiger at  yards.  The Britsh crews themselves had already concluded that a Sherman tank was not considered as safe a location as many would have been believed. Hence they covered the front with extra metal tracks and the propensity of the Sherman to do a “Ronson”, that is light up, encouraged the crew to get out very quickly.To deal with the stronger German tanks the Allies devised a way of mounting a bigger gun on some of the Shermans. This new gun was so big it meant redesigning the tank and reducing the size of the crew. These Shermans, now armed with a  pounder gun, which referred to the weight of the shell it fired, were nicknamed FireflyThe Irish Guards arrived in Normandy  days after the initial D Day landings. Caen had still not been completely captured so the Irish Guards eere given a mission to help bypass the city of Caen by gaining ground to the east of the city and drive towards the village of Cagny. This was Operation Goodwood, named after the racecourse in England.Undercover of darkness on the night of th July, Ballymena and the other tanks moved over the River Orne on newly constructed bridges and prepared for battle.The smoke, noise and movement of the battlefield created chaos. Units became mixed up and both sides sometimes got lost. This led to one of the most famous incidents of the battle. By the middle of the afternoon of July th the Irish Guard’s assault is under fire, stalled and mud bound outside the village of Cagny. Lt John Gorman of B Squadron th troop commanding a mm armed Sherman called “Ballyraggett” gets slightly ahead of his comrades and spots a German King Tiger at about yrs. Knowing his gun could do little damage to the King Tiger, Lt Gorman chose a dramatic course of action. He had previously briefed his crew Gunner Albert Scholes, Driver James BaronRadio operator Agnew, and told themhe got the chance they would adopt “Navy tactics”. He instructed Baron to drive at full speed ahead and prepare to ram the German tank. Firing a high explosive shell at close range stunned the inexperienced German crew but had little impact on the tank. However, the high speed collision effectively immobilized both tanks. The Sherman and the King Tiger were abandoned and their crews hid in the fields.Lt Gorman realising the King Tiger was still a viable threat ran towards the nearest Sherman Firefly, in the knowledge only a  pounder gun on the Firefly could do any meaningful damage. This was Ballymena. Some of Ballymena’s crew were already either dead or injured but Gorman jumped in and directed fire on the abandoned King Tiger.  The fighting continued for a while but eventually Gorman was able to rescue his own and other crews and get back to safety.For his exploits Gorman - later Sir John - was awarded the Military Cross. Editor’s note: Sir John, who died aged  in May , was a Northern Irish Roman Catholic Unionist with an unflinching sense of service.After the war he joined the Royal Ulster Constabulary before becoming a senior manager with British Overseas Airways Corporation, then head of the Northern Ireland Housing Executive. Finally he was elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly as the sole Roman Catholic member of the Ulster Unionist Party, and served as Deputy Speaker until the Assemblys suspension in . He was a frequent visitor to Ballymena during his time with the NIHE and he never failed tomention that he had married a Ballymena woman, Norah Caruth.

At the time it was taken in the iconic Flamingo Ballroom, they were members of local rock’n’blues band, Tailor.The band was formed in the early s by Tucker McIlwee and John Tennant.“Other band members who played with Tailor over the years were Ronnie McAuley, Hubert Dunlop and Ricky Maybin, Henry McQuillan, Dave Moore Trevor Erwin andGerry McNeely. We were transported to and from the gigs by Brian Surgenor, ” says John.“Our first gig was at a place called Betty Staffs in Belfast but we travelled throughout Ireland playing most of the towns on the circuit.“Amazingly, we had never played in Ballymena until Sammy Barr of the Flamingo approached our manager to offer a booking.”It transpired that Tailor were playing on the same bill as Rory Gallagher. As you would expect, the group were excited but, in their own words, ‘not overwhelmed.’John remembers: “We met with Rory and his band during set up,. Rory was a very down to earth guy.

His albums have sold over  million copies worldwide.Gallagher received a liver transplant in , but died of complications later that year in London at the age of .He began playing after school with Irish showbands, while still in his early teens. Having completed a musical apprenticeship and influenced by the increasing popularity of beat groups during the early s, Gallagher formed The Taste, which was later renamed simply, Taste, a blues rock and RB power trio, in .Performing extensively in the UK, the group played regularly at the Marquee Club, supporting both Cream at their Royal Albert Hall farewell concert, and the blues supergroup Blind Faith on a tour of North America.After the break-up of Taste, Gallagher toured under his own name. The s were Gallaghers most prolic period. He produced ten albums in that decade, including two live albums, Live in Europe and Irish Tour . November  saw the release of the album Deuce. In the same year he was voted Melody Makers International Top Guitarist of the Year, ahead of Eric Clapton. Though he sold over thirty million albums worldwide, it was his marathon live performances that won him greatest acclaim. He is documented in Irish Tour , a film directed by Tony Palmer.During the heightened periods of political unrest in Northern Ireland, as other artists were warned not to tour, Gallagher was resolute about touring Ireland at least once a year during his career, winning him the dedication of thousands of fans, and in the process, becoming a role model for other aspiring young Irish musicians.

However, underlying issues of majority and binary decision-making processes, and the resulting exclusion of certain voices, are ones that have dogged the institutions since the formation of the Northern state. It is this same system of binary voting that has further polarised opinions and furthered tension in the wake of the Brexit vote. Therefore, it is in this broad context that democratic processes advocated by the North Belfast-based de Borda Institute become all the more interesting.Headed up by Ballysillan man Peter Emerson, The de Borda Institute aims to promote the use of inclusive voting procedures on issues of social choice. These procedures are multi-choice and make use of points based voting system popularised by French mathematician Jean-Charles de Borda.Peter began his own professional career in the British Navy, but soon became disillusioned with the role of British Empire, instead viewing colonialism as “part of the problem” in other nations.His ergent path following his naval resignation saw him move to Rwanda, where he worked as a teacher in the s. It was during that time that he began questioning the majority voting systems implemented by Europeans worldwide. When he came to the North of Ireland in , he realised how similar processes had hindered political progress. “Traditional African decision-making is so much better than majority voting,” he explained.“When you look back and realise that Europeans went to Rwanda and applied majority rule. How crazy can you get “I started to question majority rule in Africa. Then I came here in  and realised that it was part of the problem here. My dad was Irish, from Cork, but he was a member of the minority because he was a Protestant. My mum was English, but she was a member of the minority because she was Catholic, so I’m a political b*****d.“We have this stupid thing here where we’re asked whether we’re British or Irish, which I was asked a lot when I arrived here. They have the same in Rwanda – are you Hutu or Tutsi  It’s a closed question. You’re caught because you could be neither, or both, so you can’t answer a question like that.“I realised very early on that the question was part of the Northern Ireland problem. In  there was the Anglo-Irish Agreement and you had Paisley standing outside City Hall protesting. One week later, six of us stood outside the same venue with a banner saying ‘we have got to say yes to something’.“Six months later we brought a number of parties together at a conference to discuss a range of issues. You put down in order of preference what you like and you can see which option has the widest support. We did this in May . We had Sinn Féin, Official Unionists, UDA, Ulster Clubs – you name it – and we had this fantastic meeting. People could suggest anything they like and as long as it didn’t infringe the UN Charter on Human Rights it was allowed.“We finished with  options on the ballot paper and the people came to conclusion that Northern Ireland should have devolution and power sharing within a joint Dublin, London and Belfast tripartite agreement. It was like a mini Good Friday Agreement, but just  years ahead of its time.”The methods – known as the ‘Borda Count’ – employed by The de Borda Institute, are used to determine the highest average vote amongst a number of options, resulting in what should be a more democratic outcome. While western countries pride themselves on being ‘democratic’, Peter said that their use of majority voting calls that self-ascribed description into question.“In Western Europe we often discuss electoral systems, but when it comes to decision-making it has to be a majority vote,” he said.“Sometimes you see complaints about North Korea, and their elections where they have do you want candidate ‘x’, ‘yes’ or ‘no’  Then we go ahead and have Brexit, ‘yes’ or ‘no’ – it’s the same thing. The basic idea of just asking yes or no is too primitive and gives all the power to the person who sets the question. Majority voting has been used by Napoleon, Lenin, Mussolini, Hitler, Pinochet, Duvalier, Saddam Hussein, Gaddafi – you name it – dictators love it. David Cameron wrote the Brexit question. The Electoral Commission says it’s fair – it’s crazy. It’s like asking a vegetarianthey would like beef or lamb.”In the coming months Peter plans to publish a new book entitled ‘Majority Voting as a Catalyst of Populism’, which tells of his overland journey from Belfast to Beijing and back. The book offers an assessment of a number of regions that he visitied that have suffered from majoritarianism, including post-conflict areas such as the Balkans and the North of Ireland. Asked about our own political impasse, Peter said: “Politicians don’t like the idea of giving people a choice. The politician who wants ‘x’ is happy to have it on the ballot paper, and maybe ‘y’, but not ‘z’. If you are a proper democrat and you want the will of the people then you give them the choice to decide. Then whatever they decide you, the Executive, execute. If you totally disagree then you resign.“We go to the polling stations and elect an assembly. If somebody abstains then that’s fine. Those who do want to get on with it can. If the DUP and Sinn Féin don’t want to be there then that’s a pity, but to give them the monopoly or veto is a crazy way of doing things. Part of the trouble is that the Belfast Agreement was designed by people who were part of the problem in the first place. It is a very majoritarian document. They devised this system that gives them control.”He added: “This idea that because one group is bigger or more numerous that they can tell the other where to go is totally primitive.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Bubbles.png","title":"siomha wows buble","story":"A -year-old Coláiste Feirste pupil wowed Canadiansinging superstar Michael Bublé with her vocal talent at his sell-out concert inthe city on Monday night.

This is the case up until he witnesses the hatred and bigotry directed towards Irish supporters of the now infamous and most politically -charged match between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland during the  World Cup qualier at Windsor Park.The toxic atmosphere which rained down from the stands was captured in Marie’s prose the match comingjust days after the Shankill bombing and the Greysteel murders.The Fall and Come Home actor Matthew Forsythe fought off  submissions,  self-tapes and “ people in the room which was then whittled down to ,” for the “dream role” of playing Kenneth.“I read it around  and it was and is one of those theatre pieces that I instantly felt a connection with. I saw a lot of me in the part especially growing up in the s and s.”The play on its first initial run was a showcase for actor Dan Gordon who portrayed Kenneth, and later Marty Maguire who toured the production around the States. Matthew explained how when he was trying to get into drama school across the water he contacted Dan for advice and support.“I was holding a charity event to try and raise a bit of money, Dan couldn’t come but he sent me a postcard with a £ cheque in it and the postcard was of Dan in character as Kenneth. I still have it,” he said.Matthew’s further connection to the piece was that he was in the Windsor stands that ‘night in November’having been taken to see the match with his school, Laurelhill High School in Lisburn.In August  Patrick Kielty took on the role of Kenneth, directed by acclaimed actor Ian McElhinney during a run at the Opera House. Fast-forward  years and its Ian and Marie’s son Matthew now in the director’s chair.“The play debuted during a very sensitive, political time,” explained Matthew McElhinney, “the reaction was very funny, very moving and very engaging. There was some controversy over the content, it was seen as being not painting the side of the community my mother came from in the best light, essentially it was a critique of her own community, her own people. Mum was writing about what she saw at the time. Such was its reaction the Lyric had to put on extra security.”Asked about the signicance of the play  years on Matthew spoke of how the play “paints the two sides of football”.“I remember there was talk of bringing the play back to the stage during the Euro’s but mum said it wasn’t the right time.  years is a big anniversary and I kept thinking ‘how am I going to stage this ’ To frame it within the context of that was then, this is now. There has been astounding progress from the ‘Billy Boys’ to being awarded the Grand Vermeil in  during the Euros, for the Northern Ireland fans along with the Republic. It’s a chance to say look at what we have achieved, and the tagline of the play is ‘is it possible to change ’“The play has ups, downs, laughs and emotion. It’s been  years and we are about to have a whole new generation come to see it.”A Night in November runs at the Lyric Theatre from June -.

He now says he favours a renegotiation of the agreement and wants the backstop to be surrounded by an unambiguous \"exit mechanism\". Has also said that a rebooted Executive Assembly would help to resolve matters and indicated that he would even lead the talks process. Described Karen Bradley as a \"brilliant\" Secretary of State.Success Rating:  Matt HancockA slightly woollier version of Goves position. He wants a time limit on the backstop, although doesnt indicate how long short the limit would be. He has also suggested that a new political negotiations body of some sort - involving Northern Irelands parties - could be established to create North South consensus on a way forward.Success Rating:  Read MoreWho are the contenders in the Tory leadership race Boris Johnson is ‘yesterday’s news’, says Tory rival Sajid JavidMark HarperA former chief whip with a reasonably good nose for what the parliamentary party might gather around, he supported the Malthouse Compromise. This emerged in January and involves the backstop being redrafted as a \"free trade agreement-lite\" with a commitment on all sides there should be no hard border on the island of Ireland. Would want to breathe new le into it. The DUP supports the compromise.Success Rating:  Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.Sign InNew to Belfasttelegraph  window.gigyaIntegration  window.gigyaIntegration  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand.push gigyaIntegrationLoginScreenSet gigyaIntegrationRegisterScreenSetJeremy HuntAlong with Johnson and Gove, considered one of the three most likely to win . He is of the view that the European Unions negotiating team has accepted that the backstop, or something very similar to the backstop, will not get through Parliament. But he hasnt set out an alternative to the backstop. Hard to knowhe hasnt actually got an alternative at this point, orhe is just keeping his powder dry until he gets to the final two.Success Rating:  Sajid Javid\"I will focus on the one Brexit deal that has already got through Parliament - that was the withdrawal agreement - with a change to the backstop. What I would do is make a grand gesture to Ireland that we would cover all their costs - the upfront costs, the running costs - of a new digitised border. I think it could be done in a couple of years.\" There is no evidence that he has even had below-the-radar discussions with either Ireland or the EU about his proposals.Success Rating:  Boris JohnsonNobody knows what Johnson will do. He excoriated the withdrawal agreement and the backstop at the DUPs conference last November and then voted for it a few weeks later. Has yet to explain how he will replace the backstop, let alone discuss avoiding the potential damage to UK Irish and North South relationshipshe fails to renegotiate the present agreement and the UK exits without a deal.Success Rating:  Andrea LeadsomHer parliamentary reputation has grown over the last two years, particularly while she was Leader of the House. More flexible than she is often given credit for, she speaks of a \"managed exit\" as opposed to a full-scale renegotiation and believes the backstop problem could be resolved with a \"sensible\" trade deal and \"technological oversight\" re the border.Success Rating:  Esther McVeyProbably the most hardline Brexiteer candidate and the one most likely to prioritise a no-deal over a renegotiation. Thats because she doesnt think the EU will reopen full-scale negotiations. The DUP wouldnt admit it, but itd rather she didnt win. The party talks tough on a no-deal outcome, but is well aware of the huge damage a no-deal could do to political institutional dynamics in Northern Ireland. Luckily for it, she has no chance.Success Rating:  Dominic RaabThe former Cabinet minister with \"responsibility for exiting the EU\" lasted only four months in the job: and didnt distinguish himself by his admission that he hadnt quite understood the full extent of how much UK trade relies on the Dover-Calais route. He also supported the Malthouse Compromise.Success Rating:  Rory StewartThe only genuine wildcard in the leadership race. His brutal, quirky honesty allows him to say things like \"stop pretending the EU will be willing to renegotiate the current backstop arrangement\". Would probably try and push the withdrawal agreement through after a new round of talks with the other parties. Would not be comfortable with a renewed parliamentary arrangement with the DUP.Success Rating:  "},{"url":null,"title":"crossborder park project given 7 9m","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

However, he dropped his religious studies in favour of a career in journalism.However, prior to this he had gained a doctorate from Edinburgh University for his contribution to charting the history of the church. It was during this particular course of study that he submitted some articles to the Belfast News Letter that led to an invitation to become a member of its staff.He accepted this position and by  he was the paper’s editor.In , after a political dispute with the News Letter’s owner he resigned and briefly became editor of the Londonderry Standard.Then, between - McKnight was appointed editor of the Banner of Ulster and it was in this period, as a result of the tenant grievances that he witnessed, he became fearful that another rebellion in the mould of the  United Irishmen would erupt.When he ed as editor of the Londonderry Standard he further developed the campaign for tenant rights. Also upon histo the Standard he married the owner of the paper’s sister-Miss Catherine McPherson of Balloughry.At this time the majority of small farmers in Ulster relied on weaving to bolster their income as well as working the land.The coming campaign of agitation was a daunting one and its success depended upon defeating Tory landlords who held all the Parliamentary representation in the country.In effect, farmers were serfs who were obliged to pay rents regulated solely by landowners who also firmly held the reins of political power. As a result, tenant farmers lived in almost perpetual fear of increased tarfs and evictionthey failed to pay them.As Repeal of the Union agitation gathered strength in the south of Ireland, James McKnight simultaneously championed the cause of Presbyterian farmers in the north. The fight centred on the three F’s-fixity of tenure, fair rents and free sale.An example of Dr James McKnight’s famed oratory was captured in a speech he delivered whilst on the tenant rights campaign trail in Newtonards in this era.“I have no language sufficiently strong to convey my contempt for policies which, under the hypocrisy of religion, degrade Christianity to an engine of State intrigue,” he said.The journalist’s abilities seemed to be sufficiently feared by the English political hierarchy to the extent that after he had led a deputation to meet Prime Minister Robert Peel on the issues at hand, he was offered a Parliamentary seat in County Wexford in an obvious attempt to bring him ‘from the cold.’ James McKnight declined the offer.The Tenant Right League was established in August of  and was formed chiefly by Charles Gavan Duffy and Frederick Lucas.The movement was remarkable in that for a time it united Protestant and Catholic tenants. In fact, Duffy named his movement The League of North and South.The political battle was framed against the backdrop of the Encumbered Estates Act of . Essentially, this legislation enabled the sale after the Great Famine, of Irish estates whose owners could not meet their financial obligations.In the north of Ireland, Anglican and Presbyterian ministers feared these new landlords would destroy the established Ulster custom of compensating tenants who made improvements to the land.At the same time in the south, politically conscious Catholic priests wanted to adopt the compensation custom in the north as a measure of reform in their part of the island.The League was a conglomeration of the Tenant Protection Societies and the Ulster Tenant Rights Association led by William Sharman Crawford. Unity between the organisations was unfortunately short lived because of objections to the involvement of Catholic clergy in the south.Larger tenant farmers were primarily interested in securing Fixity of Tenure while the smaller farmers prioritised fair rents. To strengthen the campaign the leaders of the League sought the support of Irish MPs to oppose any government that would not back the ‘Ulster Custom.’In this respect, the Tenant Rights League achieved success through the efforts of its national organiser John Martin. It garnered the support of the surviving Repealers of the Union in the House of Commons as well as a number of radical English radical MPs.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshAnd, all of these supportive elements agreed that a Land Act incorporating the three F’s would be the overall objective of the political campaign.Then, at the  General Election some fty Tenant Rights candidates including Gavan Duffy, Frederick Lucas and John Sadlier all won seats at Westminster where they sat as the Independent Irish Party.The League’s success however proved short lived when it was first weakened and then ultimately destroyed by the resurfacing of old sectarian isions.Firstly, a number of prominent members broke away and formed the Catholic Defence Association-referred to as the ‘Pope’s Brass band’ by some in the organisation. Supporters of the League were also subjected to a campaign of intimidation by the landlords.However, the most serious blow came when Frederick Lucas came into conflict with the Archbishop of Dublin, Dr Paul Cullen. The high-ranking cleric had forbidden his priests from involvement in political issues causing Lucas took his complaint about Dr Cullen to Rome. This succeeded only in alienating the Catholic church in Ireland from the fight.Then, Frederick Lucas died in October  shortly after the failure of his plea to the Papacy. A month later, Gavan Duffy emigrated to Australia.The League finally fell apart in  with the Independent Irish Party following it into oblivion the following year.It was not however the end of the tenants rights campaign. The baton that had been dropped by the League and the Independent Irish Party was picked up again by Bishop Thomas Nulty of Meath. It was then spearheaded by the Land League in  and the three F’s became anchored in legislation under the Land LawAct in .In general, the cause of tenants rights was more successful in the south of Ireland. In the north, landlords were more firmly entrenched and the issue of the Repeal of the Union had caused many northern delegates in the League to walk away and fight the cause as unionists or Liberal Tenant Righters.However, almost  years before the Land LawAct enshrined the F’s in law, in the north Mr SM Greer had gained the County Derry seat against the power of landlordism.Thirteen years later in  when Gladstone introduced a Land Bill that embodied the principles of tenant rights, it was Dr James McKnight that the government of the day consulted. That same parliamentary term also saw the introduction of the Ballot Act which ended intimidation.This shows that the journalist had at the outset been for a period a lone voice advocating social reform in Ireland.Without doubt, Dr McKnight had been regarded as the leader and champion of the rights of the Presbyeterian farmers and for his efforts was presented with a testimonial and £ by them. He died on June ,  aged  at his house on East Wall in his adopted homeplace of Derry.A glimpse of the le of James McKnight and his we outside of the newspaper business and political campaigning came around  years after his passing when his former paper, the Derry Standard marked the death of his spouse Catherine on February , .The Standard said: “We greatly regret to record the death of Mrs McKnight, formerly of this city, which took place at College Square East, Belfast, on Monday after a somewhat protracted illness during which she was tenderly nursed by her sister, Miss Rebecca McPherson.“The deceased was the we of the former editor of this paper, James McKnight L.L.D and was well known in this city thirty years ago, when Dr McKnight’s house on the East Wall and subsequently at Warrenhill, was the rendezvous of a circle of congenial spirits, who often met to enjoy the refined society of Dr McKnight and his accomplished we.“Among the welcome guests were generally to be found the late Rev William McClure, Reverend Professor Wallace and Reverend Richard, afterwards Professor Smyth MP.“At an earlier period in their domestic history they had the honour of entertaining the late Thomas Carlyle, who met at their house all the leading Derry celebrities of the time and in the book which he afterwards published made some remarks on his fellow guests that were more plain than pleasant but he said all that was kind and complimentary of the host and his gentle helpmate and commended the quality of the doctors tobacco.“After the death of Dr McKnight, Mrs McKnight visited the principle cities on the Continent, and spent some time in Italy enjoying the beauty and art of that classic land, which she was so well able to appreciate.“Although highly cultivated, and possessing good literary abilities, she was not successful as a writer, and her only work, ‘The Friend of the Poor’, was not read beyond her personal circle of friends.“For some years past Mrs McKnight has lived in Belfast, and there she passed away on Monday morning last, after a lingering illness, which she bore with patient and cheerful resignation.“The interment will take place in the Cemtery at Derry today, the funeral leaving the terminus of the Northern Counties railway at ten o’clock.”Dr James and Mrs Catherine McKnight had no children.CAPTION: Dr James McKnight."},{"url":null,"title":"derry woman appointed managing director global strategy consultancy firm","story":"A Derry woman has been appointed to the role of Managing Director at a leading firm specialising in leadership strategy.Tessa Breslinassumed the role in recent weeks and will now head up YSC’s Americas Division spanning the United States, Brazil, Canada and Mexico.YSC Consulting uses their expertise in behavioural science to help organisations across the globe connect the dots between business strategy and leadership.

The Down defence was performing exceptionally well at this stage, but they had a nightmare finish to the first half.Despite defending in numbers, Down lost their shape and points from Josh Casey, Liam McGrath and Conor Sweeney sent Tipperary into the break with a - to - lead.Down now had the wind behind them in the second half and Havern reduced the arrears in the th minute with a point from play. This was quickly cancelled out with a free from McGrath before a Harrison point left two points between the sides.Havern and Sweeney exchanged scores before the mighty Quinn got involved.His influence on the game was immediate and an early point settled him into the pace of the game, his score leaving a point in it with  minutes remaining.Down fired a couple of wides before Burns produced his game-changing save. OrsquoHare seized the moment and he drilled the ball to the back of the net in the th minute after a bit of ping-pong in the Tipperary square.Down now had a - to - lead, but Liam Casey left the minimum in it yet again when he spilt the posts with a great score.Quinn and Quinlavin swapped scores before Quinn and Paul Devlin gave Down a - to - lead with only two minutes remaining.Conor Sweeney threw Tipperary a leline with a converted free, but with five additional minutes to be played, Down patiently held on to the ball and Barry OrsquoHagan completed the scoring when he restored his sidersquos three point lead in added time.Down: Rory Burns , Brendan McArdle, Darren OrsquoHagan , Gerard Collins, Ryan McAleenan, Kevin McKernan, Daniel Guinness, Johnny Flynn, Conor Poland, Conor Francis, Pat Havern , James Guinness, Jerome Johnston , Donal OrsquoHare , Connaire Harrison .

It is important we all work to strive for the very highest of standards across all our facilities..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Castlewellan bioblitz to locate identity of wildlife in forest park  ","story":"CASTLEWELLAN Forest Park is the venue for a special race against the clock this weekend.Scientists, naturalists and members of the public will be taking part in a lsquobioblitzrsquo to find identy as many species as a possible over a period of  hours.The countdown begins on Friday at pm with a bat talk and nocturnal walk with the Northern Ireland Bat Group.On Saturday morning local moth expert Andy Crory will set out to discover what moths have been caught overnight.

An email sent to staff claimed the issue of period poverty was a lsquosilentrsquo issue that needed to be dealt with in a lsquodiscreetrsquo way by staff.Mrs Trainor said it was ldquoentirely unacceptable that women and girls were made to feel that their ldquotime of the month was inconvenient or shameful. Indeed, she said women and men have shied away from talking about periods openly for far too long.She added: ldquoUnite believes that, by changing perceptions, we can tackle some of the wider issues around periods. We want access to sanitary products in the workplace and schools to be as normal as having access to things such as toilet roll. Management of Newry, Mourne and Down Council need to change course and treat their female workforce with dignity.A council spokeswoman said the organisation was carrying out the lsquoPink Presentrsquo pilot scheme as a response to the increasingly recognised issue of lsquoperiod povertyrsquo within the wider community.ldquoWe are facilitating donations so that products are available to anybody who needs them, she said.ldquoThis project is being carried out in partnership with the Southern Health Trust and Southern Regional College and is an initiative which has previously been run in other parts of Northern Ireland, the spokeswoman continued.ldquoThere is currently limited data and statistical evidence on what the local need is for a period poverty project and this is what this pilot is trying to establish. We are very happy with how the scheme has been supported to date and will evaluate the scheme after the pilot has ended.The spokeswoman said the local authority was ldquocommitted to working with all its partners to deal with any health inequalities that are prevalent within the district and would continue to explore ways of helping those people in most need..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Crossgar girl Lauren’s charity sky dive  ","story":"CROSSGAR girl Lauren Houston is celebrating her th birthday next month with a thrilling sky e to raise money for Barnardorsquos.The charity is close to the teenrsquos heart as she knows from first hand experience what a helping hand can mean to a young person in care.Lauren was adopted at the age of four after being in the foster care system.The  year-old has already raised pound but hopes to raise more than her pound, target.A GCSE student at Saintfield High School, Lauren is also taking part in this weekendrsquos Aughlisnafin GAC Mud Run, near Castlewellan.Then a week after she turns , she will be doing a tandem skye on July .ldquoAs soon as Irsquom , I plan to do a sky e on my own, Lauren told the Down Recorder.ldquoI had to wait until I turned  before being allowed to do it due to age restrictions.

I think there was a bit more hunger from the Down team, especially in turning balls over and tackling. They showed a greater desire to win the game.Slowly, but surely Downrsquos players are starting to buy into Tallyrsquos revolution.Goalkeeper Rory Burns is a natural between the posts. He exudes confidence with his handling and his kick-outs are rarely wasted.The full back line of Darren OrsquoHagan, who negated the threat of former All Star Michael Quinlivan, the recalled Benny McArdle and Downpatrickrsquos Gerard Collins were immense.Kevin McKernan, Daniel Guinness and Ryan McAleenan threw a brick wall up in front of the back three and made scores extremely hard to come by for Tipperary.A fit again Jonny Flynn was a colossus in the middle of the park and more than held his own against the highly-rated Steven OrsquoBrien.Conor Polandrsquos physicality was much-needed in the engine room and Conor Francisrsquo non-stop running frustrated the le out of Tipperary.The Down forwards all kept going when forced to live off crumbs, but it was the introduction of Mayobridgersquos Cory Quinn that really caught the imagination.The  year-old forward has been the scourge of every defender on the county club scene since the start of the season and he is now starting to show that sort of form for Tally.The pocket rocket has pace, power and an eye for scores. Quinn has yet start to start a game for Down and throwing him in the deep end against a side like Mayo may not be fair on him, but Tally knows that he can spring him from the bench when required.The suspended Caolan Mooney will also be back for the Mayo game and he will relish the prospect of locking horns with Aiden OrsquoShea OrsquoShea, Keith Higgins, Matthew Ruane and Lee Keegan..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Environment campaigner Isabel receives recognition  ","story":"A LOCAL environmental campaigner who has received a British Empire Medal in the Queenrsquos Birthday Honours says the award is ldquototally unexpected.Isabel Hood, who has been recognised for her services to environmental conservation, is vice-chairwoman of the Strangford Lough and Lecale Partnership and a trustee of the Mourne Heritage Trust.A keen sailor, she is a past commodore of Quoile Yacht Club and current chairperson of Portaferry Leboat Station.

The former police base is now in the ownership of the Department of Communities which is working alongside the local council to help bring new investment to the town.Details of the project have already attracted reported interest from leading retailers, with Marks and Spencer and Home Bargains understood to be keen to invest in Downpatrick. The proposed investment initiative also kills off plans for a new road through the former police base linking Irish Street and St Patrickrsquos Avenue.Councillors were told this week that in addition to securing the necessary land in irish Street, officials also hope to make signicant progress on a development brief designed to encourage developers to come forward and redevelop the sprawling Irish Street site to provide a signicant economic boost for the town and existing traders through increased footfall.Securing world renowned UNESCO geopark status for an area taking in the Mournes, Ring of Gullion and the Strangford and Lecale Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty is also a priority for the local authority. The formal bud will be lodged this November.The focus on the so-called Two Oceans geopark status is primarily about environmental sustainability and trying to increase economic revenue in a part of the world already revered for its stunning beauty.For over one year the local authority has been engaging with local communities as it firms up its application bid and is working alongside the the Geological Survey of Northern Ireland.Geoparks are based around signicant areas of geology and are set up to support sustainable economic development of an area, primarily through geological and eco-tourism. But they are not just about geology and include sites that are of interest for their history, archaeology, bioersity, folklore, cultural and local heritage.Securing the prestigious designation for the local area is one of the key planks of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos tourism strategy, with councillors confident that it has the potential to deliver high quality tourism in the area, increasing the number of international visitors.The thorny issue of car parking charges across the district is another key issue for the local authority which aims to rationalise the bye-laws controlling them.A detailed survey ordered in the wake of the controversial decision to hike car parking charges across the district last year has been completed.Charges at a number of car parks in Downpatrick and Ballynahinch were increased by % in April last year, rising to  pence per hour and increasing the cost of a weekly parking ticket to almost pound.But there is anger in the business community in both towns that while parking charges in their respective locations have been increased, it remains free to park at local authority-owned car parks in Newcastle, Saintfield and Castlewellan.Planning has been a particularly vexatious issue for the local council since it was handed responsibility for it, with many councillors particularly happy with its current delivery.Under the draft development plan, the local authority aims, by the end of March next year, to process % of local planning applications with  weeks. A turnaround target of processing % of major application within  weeks has been set.Dealing with a backlog of enforcement issues has also been a problem for local planners with the council aiming to conclude % of enforcement cases within  weeks..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Karen is a golden girl  ","story":"A KILLYLEAGH grandmother has just ed home from the World Classic Powerlting Championships in Sweden with a haul of medals.The  year-old legal secretary won gold in the deadlt where she raised kg.

highly ambitious proposals aimed at shaping future tourist provision in the resort.The ious proposals are at the heart of the Mournes Gateway investment initiative which is one of a series of projects included in Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos bid for a share of poundbn investment package under the Belfast City Regional Deal.City deals are packages of funding and decision making powers which allow councils to boost the economy through the development of large projects in their respective areas.The deals are designed to allow councils to take charge and responsibility of decisions that affect their area, do what they think is best to help businesses grow, create economic growth and decide how public money should be spent.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is one of five councils paired with Belfast City Council, universities and the private sector who have committed poundm to help deliver a raft of schemes, with the remainder of the cash coming from the Treasury and Northern Ireland Executive.Earlier this year, a so-called heads of agreement mdash paving the way for work to start on the business cases and financial plans for ious components of the city deal mdash was signed.On Monday, members of the local councilrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee were provided with a progress report, with other key issues the council keen to see delivered as part of the city deal initiative including the southern relief road linking Newry by-pass with the Warrenpoint Road and the multi-million pound regeneration of Newry town centre.Local authority officials are expected to work with Tourism NI to help deliver the ambitious proposals aimed at shaping future tourist provision in Newcastle which include a gondola ride into the heart of the Mournes.The proposal is one of a series of exciting, world class attraction proposals, including an ultra-modern visitor centre at the site of the old quarry at Thomasrsquo Mountain.It is being suggested that work on the business case, alongside detailed financial plans, could take around one year to complete, with the ious proposals delivered with the help of a range of funding partners to signicantly increase the number of visitors to the resort.While the main focus is on the major aspects of the tourism initiative mdash which also include an Alpine coaster ride enabling people to hurtle down the side of the mountain on a single track in a buggy and an indoor activity centre in Donard Park mdash there are many other components.The local council hopes to secure poundm from the Northern Ireland Executive and is committing poundm of ratepayersrsquo money to fund the proposed gondola ride and visitor centre.In addition, local authority officials are working alongside Tourism NI to secure financial backing for other aspects of the gateway project and to move its ious components through a series of key stages, including the preparation of business cases and planning approval.The Mournes Gateway project also includes an elevated tree top walk in Tollymore Forest Park, new visitor centre and bird hide at the Murlough Nature Reserve and a new bridge constructed under the main Kilkeel Road at the Bloody Bridge on the outskirts of the town.Various aspects of the Newcastle tourism plan have already been discussed with the National Trust, Forest Service and Environment Agency, with the overarching vision of the project to provide game-changing, world-class, international tourist attractions..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Pop up beach plan aims to boost tourism  ","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council has unveiled details of a three-pronged initiative designed to enhance Newcastlersquos tourist reputation and satisfy the needs of residents and visitors left disappointed and frustrated at the absence of sand along its beach.The local authority is planning to work alongside the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs as part of the initiative with politicians told on Monday that plans are being drawn up to hold a meeting involving councillors, council officials and government representatives.The government department needs to grant a marine licence to carry out work at the beach, with the forthcoming talks also due to discuss the potential for transporting sand by road from Ballykinlar to the beach at Newcastle promenade.However, many believe that such a costly operation would simply not be feasible as the sand would be washed out to sea in a very short period of time and that such a scheme may not be approved by government officials.Details of the new Newcastle initiative were outlined at Mondayrsquos meeting of the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee when councillors agreed to start work on an economic appraisal to help improve the beach.It will examine in detail the cost and merits of a radical suggestion to add an articial pop-up beach at the resortrsquos promenade to provide the town with a certain je ne sais quoi between July and August.The idea to bring a little European flair to the resortrsquos sea front via a pop-up-beach mdash similar to those along the banks of the Seine in Paris and other parts of Europe mdashwas first suggested last year.While the idea was initially rejected by a council committee, the recommendation was subsequently overturned by the full council, with officers asked to look at the issue of how to address Newcastlersquos shting sands to make the resort more appealing.The problem is exacerbated by the design of the promenade which deflects waves back out to sea, taking what little sand there is on sections of the beach with it.Politicians insist that they are keen to make the resort even more attractive to visitors, often left disappointed there is no sand where the Mountains of Mourne sweep down to the sea.They say they recognise that the absence of a sandy beach is the resortrsquos Achilles heel and is an issue they are keen to address to make Newcastle even more attractive to holidaymakers in particular.Politicians also want more focus on an enhanced beach management plan which will result in a more robust cleansing programme alongside the provision of additional litter bins.Pop-up beaches along the banks of the Seine and in other parts of Europe are hugely popular and a final decision on whether they could feature in Newcastle next summer with deck chairs and parasols the order of the day along a section of the picturesque promenade is expected to be taken within the next weeks.While local politicians are united on the need to address Newcastlersquos tourism needs, they are split on the merits of a pop-up beach, with a number for and opposed to such a move, arguing there is no appetite for such a facility in the resort.In addition, some council officials believe that while Newcastle promenade is not suitable for pop-up beaches, two areas adjacent to the Downs Road car park would be and that the cost over a nine-week summer period would be in the region of pound,.Some councillors have also suggested that consideration needs to be given to placing groins along sections of beach to protect what little sand there is on it..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/9967081.jpg","title":"dragons den pitch for swcs business students","story":"Final year business students from South

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them.

And under my leadership, a Conservative administration will proudly put the people of the Vale of Glamorgan first.ldquoNaturally, we are open to working with other councillors who share those ideals.ldquoOthers - including those who resigned from the Conservative party - will have to explain to voters where they stand on these issues - and I would urge them to back us, rather than propping up a Labour administration that was rejected by the Vale at the last election.Cllr Bailey said he had a six-point plan for the Vale.He pledged to deliver the Dinas Powys bypass stop inflation-busting council tax rises scrap proposed parking charges review the local development planto curb inappropriate development protect rural schools and oppose the Barry Biomass plant.Cllr Bailey said that he was also keen to improve engagement with the public, after a series of hugely unpopular decisions taken by the existing cabinet.He said: ldquoDuring the elections in , we promised to build a stronger relationship with local residents by consulting them on key decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, too many people feel that their views are simply being ignored and that Vale consultations are just tick box exercises. Take the proposals around car parking charges, or the closure of Llancarfan School. I donrsquot think anyone outside of the Civic Offices believes that those decisions werenrsquot already done deals, and thatrsquos simply unacceptable.ldquoAnother good example is the councilrsquos failure to listen to the public over Penarthrsquos original Victorian lamp posts.ldquoIrsquove been criticised for wanting to listen to the people who elected me, and I make no apologies for that. Under my leadership, thatrsquos exactly what would happen and whilst I do accept that there are dficult decisions to be taken, we have to take the public with us - not ignore their legitimate concerns. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people. If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people. We have to say these are the facts and whether we like it or not we will have to do some things dferently or not at all.Cllr Burnett added. ldquoBut we have to be honest about the levels of pressure on local government.ldquoOur priority has to be services to the most vulnerable.The Labour-led coalition includes members of the former Conservative cabinet, which quit the party when former leader John Thomas was deposed as leader of the Vale Tories. The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for. It will be realistic and fair for everybody.School improvementsThe new cabinet says delivering on major new school buildings is a priority for the new administration.Developments in the pipeline include new builds forPencoedtre and Whitmore High Schools, and expansion and refurbishment of Ysgol Gymraeg Bro MorgannwgAgeing schools in the Vale are set to get a pound. million cash boost for repairs.Llancarfan Primary SchoolLlancarfan Primary School was set to be lsquoclosedrsquoand moved to a new pound million facility in Rhoose.The previous cabinet had approved the plans despite protests from parents and campaigners.Cllr Moore said Llancarfan School move was ldquopremature - but did not commit to scrapping the plan entirely.ldquoIf itrsquos justiable itrsquos justiable, he said. ldquoIf itrsquos not, we will look at alternatives.ldquoItrsquos not an easy decision to take. Itrsquos something we have to take some time about.ldquoWhat Irsquom not going to do is jump or kowtow to people who shout the loudest.Cllr Burnett has previously tweeted the closure of Llancarfan ldquowouldnrsquot be happeningLabour were running the council.New roadsWork continues on outline business cases for two major new roads being proposed ndash the A to M link around Pendoylan and Dinas Powys Bypass between Barry and Cardf ndash but no decision has been made whether either will actually go ahead.The future of both roads rests on whether Welsh Government and the council deem them viable, and whether ministers cough up the cash to fund them.But Cllr Moore said he doesnrsquot think Welsh Government will find the money required for the Dinas Powys Bypass.ldquoItrsquos out of our hands, he said.IncineratorCllr Moore said he believes Welsh Government will order the Barry Biomass incinerator to carry out an environmentalimpact assessment.Cllr Moore, who has previously attacked what he termed ldquoscaremongering and lies around the biomass plant, said he did not want the facility in Barry Docks.He said: ldquoWe opposed it vehemently, both as a council and as a party and personally. It shouldnrsquot be there.ldquoBut now it is there it has to operate within legal parameters.ldquoIf it does, therersquos nothing anyone can do about it.The council refused the original planning permission for the facility, but a planning inspector allowed it in  following an appeal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Anytime Fitness Penarth gym will sit on the ground floor.Savills Cardf will start selling the homes at a price of pound, for a one-bedroom apartment.Built in the s by Stanley Sadler, the building was originally the premises of Sadler Bros Ltd, the successful car garage he ran with his brother, Aubrey Sadler. During the Second World War the building was used as an auxiliary workshop. It changed hands in the early s to become Moorwell Motors.Ben Wells, managing director at Project Three, said: ldquoWe are delighted to reveal our plans to restore and revitalise this impressive Penarth building.ldquoWe were immediately struck by the strong architectural style of the faccedilade and the light and space inside. It was clear there was potential to design a scheme that would honour the buildingrsquos character and heritage, while creating something new and contemporary for future generations to enjoy.Features include double height windows in the duplex and both private and communal outside spaces. A full floor penthouse has a roof terrace to the front and back with panoramic views.Dorothy Foulkes, daughter of Stanley Sadler, who designed and built the distinctive building and ran his business from there for many years, still lives in Penarth and recently visited the site of the development.She said: ldquoI have many memories of the garage over the years. Having stood empty for many years, I am delighted it is being given a new and exciting future. It is wonderful that the key features of the original beautully designed building are being preserved and transformed.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

So, why are Northern Ireland’s makers and engineers bucking the trend  John Mulgrew takes a look at our top performers and what may be skewing the figures If there’s been an industry yet to be tainted by the ill-effects of the run-up to Brexit that I, or other journalists haven’t written about, I’d be very surprised.The latest economic metrics and predictors have been tarred by the three years of uncertainty and political instability. But, according to the latest purchasing managers’ indexfrom Ulster Bank, manufacturing here has seen an uplt – unlike the other sectors.Globally, however, the growth of the manufacturing sector has slowed closer to stagnation, sitting at . in Januaryaccording to the JP Morgan Global Manufacturing PMI.“At the moment, exports are falling in German manufacturing,” Richard Ramsey, Ulster Bank chief economist said. “Northern Ireland and the UK compare favourably to the German powerhouse, and countries such as France and Italy.”He says that nine out of the  nations which are recorded by PMIs show manufacturing is falling.For Northern Ireland and the UK as a whole, Brexit-related stock-piling is certainly a factor. Let’s say you’re a cross-border business and you could be burdened by World Trade Organizationtarfs on your exports to the Republic in the event of a hard exit. What do you do  You produce more, and warehouse in your export market.Graeme MacLaughlin, relationship director, Barclays in Northern Ireland, said the “underlying state of health of UK manufacturing continues to be obscured by stockpiling, albeit down from the last survey’s record high, as Brexit uncertainty still thwarts investment intentions”.Ulster Business has revealed in this magazine that one major manufacturer, which has its base here, had stockpiled more than £m in food stock for its market in the Republic amid border concerns – and is now left with huge levels of product in a warehouse, with the exit from the EU now not likely until Halloween.“Continuing increases in inventories of both inputs and finished goods have exacerbated the slowdown in growth of new orders and given the loss of momentum in exporting activity, with growing signs that overseas markets are looking to alternative suppliers, the sector needs some degree of clarity on the future relationship with the EU sooner rather than later,” Graeme MacLaughlin said.Looking at what organic factors and positive stories which are fuelling the increase in manufacturing, Richard Ramsey says the success stories and expansion of firms such as CDE Global and Terex could be among those contributing.“They seem to be in expansion mode. But they are firms which are more exposed to the US, which is growing strongly. I would imagine those focused on eurozone are maybe experiencing that fall in demand.”Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI, told Ulster Business that “in the past year, our firms have been busy”.“The economic conditions have been right. A purple patch indeed. Admittedly Brexit stockpiling has driven demand for many and as that begins to wash through the system in the coming monthsand with slowing of international and domestic demand, then now is the time to ensure we have the right conditions to ensure that this success is sustained.“By value, our engineering sector remains our most important. The extraordinary growth of the export focused sector in Mid Ulster, South Derry and West Tyrone contributes huge levels or employment and wages but as labour and skills have become more dficult to secure, firms have begun to spread out. CDE’s investment in Monkstown and Terex’s announcement for the North West demonstrate their commitment to creating more jobs here instead of overseas.“There has been much speculation about the demise of our manufacturing over recent years but the sector continues to confound its detractors. Employment levels, despite high profile closures, are back to  levels with exports at record levels and orders at home remaining strong. Our sector is larger and more important than manufacturing in the rest of the UK. Through direct and supported jobs, one in four local families rely on a manufacturing wage with our rural economy and community depending on manufacturers to bring both wealth and work.“Our award-winning food firms feed families at home and abroad with a greater number securing supply contracts with the UKs and Ireland’s largest buyers. Indeed news that Dale Farm had secured a supply contract with Greggs is further evidence that there is more growth possible for this critical sub-sector of manufacturing.“Often overlooked is our strength in building products. From Specialist Joinery and Carella fitting out the best of corporate offices to Smyth Steel and Macrete making the bulk of the new Tottenham Hotspur stadium, regarded as the best in Europe, in factories here before shipping on barges to London.“We’re also leading the move in construction from site build to factory built homes, schools, hospitals and offices at the McAvoy Group and Fasthouse. We have even seen a beautul table made by Terry Design from Portadown in  Downing Street.“Whether it is a critical spring on the Mars rover, or a defibrillator in the Oval office or indeed the fact that one in  people on the planet this year benefiting from a Randox test, products made in Northern Ireland are making a dference and making a huge economic contribution.“It is therefore critical that we cherish and celebrate our great firms who are making great products with great people in every postcode area. We must create the conditions that allow them to be free to make a success of their business and their community.As for the current and future “disruptor”, Richard Ramsey says while Brexit is the largest, the impact of Trump on the global economy, could have an impact on business here. “The thing is, it’s to what extentthere is when there is a trade war. Trump is increasing tarfs on China, then he focuses on the EU – how does the EU retaliate ”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/kpm_1.jpg","title":"ni bosses searching new markets to boost exports","story":"Posted on Tuesday June  by John Mulgrew Around % of Northern Ireland bosses are exploring emerging markets in order grow their exports, according to the latest survey from KPMG. Thats signicantly higher than % of bosses globally. And according to the firm’s latest Global CEO Outlook, Northern Ireland’s bosses are leading the way when it comes to embracing the ‘fast fail’ culture in an effort to make their companies as innovative as possible. Of the Northern Ireland bosses surveyed, % said they want their employees to feel ‘empowered to innovate. On the issue of Brexit, around two thirds of business leaders see the UK’s exit from the EU as the greatest threat to growth. Looking at overall growth, all of those questioned said they expect ‘top line revenue growth over the next three years’. But just % of company bosses said they ‘expect to increase headcount in the next three years of more than %’. John Hansen, partner in charge of KPMG Northern Ireland, said: “Successful CEOs know they need their companies to be as innovative as possible and it’s clear that the right environment is being created in Northern Ireland to do just that. “Our leaders aren’t afraid to give their teams the scope to try new ideas which may have a risk of failure and that opens up a world of potential. This level of freedom will no doubt make sure that Northern Ireland companies are at the cutting edge of innovation in the years to come.” Angela McGowan, CBI director in Northern Ireland, said: “KPMG’s  Global CEO Outlook gives local business leaders some great insights into what is on the radar for chief executives across the globe and raises some important and interesting ideas around what leaders should doing to maintain competitive advantage despite the uncertainty.”  View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/glandore_web.jpg","title":"glandore the family flexible workspace on the rise","story":"Posted on Wednesday June  by Ulster Business High-end flexible office company Glandore has expanded rapidly into an all-island family business with further growth on the horizon. Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
