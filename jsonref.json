God dammit! I thought the b***h was white! F**k! she roared in the video, posted to herYouTube page with the caption: \u0027Roseanne, like always, cuts through the bullsh** and gets the heart of the matter.\u0027The clip comes two months after Roseanne\u0027s eponymous reboot was axed when she tweeted that former Obama advisor  Jarrett, who is African American, looked like the \u0027Muslim brotherhood \u0026amp planet of the apes had a baby\u0027.Scroll down for video           Roseanne Barr has posted a bizarre new video where literally screams her defense of why she posted the racist tweet about Valerie Jarrett which got her show cancelledThe 65-year-old immediately backtracked in the wake of furious backlash, claiming it was a \u0027joke\u0027, blaming her Ambien sleeping tablets, and claiming she didn\u0027t know Jarrett was African American but believed she was Jewish and Persian.In a since deleted Twitter rant from May, she says she told President of Disney-ABC Television Group Ben Sherwood: \u0027I thought she was white, she looks like my family!\u0027\u0027I bought the Chicagoist just to run you racist b*****s out...Papa Johns is hit with second scandal as bosses are accused...Share this article    Barr followed through with her promise when she posted the bizarre video of her speaking about the tweet on her YouTube page on Thursday           The actress looked disheveled and increasingly agitated, smoking a cigarette and repeatedly running her hands through her hair as she was interviewed by someone off camera          \u0027I thought the b***h was white!

Roseanne Barr posted the initial offending tweet on May 29, which she attempted to backtrack on minutes later, claiming \u0027Muslims r NOT a race\u0027 then apologizing Barr, who claimed her whole life has been about fighting racism\u0027, also claimed she had been \u0027Ambien tweeting\u0027 when she sent the offensive tweet.\u0027I\u0027m not a racist, I never was \u0026amp I never will be. One stupid joke in a lifetime of fighting 4 civil rights 4 all minorities, against networks, studios, at the expense of my nervous systemfamilywealth will NEVER b taken from me.\u0027The pharmaceutical firm which produces Ambien later hit back saying \u0027racism is not a known side effect of any Sanofi medication.\u0027Barr has faced huge backlash in the wake of her tweets, including from her former costars, who lost their jobs when ABC axed the series.Several of her costars, including Wanda Sykes, announced they would be leaving the show over the racial slur.          In the early hours of May 30, just 24 hours after posting the racial slur, Roseanne claimed in two tweets minutes apart she believed that Jarrett was Jewish and Persian, or white   Contextual: Her son  shared text messages that he and his mother purportedly exchanged in which Barr writes that she thought Jarrett was \u0027white\u0027 and \u0027Iranian,\u0027 posted eight hours after the show was cancelled          On May 30, Barr claimed she had begged Ben Sherwood, then president of the Disney-ABC Television Group, to not cancel her show and let her \u0027make amends\u0027          She said that she thought Jarrett \u0027was white, she looks like my family!\u0027 she tweeted          The shamed star also blamed her racist rant on sleeping pill Ambien. Users have previously reported going into blackouts and performing complex actions such as driving and making food without recalling it The network has since announced  a Roseanne spinoff about the Conner family which will air in the fall without the disgraced star.Meanwhile, Roseanne is reportedly working on her own talk show which she will host on her YouTube channel.She\u0027s been working with her son Jake\u0027s Full Moon \u0026amp High Tide studio to interview friends and family, including Barr’s boyfriend Johnny Argent, former Roseanne crew member Allan Stephan and ex campaign manager Thomas Muhammad, TMZ reported.Thursday\u0027s YouTube clip was reportedly a preview of the show’s first episode. There is no set release date or name for the show.Barr has apologized for her tweets, saying she didn\u0027t mean to hurt anyone and that she\u0027s regretted the tweets, even before saying in an interview she \u0027lost everything.\u0027She later stated that she would not be speaking to the media any more, but would be addressing her fans \u0027directly\u0027 to \u0027cut out any middlemen who use for clickbaitad revenue while seeking to ide rather than unite.\u0027Barr followed through with her promise when she posted the bizarre video of her speaking about the tweet on her YouTube page on Thursday.    It was during this rant that Barr made the comment \u0027muslim brotherhood and planet of the apes had a babyvj\u0027, using Valerie Jarrett\u0027s initials, that would see her show axed.Barr subsequently deleted the tweet but not before it had been copied and shared across social media, leading to swift calls for her show to be pulled from the air.          After Barr\u0027s now-infamous Planet of the Apes tweet had been sent, Clinton replied around 9am to say that she was not in fact married to a Soros, though she admired the work his foundation does.Barr subsequently sent a Tweet apologizing to Clinton for the mistake, though launched another broadside at Soros by claiming he was a \u0027Nazi\u0027 who betrayed Jews during the holocaust.The actress also launched a salvo at Clinton\u0027s actual husband, Marc Mezvinsky, saying: \u0027HER HUSBAND IS THE SON OF A CORRUPT SENATOR.\u0027Clinton\u0027s father-in-law is a former congressman and convicted felon who in March of 2001 plead guilty to 31 of 69 felony charges of mail, bank and wire fraud.            But as the Clinton saga wound to a close Barr\u0027s tweet about Jarrett was catching a massive amount of attention, forcing the actress to brand her remark \u0027a joke\u0027.She also defended herself against allegations of racism by countering that Islam \u0027is not a race\u0027.The remarks were not enough, however, and around an hour later she offered a full apology to Jarrett and announced that she would be leaving Twitter.Shortly after midday Wanda Sykes, an African-American comedian and writer working on the Roseanne reboot, announced that she was walking away from the program.Around an hour later ABC broke its silence over the controversy to say that Roseanne was being cancelled.We now know that the network spent this time contacting Jarrett to apologize and inform her of the cancellation.Barr later said that the network had bowed to pressure amid calls for a boycott of Roseanne\u0027s advertisers, though ABC did not immediately respond to her remark.In its statement, ABC said Roseanne\u0027s remark was \u0027abhorrent, repugnant and inconsistent with our values\u0027.                          "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/21/00/4E72530100000578-5976287-image-a-38_1532129021809.jpg","title":"Revealing portrait Prince George fifth birthday","story":"    Prince George attends the Maserati Royal Charity Polo Trophy at Beaufort Polo Club, Tetbury          A photograph taken in London on July 2, 2014, to mark Britain\u0027s Prince George\u0027s first birthday           Prince George looks at his sister Princess Charlotte  in her pram on the Sandringham Estate          President Barack Obama, Prince William and First Lady Michelle Obama talks with Prince George          George enjoys weekends at Anmer Hall, visits to farm parks and country showsIt is an image of George, however, that friends of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge insist belies the happy, confident child their firstborn is developing into. Tomorrow, George turns five and will be celebrating his milestone birthday on the Caribbean island of Mustique.The family left London on Monday and have been joined by grandparents Carole and Michael Middleton, and aunt Pippa and her husband James Matthews, so it will be quite a party.One day, the third in line to the throne — who wants to be a pilot, just like his adored ‘Papa’ who flew with the East Anglian Air Ambulance — will learn his life choices are somewhat restricted.For now, his parents are focused on providing him with the close-knit, carefree family life that mum Kate took for granted as she grew up — and that William’s own late mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, fought to try to give her two boys.What will happen when the Queen of England dies?How the court jester had the last laugh: Tearaway Guy Pelly...A Royal thank you! The Queen hails the \u0027tenacity, skill and...Share this articleThe past year has been a formative one for George the family moved back to London from their cloistered life at Anmer Hall, on the Queen’s Sandringham Estate in Norfolk, and he started school.His nerves on his first day at Thomas’s Battersea, in West London, were apparent, despite his parents arranging for a discreet, five-strong group of media to capture the moment, as opposed to the hundred-plus assembled to document William’s arrival at prep school at the same age.The duke admits his own experiences as a young boy — the mass photocalls and what he views as an overwhelming public interest in himself and brother, Harry — had been hard to deal with.He has made clear that he will be much more cautious with his own children, striking a careful balance between allowing people to share in their growing up, without making the youngsters feel they are constantly in the public eye.Some have questioned whether William and Kate’s understandable protectiveness of their son, plus their instinctive wariness of the media, may have inadvertently rubbed off on George. But friends insist he is no different from other young children. ‘Just because he reacts more cautiously than Charlotte when there is a camera around isn’t an indication of what he is like behind closed doors,’ says one. ‘Your first day at school is a big enough deal without all these strange people watching you. He is a very happy little boy.’William and Kate hope their choice of school, albeit one in the heart of an affluent area of the capital that has been dubbed Nappy Valley, will offer their son the chance to develop in a more rounded environment than other young royals.‘They thought long and hard about where George should be educated and really liked Thomas’s, which has a lovely nurturing atmosphere,’ a source said.‘The school focuses as much on helping develop the character of pupils, as what they learn. William and Kate are keen to allow George to spread his wings and make friends at this stage.‘They know there will come a time when they will have to sit down and talk to him about the implications of his royal status and why so many people are interested in him. He is becoming more aware of the cameras. But they are determined to do that at George’s own pace and feel that can all wait a bit.’          Prince William with Prince George on his son\u0027s first day of school on September 7, 2017Carole, 63, and her husband Michael, 69, play a hugely significant role in their grandchildren’s lives — as their current Caribbean holiday together shows. She has taken George and Charlotte to work at the family’s Party Pieces HQ, a short drive from the Middletons’ Berkshire mansion, where they play at being shopkeepers.One visitor spotted George sitting in the ‘front of house’, exclaiming excitedly ‘Oh my gosh!’ as his indulgent granny gave him a bag of sweets for being a good boy.Kate understands only too well that it is a grandparent’s prerogative to spoil their grandchildren — and still laughs about how she once called home from a foreign tour to speak to her mother, who was looking after George, only for him to tell her earnestly that his granny had given him ‘chips, again’ for dinner.With a loving, extended family around him, determined to protect him from the pressures of royal life for as long as they possibly can, it’s no wonder that George is growing into such a settled little boy.And who knows, one day he still may be able to become a pilot — just like Papa. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/03/09/4DDEDC4900000578-0-image-a-11_1530606342861.jpg","title":"Susanna Reid says Twitter trolls wont drive Good Morning Britain","story":"    Good Morning Britain presenter and  Susanna Reid has hit out at those who abuse her online\u0027This is like Mao’s China\u0027: Piers Morgan compares schools...\u0027Who\u0027s giving him PR advice?\u0027 Princess Diana\u0027s former butler...‘I’ve changed my mind about Meghan’s dad – he’s just a shy,...Share this articleBut Ms Reid has insisted she is unmoved by the abuse.

Thousands of Britons flood UK\u0027s...Water, water everywhere... from the deck of a £2million...Siberian Husky swims FIVE MILES to shore in the dark and is...Released to save their species: Zoo-bred Przewalski’s horses...Share this articleUU loses 439.2million litres of water every day from leaks and has applied for permission to extract water from three Cumbrian lakes, including Windermere, as its reservoirs continue to run low. The company has turned to Snipe, a 21-month-old cocker iel, which has undergone weeks of special training by ex-military personnel to detect  tiny amounts of chlorine found in tap water.Snipe will be used  in rural areas where leaks are hardest to detect.  Snipe with trainers Luke Jones and Ross Stephenson and Hannah Wardle of United UtilitiesOwner Ross Stephenson, 32, the MD of Cape SPC, a pest extermination expert firm in Liverpool, has been putting Snipe through his paces since late last year.He said: \u0027All I did was start off with normal tap water, and then putting in extra chlorine levels to make it stronger.\u0027So we just put a tiny bit of that in, so the dog understands the strongest odour is the one we want them to find.\u0027We would have eight glass pots, one of them will have it in and every time the dog sniffs that pot he will get rewarded – a tennis ball.\u0027What I had to do was take the pots outside first and start doing it in different environments and then I would take the pots away and then ended up having normal tap water, pouring it on the ground and getting the dog to search that.\u0027So we want the dog to sit and stand and stare where the source is, so try to get the dog to stay there for 30 seconds, a \u0027passive indication\u0027.\u0027Mr Stephenson, from Bristol, set up his firm after leaving the military two years ago, where he served with the Royal Veterinary Corps as a Corporal, deploying to war-torn Afghanistan and Iraq.His business partner Luke Jones, 27, from Bargoed, south Wales, served in the same military unit, using dogs to search for weapons, explosives and IEDs before transferring his skills to teach dogs to sniff out bed bugs – and now detecting water leaks.Mr Jones added: \u0027All the principles are basically exactly the same, it\u0027s just a different setting. And less stress.\u0027Tap water consists of one part chlorine per million parts water – with a dog\u0027s nose thought to be able to detect one particle of an odour or scent in a billion.UU responsible for a network of 42,000 kilometres of pipes, fixes around 27,000 leaks a year, with a team of 140 personnel, using high tech drones, camera and sound detection equipment – and now their latest recruit, Snipe.However, the firm has come under fire for the sheer amount of water wasted every day through leaking pipes.Critics claim that if United Utilities – who paid chief executive Steve Mogford £2.3million in salary and bonuses last year – stopped the leaks then the ban could be avoided.Earlier this week, MPs and councillors reacted angrily to fresh revelations about Mr Mogford\u0027s lifestyle, branding his ownership of a luxury £2million yacht a \u0027particularly galling example\u0027 of excess.  Manchester Central Labour MP Lucy Powell added: \u0027Constituents would be appalled to learn that, at a utility company which really should be a public asset, executives are paid so much they can afford to lead this kind of lifestyle.\u0027Bury North Labour MP James Frith said: \u0027His customers would be dismayed to learn he has such a high pay packet through which he can afford to own a yacht.\u0027Twelve Greater Manchester MPs who have written to United Utilities complaining about the hosepipe ban at a time when the firm wastes so much water from leaks.Cat Hobbs of We Own It, which campaigns for public ownership of utilities, said: \u0027Water belongs to all of us, there\u0027s no reason why we should bankroll lavish lifestyles for Mogford and his shareholders.\u0027Tim Roache, the GMB union\u0027s general secretary, said: \u0027Most people can\u0027t sail off into the sunset on a luxury yacht whenever there\u0027s a water shortage.\u0027United Utilities waste more than 175 Olympic-sized swimming pools of water every day – plug the leaks and you won\u0027t need a hosepipe ban.\u0027  Wayoh Resevoir, Lancashire, has completely dried up in the wake of a continuing UK heatwaveHannah Wardle, regional leakage manager at UU, who described Snipe as \u0027an invaluable asset\u0027 in helping fix the problem of wasted water, said: \u0027The north west of England is a notoriously wet region, and sorting the leaks from the puddles especially out in the fields can be a real challenge.\u0027This is where we hope Snipe will really come into his own, as his sensitive nose can detect mains water at incredibly low concentrations.\u0027With leakage detection it\u0027s all about building up the evidence using a range of different technologies. \u0027We\u0027re trialling the use of satellites and drones to get a bird\u0027s eye view of a particular area, but the devil is in the detail, and pinpointing the exact place to start digging is more difficult than you might think.\u0027 Customers who flout the ban could face criminal prosecution and fines of up to £1,000 if they use a hose to water their garden or plants or clean their cars, windows, paths and outdoor surfaces.The hosepipe ban by the company is the first in England since 2012, when 20million customers were affected.  "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/22/10/4E7B1D2300000578-0-image-a-6_1532250550706.jpg","title":"Young

The leaflet cost more than the £7 million the two sides were each allowed to spend, but it was not counted towards the Remain campaign’s spending as it was delivered the week before the official campaign period began.The Independent Commission on Referendums said: ‘The commission is concerned that the current restrictions on Government during referendum campaigns permit potentially unlimited spending of public money in favour of one side before the final four weeks.’ "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/22/14/4E7AE77400000578-5979627-image-a-39_1532267532582.jpg","title":"Huge crocodiles offer toothy grins pictured swimming alongside brave models","story":"    These incredible photographs, taken by Ken Kiefer, show brave models posing with crocodiles at Chinchorro Banks in Mexico          The models, Melodie Trevino and his wife Kimber, get unbelievably close to the gigantic beasts so Mr Kiefer could get the perfect shot  Around 500 wild American crocodiles live in the central lagoon of Chinchorro Banks so Mr Kiefer had no trouble finding crocs to show off their toothy grinsThe Mars-lit sky!

They orced after his extramarital affarisThe spotlight was thrown on his family life after he crashed his SUV into a tree and a fire hydrant outside his home in Windermere, Florida.  Over the next few weeks reports emerged of multiple extramarital affairs, which he eventually admitted and which led to his orce from wife Elin Nordegren. He did not return to golf until the 2010 Masters and next won a PGA Tour tournament in 2012. His career faced further struggles through injury as Woods had back surgery in 2014, missing the Augusta National the first time, and again in 2015 after missing the cut at three of the year\u0027s four majors. In late 2016 he competed for the first time in 15 months at the unofficial Hero World Challenge in the Bahamas.

A nod was too much to expect,’ say the authors. According to the book Tiger had a tough childhood. The authors revealed  his father, retired army lieutenant-colonel Earl Woods, not only instilled in Tiger a ruthless determination to win at golf, but also appeared to pass on his weakness for womanising.The book reveals how, in his later years, Woods Sr turned Tiger’s childhood home into what one employee called ‘a house of horrors’.The house in California had cupboards and drawers overflowing with sex toys, while pornography played continually on the TV.

These boys are saying “we missed out on our fathers, we’re not going to miss out on our children.”’She gave an example of one young couple – a male teacher and female doctor - who have both gone part-time.    The BBC Radio 4 presenter said it was the ‘ideal solution’ rather than one parent having to give up work or otherwise sending young children to the nursery‘They don’t have childcare, they manage it between them so both can keep their jobs and they can both be good parents. That, for me, would be the ideal solution,’ she said. Responding to a question about whether modern feminism is devaluing traditional motherhood, Dame Jenni said women choosing to give up work to bring up children is ‘absolutely right if it’s your choice’.‘The people who matter in all this are the kids,’ she said.Dame Jenni, 68, told how attitudes to parenting were once very different with her mother having to give up her job as a civil servant once she married ‘as it was assumed she would start a family’.And she said that, during the 1980s, she asked Margaret Thatcher about whether her government would be willing to help mothers wanting to go back to work.Mrs Thatcher replied: ‘Perhaps women could work a couple of days and find a kindly aunt or grandparents to help.’But Dame Jenni said: ‘She managed to do what she did because she had her wealthy husband to help with the childcare costs of their two children.’The author also said she was ‘ashamed there are no sports women’ in her latest book, A History of Britain in 21 Women.‘I think it’s because, apart from riding horses, I haven’t been involved in any sport apart from watching my son,’ she said."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/13/00/4E2D029700000578-0-image-a-4_1531436952662.jpg","title":"Doctors think discovered cause MS","story":"    Doctors now believe the development of a vaccine against one of the two common viruses which cause the body to attack itself may hold the key to future MS prevention (file image)Approximately 100,000 people in the UK live with multiple sclerosis.The neurological condition is triggered when the immune system attacks the nerves, causing pain, fatigue, vision problems and spasms.What causes the body to begin attacking itself has never been identified.But scientists at the University of Glasgow and Harvard University in the US suggest exposure to two common infections – threadworms followed by the Epstein-Barr virus – may be the trigger.Unvaccinated child dies from flu in Sydney as doctors urge...\u0027This could happen to any mum\u0027: Heartbroken paediatrician...Share this articleThe findings therefore suggest that developing a vaccine or drugs to stop people getting the Epstein-Barr virus could also make them immune to multiple sclerosis.Professor John Paul Leach, consultant neurologist at the University of Glasgow, said: ‘MS is a condition where the body produces antibodies against itself for reasons that have never been understood and goes against its own nervous system. It is odd that we have never found out why some people are more prone than others.‘There is already some evidence that exposure to the Epstein-Barr virus makes it more likely someone will develop MS but this does not offer the full explanation of why people develop this reaction. MS may be the result of not one but two infections in the right order.’The researchers’ explanation is currently just a theory but they plan to carry out further research. Threadworms affect around one sixth of the world’s population and are a parasitic infection affecting the gut, common in children.The Epstein-Barr virus is one of the most common viruses in humans and is the cause of glandular fever although many people only suffer mild symptoms.Dr Patrick Kearns of Harvard University, who led the research, said: ‘I believe the missing link may be threadworm infection. This is a very common condition in children and is also common in soldiers living in barracks.‘In areas where soldiers were billeted during the Second World War it would have spread to local populations.‘I believe that what may be causing MS is a rare late complication of exposure to these two infections.‘First, when the body is exposed to threadworm infection it produces an immune response and “memory” white blood cells are created and live in the immune system that could fight off the infection again. Next, if someone is exposed to the Epstein-Barr virus then even after they recover from the illness, the virus hides in the white blood cells.‘It is already known to cause a huge number of other diseases and cancer and it could be that it causes the memory white blood cells that were created to respond to threadworms to start attacking similar cells in the human body. It may be a good idea for public health officials to treat worms at a population level.‘But the real benefit would be developing better tools to target the Epstein-Barr virus with a vaccine or drugs.’The research is published in the journal Multiple Sclerosis and Related Disorders."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/23/00/4E80876F00000578-5980691-image-m-42_1532301849526.jpg","title":"Rustling sweet wrappers sorry cards irritants make want scream","story":"    Daily Mail columnist Sarah Vine, who doesn\u0027t like men who spectate her parallel parking1.

Snipe with trainers Luke Jones and Ross Stephenson and Hannah Wardle of United UtilitiesOwner Ross Stephenson, 32, the MD of Cape SPC, a pest extermination expert firm in Liverpool, has been putting Snipe through his paces since late last year.He said: \u0027All I did was start off with normal tap water, and then putting in extra chlorine levels to make it stronger.\u0027So we just put a tiny bit of that in, so the dog understands the strongest odour is the one we want them to find.\u0027We would have eight glass pots, one of them will have it in and every time the dog sniffs that pot he will get rewarded – a tennis ball.\u0027What I had to do was take the pots outside first and start doing it in different environments and then I would take the pots away and then ended up having normal tap water, pouring it on the ground and getting the dog to search that.\u0027So we want the dog to sit and stand and stare where the source is, so try to get the dog to stay there for 30 seconds, a \u0027passive indication\u0027.\u0027Mr Stephenson, from Bristol, set up his firm after leaving the military two years ago, where he served with the Royal Veterinary Corps as a Corporal, deploying to war-torn Afghanistan and Iraq.His business partner Luke Jones, 27, from Bargoed, south Wales, served in the same military unit, using dogs to search for weapons, explosives and IEDs before transferring his skills to teach dogs to sniff out bed bugs – and now detecting water leaks.Mr Jones added: \u0027All the principles are basically exactly the same, it\u0027s just a different setting. And less stress.\u0027Tap water consists of one part chlorine per million parts water – with a dog\u0027s nose thought to be able to detect one particle of an odour or scent in a

now their latest recruit, Snipe.However, the firm has come under fire for the sheer amount of water wasted every day through leaking pipes.Critics claim that if United Utilities – who paid chief executive Steve Mogford £2.3million in salary and bonuses last year – stopped the leaks then the ban could be avoided.Earlier this week, MPs and councillors reacted angrily to fresh revelations about Mr Mogford\u0027s lifestyle, branding his ownership of a luxury £2million yacht a \u0027particularly galling example\u0027 of excess.  Manchester Central Labour MP Lucy Powell added: \u0027Constituents would be appalled to learn that, at a utility company which really should be a public asset, executives are paid so much they can afford to lead this kind of lifestyle.\u0027Bury North Labour MP James Frith said: \u0027His customers would be dismayed to learn he has such a high pay packet through which he can afford to own a yacht.\u0027Twelve Greater Manchester MPs who have

\u0027Most people can\u0027t sail off into the sunset on a luxury yacht whenever there\u0027s a water shortage.\u0027United Utilities waste more than 175 Olympic-sized swimming pools of water every day – plug the leaks and you won\u0027t need a hosepipe ban.\u0027  Wayoh Resevoir, Lancashire, has completely dried up in the wake of a continuing UK heatwaveHannah Wardle, regional leakage manager at UU, who described Snipe as \u0027an invaluable asset\u0027 in helping fix the problem of wasted water, said: \u0027The north west of England is a notoriously wet region, and sorting the leaks from the puddles especially out in the fields can be a real challenge.\u0027This is where we hope Snipe will really come into his own, as his sensitive nose can detect mains water at incredibly low concentrations.\u0027With leakage detection it\u0027s all about building up the evidence using a range of different technologies. \u0027We\u0027re trialling the use of satellites and drones to get a bird\u0027s eye view of a particular area, but the devil is in the detail, and pinpointing the exact place to start digging is more difficult than you might think.\u0027 Customers who flout the ban could face criminal prosecution and fines of up to £1,000 if they use a hose to water their garden or plants or clean their cars, windows, paths and outdoor surfaces.The hosepipe ban by the company is the first in England since 2012, when 20million customers were affected.  "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/22/10/4E7B1D2300000578-0-image-a-6_1532250550706.jpg","title":"Young

It is odd that we have never found out why some people are more prone than others.‘There is already some evidence that exposure to the Epstein-Barr virus makes it more likely someone will develop MS but this does not offer the full explanation of why people develop this reaction. MS may be the result of not one but two infections in the right order.’The researchers’ explanation is currently just a theory but they plan to carry out further research. Threadworms affect around one sixth of the world’s population and are a parasitic infection affecting the gut, common in children.The Epstein-Barr virus is one of the most common viruses in humans and is the cause of glandular fever although many people only suffer mild symptoms.Dr Patrick Kearns of Harvard University, who led the research, said: ‘I believe the missing link may be threadworm infection. This is a very common condition in children and is also common in soldiers living in barracks.‘In areas where soldiers were billeted during the Second World War it would have spread to local populations.‘I believe that what may be causing MS is a rare late complication of exposure to these two infections.‘First, when the body is exposed to threadworm infection it produces an immune response and “memory” white blood cells are created and live in the immune system that could fight off the infection again. Next, if someone is exposed to the Epstein-Barr virus then even after they recover from the illness, the virus hides in the white blood cells.‘It is already known to cause a huge number of other diseases and cancer and it could be that it causes the memory white blood cells that were created to respond to threadworms to start attacking similar cells in the human body. It may be a good idea for public health officials to treat worms at a population level.‘But the real benefit would be developing better tools to target the Epstein-Barr virus with a vaccine or drugs.’The research is published in the journal Multiple Sclerosis and Related Disorders."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/23/01/4E80992600000578-0-image-m-9_1532304362068.jpg","title":"Honey Monsters puppeteer defends character","story":"The Honey Monster, designed and built by Peter Pullon, a puppet and model maker (stock image)The Honey Monster has already been slimmed down over the years to make him more \u0027politically correct.\u0027And four years ago, Sugar Puffs was re-branded to Honey Monster Puffs, and its recipe changed to have less sugar and more honey.However, puppeteer Mr Pullon said the idea of banning cartoons such as Frosties mascot Tony the Tiger, promotes a \u0027nanny state\u0027.Mr Pullon said: \u0027I think parents need to take some responsibility, not only for their children but for themselves as well.No-deal Brexit could bring CIVIL UNREST warns Amazon’s UK...Is plastic and paper sent abroad for recycling ending up in...Share this article\u0027I\u0027m pretty old, I\u0027ve got three children and I\u0027ve never pushed sweets on my children.

When most admitted they wanted to throw something, she suggested they bring in a selection of harmless projectiles, including old pens and stuffed toys.“I like to work collaboratively, so I wanted them to choose the objects they would like to throw, then got them to throw them at the same time,” says Valade. “I wanted to capture this sudden and out-of-the-ordinary burst of adolescent energy. It was about exploding, expressing and exploring something in themselves. The idea was for them to revolt to do something unexpected, especially in a space like a school that is normally strictly controlled.“Suddenly, all is possible...including transgression and private rebellion.”More artistic than documentary, the photographs in the series – in this case a collage of three separate images – were meticulously staged.

It was the title of a 1984 book by biologist Edward O Wilson, who claimed humans are genetically drawn to seek out and feel more zen in nature. In 2005, author Richard Louv proposed that not seeing your greens could cause Nature Deficit Disorder (NDD), a low-mood condition similar to Seasonal Affective Disorder (Sad).“Nature is good for us because humans are part of nature,” says Dr Miles Richardson, director of psychology at the University of Derby and founder of the Nature Connectedness Research Group. The science of why is down to a three circles model, where wellbeing is a delicately weighted balance between drive, contentment and threat. “Being constantly driven at work can mean our threat response is overactive, positive emotions are reduced, and we become anxious. Nature reduces sympathetic nervous activity associated with drive, and increases parasympathetic nervous activity associated with calm,” he says.  Relaxation comes whether you bathe in a forest or simply look at some roses – so it’s not necessarily being in nature that relaxes you, but feeling connected to it. “Simply noticing three good things in nature every day, such as a flower growing on the pavement, increases connectedness and, therefore, wellbeing,” adds Richardson. Light rightThere’s a reason that getting the window seat is such a big deal – it is, in fact, scientifically good for us. A study in the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine found that sitting by a window during your working day results in 46 minutes more sleep every night.Where windows-for-all isn’t an option, architects are plugging into the new trend for circadian lighting: LED systems that mimic the angle and colour of the sun to sync with our bodies’ awake and sleep cycles. “Evolution has led us to expect a bluer light in the afternoon and a redder light in the morning and evening. Manufacturers are starting to produce systems with wavelengths to echo this,” explains Joe Croft, head of environmental and sustainability at Overbury, a wellbeing-focused fit-out firm. Air-ratedPolluted air doesn’t just create temporary physical symptoms such as problematic skin, and irritated eyes, nose and throat, it also contributes to the risk of chronic illnesses – but new tech is assisting the fightback against bad air. “The world’s first smartphone with air-quality sensors was released in February. Soon, more and more people will have the technology in their pocket to measure the quality of air around them,” says Croft. Colour of creativityThe psychology of shades has been a talking, dressing and wall-painting point ever since psychologist Angela Wright identified how colour influences our reactions back in 1984. Today, much of the focus is on how our environment spurs creativity. Sensory “triggers”, such as different textures of materials, are thought to keep the brain engaged, improving our ability to access knowledge. The significance of colour is also now thought to vary depending on where you are. According to the Human Spaces report, creativity is best boosted by green and purple colours in the UK, red design accents in India and water features in Brazil. Immersed in waterThe effect of urban water on wellbeing is the very latest area of environmental research. While the value of green space is in no doubt – the charity Fields in Trust equates the health benefit of the UK’s parks to around £34bn – water features, such as rivers, are less well examined. A special project will look at how 18,000 Europeans’ lives are influenced by water, meaning we could soon be splashing around a new buzzword: blue health.Look out for Clinique’s “purity patrol” fleet, carrying commuters around London, Manchester and Birmingham in air-purified rickshaws from 19-21 July.

When I saw that a giant statue of Jeff Goldblum in sweaty, semi-naked repose had been unexpectedly erected near Tower Bridge, my pulse did not quicken. My palms did not bead with sweat. My desire – for a new Facebook display picture, or otherwise – did not pull me compulsively towards the Thames. I was left cold by “Sexy Jeff Goldblum” – which is not to say I am left cold by Jeff Goldblum. I have a pulse, and a formative memory of him attempting pick-up artistry on Laura Dern from the back of a Jeep in Jurassic Park.Online appreciation for his sultry turn as Dr\u0026nbspIan\u0026nbspMalcolm in that film has seen Goldblum go from cult figure to fully realised sex symbol in recent years, with many memes made of his open-shirted form. It is as the “chaos theorist” that Goldblum appears rendered nearly 10ft (3m) tall and 23ft long on the South\u0026nbspBank. “Jurassic Jeff”, a stunt by Sky’s subscription service Now TV to mark the 25th anniversary of Steven Spielberg’s blockbuster, has received adulatory coverage since it was installed last week. Goldblum himself awarded it the highest of accolades: “1010\u0026nbspGOLDBLUMS”.I’d put it at two or three, at most. Viewed most generously, Jurassic Jeff is a totem to the female gaze, a modern riposte to centuries of women being put on pedestals. It is also no small physical feat, reportedly having taken more than 250 hours over six weeks to construct. But ultimately, it is a publicity stunt, and a very successful one at that.That may be enough for many to enjoy the statue at bare-chest value and “bask in its nonsensical glory”, as someone put it on Twitter. But some defining images of our time have been advertisements (and some defining artists advertisers). Its commercial imperative is no reason not to ask what Jurassic Jeff and the rapturous response to it says about popular culture. And, Goldblum fan though I am, I would argue it’s nothing good.It does not comment on or subvert the sly and often surreal use of Goldblum’s image at the centre of his cult online following it just reproduces one of its main symbols. The statue is nothing more than a meme made manifest, a one-note statement that says: “Hey, you’ve seen this on the internet!” We should ask for more, even of our publicity stunts. Weeks of construction aside, it is lazy, the result of mining the internet for ideas and lifting them wholesale. Yet Adweek hailed it as an “instant classic”.Jurassic Jeff represents a tired extension to the life cycle of a meme, which – one could fairly argue in light of the $25 T-shirts printed with “big dick energy” on them – was already longer than what could be considered tasteful or humane. Once, memes began their lives in an online subculture such as 4chan, Reddit or Tumblr and ended them weeks or months later on Facebook, where they’d wash up, spent, to await the final blow: being shared by your mum, or a police force page.Today the final resting place for an internet joke is the South Bank, or on the side of an apartment block, immortalised in a public space. I’m regrettably reminded of the work of Lushsux, an Australian Banksy aspirant who has made his name with large-scale reproductions of internet culture. Which is to say, he paints a meme on a wall. Apparently he calls it “memefiti”.Like Jurassic\u0026nbspJeff, Lushsux’s paintings – of Kim\u0026nbspKardashian’s naked selfie, Taylor Swift, one-hit viral wonders such as Harambe the gorilla and the “Cash Me Ousside, Howbow Dah” woman from Dr Phil – often generate media coverage, creating a banal feedback loop: meme is born online, injected into the world, and returned whence it came in the form of breathless news stories. At one point of 2016, entire walls of Melbourne’s famous street-art alleys were given over to spray-painted memes: crying Michael Jordan, Arthur’s clenched fist, approving Drake.Online, these memes are used widely but deliberately, to communicate meaning – barely repressed devastation, simmering anger, permissiveness and denial – in an infinite variety of contexts, from relatable everyday observations to principles of urban planning. On a wall, they say nothing. Corporations co-opting symbols and subcultures is nothing new, but it’s particularly self-defeating in the case of memes, which are self-perpetuating and, fundamentally, fleeting. Their meanings are mutable – look how the lovable downbeat Pepe the frog cartoon was moulded into a symbol of hatred by the alt-right, even as its creator launches a legal challenge to prevent it. Digital culture is rich and nuanced, and has the potential for real-world impact. It deserves to be dug into and engaged with meaningfully, not just skimmed off the top for a punchline.But, in part because of the social media chatter and column inches generated by large-scale, facile stunts such as Jurassic Jeff, these hollow displays of cultural literacy are everywhere – in Hillary Clinton tweeting at Trump to “delete your account”, hashtags on everything, a book deal for Grumpy Cat, a TV show developed from a Twitter account, and a modern language reduced to a “contemptible and manipulative” film.How to record internet culture poses a challenge for today’s archivists, but lifting it wholesale, without context or analysis, benefits no one (bar, often, the corporations). Landing memes writ large on the Thames reflects a flattening of culture, a subtext-free call and response. We see Jurassic Jeff, we recognise him from the internet, and we send him back there on our Instagram stories and Facebook feeds.Better to give our attention to art and spectacle that actually mean something, and leave memes in their natural habitat online, to live, morph and – eventually, thankfully – die.• Elle Hunt is a commissioning and communities editor with  Cities"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/adb65bfb73578400d5c4f4ae73fb7a334f733f9d/0_4_2362_1417/master/2362.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2838dfff11938d2fe6b51bd3fa5e8ba7","title":"snake oil medicine politics andrew wakefield","story":"There is a classic Mitchell and Webb sketch in which two doctors working in a “homeopathic A\u0026ampE” treat a patient who has just been hit by a car. “Get me some wolfsbane, also known as monkshood, in here!” shouts Webb over the gurney. “And a whole tray of flower remedies!” Mitchell winces: “Oh … his chakras are fading. He needs some crystals.” Webb responds: “Nurse – fetch me some purple-tinted quartz! All right, make that aquamarine quartz!”The dialogue is as funny as it is because it parodies a form of delusion and superstition that – far from fading – is gaining traction at a deeply alarming pace. Pseudoscience is nothing new, but its scale and proliferation most definitely are. And the consequences are real and frightening (full disclosure: I am a trustee of the Science Museum Group). Last week, a study by scientists at Yale University of 1,000 patients with breast, prostate, lung or bowel cancer showed that those who used so-called complementary treatments were twice as likely to die as those who did not. The study, published in the journal JAMA Oncology, concluded the primary reason for this was that the subjects seeking “alternative” cures were more likely to delay or refuse conventional cancer therapy.Meanwhile, it has been reported that Andrew\u0026nbspWakefield – a disgraced doctor whose claims that there is a link between vaccines and autism have been comprehensively and repeatedly discredited – is dating Elle Macpherson, an Australian businesswoman and supermodel. Though not of much scientific importance in itself, this liaison symbolises the appalling success with which Wakefield has turned his academic infamy into a form of celebrity. Struck off as a medical practitioner in the UK, he has reinvented himself in the US as a populist guru and protector of children, fighting the wicked establishment of the pharmaceutical companies, government and supposedly corrupt doctors.The extraordinary spread of pseudoscience chimes with the spirit of the age: expertise, once a claim to authority, is now often regarded as a liability. The medical research community is increasingly distrusted as just another mendacious elite seeking to control the more open-minded public. Not surprisingly, social media has been the principal engine of change, weaponising bogus medicine, fakery and charlatanism of all sorts. Conspiracy theorists scuttle over the web, encouraging disdain for conventional medical practice and (most recently) alleging that what we call science is just another western “social construct”.And fighting back is not straightforward. William\u0026nbspDavies argues in his brilliant forthcoming book, Nervous States: How Feeling Took Over the World: “Phoney science can be demolished. The problem is, it takes time.” The scientists are making a complex case, the pseudoscientists merely mobilising opinion and appealing to public sentiment by digital means.I don’t want to close down spas, ban herbal tea and charcoal balm, stop people buying botanical products or enjoying reiki. Many modern pharmaceuticals have their roots in ancient herbal treatments: the precursor to aspirin, for instance, was found in willow tree leaves. But as Tim Minchin has joked: “Do you know what they call alternative medicine that’s been proven to work? Medicine.”Once again, the gag captures a genuine peril. What so many pseudoscientists and champions of “complementary medicine” do is to undermine trust in treatments that are actually effective – with terrible real-life consequences. Since Wakefield’s campaign began, the incidence of measles has risen appallingly, with many losses of life. The Yale study should give pause to every person who, hearing that a friend or loved one has been diagnosed with a tumour, is minded to send them a leaflet about an amazing new diet, or tell them a story about the aunt of a neighbour of a colleague who was “cured” by a shaman in Streatham.It is a particular irony in the case of cancer that, precisely at the moment that pseudoscience is on the rampage, we stand on the brink of a historic breakthrough in oncology. I recently met a cancer specialist who refers to himself as an “algorithmist” because his work entails the development of super-specific drug treatments, computerised protocols based on genetic mapping. Immunotherapy and related practices should soon turn what is all too often a terminal disease into, at worst, a chronic condition like diabetes. It is hard to exaggerate the potential benefits to humanity that may lie in the not-too-distant future.The catch, of course, is that such treatments will require funding, and lots of it. But researchers I have spoken to say the challenge will be one not only of regularised resources, but of public education. A decade from now, the traditional trinity of surgical resection, radiotherapy and chemotherapy will look very old-fashioned. As cancer treatment becomes more complex – a lot more complex – it will be ever more important that patients have some idea of how to navigate these new shoals.Yet modern culture loathes complexity. Populism – the claim that there are easy answers to difficult problems – is surging around the world. Build a wall, leave the EU, ignore doctors: this is the high season of snake-oil salesmen selling bogus tonics off a cart to punters who crave an easy solution to problems of great subtlety and nuance. The desire for simplicity is a natural human instinct. Confronted by the kaleidoscopic multiplicity of contemporary life, we heed those who promise to make everything better with the flourish of a wand. But one of the tasks of true leadership – in all fields – is to explain that simplicity is not always possible, decreasingly so.It is part of the maturation of our species that we accept that immigration is not the cause of our social ills, that the Earth is not (as a growing number of people believe) flat, and that carrot juice absolutely cannot cure cancer. It is time to put aside childish things."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fde237f595d8ac4d4db85e52f3fabd4ab0b46019/0_0_3035_1819/master/3035.jpg?w=940\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ecf159082ad30fca20b4dd0f535c9d96 940w","title":"denver nuggets where to eat and drink in colorados capital","story":"From the best pizza to the finest brewpubs, if there’s a restaurant or bar worth knowing in the Mile High City then chances are that local food doyen Kade Gianinetti has tried it out.

Go-to order: the clam pizza.SpuntinoTheir food is incredible, but it’s super-passionate owner Elliot Strathmann’s knowledge of digestifs and aperitifs that makes Spuntino. He has a vintage collection of spirits, and if you’re nice enough to him he’ll let you sample some really old Italian amaros.Ratio BeerworksThis is an awesome microbrewery, with a beautiful patio right on Larimer Street.

And they sell house-made sausage.Hop AlleyChef and owner Tommy Lee knows what people like and delivers it in a really creative way. It’s traditional Chinese food served family-style, but he pushes people’s boundaries at the same time by the end of your experience, you’ve tried something new. It’s a really fun night out in Denver.Amethyst Coffee CompanyOwner Elle Taylor does a great job – her coffee shop is a representation of how she sees the coffee community and what she supports.

That they are not more widely known is partly because the amount of money going to schools for pupils under 16 was protected until 2015. Only by taking into account large reductions in spending on sixth forms, and by local authorities, was the independent Institute of Fiscal Studies able to present a more complete picture of the budget pressures faced by schools, in a report this\u0026nbspmonth.Damian Hinds had only been education secretary for a month when his Labour shadow, Angela Rayner, reported him to the UK Statistics Authority for making the incorrect claim that “real-terms funding per pupil is increasing across the system”. The mistake was corrected, and six months into the job Mr Hinds has now recognised not only that school budgets are being cut, but that such cuts are unsustainable and destructive. Last Friday he told the  he is fighting for additional funds from the Treasury amid ongoing negotiations about a pay rise for teachers, who have fallen behind those in other developed countries as public sector pay has been squeezed under the government’s austerity programme.Mr Hinds is correct that there is a “special case” to be made for school funding because educating the next generation is so important, and his frankness about problems, including teacher workload and exam stress, is welcome. Chancellor Philip Hammond should pay more attention to his measured bid than to recent grandstanding by the defence secretary, Gavin Williamson, who is similarly eager to secure a bigger budget. Teachers should get a pay rise not only because they deserve one, but because schools are dealing with a recruitment and retention crisis, with the Ofsted chief, Amanda Spielman, among those highlighting the risk of experienced staff “burning\u0026nbspout”.It is a relief that the focus has shifted to the more urgent problems confronting schools across the country. But the promise to let grammar schools expand, and allow free schools to operate highly restrictive admissions policies, must not be forgotten. Austerity has caused serious problems in education. But so has the government’s ideological, market-based approach, with its explicit drive to create winners and losers, and drive improvement through competition rather than cooperation. Free schools, and in particular studio schools, have been a fiasco, while the academies programme has consumed vast resources and failed to deliver.The flagship coalition policy of the pupil premium meant poorer and more vulnerable children were offered some protection from these effects. Recent rises in exclusions and “off-rolling”, whereby children are voluntary removed at a school’s urging, along with cuts to special needs provision and moves against inclusive education, show the extent to which such protections have been stripped out, while the extent of mental illness and unhappiness among young people is deeply worrying. Mr Hinds may have grasped some of the problems facing schools. But he has offered no solution."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9459756478f7cdd6cc74168386e779759a65158/697_764_4487_2692/master/4487.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=86058e54703d1539aba2106d165151a6","title":"earths resources consumed in ever greater destructive volumes","story":"Study says the date by which we consume a year’s worth of resources is arriving fasterHumanity is devouring our planet’s resources in increasingly destructive volumes, according to a new study that reveals we have consumed a year’s worth of carbon, food, water, fibre, land and timber in a record 212 days.As a result, the Earth Overshoot Day – which marks the point at which consumption exceeds the capacity of nature to regenerate – has moved forward two days to 1 August, the earliest date ever recorded.To maintain our current appetite for resources, we would need the equivalent of 1.7 Earths, according to Global Footprint Network, an international research organisation that makes an annual assessment of how far humankind is falling into ecological debt.The overshoot began in the 1970s, when rising populations and increasing average demands pushed consumption beyond a sustainable level. Since then, the day at which humanity has busted its annual planetary budget has moved forward.Thirty years ago, the overshoot was on 15 October. Twenty years ago, 30 September. Ten years ago, 15 August. There was a brief slowdown, but the pace has picked back up in the past two years. On current trends, next year could mark the first time, the planet’s budget is busted in July.While ever greater food production, mineral extraction, forest clearance and fossil-fuel burning bring short-term (and unequally distributed) lifestyle gains, the long-term consequences are increasingly apparent in terms of soil erosion, water shortages and climate disruption.The day of reckoning is moving nearer, according to Mathis Wackernagel, chief executive and co-founder of Global Footprint Network.“Our current economies are running a Ponzi scheme with our planet,” he said. “We are borrowing the Earth’s future resources to operate our economies in the present. Like any Ponzi scheme, this works for some time. But as nations, companies, or households dig themselves deeper and deeper into debt, they eventually fall apart.” In the past, economic slowdowns – which tend to reduce energy consumption – have also shifted the ecological budget in a positive direction. The 2007-08 financial crisis saw the date push back by five days. Recessions in the 90s and 80s also lifted some of the pressure, as did the oil shock of the mid 1970s. But the overall trend is of costs increasingly being paid by planetary support systems. Separate scientific studies over the past year has revealed a third of land is now acutely degraded, while tropical forests have become a source rather than a sink of carbon. Scientists have also raised the alarm about increasingly erratic weather, particularly in the Arctic, and worrying declines in populations of bees and other insect pollinators, which are essential for crops.

His free-kick was fired in from the left, Eric Bailly found space and a stooping header pinged off JT Marcinkowksi’s bar.The defender should have scored and United came close seconds later. This time Sánchez strolled through the middle and fed Tahith Chong but the 18-year-old’s back-heel was cleared.While Sánchez was finally starting his pre-season following a visa issue, Antonio Valencia’s afternoon lasted six minutes, the captain being removed for Matteo Darmian with what looked to be a calf problem.As Sánchez continued to buzz around, all of this meant a bright start for those inside Levi’s Stadium, home of the San Francisco 49ers.The problem was the empty seats. A venue that holds up to 75,000 appeared around only a quarter full despite the official number given. This followed the half-filled University of Phoenix Stadium for Thursday’s 1-1 draw with Club America. When United played Real Madrid here last year and Barcelona three years ago the venue was a virtual sell-out.After Florian Jungwirth clattered Sánchez – drawing a yellow card – Luke Shaw suffered a nutmeg by Nick Lima that led to a free-kick. This yielded nothing as did an Anthony Martial run when he was clear in on Marcinkowski.Along with Sánchez, James Garner, Chong and Joel Pereira were Jose Mourinho’s other changes from the opening tour match. Garner, another who is 18, made one intervention near his area.At the other end United offered up a sequence of slick interplay that had Sánchez to the fore, alongside Andreas Pereira in midfield who was sharp and tenacious.Eight minutes before the break United forced a second corner. Pereira swung the ball in from the right, finding Garner’s head, but the youngster could not direct the shot. By the break the Earthquakes had proved feisty opponents, with Sánchez and Pereira being roughed up. The pair were among United’s better players, Sánchez in particular illustrating his class by running the contest via a cocktail of pace and verve.Lee Grant, Timothy Fosu-Mensah, Axel Tuanazebe, Scott McTominay and Juan Mata were the manager’s changes for the second period as he reshuffled the frontline to have Sanchez playing central, Martial on the left, the Spaniard to the right.Mikael Stahre changed all of his XI and Mata’s first contribution was to cede possession needlessly to Jackson Yueill in midfield. When United’s No 8 made a diagonal run from his right-hand berth Sánchez found him and Mata, from inside the area, tried to turn the ball back into Martial. He failed but this was a clever United move that will have pleased Mourinho.So, too, the goal-line clearance an alert Fosu-Mensah made to clear Vako’s shot as United were split open for virtually the first time.It was Vako who next stood up a free-kick for Yeferson Quintana to beat a clutch of defenders and head at Grant, the keeper making a low save.When Sánchez went off he was replaced by Mason Greenwood, the 16-year-old operating at centre-forward for United in only a second appearance. On the afternoon’s evidence Sánchez had not suffered from missing the Club América match while waiting for US Immigration to grant his papers for travel.United were bound to dip with his departure and Grant had to pull off a flying save from a shot from 25 yards by Tommy Thompson, the No1 tipping over the bar. Finally McTominay was offered a gilded chance to claim victory but his close-range header from Greenwood’s cross was disappointing.Antonio Valencia was forced off after six minutes due to what appeared calf strain.Mourinho said: “He’s injured. We need to get used to it. Last season he was already in this kind of situation and probably this season we’re going to have more of that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16b82038e8fd159785126510f00ddd2e07688191/79_300_1228_736/master/1228.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6c00095c175de6bf9e88ac799289e72a","title":"jose mourinho manchester united improve harry maguire","story":"• Manager now wants to reinforce centre-back position• Full-back is no longer a worry as Diogo Dalot can coverJosé Mourinho believes the acquisition of Diogo Dalot in the summer window has bolstered the position of full‑back enough for him to switch focus to signing a central defender with Harry Maguire a potential target.Mourinho’s decision is significant as he said that both the left-back and right-back positions needed improving for United to be credible title contenders this season.Having bought only Dalot, who can operate on both flanks, for £19m from Porto, the manager has decided he can trust Antonio Valencia and Ashley Young as first‑choice full‑backs with Dalot and Luke Shaw providing competition.The 19-year-old Portuguese is virtually untested, having only made his senior debut last season, and Shaw’s career at United remains unconvincing with both manager and player recognising the upcoming campaign is his last chance to prove himself. Valencia and Young are converted wingers who will be 33 when Manchester United’s league campaign begins against Leicester City.Demetri Mitchell, 21, can also play at left-back and may be given a chance to establish himself in the squad. Timothy Fosu-Mensah, a right-back, is expected to go on loan again, having spent last season at Crystal Palace.Mourinho’s choice to prioritise buying a centre-back underlines his uncertainty of Chris Smalling and Victor Lindelöf, while Phil Jones is prone to injury. Maguire impressed during England’s run to the World Cup semi-finals and would cost a minimum of £50m before any add-ons if he was to be prised away from Leicester.Mourinho believes the 25-year-old’s technical attributes would offer a fresh impetus to United’s ability to initiate attacks from defence."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db395978ad1bef6be6669cfdb44a7f3404226ea4/0_0_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d7191d7d497e289ecf55b6246e348002","title":"france croatia final trophy russia 2018 ends on high world cup football daily","story":"Max and co discuss France’s World Cup final triumph over Croatia, another penalty, another controversial VAR incident, the tournament’s highs and lows and players taking shots to the conkers"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8b06010c491cea933679ba0c6b18cc8a8bd59f89/0_597_5191_3115/master/5191.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=16c3e1d99234b1a22c91f08592fb37a3","title":"liverpool borussia dortmund live friendly international champions cup","story":"Christian Pulisic scored twice as Borussia Dortmund beat Liverpool 3-1 in their pre-season friendly in Charlotte as Joël Matip was forced off with a reported muscle tearJürgen Klopp has said the injury that forced Joël Matip off during the 3-1 defeat to Dortmund was not a repeat of the thigh injury that forced the defender out of action for months. “It’s not the same injury.

Things like this can happen, but you don’t want them to.“Maybe tomorrow or the day after tomorrow we will know more, but in this moment we only know that it was too painful for him to carry on.”Virgil van Dijk headed Liverpool into the lead after 25 minutes in Charlotte, but several changes for both sides, including the introduction of Dortmund winger and US international Christian Pulisic, changed the course of the game.Pulisic earned and converted a penalty after 66 minutes and despite Liverpool creating more chances and dominating possession, grabbed victory for the German side in the 89th minute, finishing well from a quick counter-attack.Loris Karius’s struggles in goal for Liverpool continued, and his weak save from Pulisic in stoppage time fell to Jacob Bruun Larsen, who completed the scoring.So to sum up what we’ve learned ...More seriously, Liverpool will surely be able to put things together when they bring in reinforcements. Including that new keeper. Dortmund may be depending on Pulisic, which is both a thrilling prospect and a frightening one.That’s a wrap. Join us for the rest of the International Champions Cup over the next couple of weeks.If you care about the result of this game and support Liverpool, you will be quite disappointed. If you care about having the most possession in the midfield and attacking third because it’s just preseason, then you might be happier if you’re a Liverpool supporter.90 min +4: Pulisic gets the ball again on the right and puts a cross past the far post. Overhyped.And it’s Pulisic again, easily turning Moreno and ripping a shot at Karius, who can only parry it to Larsen. Gomez rugby-tackles Larsen, but the Dane still gets the foot in for the easy tap-in.Shocker for Liverpool here. They’ve dominated. But Pulisic has had two opportunities, and he turned the first into a penalty that he converted. The second capped a quick Dortmund counter in which the young American ripped a shot from the top of the box into the low left corner.85 min: Sturridge wins a corner. Liverpool play it short and win another corner. Gomez gets a head to Milner’s strong ball into the mixer, but his shot is straight at Hitz.84 min: Dortmund finally get back into the attack, maybe for the first time since Pulisic’s goal. Larsen settles the ball nicely but can’t thread a pass through the recovering Purple Monsters.83 min: Dortmund impressively keep the ball away from the Liverpool press, but they can’t get past midfield and eventually run out of patience, launching a dull ball forward.Keita then arouses the ire of the crowd with a little kick on Pulisic. Not a good idea.81 min: The new Liverpool man Keita AGAIN creates problems for Dortmund on the left side of the box, this time winning a corner. Nothing interesting follows.Also, to correct misinformation from earlier -- Karius is still in. So Liverpool have TWO players available on the bench. They are, however, both goalkeepers.79 min: Long break to tend to injured Dortmund player Dzenis Burnic. Dortmund have more players available. Liverpool only have a goalkeeper.77 min: CHANCE. Solanke plays a beautiful through ball to ... Moreno? He gets a foot to it, but it’s an easy save.The stats say Liverpool have outshot Dortmund 7-3. But they also say Christian Pulisic has yet to enter the game and has scored anyway. He’s THAT good.75 min: Replay of a few minutes ago, with Keita doing some promising work in the box and teammates failing to do anything substantial with the ball.Liverpool have a man down but play on. It’s Sturridge.71 min: Water break. Did we mention that it’s hot? 69 min: Milner takes a free kick for Liverpool that Solanke might have gotten with his head if only he were eight feet tall.No problem for the American teenager, who puts it down the middle over Karius’ feet. The score is certainly against the run of play, but the fans in Charlotte are surely happy to see what they came to see.After waiting patiently for his teammates to get him the ball, Pulisic takes matters into his own feet and dribbles into the box. Foul, PK.64 min: CHANCE! Woodburn rips the ball away from Sergio Gomez, who comes up holding his arm. Sturridge puts in Ojo for a one-on-one opportunity, but Hitz deflects the ball onto the crossbar.61 min: Keita gets into the box on the left and creates some danger, winning a corner. Milner ends up with the ball and lifts the ball to the far post for Solanke, who outleaps the defense and heads it back across the goal, neglecting to get it forward and into the net.Nathaniel Phillips is NOW in for Nathaniel Clyne. That was reported earlier but has just happened.59 min: Dortmund are playing possession football, in the sense that they are watching Liverpool possess the football. Sturridge, who has drifted to the right from the left, finally takes an ambitious shot from 24 that skips well wide.Gomez, Gotze, Schmelzer, Larsen, Bockhorn, Burnic, Pulisic, Pieper, Isak. And two more. Presumably including a goalkeeper.Milner, wearing the Liverpool armband, shoots just over the bar from 28 yards out.52 min: Liverpool did indeed replace 10 of 11 players at the half, and one (Gomez for the injured Matip) was already changed. The current lineup: Grabara in goalGomez, Klavan, Moreno, PhillipsMilner, Keita, OjoSturridge, Solanke, Woodburn50 min: Nothing has happened yet, but let’s round up some Liverpool subs:Supposedly Sturridge and Ojo are in as well. Sturridge certainly is, making a good surge with the ball on the left and centering to teammates who should’ve done better.One interesting move: Young goalkeeper Kamil Grabara replaces Loris Karius for Liverpool.Subbed in on the right as the second half starts.No official word yet on substitutions. Has anyone ever considered using the old Who song Substitute for the second-half walkout music of a friendly? No? Liverpool spend most of stoppage time passing the ball in their own half.Email me or tweet at me as you like, but I will be spending most of halftime trying to keep up with all the incoming substitutions."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83d62eaecf8a705ebb0a1a574e5c0f6e1e4de3d2/0_413_4000_2399/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af4422d59ad1310e25b22c71f7d126a3","title":"social media and celebrity culture harming young people","story":"Young people’s mental health damaged by ‘unobtainable’ body image in online worldAirbrushed photographs of celebrities with perfectly preened bodies staged in exotic locations are all over social media, but such flawless images have been described as damaging for the way they pressurise young people to meet unobtainable body-image standards.Most children own a smartphone by the age of 10, and this has in turn led to increasing pressure on youngsters to look perfect in their online lives, a study has found. Denise Hatton, the chief executive for YMCA England and Wales, said: “We’ve all been guilty of only posting our most flattering pictures on social media. While there’s nothing wrong with wanting to show yourself from your best angle, it’s important that we still like ourselves when we’re not looking our best, which is probably the majority of the time for most of us.”The charity has joined Dove, the health and beauty products company, for its Be Real Campaign, which is asking people to sign up to its body image pledge, IPledgeToBeReal.It urges social media users to stop editing their pictures and to hold brands and organisations responsible for not promoting healthy body images and ersity.Hatton said: “Today’s beauty standard is completely unobtainable, leading us to constantly feel bad about our bodies and looks. This is particularly the case for young people and it can have serious effects on their mental and physical wellbeing.“It’s time to take back control of how we feel about our bodies and celebrate our real self so that everyone can feel confident in their body this summer and beyond.”Increasing numbers of academic studies have found that mental health problems have soared among girls over the past decade, coinciding with the period in which young people’s use of social media has exploded.Dr Bernadka Dubicka, the chair of the child and adolescent faculty at the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said last year: “There is a growing crisis in children and young people’s mental health, and in particular a gathering crisis in mental distress and depression among girls and young women.”Dubicka said social media such as Snapchat and Instagram “can be damaging and even destructive” to girls’ mental wellbeing. “There’s a pressure for young people to be involved 247 and keep up with their peer group or they will be left out and socially excluded.”Social media use has also contributed to a increasing sleep deprivation among young people, which could both be a symptom of mental illness and also raise the risk of it developing, she added."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/604ad61332ee65d3e71133edb0c19babc8d1b298/0_73_1732_1039/master/1732.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f60de76ef032bd89e591f3b5996cc427","title":"the plays the thing five fabulous audio dramas not to miss this summer","story":"With audio content exploding in popularity, a raft of gripping stories told by multiple narrators is just a few clicks away. Coco Khan picks out some of the bestA conversation can speak volumes and in the world of audio dramas, they often do. The audio drama – a piece of fiction told using several voices – is in the midst of a renaissance. Previously consigned to rare radio slots on rainy Sundays, audio dramas are now ubiquitous, buoyed by audience tastes for podcasts, and attracting some of the world’s most exciting writers and actors.These are professional, high-quality productions – think Netflix for your ears. And like Netflix, Audible has begun commissioning original audio dramas, making them free for members, putting an end to the bottleneck in which many creatives vie for one radio slot (and a broadcaster therefore has to pick the one with broadest appeal). Audio dramas run the gamut, whether you want a tear-jerking tragedy, an edge-of-your-seat thriller, or a heart-fluttering romance. With such variety, they make for perfect accompaniments to your summer holidays, whether you’ve got a long-haul backpacking trip planned, or a short and swift city break lined up.But with so many options, where do you begin?We picked out five of the best audio dramas from Audible, so you don’t have to. All you have to worry about is whether or not you can resist binge-listening your weekend away.The Child “My name is Simon. I’m 10 years old. I’m a serial killer.” So begins Sebastian Fitzek’s chilling tale of a boy who claims to have killed in a previous life. Set in Berlin, the story follows the child and the only people who believe his cryptic utterings – his mother and a lawyer she has hired. But when Simon’s knowledge leads to several bodies being discovered, the police start to suspect the lawyer. He must solve the crimes before the police put him in the frame, no matter what it takes. Fitzek is one of Germany’s most lauded crime-thriller writers and has seen his work translated into 20 languages. His talents are at their height in this intricate, spine-tingling adaptation. The fabulous narrators include Emilia Fox (Polanski’s The Pianist) and Rupert Penry-Jones (Spooks).Northanger Abbey If audio dramas are having a renaissance, Northanger Abbey might be the Sistine Chapel. A slick, star-studded adaptation of Jane Austen’s classic, this ambitious production has redefined audio storytelling – which is to be expected, given the cast. National treasure and Bafta award-winning actress Emma Thompson tops the bill, bringing Austen’s dry wit to life, while supporting performances from Lily Cole and Jeremy Irvine elevate the series to GOAT (greatest of all time) level. This coming-of-age story follows 17-year-old Catherine Morland through love, danger and intrigue, satirising the gothic tales that were popular at the time of writing, while taking a shrewd look at the British class system. Such skewering of high society feels as fresh as ever. Even those put off by historical drama will find joy in this.Neverwhere Nobody anticipated the impact the BBC’s 2013 adaptation of Neil Gaiman’s cult novel by the same name would have. Broadcast over six days, the production was a smash hit with Gaiman fans and non-fans alike, propelling the audio play into the public eye and showing just how exciting the form can be. Download to listen to Benedict Cumberbatch, David Harewood, James McAvoy and Natalie Dormer telling the story of Richard Mayhew, the unassuming Londoner who finds himself in London Below, a magical version of – and coexisting with – the real city, known as London Above. Originally conceived as a television series, Neverwhere lends itself to episodes, and so its separation into six parts feels natural and seamless. And on Audible it includes over 25 minutes of additional unbroadcasted material, including extended scenes, bloopers and outtakes.Rudyard Kipling’s The Jungle Book: The Mowgli Stories One for the slightly older kids (and also the parents), The Mowgli Stories brings together all of Kipling’s tales about the boy raised by animals in the jungle. Though the average listener might think they know all there is to know about Mowgli from the much-loved Disney film, his adventure takes many more twists and turns. This retelling of the timeless classic stays true to Kipling’s darker side and the well-known cast, including comedian Bill Bailey and actors Richard E Grant and Celia Imrie, make this one unforgettable audio drama. A must-listen for anyone who has seen the film, and a brilliant, truthful, introduction to the work of Kipling for those who haven’t.Locke \u0026amp Key One of Audible’s first forays into commissioning original audio dramas is still among the most ambitious undertakings the form has seen. Locke \u0026amp Key began life as a graphic novel – so translating the form from highly visual to solely audio was no small feat. To do so, Audible drafted in Locke \u0026amp Key’s creators, Joe Hill and Gabriel Rodriguez, to ensure the adaptation stayed true to its dark, terrifying roots. And it worked, assisted no doubt by the voice of scream queen Tatiana Maslany (Orphan Black) and Haley Joel Osment of “I see dead people” fame. Locke \u0026amp Key follows a family who, starting over after a tragedy, set themselves up in a quiet town that is also frequented by demons. A sharp production that will have you jumping out of your skin and sleeping with one eye open.Your first audiobook is free with a 30-day trial from Audible - £7.99 a month after 30 days.

That position is echoed in Berlin and Paris, among other EU capitals.Article 50 can only be extended by the unanimous agreement of the 27 other member states, and on the request of the withdrawing state, which May has already said she is not prepared to do.On Friday, Barnier picked apart the UK’s white paper, complaining that it would leave the EU open to fraud and burden European businesses with extra bureaucracy.He told reporters he had offered to hold intensive talks with the new Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, to find a solution to the problem of avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland, without which there will not be a withdrawal agreement. understands that during a meeting of EU ministers with Barnier on Friday, astonishment was expressed at May’s comments in Belfast earlier in the day in which she accused the EU of seeking to constitutionally and economically “dislocate” the UK.“We want to de-dramatise this, talk it all down, and so there was surprise at the aggressive tone,” one diplomat said. “It just gives her even less room for manoeuvre. If she wants to give up, she should just say so.”But while the negotiations have rarely looked so in danger of failing, senior EU officials and diplomats do not see any purpose in an extension to article 50, the two-year negotiating period set aside for a member withdrawing from the union, unless there is a change in British politics that can offer genuine hope of a better outcome.“If it is time just for the sake of putting off an inevitable no deal, then it will not happen,” one senior diplomat involved in the negotiations said.Charles Grant, the director of the Centre for European Reform thinktank, said that following his discussions with French government officials and the commission it was clear that a high bar would be set for an extension.“If there is a very good reason for it, then fine,” he said. “But if it is just because a deal hasn’t been agreed, then that’s not going to be fine. The commission and the French government say they are relaxed about a no deal, although I am not sure they are.”The issue had yet to be formally discussed among those involved in the EU-UK negotiations, but informal discussions suggest there is limited appetite for such a development, sources in Brussels added.“You have 27 member states who have to agree to it and I can’t see them all doing so. There will always be someone who is awkward, and wants something out of it. Spain might want to make a point about Gibraltar, for example,” said one diplomat involved in the Brexit negotiations.“We have spent the GDP of Greece in terms of manpower in trying to first of all keep the Brits in and now negotiate on their exit. Even if the UK asked for it, and that seems unlikely, it would need a compelling reason to be given.”Mujtaba Rahman, a former Treasury and European commission official, and now head of Europe for the Eurasia Group risk consultancy, said: “An extension can’t be an end in itself. It would need to come with political change in Westminster, a referendum, change of leader or general election, otherwise negotiations would risk remaining deadlocked. That’s the view of the commission, the European council, Berlin and Paris.”Rahman said the European parliament would be opposed to an extension as it would play well for European populists, including Ukip, who could point to the failure of the political classes to respect the 2016 referendum result.Officials in the parliament have taken legal advice, which suggests that extending article 50 beyond the next European elections in May would not only give 73 British MEPs a right to sit in the chamber until the UK leaves but for the full five-year term.Asked about the possibility of an extension of article 50, a senior British cabinet source said there had been no conversations within the government on the topic. He added that ministers were aware that such a request would likely prompt a collective “cardiac arrest” among leaders of member states."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/740e7c639c686198606dee304d857ec70b3e26d8/0_390_5772_3466/master/5772.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ccd50516aa3f68343053ea965fbf746d","title":"labour should drop action against margaret hodge mcdonnell","story":"Jeremy Corbyn defends inquiry into Hodge for calling him antisemiticLabour should drop its disciplinary inquiry into Dame Margaret Hodge for calling Jeremy Corbyn an antisemite, the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has said.As Corbyn defended the inquiry, McDonnell, his close friend and ally, said that if it could not be abandoned, the Hodge investigation should be resolved very quickly because it was best to “move on”.“Sometimes you can express anger – I’m one of these people who has in the past – and basically you have to accept that sometimes people can be quite heated in their expressions. Let’s understand that and just move on.”Hodge called Corbyn an “antisemitic racist” in an angry row in the House of Commons on Tuesday after Labour’s national executive committee refused to abandon a controversial new code of conduct on antisemitism. The code features the internationally accepted International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition of antisemitism, but does not replicate in full a list of examples of antisemitism published by the IHRA alongside its definition.After Hodge made the comment, a spokesman for Corbyn said it was unacceptable and that action would be taken. This provoked anger from Corbyn’s critics in the party, not least because Hodge, a former minister and former chair of the public accounts committee, is a respected figure.McDonnell told Sky: “Someone has made a complaint so that’s being investigated. My view is let’s resolve this very, very quickly, almost drop the complaint, and let’s move on. Or if someone wants their complaint investigated, let’s get that done quickly.”Corbyn took a less conciliatory view when he was asked about the Hodge incident in an interview at the Tolpuddle Martyrs festival in Dorset.“I felt not pleased about it,” he said. “I felt upset about it, but as always I am very calm and treat people with a great deal of respect. I don’t shout at people, I just listen to what they have to say.“A complaint has been registered and that will have to be dealt with by the party, but that is independent of me.” Labour’s code of conduct includes a section listing only some of the examples of antisemitism published by the IHRA alongside its definition. The four missing examples are: accusing Jewish people of being more loyal to Israel than their home country claiming that Israel’s existence as a state is a racist endeavour requiring higher standards of behaviour from Israel than other nations and comparing contemporary Israeli policies to those of the Nazis.But Labour says it is wrong to say that these examples have been left out, because all of them are covered by other parts of the code. For example, there is a section that specifically states: “It is wrong to accuse Jewish citizens of being more loyal to Israel, or to the alleged priorities of Jews worldwide, than to the interests of their own nations.”At a meeting of the parliamentary Labour party on Monday some MPs and peers are planning to push an emergency motion saying the PLP should adopt the full IHRA definition of antisemitism, “including all of its accompanying examples”, in what would be seen as a rebuke to Corbyn.The Labour leader said he hoped the debate would be delayed until the autumn because, with the summer recess starting on Tuesday, attendance might be limited.“I’d rather they delayed that discussion until September because there will be a full attendance at meetings in September,” he said. “I also think MPs should get full notice of that issue, but obviously the parliamentary party is quite free to debate it but, as with all functions of the Labour party, ultimately, standing orders must be approved by the national executive committee and that cannot happen until the autumn.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d250079751d1ee89e3daf134b579ddceb545d61/0_358_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=97e68ebdd9c7568b99194c38424d3390","title":"thats when i lost my temper ash sarkar on her clash with piers morgan","story":"The activist who confronted the Good Morning Britain presenter talks about her fears over Brexit, the future of communism in Britain and her passion for SpursWriter, lecturer and activist Ash Sarkar, 26, grew up in north London and got two degrees at UCL. She is now senior editor at radical leftwing website Novara Media, focusing on race, gender, class and power. Footage went viral last week after she appeared on ITV’s Good Morning Britain to discuss the Stop Trump march, telling presenter Piers Morgan: “I’m literally a communist, you idiot.”How is your newfound fame?Surreal. I’m punch-drunk but still alive. Before, I’d maybe get recognised a couple of times per week now it’s most places I go. What if I’m really hungover and gross one day? Or having a PMS cry on the bus? But everyone’s unerringly lovely and just wants to chat about politics, which is encouraging. It shows there’s a real desire for engagement and conversation that doesn’t treat people like they’re stupid.Do you think there’s a trend towards shouty, adversarial media?Yes, although there’s a huge contrast between Newsnight, where you can make a point clearly, and Good Morning Britain, where you’re entering a bear pit to get savaged. Piers Morgan and the production team have tacked quite hard towards the alt-right. A leftwing Muslim woman is like throwing chum to them.How did you feel when Piers Morgan kept talking over you?He kept trying to pin me down on Obama’s presidency, even though I’d come on to talk about Trump, with the presumption that I was a diehard Democrat. That’s when I lost my temper. I hadn’t planned to call him an idiot or go in hard about his journalistic record. I was just frustrated with being barracked for something I’m not.Have you had more TV offers?Celebrity Big Brother asked me to go on. I said, “Listen, there are much easier ways to see me get drunk, alienate people and have an ill-advised dry hump. Just find me on a Saturday night out.” I could become a tap-dancing poodle in the culture wars, but is that going to get more people participating in politics or just make me a discourse clown?Do you feel you should capitalise on your higher profile?It’s not about personally profiting I want people to support the media organisation I work for. Since Good Morning Britain, I’ve had lots of emails from weird men asking if I can “fin-dom” them – financially dominate them by spending all their money. It’s unsettling, so I’ve been replying with the link to our donations page. We’re selling “I’m literally a communist” T-shirts to help keep the studio running.It was also on placards at the Stop Trump march. How was that?I bumped into some of them. This is what people have been missing: politics shouldn’t be about the dour cultishness and pomposity that dominated the left for decades – it should be joyful and exuberant. Your Twitter bio uses the phrases “anarcho-fabulous” and “luxury communism”. Can you explain?It’s partly poking fun at how people accrue adjectives and put them in their bios as if they’re a meaningful badge. But also, my communism isn’t about authoritarian bureaucracy, suppressing freedom or everyone wearing burlap sacks. It’s about the desire to see the coercive structures of state dismantled, while also having fun. It’s not about driving everybody down to the same level of abjection, but making aesthetic pleasures and luxuries available to all.How do you envisage communism working in 21st-century Britain?As a long-termist, I acknowledge there are more pressing causes than the abolition of private property. This is why I’m a Corbyn supporter. We have the opportunity for a socialism that says austerity is a deliberate political choice. We can more equitably distribute wealth through taxation. We can borrow to invest in housing, railways and healthcare, making them publicly owned and managed assets. That’s what we’ve got room for in this country right now. Communist vision can help guide that and give people a say in every decision that affects their lives.Is it possible to support Corbyn but still feel betrayed by him over Brexit?I voted Remain but the cost of losing twice would be catastrophic. It would make life difficult for people of colour or anyone perceived as an immigrant. If you want any hope of staying in the EU, or having a Brexit that doesn’t mean capitulation to ethno-nationalism, you’ve got to tie it to a wider vision of political and economic transformation. Which, at this point, means backing Corbyn.You’re a big football fan, right?Huge. I’m a diehard Spurs supporter who gets her heart broken again and again. I love terrace culture, the flow of the game and those moments of beauty like Zidane’s volley where you just think: “That is God speaking through you, my son.” I became obsessed with Jordan Pickford during the World Cup. Mainly how he looked like Thomas Turgoose from This Is England.Is it true you’ve never knowingly kissed a Tory?Absolutely. I make it my business to check. I give them a reading list before a first date, then maybe we can go to Wetherspoons.What will you say next time you get the call from Good Morning Britain?New phone, who dis?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c680b8014f92cae91c35e71fefc6ef067d62f1c8/0_150_2947_1768/master/2947.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=833346030b17c9fa271ab86c6f412372","title":"vince cable denies plotting new centrist party","story":"Lib Dem leader refuses to give details of ‘private discussion’ that led him to miss key votesThe Liberal Democrat leader, Sir Vince Cable, has denied he was discussing the creation of a new anti-Brexit centrist party at a private meeting on Monday that led to him missing tight votes in the House of Commons.He also ruled out joining or merging with another party, and said he had repeatedly warned those disillusioned with the current political parties that the UK’s first past the post electoral system makes setting up a new party “often suicidal or silly”.But, in an interview on Pienaar’s Politics on BBC Radio 5 Live, Cable refused to discuss who else attended what he described as “a confidential private discussion”, or exactly what they talked about.Attending the dinner on Monday meant Cable missed two votes on Brexit legislation, each of which the government won with majorities of just three. Tim Farron, the former Lib Dem leader, was also absent.It is understood that no MPs from other parties, and no donors, were at the dinner, where Cable and others were engaged in a wide-ranging discussion on how Brexit was contributing to a realignment in UK politics – an issue of particular interest to the Lib Dem leader.In his interview, Cable said reports claiming the creation of a new centre-ground party was discussed at the dinner were “not correct”. But he defended talking to people in other parties, saying it was “part of the job”.Without going into details of what was discussed, Cable said he was sceptical of the case for setting up a new party.“It’s much better to work constructively with people in other parties.”Asked if he would ever join a new party, he said he would not “because I’ve got a very good party of my own which is winning some of the key arguments”. But he said he was in favour of parties collaborating, as the Lib Dems and the Greens did in Richmond, his local council, where they struck a deal over seats at the local elections.Cable said his priority was to work with other parties to stop Brexit but that in the longer term he expected to see a realignment of politics.He continued: “The tensions building up in the Labour party and the Conservative party are so severe that it’s difficult to see them surviving in their present form, and we have to think ahead a little bit. And my party will play a key role in whatever happens.”In his interview, Cable described as “ridiculous” claims that his leadership of the Lib Dems was at risk. Some Lib Dem activists are reportedly planning to discuss replacing Cable at a meeting this week, but Cable dismissed the notion that his position was under threat, saying this was “the last thing” he was worried about.“Unlike Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn for different reasons, I’m in the fortunate position of having a united, cohesive team of people,” he said. Under his leadership, the party was going forward, he said.“It’s not spectacular, but I think we’ve made very good, solid progress, and my colleagues recognise that. And we’ve had record levels of membership which has held up and is still growing, as far as I’m aware. So it’s a good story.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce333ac5da6ba5c4078a61643d38df24eaeee850/0_191_1470_882/master/1470.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0e81904985f4e476bf59f146a2c56426","title":"theresa may takes chequers brexit roadshow north east","story":"Prime minister sets off on summer tour to gain public support for Chequers planTheresa May will chair a cabinet meeting in the north-east of England as she starts a summer campaign intended to gain public support for her much-criticised Chequers Brexit plan.The visit on Monday is intended primarily to show the government’s ongoing support for the “northern powerhouse” concept, and May will confirm that up to £780m is being set aside for a pre-planned east coast mainline upgrade and that the “North of Tyne” devolution deal is to go ahead.But the prime minister is also intending to use the visit to defend the Brexit proposals that polls suggest are deeply unpopular with Conservative supporters and the public at large.On Sunday, as some high-profile Conservatives suggested a second referendum might be the only way to resolve national isions about how to handle Brexit, the former Brexit secretary David Davis used an interview to say that there would have to be a “reset” in the autumn when the government would have to abandon Chequers and start again.With the Commons recess starting on Tuesday, May will not face any more parliamentary challenges until the autumn. But the government is supposed to reach a deal with Brussels on EU withdrawal by October, and the compromise plan agreed by the cabinet two weeks ago is finding little support in Brussels or in parliament.The Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, on Sunday accused Brussels of being irresponsible for flagging up the risks to EU nationals living in Britain from a no-deal Brexit. He said a document published by Brussels last week that highlighted the risk of the UK leaving the EU without an agreement was “obviously an attempt to try and ramp up the pressure”.In an interview on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show, Raab said the UK was preparing for all eventualities, and that more information about the planning would be made public later in the year in a series of “technical notices” the government would publish.He did not deny a report saying that the contingency plans included a proposal to turn a 10-mile stretch of the M26 in Kent into a lorry park.In the EU’s 17-page paper for member states urging them to intensify preparations for all eventualities published on Thursday, it highlighted what a no-deal Brexit would mean for citizens. “There would be no specific arrangement in place for EU citizens in the UK, or for UK citizens in the EU,” it said. Asked specifically about the issue, Raab said: “Well, I think that’s a rather irresponsible thing to be coming from the other side. We ought to be trying to reassure citizens on the continent and also here.”Monday’s cabinet excursion to the north-east will be followed be series of meetings cabinet ministers are holding with their European counterparts over the summer, largely focused on promoting the UK’s Brexit proposals. Jeremy Hunt, the new foreign secretary, will be in Berlin on Monday, and he said in advance that he would be telling the German foreign minister, Heiko Maas, “that our European partners must show much more flexibility and creativity in negotiations if we are to avoid a ‘no deal by accident’ scenario”.In an interview with the Sunday Express, Davis, who resigned earlier this month because he could not support the Chequers deal, said that he thought May would have to abandon the plan in the autumn and try something different.“We’re going to have to do a reset and come back and look at it all again. What we mustn’t do is leave everything on the table and offer something else on top,” he said.“One of the traditional tactics of the EU is to say: ‘OK, but not enough’ and pocket what they’ve already been given. We can’t allow that. We’ll have to say: ‘Sorry, if that deal’s not enough then it’s no longer available’.”Davis said t at that point the government should draft its own plan for a free trade treaty with the EU, incorporating “the best bits” from existing EU free trade treaties. He said that he would not expect the government to welcome this “Canada plus, plus, plus” approach (so-called because it would be modelled on the EU-Canada free trade deal) now but that “come the autumn, we’ll be in a different position”.He also said the government should accelerate planning for the UK having to leave the EU with no deal, trading on World Trade Organization terms. He accepted that this would generate problems, but said: “They’re likely to last months rather than years.”In an interview on the Marr Show, the former Conservative prime minister John Major said that leaving the EU with no deal would be “a terrible betrayal of the interests of everyday people who really are not political”.Showing limited enthusiasm for the Chequers plan – “it isn’t what I would have preferred to see, but it is a compromise” – Major also talked up the case for holding a second referendum as a solution to the government’s Brexit dilemma. “Frankly, a second vote has democratic downsides. It has difficulties. But is it morally justified? I think it is,” he said.In a separate interview, Dominic Grieve, one of the leading pro-EU Tory MPs, said he thought a second referendum “may be the only solution”.Speaking at the annual Tolpuddle Martyrs festival in Dorset, Jeremy Corbyn said he thought Tories who favoured a no-deal Brexit were now dictating policy in the Conservative party, and that the country would suffer as a result.“I just get the feeling that the tail is wagging the dog in the Conservative party and those that want no deal seem to be ruling the roost and they are pushing for that,” the Labour leader said.“No deal would be a very, very bad situation and no deal would be a very bad deal because we then go on to World Trade Organization tariff rates that would hit the manufacturing industry and hit the food processing industry and hit an awful lot of things in Britain very rapidly. I believe there has to be serious stepping up of negotiations to reach an agreement on customs and on trade.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7dc5e24831612dc128c7f348f124abfce0aca669/32_104_1968_1182/master/1968.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2045c9a553fcff2a44e883d4b4d8e308","title":"starwatch red marvel that is a lunar eclipse","story":"Most of the world has a chance to see the moon change colour at the end of the weekA total lunar eclipse will be visible over most of Europe, Asia, Australia and South America on 27 July. Only North America misses the show this time.During a total lunar eclipse, the moon passes through the Earth’s shadow. Once totally immersed, it turns to a deep red colour. This glorious sight occurs because of the way sunlight bends (refracts) through the Earth’s atmosphere. The blue component of sunlight is scattered all over, which is why the sky looks blue to us, but the red light is refracted, which directs it behind the Earth and onto the Moon. The eclipse starts before the moon rises in the UK. This means that Earth’s shadow will already be crossing the lunar surface when the moon climbs above the south-eastern horizon about 8:50pm. Half an hour later, the moon will be at the midpoint of the eclipse and it will turn red. By 10:15pm, it will be leaving Earth’s shadow.

The theoretical aim, for which there was general support across the political spectrum, was to simplify the system and increase the incentives for people to move off benefits into work.The project was legislated for in 2011 under the auspices of its most vocal champion, Iain Duncan Smith. The plan was to roll it out by 2017. However, a series of\u0026nbspmanagement failures, expensive\u0026nbspIT blunders and design faults\u0026nbsp means it is six years behind schedule and rollout will not be complete until 2023.The original design set out\u0026nbsp a\u0026nbspminimum 42-day wait for a first payment\u0026nbspto claimants when they moved to UC (in practice this is often up to 60 days). After sustained pressure, the government announced in the autumn 2017 budget that the wait would be reduced to 35 days from February 2018. This will partially mitigate the impact on many claimants of having no income for six weeks. The wait has led to\u0026nbsprent arrears and evictions, hunger (food banks in UC areas report\u0026nbspnotable increases in referrals), use of expensive credit and mental distress.\u0026nbspMinisters have expanded the availability of hardship loans (now repayable over a year) to help new claimants while they wait for payment. Housing benefit will now continue for an extra two weeks after the start of a UC claim. However, critics say the five-week wait is still too long and want it reduced to two or three weeks.Plenty.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMultibillion-pound cuts to work allowances\u0026nbspimposed by the former chancellor George Osborne mean UC is far less generous than originally envisaged. According to the Resolution Foundation thinktank, about 2.5m low-income working households will be more than £1,000 a year worse off when they move to UC, reducing work incentives. Landlords are worried that the level of rent arrears accrued by tenants on UC could lead to a rise in evictions. It\u0027s also not very user-friendly: claimants complain the system is complex, unreliable and difficult to manage, particularly if you have no internet access. And there is concern that UC cannot deliver key promises: a critical study found it does not deliver savings, cannot prove it gets more people into work, and has plunged vulnerable claimants into hardship.Mistakes and delays can add on average an extra three weeks to the formal 35-day wait for an initial benefit payment, pushing claimants into debt, rent arrears, and reliance on food banks. Campaigners warn that the problems could get worse next year when more than 3 million claimants start to be “migrated” to the new system.Growing concern over universal credit, which is six years behind schedule but will eventually handle £63bn of benefits going to 8 million people, is matched by disquiet over what critics say has been a defensive and insular approach to managing welfare reform by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP).The department came under withering fire last week from a cross-party group of MPs who accused it of a “culture of indifference” after it had repeatedly ignored warnings of basic process errors that led to 70,000 disabled benefit claimants being underpaid an estimated £500m over six years. The work and pensions secretary, Esther McVey, sought to limit the damage in a speech on Thursday in which she admitted there were problems with universal credit, and promised to listen to campaigners, claimants and frontline staff to find ways to change and improve the system.One whistleblower said many of the design problems with universal credit stemmed from the failure to understand claimants’ needs, especially where they lacked digital skills and internet access. “We are punishing claimants for not understanding a system that is not built with them in mind,” he said.The DWP said it would not comment on the whistleblowers’ specific claims but insisted the system was being constantly improved. “Universal credit is a flexible and responsive benefit and we continue to listen to feedback and make any necessary improvements during the rollout with our test-and-learn approach.Bayard Tarpley, 27, who left the Grimsby service centre last week after two years as a telephony agent, told the  that he had been dealing with distressed claimants every day. “My hope is that by speaking out I can help explain why these processes have such a significant, harmful impact on claimants.”To help us further understand the issue, we\u0027d like to hear from people who have experience working with universal credit claims or claimants.

Officials are told to advise claimants who are in hardship and who do not qualify for cash advances to contact charities or their council for help. Many councils have closed local welfare provision as a result of cuts. A second whistleblower, Joanne Huggins, who was until recently a case manager at the Grimsby centre, said that high staff caseloads and a high volume of calls to the service made it difficult to keep track of and prioritise claimants’ problems. “The system is set up in such a way that people don’t get support,” she said.At least £1.3bn has been spent since 2010 developing universal credit. Although it is heralded as a streamlined digital replacement for the existing benefit system, a recent National Audit Office report concluded it was still in many aspects unwieldy, inefficient and reliant on basic manual processes.The DWP says it operates a “test-and-learn” approach to constantly improve the system, although the whistleblower said in his experience staff suggestions were ignored and “top down” adjustments tended to follow media or political controversies, such as the scrapping of call charges on universal credit helplines.Mark Serwotka, the general secretary of the Public and Commercial Services union that represents DWP staff, said: “The findings from the whistleblowers are in line with the ongoing feedback we get from our reps and members who struggle to deliver a service to universal credit claimants in the face of mounting cuts and increasing workloads.”Citizens Advice said its research showed that a “significant minority” of claimants faced additional waits for payment because of the complicated application process. The 10-stage process took some claimants over a week to complete, even with expert help.“Top of the government’s list should be simplifying the process and making sure adequate support is in place so that a claim can be completed as quickly as possible,” said the chief executive, Gillian Guy"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f1a1f4e2a21ab0f0dcbb8c1e6b6f7879b313d7f/0_38_4773_2865/master/4773.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fd1d18b22937966cfeddf12fe06786f1","title":"confident german grand prix win would stand lewis hamilton","story":"Lewis Hamilton revealed he was confident after his meeting with stewards following the German Grand Prix that his race win would stand, as they investigated the incident on which his victory had turned in Hockenheim.Hamilton won after a remarkable drive from 14th on the grid, but the British driver had to wait more than two and a half hours for his victory to be confirmed.The pivotal moment in the race came under the safety car prompted by Sebastian Vettel’s crash. Hamilton’s Mercedes team called him in and then out of the pits and the British driver opted to trust his instincts and stay out, veering from the pit entry and cutting the line separating it from the track. He could have received a time penalty for the offence which would have cost him the win.“It’s not going to be taken away,” he said after he had been summoned to the stewards but added that it had been a difficult end to an exceptional race. “No one wants to go and see the stewards, they have the hardest job but this has been an unbelievable day,” he said. Shortly afterwards his win was confirmed in a statement from the FIA.He was issued with a reprimand with the stewards’ decision based on three mitigating factors: that Hamilton admitted the mistake and it had occurred because of confusion in communication that it was during a safety car period and that no other competitor was put at risk by the manoeuvre.The moment was vital: had he pitted he would have lost track position and the victory would have gone. “It was a confusing second and a half,” he said. “I thought I was going to stay out and they said ‘come in’. I said: ‘Are you sure?’ and then they said: ‘Stay out.’”He was also particularly proud of coming back after a trying weekend. “Today is one of the most unbelievable days for me.

The latest incident was reviewed by race commissaires after the stage finish in Carcassonne, who then disqualified him. The race commissaires said Moscon had been disqualified for “particularly serious aggression”.After the incident in April 2017, Moscon was warned about his behaviour and Team Sky said that “any repeat will result in termination of his contract”. In a statement on Sunday night Sky accepted the commissaires’ decision, apologised for the incident and said they will investigate the matter futher at the end of the Tour. Thomas, meanwhile, had expected to enjoy a quiet rest day in Carcassonne, with only a brief ninety minute ride, and an afternoon lying in bed. “Every day in the peloton is stressful’ Thomas said after Sunday’s finish, “so it’s nice not to fight for a day.” Now however, the hostility towards Team Sky seems certain to increase.Aside from the usual flurry of boos, stage 15 was uneventful for the 2018 Tour’s race leader. Ahead of Thomas and the other main contenders, a breakaway move climaxed with victory for Denmark’s Magnus Cort Neilsen in his first Tour de France, and completed a successful weekend for his Astana team, which also won Saturday’s stage to Mende. But yet again the atmosphere on the road towards Thomas and his fellow Sky team members was poisonous. Further criticism from across the French media rained down on Sky over the weekend, targeting in particular Thomas and his teammate Chris Froome.“It’s not a nice situation because this is a highlight of my career,” Thomas said of the continuing hostility towards him. “It’s a massive honour and a privilege to be wearing the jersey and it’s been an incredible race so far. There’s obviously been a bit of negativity which isn’t nice, but you have to stay strong in your head and crack on.“The way I see it, I would rather be in this jersey, having the race of my life and getting booed for whatever than being dropped on the first climb and everyone cheering you.”Meanwhile, the outcome of the race is still in the balance, but the reception of the locals to the prospect of another Team Sky success is no longer in doubt. Effectively there are two races being run side by side, one focusing on the leadership intrigues at Team Sky and the other arguing that this Tour, tainted by suspicion and spectator hostility, represents a new low point in the popularity of the race.While French television coverage preserves, through gritted teeth, the myth of camaraderie and celebration, the Twitter feeds of leading riders tell a different story, as do the declining TV ratings.“What I saw from the fans on the final climb towards Team Sky was disgraceful,” the Australian rider Luke Durbridge said after Saturday’s stage to Mende when Froome was showered with an unknown liquid. “If you don’t like cycling don’t come to watch.”“Obviously we would prefer everyone to love us,” Thomas said, “but I’m not sure it’s anything we’ve done – or especially that I’ve done – to deserve it. You would have to ask the public, and maybe it’s a reflection of the way we’re perceived in the French media.”The first Pyrenean stage on Tuesday will surely test the legs of all the major contenders, but it is the 65-kilometre mountain stage to the Col du Portet on Wednesday that is most likely to turn the screw.“For sure they are hard stages,” Thomas said. “A lot can still happen. I’m expecting a big fight on Tuesday and some long-range attacks. The 65km stage is up down, up down and then up. It’s two and a half hours of full-gas racing. I might seem close to Paris in days, but look at all the climbs and racing we’ve got to go. So I’m keeping my feet on the ground. There are three big, big days to come.”There was little real action among the overall favourites on the road from Millau to Carcassonne, beyond a lone sortie from Dan Martin and an impetuous move on the descent of the Pic de Nore from Romain Bardet.Thomas was dismissive of Martin’s attack. “It was 40km to go from the top but it didn’t make much sense really. The wind wasn’t enough to do anything but it was a bit of stress.“Bardet tried on the descent which was a bit crazy. We just made sure we were in front. The last 15 kilometres were a bit of stress with the wind, but we were always in the right place.“Days like today you want to try and recover as much as possible,” Thomas said, while insisting that final victory in Paris had not crossed his mind. “I take it day by day and just worry about the next stage, the next climb and keep going.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6eb074e7c74ebb065feaadf9cb019e52f790aba0/0_84_2944_1767/master/2944.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ffe876fe246ffb9daa887223ac126012","title":"the open 2018 report francesco molinari","story":"Open championships at Carnoustie have developed an association with the grisly elements of golf. The last time the oldest major was staged here Sergio García was reduced to tears following play-off defeat by Pádraig Harrington. The Open of 1999 will for\u0026nbspever be synonymous with Jean van de Velde’s 72nd‑hole capitulation.Francesco Molinari has the hardly insignificant consolation of the Claret Jug as a household accessory, given he may now be portrayed as the man who killed Santa Claus and the Tooth Fairy in a single gory act. Stewart Cink, who triggered sighs when ending Tom Watson’s epic Open quest in 2009, is unburdened now.For so long on Sunday afternoon one of the most extraordinary stories in golf was playing out. Tiger Woods, amid his latest comeback from personal and professional trauma, led the Open. Suddenly it was oh so real.That the 42-year-old could not complete the claiming of a 15th major, a decade after number\u0026nbsp14, owed more to Woods hitting the self-destruct button than the landing of body blows by the understated Molinari but there was still despondency in the Carnoustie air. There was not even the marquee backup option of success for Rory McIlroy or Jordan Spieth to soften the blow. Look what you could have won.None of this, of course, should take away from Molinari’s latest and biggest triumph. His accuracy under the most extreme of pressures was robot-like. The fact he played in the company of Woods when hitting a bogey-free 69 should only heighten appreciation of the 35-year-old’s achievement. Molinari’s home city of Turin is typically famous for cars. Italy has a well‑versed passion for football. Another sport has delivered a new national hero it can only be hoped this is properly recognised.It was odd, in a way, that Molinari’s eight‑under‑par success came by the relatively comfortable margin of two shots. This had been a tense final day played in whipping winds, distinctive early on for how many players had the top of the leaderboard within view. McIlroy, Justin Rose, Xander Schauffele and Kevin Kisner shared second.Rose’s weekend showing – he signed off with a 69 – was terrific. He had knocked in a lengthy birdie putt on the 36th hole to survive the cut by one. Two days later he stood with wedge in hand in what bore endearing similarity to his Open debut 20 years ago. Rose holed his approach shot at Birkdale here, he played the iron to tap-in range. “It brought back memories for sure,” Rose admitted. “I was thinking, ‘Can I do it again?’ I very nearly did.”Drama attached to Woods had started with his birdie at the 6th. Moments later Schauffele and Spieth dropped shots Woods was within one of the lead. At 25 minutes to five Woods was the solo leader. He later played one of the shots of the tournament, from a hazardous fairway bunker on the 10th to within 20ft of the hole.The 11th was to prove Woods’s Carnoustie nemesis. Missing the green to the left should not have been a disaster but his attempted flop shot could not reach the putting surface. The double bogey left eight players within a shot of the lead. Woods played the closing stretch in level, his 71 and five-under aggregate enough only for a tie for sixth with Kevin Chappell and Eddie Pepperell, who revealed he had started day four with a hangover. Pepperell duly produced a 65.A year ago it was doubtful whether Woods would play competitive golf again. A decade ago he would never have failed to press home the advantage he earned here. “I’m a little ticked off at myself,” he conceded before leaving Scotland.McIlroy’s Sunday was in neutral before the kind of special moment that so often separates him from the rest. The Northern Irishman converted a 70ft eagle putt at the 14th, which suddenly catapulted him into a six-way tie for the lead. With an hour to play the championship was wonderfully hard to call.McIlroy does not really have cause to rue a birdie chance at the last which slid agonisingly past, given Molinari finished two ahead of him anyway. McIlroy belied a few myths during the week relating to his supposed inability to contest at firm venues, windy venues or when the rain batters down. McIlroy was happy to turn immediate attention to praise of Molinari. “He is a fantastic golfer and a great guy,” the 2014 champion said.Spieth, who started day four in a share of the lead, was derailed by a double bogey at the par‑five 6th. The Texan had to take a drop after landing his second shot in a bush. The defending champion did not collect another shot thereafter, with a bogey at the 15th all but ending his hopes of retaining the Claret Jug. Spieth’s 76 – the highest score of any player in the last eight Sunday groups – slid him back to tied ninth. Spieth was clearly irked at being warned for slow play by tournament officials, midway through his last round. “I think I played the fastest golf I’ve probably ever played while contending in a tournament,” he said.Thomas Bjorn, Europe’s Ryder Cup captain, led the immediate tributes towards Molinari, a player now guaranteed to form part of the home contingent in France this year. “Is he a man or a machine?” asked Bjorn of Molinari. After five major successes in a row for American players, this was a boost to a golfing continent. Molinari stepped firmly out of Woods’s major shadow not many players can lay claim to that. Brillante, Francesco."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/143780333c85c99dea28d3fdf857740f123616e9/930_589_2760_1656/master/2760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e7db08d25584a581917a3ae6360c1741","title":"can you do comedy about natalie palamides thinks so edinburgh best newcomer","story":"The LA comic, who won best newcomer at last year’s Edinburgh fringe, has tested her electric new material on American audiences.

Who could have foreseen that the buzziest comedy in 2017 would come from an unknown LA actor making performance art about fertility, parental anxiety and eggs? But so it proved.

But not because, as per the cross-dressing cliche, she felt liberated by posing as a different gender. “It’s not about ‘getting away’ with certain things,” says the Pennsylvania native, “because I pretty much do anything on stage anyway.” It was more that she wanted to explore “love, relationships and masculinity” from a male perspective, and knew there was comic mileage in satirising casual sexism. But the show had teething problems, that Doctor Brown – real name Phil Burgers – helped her overcome. “I was dancing around the subject of consent,” she says, “because I was scared. I was really frustrated. Finally Phil was like, ‘What do you really want to do?’ And I said, ‘I want to put rape into the show.’ I didn’t want to trigger anyone or handle it the wrong way, though. But it needed to be in there.” And so, having tried out the material in front of LA audiences, she added a new strand about Nate’s adventures in sexual consent. I’m sworn to secrecy about how that all pans out on stage. But, given the current climate, and bearing in mind the brutal, brittle brilliance of Laid, it is likely to be electric.She insists, however, that this isn’t “issue comedy”. It’s a bit like Laid, she explains. In that show, Palamides hatched from a giant foam egg and spent most of the show frying her “babies” and eating them. “It’s really dumb and stupid and fun,” she says. “It’s important for comedy to speak to issues, while providing the relief that everything’s going to be OK. I want people to leave laughing.”They probably will: Palamides built up a lot of audience love in Britain last summer – and the feeling is reciprocated. Having grown up in a country where improv is practically the national sport (Palamides is well versed in it), she finds the LA crowd rather too keen to join in. “I prefer British audiences. They are more patient and allow me to guide them through it, rather than having someone who’s too excited to play with me on stage.”Another reason why Edinburgh appeals is its tradition of hour-long creative comedy, which Palamides prefers to the quick-hit standup culture of LA. “My set is very different to everything else that is going on there,” she says. “It always throws a little wrench in the works. Which is fun.” But not so lucrative that she can give up her sidelines: starring in a regular insurance ad on TV, and a voiceover gig on popular tween cartoon The Powerpuff Girls. Asked about her more long-term career plans, Palamides says: “Eeeugh! I don’t know what I’m going to do. I would like to make my own TV show. But often I think, ‘Oh jeez, who’s going to want me?’ That’s why I have to make my own stuff.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/240adff64e0a7bdcb56c72a15ee67f922c7e9ca5/0_30_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d76c4354cf25218c84e5c81b66125157","title":"tim minchin lands new tv series upright the show ive been waiting for","story":"The Foxtel-Sky UK production will follow two misfits and a cherished piano on a road trip across AustraliaMusician, writer and comedian Tim Minchin – the creator of Matilda: The Musical – has added a new string to his bow, landing a starring role in his first TV series, Upright, which will begin shooting in South Australia and Western Australia in October. A co-production between Australia’s Foxtel, Sky UK and production company Lingo Pictures, the series – a buddy road trip comedy starring Minchin and teenager Milly Alcock – was created by Chris Taylor of Australian satirical team The Chaser. It has a writing team that includes Minchin, Taylor and actorwriter Kate Mulvany, and will be directed by Please Like Me’s Matthew Saville.Upright follows Lucky Flynn (Minchin), a gifted pianist in Sydney who is “broke, distant and damaged” and “whose talent for music is matched only by his talent for self-destruction”. When he learns his mother is dying on the other side of the country – in Minchin’s hometown of Perth – he hires a car to drive the 4,000 kms with his only prized possession: a battered upright piano. On his way, he runs into a “tough-as-nails teenager” played by Milly Alcock, from Janet King and High Life, “who we soon discover has plenty of scars and secrets of her own”. Minchin moved back to Australia at the beginning of 2018 following a year in the US that he described as “unbearable” in an interview with the . He had moved to LA four years earlier to make a $1m film that was scrapped in March 2017, and a few months later Groundhog Day: The Musical – the follow-up to his smash-hit stage adaptation of Matilda – closed early on Broadway.Minchin has performed sporadically in Australia since his return, and had a part in the ABC’s comedy series Squinters, but Upright, which he is also executive producing, marks his first major move since returning to home soil.“From the moment I heard about the idea for Upright, I knew it was the show I’d been waiting to make,” he said of the series. “I like stories that make me laugh and think and cry, I adore the landscapes of outback Australia – and I love music and homecomings, and characters full of flaws.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42c7d848eedfeb44c7e06037f475ea94d3934b90/0_374_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=688ff991c0d1b41024eb36bbe607ea5f","title":"why donegal is the coolest place on the planet","story":"The long-overlooked north-west corner of Ireland has finally started getting its dues. In 2017, Donegal even topped National Geographic’s list of the coolest places on the planet. Anna Hart rounds up the 10 best things to do on a Donegal road trip Ireland’s most rugged and ravishing county has been a much-loved retreat for artists, bohemians, outdoorsy types and holidaying families for decades, but it’s only now that the rest of the world is waking up to the charms of traversing Donegal by car. Dramatic, secluded beaches, craggy coastlines, soaring peaks, shimmering lakes, verdant valleys and time-warp harbours – all dotted with atmospheric country pubs and quaint seafood restaurants – recently propelled this north-west county to the top of National Geographic Traveller’s Cool List. “It’s a warm-hearted place, but wilderness always feels just a stone’s throw away,” says National Geographic Traveller editor Pat Riddell. “And it is wilderness – world-class wilderness.” It’s definitely the coolest place on the planet right now if you’re a Star Wars fan. The region’s Inishowen peninsula was spectacularly showcased in Star Wars: The Last Jedi, with Malin Head being used to represent bits of Luke Skywalker’s isolated retreat, planet Ahch-To. This only added to the buzz around this long-overlooked corner of Ireland, further embellishing its hip credentials and making it the stuff of road-trip dreams. If you’re taking your car to Ireland by ferry to explore the attractions of Donegal, make sure you hop out at the following must-do spots.Sink a pint at McGrory’sUnassuming but atmospheric, 1920s family-run McGrory’s hotel in Culdaff has long been a local favourite, thanks to its open fires, a dazzling range of Irish craft beers and traditional music sessions. So much so that Daisy Ridley and the Star Wars crew had a night out there around filming, leading to a steady stream of Star Wars-struck visitors. Making the most of the welcoming atmosphere and seafood-heavy menu is now even more of a must.Swap four wheels for two While Donegal rewards road-trippers with sublime coastal scenery, isolated castles, private estates and ancient forests, it’s also a great spot to jump on a bike and blast some of that Atlantic sea breeze into your lungs. The peninsula at Horn Head, forming part of Sheephaven Bay, is perhaps the most scenic of all the Donegal peninsulas, where the cliffs rise to 180 metres (600ft) on the ocean side and provide breeding grounds for seabirds such as the European shag and razorbill. The Hornhead loop can be walked or driven, but biking is the best way to drink it all in, speeding past quartzite cliffs, mud flats, dunes and the salty New Lake area, complete with exceptional views of the Atlantic Ocean.Scale Mount ErrigalThe stark, striking quartzite mass of 751-metre Mount Errigal looms as you head east on the N56 from Gweedore. This is the tallest peak in County Donegal, and along with Mweelrea, is considered one of the most satisfying climbs in the county. Alternatively, drive to the coast and take a bracing walk at the highest sea cliffs in Europe – Slieve League. They stretch 600 metres (2,000ft) above the Atlantic Ocean at the highest point, with impressive views of the rugged coastline and Donegal Bay. Lose yourself in Letterkenny With a population of nearly 20,000, Letterkenny is Donegal’s most populous town, a confident and vibrant former market town famous for gothic-style St Eunan’s Cathedral – and its Hindu temple too. Donegal County Museum, housed in a 19th-century workhouse building, is a great place to get clued up on the county’s former industrial history, and, just south-west of town, the Newmills Corn and Flax Mills have a huge working waterwheel powered by the River Swilly.Picnic at Glenevin waterfallGlenevin waterfall is found at the top of a short hike of just over a mile through the woods in Clonmany, with nicely landscaped picnic areas, footbridges and stepping stones adding to the magic of this beautiful spot. Stock up on sandwiches, quiches and sweet treats at Claire The Bakers in Carndonagh beforehand.Explore Malin Head on the Inishowen peninsulaMalin Head, Ireland’s most northerly point, offers spectacular views, and the northernmost tip, Banba’s Crown, is one of the most photographed spots in the county. Sip a flat white from the Caffe Banba coffee truck (which also has a standalone cafe in Carndonagh) and see if you can spot scenery that made an appearance in Star Wars: The Last Jedi.Take a trip to Tory IslandTory Island, just 8.5 miles off the mainland, is an island steeped in history and folklore, where Irish is spoken and the locals elect a king, who acts as the community spokesperson. Seventy-four-year-old musician Patsy Dan Rodgers has been king for two decades now, ruling over this island of 150 inhabitants, a single road, one church, one grocery store, one lighthouse, one hostel and a social club.Surf the AtlanticThe Wild Atlantic Way is studded by tiny surf towns and beaches that have become legendary among the European surf community. Bundoran is widely considered one of the best surfing spots in Europe, and is fantastic for all kinds of water sports and horseshoe-shaped Magheraroarty Strand and sand dune-backed Ballyhiernan Bay are both suitable for windsurfing and surfing. Beginners can get to grips with the sport at Inishowen, which has some of the most consistent waves in Ireland, due to its exposure to rolling swells. Its long stretches of golden sandy beaches make for safe surfing conditions and a pleasant environment for newbies.Cook your catchCatch and cook your own dinner on a fishing trip with An Duanai Mara Boat Charters, based in the fishing town of Killybegs. On these deep-sea angling trips (combined with sightseeing trips around Donegal Bay), you’ll have the chance to reel in a cod, ling or turbot, watch the skipper fillet it, and then feast on it at nearby Kitty Kelly’s restaurant.Hike Glenveagh national parkGlenveagh national park is one of six in Ireland, encompassing some 16,000 hectares in the heart of the Derryveagh mountains. These lands were managed as a private deer forest before becoming a national park in 1975, and this is now bona fide wilderness, home to a lot of indigenous wildlife and rare plant species.Explore Ireland from the comfort of your own car with Irish Ferries.

Should you step in? Parents reveal the contrasting conflicts of instant fameWhen Charlotte D’Alessio was 16 she accidentally became a social media influencer. The Canadian-born teen had recently moved from Toronto to Los Angeles with her family when, in the spring of her first year in LA, she attended the music festival Coachella with a few of her new mates.While at Coachella, Charlotte and her friend Josie changed outfits several times, taking a few pictures of themselves in bodysuits, bikini tops and jean shorts (the typical Coachella nouveau-boho uniform) and posted them on social media. So far so normal. But when the successful LA photographer Bryant Eslava took some photos of the girls and tagged them on his account, their images began to go viral. Soon the girls were seeing themselves everywhere, featured in roundups of the festival and in the “popular” galleries of Tumblr and Instagram. They were gaining hundreds and thousands of followers by the minute and being followed by strangers who’d comment “I found them!” and then tag their image to their followers in turn.For Charlotte, a quiet, studious girl from Canada with ambitions to attend UCLA, it was entirely surreal. “I was honestly freaking out,” she says. And given what happened to her life after that, it was an appropriate reaction.BuzzFeed picked up the story with the headline: “Meet the 16-year-old whose Instagram made her Coachella famous,” and by the time Charlotte returned to high school on Monday morning, she was officially a new media It Girl. Her following on Instagram soon hit 100,000 – placing her firmly in the category of “micro-celebrity” – ie someone who is famous for being famous on social media. Today, her following is more than half a million and climbing.A modelling contract with Wilhelmina Models followed soon after and within a couple of months Charlotte had decided to drop out of school to pursue a career as a professional model and social media “influencer” (the line between the two professions can be blurry at best), and continue her studies by correspondence.She was not the only one to be surprised by this sudden turn of events.Watching from London was her mother, Christina Ford, a former commercial producer who had recently moved there with her new husband. Now in her early 50s, Ford had some experience with the world of show business and had always been determined to keep both her daughters well out of it until their education was complete. After years of carefully managing Charlotte’s homework and activities back in Toronto, she found that one trip to Coachella with a smartphone had rerouted her daughter’s entire life journey. “I was stunned,” says Ford, “I tried to talk her out of it. I flew to LA, but she wouldn’t see me or talk to me. She was absolutely determined to follow it through. We didn’t speak for more than a year.”Ford recounts how during this time she couldn’t bear to monitor her daughter on Twitter or Instagram, where her following continued to grow. Tensions also arose with her ex-husband, a commercial director with whom Charlotte lived, who was much more encouraging about their daughter’s new career. Friends would alert Ford to events in her daughter’s life (like the time she got a tongue piercing), all of which were being documented forensically by way of a long series of glamorous, often scantily clad, selfies. These photos, in turn, would be instantly “liked” by tens of thousands of people, the majority of them anonymous strangers.Then one day Ford walked into a London clothing boutique and saw a floor-to-ceiling in-store advert featuring her daughter. Her eyes well up remembering the moment. “I felt like I’d lost her completely and yet suddenly she was everywhere.”So how much do these influencers actually get paid and how do their “brand partnerships” work? It’s complicated. According to the influencer analytics platform Captiv8, the numbers range from very little or contra (in exchange for free stuff) to fairly impressive – at least at the top end of the business.YouTube is the pinnacle, with the highest earners – 7m subscribers or more – able to demand $300,000 for an ongoing video brand-partnership.On Instagram and Facebook, the biggest influencers are taking home anywhere between $150,000 to $187,000 per post. And even smaller “micro-influencers” with followings around 100,000 are able to command up to $5,000 per sponsored post – a pretty good living when you add it up at the end of the day.Christina Ford and her daughter have since made up. Charlotte flew back to Toronto for her maternal grandfather’s funeral and, after many months of stormy relations, mother and influencer were reconciled. But the whole experience has still been deeply strange for Ford. She recounts how, just last summer, she picked up Charlotte and a teenage girlfriend at Toronto airport. Unbeknown to Ford, the friend was also a social media star – the YouTube singing phenomenon, Madison Beer.“They were in the back of the car, chatting away and checking in on social to say they were in Toronto just like normal teenagers, and then suddenly Madison was like, ‘Oh God, it’s Drake Facetiming us. Should I answer?’”As Ford drove on, listening to her daughter and her friend chatting away in the back seat with one of the biggest hip-hop stars on the planet, she felt the world as she knew it shifting under the wheels of her car. “I thought: OK, she’s hanging out with Drake. I guess this is for real.”Ford is not the only influencer parent to have found herself flummoxed by the reality of her child’s new status. John Rivera, father of the American YouTuber and Instagram star Brent Rivera (who has more than 10m followers on the two platforms combined) tells the story of how, before he knew Brent was famous, he took his son and his brother to a local hockey game. They were watching the game when a mother approached and asked if Brent could look up and wave at her daughter a few rows back. “My daughter’s having a birthday party,” she reportedly explained. Brent obliged and all the girls started screaming.It was then that his father knew something was up. But with overnight – even accidental – fame comes responsibility and for many influencer parents navigating the murky waters of new media, show business can be confusing at best and terrifying at worst. What sort of advice can you give your kid about building a career in a world you barely understand? And how do you protect them from the legion of creepy “manager” types who are keen to get a cut of their earnings without offering much in return?Kelly Eastwood, a London-based influencer who started her style blog the London Chatter nearly 10 years ago, says parents should be wary of anyone offering their teen representation without a proven track record. She says she has an experienced manager herself now, but that’s only after almost a decade of building her following. “It’s actually the hard work of my generation of early bloggers which has paved the way for the new wave of Instagrammers coming up overnight. We worked for many years for no money at all and these new kids are just exploding on to the scene.”It makes sense, of course. As recently as five or six years ago, Eastwood’s job description was almost a laughable concept – and now it’s industry standard. “I remember once, years ago, going to a brand luncheon and all the women there were working at magazines and when I said what I did they literally looked at me like I’d just poured toxic waste in the salad. Now those same luncheon tables are mostly filled with bloggers like me who are big on Instagram.”Eastwood says her parents have been supportive of her work, even if they don’t always fully understand it. And she’s glad she found success as a social media star later in life (in her ripe old 30s), rather than in her teens. “Everyone in this world talks about their ‘brand’, but the truth is I know my brand because I know myself. You can fall into things when you’re young because it seems fun and free stuff is on offer, but you need to actually know who you are and what you want and what you like. Also, you should see the number of offers for free plastic surgery I get – it’s terrifying.”Most adults have a pretty linear notion of what “achievement” looks like: money, power and influence. But with children, the concept is far more ambiguous. Is a child who gives up their education in favour of making money or amassing a following actually more successful than the child who thrives in school? Moreover, what sort of values does a child actually learn from experiencing overnight success – and could you even shelter them from it if you wanted to? (Answer: only if you locked them in their room without a phone until they became old enough to vote.)As Tiff Lewis, the mother of Madison Lewis (a singing star on Musical.ly with more than 2.6m fans), recently mused in an interview: “You think you’re doing right by your child, but it’s hard when you don’t know what you’re doing. She’s just on here having fun as a kid, but then you realise, well, she could make a lot of money off this. Is that a smart thing we should do? It was scary as a parent not knowing who to turn to. Then, a little over a year ago, she let management start to take over, and again I had to wonder whether that was the right move. How do you know if any of this is what’s really best?”Personal security is another serious issue for the parents of teen influencers to consider. Christina Ford says she “went crazy with worry” when Buzzfeed published the name of her daughter’s LA high school. And she’s right to be concerned.Last November, the Dolan Twins (two American teens with more than 5m followers on YouTube) tried to organise an informal meet-and-greet with fans in London’s Hyde Park. The day before, they jumped on Twitter and announced to fans where they’d be and when. Shortly after doing so, they realised it was Remembrance Day, so they cancelled the gathering and apologised – but it was too late. Thousands of teenage fans gathered at the park the following day, only to be disappointed. The angry adolescent mob then erupted into a mini-riot in which several people were trampled and injured, and the police were forced to intervene.While some parents (like Ford) instinctively want to protect their children from the spotlight, others happily step into it themselves. Inspired by his daughter’s success, Charlotte D’Alessio’s father is reportedly starting his own Instagram magazine. Other parents leverage their kids’ fanbase even further, becoming professional influencers in their own right.Greg Paul and Pam Stepnick, the super-gregarious parents of Jake and Logan Paul (two of America’s biggest teen influencers on the planet, with more than 28m followers combined), regularly appear in their sons’ videos and have amassed huge followings themselves on YouTube and Instagram respectively. Pam and Greg regularly make “reaction videos” to their son’s vlogs, take part in pranks and feuds, stirring drama into the vlogosphere – and, of course, adding to the family income. The result is an exhaustive, 247 archive of the minutiae of family life that makes the Kardashian clan look shy and retiring by comparison.You won’t encounter many profound insights into the human condition watching the Paul brothers on YouTube, but you will find a certain amount of self-referential musing on just how strange it is to be a successful teen influencer in 2018. After moving from their home town of Westlake, Ohio, to Los Angeles, the teens branched out into other media, appearing in various TV shows and films, and even starting a company called TeamDom, which aims to be a “modern-day media conglomerate focused on building powerful brands, stories, celebrities and businesses around teen entertainment and media”. Or, as Jake Paul himself put it loftily: “I want to be the Dr Dre of social media.”As time moves on, the first generation of under-age influencers is now coming of age. Today, Charlotte D’Alessio is 20, signed to a new management company and attempting to “monetise her brand”. Her first serious boyfriend, Presley Gerber, the model son of Cindy Crawford and a fellow influencer (Insta following: 601,000 plus) also helps to keep her in the public eye. Paparazzi regularly tail the teen couple around Los Angeles and elsewhere.When Charlotte came to visit her mother in London over Christmas last year, she was stopped several times on the street for photographs by starstruck teenage fans. To Ford, who recently started a blog of her own about being a North American in London, her daughter’s overnight success is still difficult to grasp. “It’s hard for me to actually believe that she’s ‘famous’ because to my mind she hasn’t really done anything yet,” says Ford. “But she’s said to me: ‘Mom, I’ve got this window,’ and I get that.”Today, Charlotte is doing some modelling, but mostly she exists in the nebulous new world of Instagram models – a global league of (mostly) attractive and uninhibited young women with a substantial online following which leverages the eyeballs of their audience in exchange for glamorous party invitations, free trips, designer clothing, accessories, make-up and beauty treatments – and, at the highest levels, actual cold hard cash.How does her mother feel about it? Ford shrugs and smiles, her expression philosophical. “She’s an adult now and it’s her life, her choice, so I respect it. But I do sometimes think about all the money and time I spent on her education and, you know, carefully selecting her lessons and activities, all so that she could just become… famous for being famous. And that’s a job? It all seems so random.”How do parents teach their kids values in the era of overnight influencers? Not very easily. But here’s to one mother for trying."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85e11c7dbe00ee43665b186629a67b5012756e92/0_260_4216_2530/master/4216.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=66b0812999f160cf0d8253a896ede2da","title":"porto portugal second city culture cafes shopping","story":"A decade ago, the city’s historic centre was badly rundown. Now, having been carefully restored, it’s filled with culture, cafes and unusual shopsSomething odd is happening in Porto’s most famous bookshop. We arrive in the middle of the morning, after a leisurely breakfast of coffee and custard-filled pastéis de nata. The queue to get inside runs around the next block. At the ticket office, where access to the bookshop can be achieved by purchasing a ticket for €5, we are assured that it will take only 30 minutes until our turn. You read that correctly: people pay €5, and wait half an hour, just to get into a bookshop.Mind you, Livraria Lello is not any old bookshop, which helps to explain the partyish atmosphere among the people waiting, with a busker playing jazz on the steps of a neighbouring department store.Built in 1906, the shop’s architecture is a startling mix of neo-gothic and art deco, with a stained-glass skylight and a red-painted twisting staircase that supposedly inspired JK Rowling when she started writing Harry Potter (Rowling worked in Porto as an English teacher from 1991 to 1993).Potter fans, leaping on this connection, were so keen to see the fantastical original that the shop couldn’t cope. The only way to deal with the flood was to charge for entry, with the price redeemable against a book if visitors choose to purchase one.Suddenly, a bookshop that was struggling with huge crowds who didn’t buy much became, in effect, a museum. And with well over a million visitors each year, a museum that is doing very nicely. It’s also caused a pleasing rebound in book sales. But it’s not the most relaxing place to browse for books: amid the swarm of visitors taking selfies and filming entire movies on their phones, it’s a bit like hoping to pause before the Mona Lisa and take your own sweet time examining Leonardo’s brushstrokes.Happily, other parts of Porto are not so overwhelmingly crowded, though locals report a massive change from around 2005 when much of the old town centre was deserted.Richard Zimler, author of the bestselling Last Kabbalist of Lisbon, moved to Porto from San Francisco with his husband in 1990. It was very different then. Today, he’s something of a celebrity here: in 2017 he was awarded the city’s Medal of Honour. Describing the enormous change the city has witnessed over the past decade, he cuts through the queue from Livraria Lello to show a colourful historic street with bunting. This street, like many others, was empty and sad until a thriving movement of pop-up shops, and a determined mayor, revitalised the city centre.Cheap flights increased the number of tourists, and large areas overlooking the beautiful Douro river, previously used by industries such as the port wine trade, became available for renovation.The department store where the busker is playing provides a beautiful example of the newly confident city. A Vida Portuguesa, housed in a 19th-century warehouse, sells an inspired edit of Portuguese products – soaps, classic toys, ceramics, linens and more. In a globalised market where it can feel at times as though all products available anywhere are exactly the same, it’s wonderful to see so many exquisite things that are utterly unfamiliar.And big brands from outside are keen to be part of Porto’s moment. The city’s grand and atmospheric hotel, Infante Sagres, has been painstakingly renovated. Next door, it has opened a Vogue Café (only a few cities around the world can boast one of these). We happened to be in town when guests arrived for the grand opening, from all over Portugal and beyond.Throughout the city, threaded together by charming old wooden trams, Beaux Arts buildings are being renovated so that new cafés and boutiques can blossom. The Majestic Café, the city’s most famous café, was saved a few years ago from decay and is now back to its former glory. Newer buildings are added with great care, such as a complex of shops entirely covered with a living roof, creating a new city park with trees.Porto is a good-looking city, its granite buildings packed into a hilly landscape, many of them decorated on the outside with azulejos, the stunning blue and white tiles that are a defining feature of this place. The entrance to the São Bento station is particularly memorable, covered in some 20,000 of these tiles depicting key moments in the history of Portugal.We wander down the recently pedestrianised Rua das Flores with its pretty balconied houses and azulejo-clad Igreja da Misericordia. In a side alley there’s a striking blue and white mural of a cat on a wall several storeys high. We stop off for a craft beer and a plate of organic cheese and salamis at the Mercearia das Flores.Here we find Claus Porto, Porto’s most famous soap brand, founded 130 years ago. Claus Porto is the brand that soap connoisseurs have bought as much for the beautiful packaging as the delicious soaps inside. The Porto shop opened last year, designed by the renowned Portuguese architect João Mendes Ribeiro. Upstairs, a museum traces the history of the brand, the distinctive wrappers redolent of the 20th century’s changing fashions in illustration.Porto is hilly but walkable. From the Infante Sagres, it’s an easy stroll through the historic Ribeira district, classified by Unesco as a World Heritage Site. Climbing through the tangle of medieval streets to the old Jewish quarter, we find ourselves on a high terrace and admire the view across the city to the Douro. On the opposite bank in Vila Nova de Gaia, huge signposts among the riverside restaurants emblazon names of the iconic port lodges: Taylor’s, Sandeman, Croft, Fonseca, Symington, Calem...Just below we find Armazém (warehouse in Portuguese), a vintage market full of fabulous antiques and a great place for lunch. Then a drink on the riverbank, which is splattered with brightly coloured houses in reds, blues and yellows. We wander across the bridge, built by a disciple of Gustave Eiffel. There’s one crossing just above the river, and another immensely higher: there can be few better places to get a sense of the city, and the powerful river.On the far side, in Vila Nova de Gaia, we look back on Porto from the terrace of the Yeatman Hotel (part of the same group that owns Taylor’s and the newly restored Infante Sagres) where we enjoy a chilled white port. Below us, extensive building work is taking place to build a World of Wine – there are to be cafés, restaurants and museum space dedicated to the history of the city of Porto, Portuguese fashion and the amazing natural material that is cork.We cross back into Porto, past the imposing cathedral, and hear the evening bells of the landmark Torre de Clerigos as we approach our hotel. We’ve time before dinner to climb the 225-step spiral staircase to the top, and catch the best view of all over the city.• Claus Porto for fabulous handcrafted soaps and skincare, plus hot towel shaves.

How did that happen so quickly? After last week’s light entertainment, things took a dark turn this week, mostly thanks to Frilly Shirt Man, who finally had his moment in the sun, after weeks of trailing his louche presence. Ross saw him off almost as quickly as he appeared, occasioning scenes so gory that even the hardy Demelza was looking queasy. Thank goodness Dr Enys is handy with implements that can pick bullets out of people’s flesh without anaesthetic.The duel was like something of out Dangerous Liaisons, with Ross as Keanu Reaves and Frilly Shirt Man as John Malkovich. I guess that makes Sindy Doll Glenn Close and Demelza Uma Thurman. Or maybe Horace the Pug is Uma Thurman. (I know it doesn’t quite match up, but humour me. I’ve lost it a bit after those hotel scenes at the beginning.) We had been allowed to forget for much of this series that Ross can be a right idiot sometimes and here his stubborn stupidity was firmly to the fore. Dr Enys was right, of course: there was absolutely no reason to duel with Frilly Shirt Man. It was known to all of London that Frilly Shirt Man was a bonkers psychopath with a death wish. And yet Ross just had to let him get under his skin, even though Frilly Shirt Man had got nowhere near Demelza (not for want of trying, admittedly).Personally, I blame the flowers. They were spectacularly beautiful. If Demelza had thrown them out, as Ross suggested, none of this would have happened. Here we returned to the central issue of Demelza and Ross’s partnership, as showcased at length in previous series: they are both as bad as each other. Yes, Demelza remained chaste, but she did tolerate Frilly Shirt Man’s attentions and she was unwilling to draw the line when Ross asked her to. Equally idiotically, Ross insisted on sulking about Frilly Shirt Man, even though it was obvious that Demelza was innocent. What a mess. My sympathies were with neither of them in the end, especially not after Demelza’s passive-aggressive note: “My wish to be friendly and polite was taken by some to mean something more. It was even taken by you to mean something more.” The two of them need their heads banged together. Maybe this was a case of the wrong two people having a duel. Prudie, find Demelza some pistols.Meanwhile, Cornwall was sorely missed in this outing, with only a glimpse of the Morwenna-Drake storyline. I thought this plot point was already exhausted and Morwenna’s fate sealed. But it seems there may still be hope for Drake, as long as he doesn’t expect Morwenna to kiss or touch him. Morwenna’s speech about carnal revulsion was excellent and no one could blame her for not mourning her miscarriage. Grim times indeed. I get the impression Morwenna is going to be captured next week and sent to the asylum. Meanwhile her mother-in-law showed where the nasty vicar got his charm: “We must hope for a boy. Girls are of no use to anyone.”Happy moments? Dr Enys’ attempt at a joke at Ross being able to fight the Unintelligible Hook Hand Man. And Dr Enys and Sindy Doll speaking to each other through the dog:“Horace wonders why Dr Enys cannot find it in his heart to love London as he does.” “Perhaps Horace will return to Cornwall sooner than he thought.” But the absolute highlight of this episode and possibly of the entire series? Evil George’s face when Geoffrey Charles exclaimed at the top of his voice: “Lord, why have I never noticed this before? Is he not the very spit and image of Uncle Ross?” Finally the penny drops.Pistols at dawn and snifters of brandy all round as we twirl the frills of our shirts exuberantly in praise of Frilly Shirt Man, also known as Monk Adderley (played brilliantly by Max Bennett). The exchange between him and Evil George at the masked ball was priceless:“The hair’s a touch provincial but the rest is good.” “Doubtless she has been dressed in London.” “Then she must be undressed in London … Have you ventured yourself?” “My tastes are more refined. But if you have the stomach …” What an excellent scene! There were moments when Frilly Shirt Man appeared to channel the spirit of the nasty vicar. They certainly had similar attitudes to lust and to women. Anyone who didn’t find themselves carnally revulsed should seek medical attention immediately. In acting terms, though? Top work, Frilly Shirt Man.A few seconds of chest at the steamy beginning. The conjugal bliss was positively blush-inducing and clearly never destined to last. Maybe it’s me, but surely the chest is best observed wordlessly, in solitude and in its natural Cornish marine habitat?High drama as Evil George faces the truth about Valentine. Elizabeth goes into labour at the most inconvenient time. And some very nasty people chase after Morwenna in the woods. Bad times."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f9beb162686bd4182698fd3168dfabb784c9f80/0_92_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b133d8b66d7f7e156db931aded01d1fb","title":"unforgotten series 3 episode 2 recap finally we have our first solid lead","story":"We now know there is a clear link between the suspects and Hayley, but its still unclear who killed herBit by bit, we learn more about Hayley. A sit-down with former DCI John Bentley, the second-in-command on the investigation in 2000, reveals a police oversight that hampered the case. Believing she had gone to London with her boyfriend, they delayed the start of their search for five days. Bentley will never know what they could have turned up in that period and he bitterly regrets the decision. There’s a lot of that about on Unforgotten. Plod make a breakthough when an old friend places Hayley in a Hampshire holiday rental called the Spinney at the turn of the millennium. The home was leased to James Hollis for the New Year – also present were Melanie Hollis, Peter Carr, Tim Finch and Chris Lowe. It’s a solid lead and our first connection to the suspects. With Melissa handing over the hard copies of Hayley’s diaries, there’s a lot for Cassie and Sunny to get their teeth into. At the General Medical Council hearing, Alison Pinion makes a compelling witness. Her testimony on Tim’s threats towards her mother has a ring of truth to it. Maybe that’s because she has had so much experience in giving it. Alison has made complaints against local practices on multiple occasions and every time she has tried to settle financially. It’s a bad look for any plaintiff in a he-said-she-said case. All the signs are that her complaint will be summarily dismissed and Tim can get back to doing what he does best – helping the vulnerable. That starts with his old pal Chris. Live life on the margins and you’re always an easy mark. Chris discovers this the hard way when he returns to his minimum-security campervan to discover both the £4,000 deposit for the flat and Frankie the superdog are gone. Like a lot of artists, he finds life’s practicalities beyond him, but when Tim white knights in from the north to fix his shattered windscreen and patch up his broken life it’s a huge boost. Tim presents as the kind of guy who would do anything to help a buddy out, even if they had, I don’t know, accidentally snapped a teenager’s neck at a millennium party or something. A rapidly improving day gets even better for Chris when Jamila shows up to accept his proposal, closely followed by the returning Frank. With the press swarming all over the Hayley case, though, he won’t want to be popping any champagne corks just yet. Taking a well-earned break from ruthlessly exploiting the elderly, Pete rolls up to the school sports day. He is greeted by his wife, Maria, talking to a man looking suspiciously like he just stepped out of the “guy she told you not to worry about” meme. There’s nothing solid there – just that sickening sense of dread that haunts his every waking moment. Maria later berates him for his inability to face up to his responsibilities as a breadwinner. “This isn’t Hong Kong you know – whatever weird endlessly delayed adolescence you lived over there,” she snaps. Exactly what Hong Kong phooey did Pete get up to? More urgently, how will he explain the missing £3,000 now that Mr Salthouse’s daughter has cancelled the cash Isa? Over to you, Pete. Perhaps in keeping with being the most successful of the suspects, James is also the most stressed. He’s swearing like Roger Mellie at work and feeling the pressure at home. In a parent-child heart-to-heart, he tries to get a handle on Eliot’s troubles and in return gets oblique references to a dark history: “This isn’t about the past, or at least not the past you’re talking about.” It sounds a lot like whatever went on in the holiday rental, Eliot was somehow involved. When Cassie and Sunny come to visit James, he immediately lawyers up, lies to his wife and phones Eliot to announce: “It’s happened, sweetheart. They’ve come – the police – about her.” How is Eliot wrapped up in the case? Is there a future for Chris and Jamila? Just how much does Frankie the superdog know?

Old political certainties could be turned upside down in Germany this summer as the far ends of the country’s political spectrum both moot a “national social” turn.A new leftwing movement soft-launching in Germany in August aims to part ways with what one of its founders calls the “moralising” tendency of the left, in an attempt to win back working-class voters from the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD).The as-yet-unnamed new populist movement, partly inspired by the British Labour party’s Momentum and Jean-Luc Mélenchon’s La France Insoumise, and spearheaded by the leftwing party Die Linke’s chairwoman, Sahra Wagenknecht, will include former and current members of the Social Democratic and Green parties, and prominent academics such as the sociologist Wolfgang Streeck.According to one of the movement’s founders, its defining feature is likely to be its adherence to “the materialist left, not the moral left”.“When people live in social conditions that make them feel secure, they are usually prepared to act generously and tolerantly,” said Bernd Stegemann, an author and dramatist at the prestigious Berliner Ensemble theatre who is working with Wagenknecht on the movement’s programme.“When they live in increasingly precarious and atomised conditions, however, they are also likely to react to challenges in a tougher and colder manner. Brecht summarised it wonderfully. Grub comes first, then ethics.”As well as rallying around traditional leftwing causes such as disarmament and a reversal of Germany’s Hartz IV labour market reforms, an unsigned position paper circulating around Berlin political circles in recent weeks suggests the movement will also advocate law and order policies and a tougher stance on immigration. “Open borders in Europe means more competition for badly paid jobs,” says the paper, which is headed “fairland”.Stegemann, who is not a member of any political party, said he was frustrated with middle-class leftwing intellectuals lecturing working-class Germans for their sceptical reaction to Angela Merkel’s decisions at the height of the refugee crisis.“We are dealing with an absurd situation when the winners of neoliberalism tell the losers that they must be more humane. And it galls me when politicians think it is enough to pass down moral judgments. No, politics must act.”The launch of the new movement, which will start as an online forum where supporters can upload and visualise policy proposals, comes as the AfD is trying to win over disappointed Die Linke supporters in the former states of East Germany. It is doing so by occupying positions on social welfare usually associated with the left.Non-Germans are largely excluded from the AfD’s newly discovered welfare initiatives. A proposed “state resident’s pension” of €190 a month could only be claimed by German citizens who have worked in the country for more than 35 years.Björn Höcke, the far-right politician who has emerged as the leading architect of AfD’s “national social” identity in the east, has argued that “the German social question of the 21st century” is not primarily the redistribution of national wealth from top to bottom, or old to young, but “inside to outside”.For both Die Linke and the AfD, the new “national social” formations – as a recent article in Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung dubbed the new political initiative – face opposition from within their own parties. There are fears among the former’s strategists and activists that the new movement’s launch proper in early September could backfire and destroy Die Linke’s already low chances of entering parliament at Bavarian state elections in October.Wagenknecht is a widely recognised politician whose rhetorical gifts have made hera regular presence on Germany’s political talkshows, but critics inside her own party say her popularity is an illusion. Unlike Labour’s Momentum, her new movement has so far mainly attracted older white men. In terms of policy, she runs counter to the successful socially liberal, pro-refugee Berlin branch of Die Linke, which is leading polls for state elections in 2021.Inside Alternative für Deutschland, calls for higher pensions and rallying cries against labour market deregulation clash with the official positions of the party’s upper ranks, where its leader, Alice Weidel, advocates Swiss-style pension funds as the model for Germany to follow, and its deputy leader, Beatrix von Storch, rails against high taxes on Twitter.Manual workers who used to vote for the far right or far left in protestare increasingly solidifying their identification with the AfD, Dörre said. “They used to be a fluctuating protest movement, but now they follow the party line.”One of the anonymous case studies quoted in the study, a previously “exemplary” union activist who had fought for solidarity with Czech temporary workers, expressed views that crossed over from “national social” to national socialism: “In my view, the refugees have to go away ... I wouldn’t have a problem if they opened up Buchenwald again, put barbed wire around it, them inside, us outside.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/445b8bd82f99e44f59a17f3253207d89be027554/0_374_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a8c53965e962fc0ff194a54a2333e062","title":"heatwave northen hemisphere uk algeria canada sweden whats the cause","story":"The northern hemisphere is having a baking summer – and it’s not just down to climate changeLast week, authorities in Sweden took an unusual step. They issued an appeal for international aid to help them tackle an epidemic of wildfires that has spread across the nation over the past few days.After months without rain, followed by weeks of soaring temperatures, the nation’s forests had become tinderboxes.The result was inevitable. Wildfires broke out and, by the end of last week, more than 50 forest blazes – a dozen inside the Arctic circle – had spread across Sweden.A nation famous for its cold and snow found itself unable to cope with the conflagrations taking place within its border and so made its appeal for international help, a request that has already been answered by Norway and Italy who have both sent airborne firefighting teams to help battle Sweden’s blazes.Nor is the nation’s fiery fate particularly unusual at present. Across much of the northern hemisphere, intense and prolonged heatwaves have triggered disruption and devastation as North America, the Arctic, northern Europe and Africa have sweltered in record-breaking temperatures. In Africa, a weather station at Ouargla, Algeria, in the Sahara desert, recorded a temperature of 51.3C, the highest reliable temperature ever recorded in Africa. In Japan, where temperatures have reached more than 40C, people were last week urged to take precautions after the death toll reached 30 with thousands more having sought hospital treatment for heat-related conditions. And in California increased use of air conditioning units, switched on to counter the scorching conditions there, has led to power shortages.But perhaps the strangest impact of the intense heat has been felt in Canada. It too has been gripped by ferocious heat, with Toronto recording temperatures that have exceeded 30C on 18 days so far this year. This figure compares with only nine such days all last summer.Dozens have died in the withering heat – with startling and grim consequences. Montreal’s morgue has been swamped with the bodies of those who have died because of the heat, and many corpses have had to be stored elsewhere in the city. Montreal coroner Jean Brochu said it was first time the city’s morgue had been overwhelmed this way.Britain’s scorching weather – which has melted the roof of Glasgow’s Science Centre and parched the lawns of the nation’s historic homes – may have made regular UK headlines. However, it has been relatively mild in impact compared to those experienced in many other parts of the world.Far from being a parochial problem, the current heatwave is clearly an issue that affects vast stretches of our planet: a global concern not a local one.But why is so much of our world currently being afflicted with blisteringly hot weather? What is driving the wildfires, the soaring temperatures and those melting rooftops? These are tricky questions to answer, such is the complex nature of the planet’s weather systems. Most scientists point to a number of factors with global warming being the most obvious candidate. Others warn that it would be wrong to overstate its role in the current heatwaves, however.“Yes, it is hard not to believe that climate change has to be playing a part in what is going on round the globe at present,” said Dann Mitchell of Bristol University. “There have been some remarkable extremes recorded in the past few weeks, after all. However, we should take care about overstating climate change’s influence for it is equally clear there are also other influences at work.”One of those other factors is the jet stream – a core of strong winds around five to seven miles above the Earth’s surface that blow from west to east and which steer weather around the globe. Sometimes, when they are intense, they bring storms. On other occasions, when they are weak, they bring very calm and settled days. And that is what is occurring at present.“The jet stream we are currently experiencing is extremely weak and, as a result, areas of atmospheric high pressure are lingering for long periods over the same place,” added Mitchell.Other factors involved in creating the meteorological conditions that have brought such heat to the northern hemisphere include substantial changes to sea surface temperatures in the North Atlantic. “These are part of a phenomenon known as the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation,” said Professor Adam Scaife, of the Met Office.“In fact, the situation is very like the one we had in 1976, when we had similar ocean temperatures in the Atlantic and an unchanging jet stream that left great areas of high pressure over many areas for long periods,” said Scaife.“And of course, that year we had one of the driest, sunniest and warmest summers in the UK in the 20th century.”However, there is one crucial difference between 1976 and today, added Professor Tim Osborn, director of research at the Climatic Research Unit, University of East Anglia. “The baseline on which these effects operated is very different today. Since 1976 we have had several decades of global warming – caused by rising carbon emissions – which has raised baseline global temperatures significantly.”As a result, any phenomenon such as the weakening of the jet stream is going to have a more pronounced effect than it did 40 years ago.And as global carbon emissions continue to rise and predictions suggest the world will be unable to hold global temperature rises this century to below 2C above pre-industrial levels, widespread heatwaves are very likely to get worse and become more frequent, scientists warn.Nor is the problem of increasingly severe heatwaves confined to the land. “We have marine heatwaves as well – all over the globe,” said Michael Burrows, of the Scottish Marine Institute, Oban. “For example, there was a major marine heatwave that struck the coast of Australia last year. It devastated vast swathes of the Great Barrier Reef. More to the point, marine heatwaves are also becoming more and more frequent and intense, like those on land, and that is something else that we should be very worried about.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/877d1ce5ee1b9c313f831d8ec371f2be9ef25cf0/740_905_3551_2130/master/3551.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=61e127931cf038fff1a9f0dd21c505e3","title":"the black man in the ku klux klan","story":"The local KKK leader thought he’d found an enthusiastic new recruit. In fact, he’d inadvertently signed up a black policeman. Ron Stallworth reveals the often hilarious saga that has now become a Spike Lee filmIt is late October, 1978, in Colorado Springs when Ken O’Dell, a closet member of the newly resurgent Ku Klux Klan, receives an encouraging sign that his strategy of placing ads in the personal section of the local paper for new recruits has met with some success. Ken has been sent a letter from a man called Ron Stallworth. Ron, he says in his letter, wants to “further the cause of the white race” – and to join the Klan. Before long the two men are in enthusiastic telephone contact. Ken, who loathes blacks, Jews, Catholics and any other minority he can think of, sees Ron as a kindred spirit. Indeed, Ken is so impressed by Ron that, over the coming months, he will not only make sure that Ron gains membership and full access to the Klan, but he’ll even tout him as a future leader of the local chapter. Unfortunately for Ken, there are a couple of things about Ron he doesn’t know –and won’t know until 28 years later when Ron reveals them in a newspaper interview. First, Ron is an undercover police officer. Second – and this never fails to crack Ron up every time he thinks of it – Ron is black. “I was having a lot of fun,” he says.The story of how a black police officer infiltrated the KKK is at first so hard to wrap your mind around that you may question how it can possibly be true. But once you’ve taken account of the state of late 1970s technology, it becomes easier to understand how such an audacious and thrilling police sting could ever have come into being. No internet, no smart phones: resurgent underground terrorist organisations have to rely on letter writing and telephone calls for their secret communications. Ken has no way of knowing, for example, that the voice on the other end of the telephone line, fulminating against “slaves” and “mud people” belongs to anyone but what Ken likes to call “an intelligent white man” – like himself. Ken falls for it.“Fortunately the people I was dealing with weren’t the brightest bulbs in the socket,” Ron says. What happened next is the proudest, most off-the-wall moment of his career in law enforcement. “It was so hilariously funny that this was even taking place. But funny as it was, it was an investigation that we took seriously – because the Klan’s intent was very serious.”I stumbled across Ron’s story last year in an article written in 2006 in the Desert News, a Utah newspaper. Ron was well known for having set up the state’s first Gang Task Force, but when asked to name his most significant career achievement he dropped a bombshell and said: “The year I went undercover with the KKK.” The story went viral.I tracked Ron Stallworth down in El Paso, Texas, the border town where he’d grown up. Ron, now 65, is living a comfortable married life. He is retired, though still deeply loyal to the police force, and there is a grouchy rebelliousness to him: “I don’t care what they think,” he says calmly when I ask him what his former colleagues, his parents, the KKK, the world make of his surveillance work, or anything else. Ron was 21 when he joined the police as a patrol officer – the only black person working in the entire department. The Klan investigation came out of the blue, four years later – what a gift to a spirited and ambitious young cop. At one point in our conversation he opens his wallet to show me a memento: his Klan membership card, issued in 1979. He was ordered, on its termination, to destroy all evidence of the investigation, but it’s typical of Ron’s rebellious nature to have kept the card anyway.There’d been talk over the years of his story being made into the film – it had never happened. But shortly before I first made contact with Ron, the director Spike Lee had finally given the project the green light. Ron tells me he is very excited, “somewhat overwhelmed”, that the film director is flying him to New York for a read-through of his film adaptation of Ron’s life. “Spike has been very respectful, he has said he values my opinion.” BlacKkKlansman is going to be a return to form for Lee, predict critics: a strong contender for film of the year when it’s released next month. Lee cast John David Washington as the younger Ron. The older Ron admits that, as an admirer of Denzel Washington, he is excited to see what the actor’s son will make of the role.It’s baffling that it has taken more than two decades for such an astonishing story to be adapted. “It wouldn’t have been made if Trump wasn’t occupying the White House” (Ron won’t dignify the present incumbent with the word “President”): Charlottesville, where last August neo-Nazis and white nationalists clashed with anti-fascist demonstrators, accelerated Lee’s race to get the film finished. The question arises, how could Ron, a black man, have possibly embedded himself in a white supremacist organisation? What happened when he had to meet these people in the flesh? “I called my friend Chuck,” Ron says.It was never actually intended to be a sting, explains Ron. The police were worried at the time, and wanted to find out more about Klan activities, so Ron did some homework. “When I saw that ad in the newspaper I wrote back, thinking they’d just send me some pamphlets.” Instead, Ken O’Dell called him directly, identifying himself as the local organiser of “The Cause”. Ron hadn’t been prepared for that phone call, but he’d had the presence of mind to include in his letter an untraceable number which fed directly into the police department. That said, he also made two howling errors: he’d signed his letter to the KKK ad with his own name, and “I broke the most basic rule of all and that was going into a case without a plan of operation.” Talking to Ken that first time, Ron improvised as best he could: “My sister was recently involved with a nigger,” Ron angrily told Ken during the phone call, “and every time I think about him putting his filthy black hands on her pure white body I get disgusted and sick to my stomach.” “You’re the kind of person we’re looking for,” said Ken. “When can we meet?”Chuck now enters, stage left. Ron decided there needed to be two Ron Stallworths: the black version (himself) who would continue written correspondence and manage the untraceable phone line and the white version, Chuck, a friend of Ron’s who worked in the narcotics department, who would deal with the KKK’s cloak-and-dagger meet-ups when they arose.Chuck was game but senior staff were against the idea, arguing: “They’ll know you’re a black man from the sound of your voice.” Ron explains how US law enforcement was at the time somewhat confused between its own prejudices and its determination to crack down on race hate crimes. It didn’t want a replay of the riots of the late 1960s and early 70s. White supremacist groups and, at the other extreme, Black Panthers, covertly or not, advocated armed combat. In Denver, the Klan had recently burned several 14ft crosses in strategic locations a black man escorting a white woman to the cinema had been shot dead antisemitism was on the rise. African-Americans did not take well to Ron joining the police force, he says: “I was too ‘white’, too ‘blue’” his white colleagues, meanwhile, gawped at his Afro.“I didn’t care, and I still don’t care what anyone thought,” says Ron. He charmed and bulldozed the powers-that-be that not every black person “shucked and jived”, or engaged in criminal behaviour. “They harboured no bigotry against me personally, but hadn’t reached the point where they could see past their stereotypes.”The grocery and bicycle store on Main Street, Colorado Springs, are no longer there, but the Kwik Inn is still standing. A 1950s diner, it looks exactly as it did when Ken chose it as the location for his first meeting with Ron. He was to turn up there at 7pm where he’d be met by a skinny, cigar-smoking white man with a Fu Manchu moustache, who would take him to a secret location to discuss Ron’s eligibility for membership of the Klan. Chuck, the “white Ron”, set off, wired up, with the black Ron and a second narcotics investigator called Jimmy trailing his movements from a surveillance vehicle.A mile or so later, the skinny cigar smoker pulled up outside a e bar that the local Klan used as its recruitment centre. Ken was inside with another man, and a Klan membership form for Ron. Ken was 28, short and stocky – an army man. The military base, Fort Carson, was a short drive away. Ken boasted that, under him, the Crusader, the Klan newspaper, was now widely circulating in Colorado prisons and military staff were secretly joining in droves. What is certainly true is that many white military men resented the new black presence among their officers – a perfect opportunity for the Klan to widen its base. Ken was satisfied that Ron didn’t have “any Jew in him”, and explained that membership cost $10, but new recruits had to pay extra for a robe and cloak.It was often, says Ron, very hard not to burst out laughing at the credulity and the petty officiousness of the Klan members. Back at the police station, he recalls, “My sergeant would sometimes be laughing so hard he’d have to excuse himself from the room.”Only once did any members of the Klan get suspicious. “Chuck had been to a meeting with the Klan members and there had been something I wanted to follow up on so, a couple of hours after Chuck left the meeting, I called Ken. He immediately said: ‘What’s wrong with your voice?’ So I coughed a bit and said I had a sinus infection. Ken proceeded to prescribe me a remedy. He said: ‘I get those all the time.’”The deeper the investigation probed, the less laughable the inept Klansmen became. Soon after that first meeting, Ken called Ron to invite him to his house. Ken and a small group of “losers” (Ron’s words) were assembled in the living room, including the group’s second-in-command, its treasurer and a bodyguard. Plans to burn four 17ft crosses were discussed and finalised: everyone in the group agreed it would be a deeply moving religious experience. Publicly, the Klan were against violence. Ken gave White Ron the tour of his own personal arsenal, which included 13 shotguns, plus the weapons he carried in his vehicles.As special guests at his next rendezvous, Ken invited the leaders of a powerful Nazi survivalist group, Posse Comitatus. Together they watched a screening of a nationalist film and discussed collaborating on terrorist activities.David Duke, the white supremacist politician and a holocaust denier, is still an influential person in American political life. In May, he accused Trump of “stealing” his Build The Wall slogan, which he’d coined in the 1970s. At the time of Ron’s investigation, Duke was the Klan’s newly appointed leader or Grand Wizard: a clean-cut and reasonable-seeming man “He was a Dr Jekyll but he’d turn into Mr Hyde in private conversations,” remembers Ron. In the pivotal breakthrough in the case, Ron was put on to Duke to check the status of his membership card.Duke is a PR man to his core. In the view of the Far Right, his greatest achievement was conferring respectability on the KKK, banning his members from wearing hoods and robes in public, and aligning “The Cause” with fundamental Christianity and dissatisfaction with the government. “Duke was a con artist,” says Ron. “His appearance was that of an all-American boy every mother would want as a prom date for her daughter.” “Racial Purity Is America’s Security” is the slogan he used when he ran for Louisiana state senator – as a Democrat. Ron established a friendly relationship with Duke over the phone. He describes him as “a very pleasant conversationalist”. Duke presided over Chuck’s solemn candle-lit naturalisation ceremony. “I laugh all the time about our investigation, especially about making a fool of David Duke, who likes to think I don’t have the intelligence of an ape because he thinks I’m genetically inferior,” says Ron. “How I conned the Grand Wizard, David Duke, and his coterie of followers… It has defined me in ways I never could have imagined.”As fascinating as Ron’s story is, what did he actually achieve? The sting never resulted in any arrests and when, months in, the Klan unexpectedly nominated Ron as its local group leader, he was forced to shut down the investigation. If the story got out, Colorado police worried it would be misconstrued: in the 1920s, Denver’s head of police was a Klansman. But through their work, Chuck and Ron had foiled a Neo-Nazi plot to nail-bomb a gay bar and identified seven Klansman army personnel. They’d discovered where the local Klan kept its money. Ron also uncovered intelligence regarding violent plots among black extremists. In mid-1979, the investigation was terminated. A year later Duke left the Klan to form the National Association for the Advancement of White People. Ron followed his career in law enforcement to Wyoming, Arizona and Utah, specialising in gangs. When he retired in 2006, he gave that bombshell newspaper interview. The FBI called him after the piece went viral: Ron’s name, picture and alleged home address had been published on white supremacist websites. “After that, I started carrying a gun again,” he tells me. Was he frightened? “I have never had a fear of white people. As a child, if anyone called me a nigger, my mother would say: ‘I hope you whipped his ass!’” As for the film, he says: “Spike’s take on the book is pretty accurate,” Ron says. “I got a lot of joy from telling my story.” I can hear him smiling on the other end of the phone.Black Klansman by Ron Stallworth (£7.99, Arrow) will be published on 29 July.

The inquiry also did not find any evidence that Muscat, his wife, his close aide Keith Schembri, tourism minister Konrad Mizzi, or former European commissioner John Dalli were involved in money laundering or suspicious financial transactions involving holders of bank accounts in Azerbaijan via Pilatus Bank.The allegations had been made on the blog of slain investigative journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, killed by a car bomb last year.After winning the election, Muscat had promised to resign if the probe showed there was an “ounce of truth” in the allegations.

Photograph: iStockNew figures show the extent of the “class gap” in higher education with students from fee-paying schools far more likely to attend a handful of top Dublin-based universities.Students from fee-paying schools account for 20-25 per cent of undergraduates at Trinity and UCD.By contrast, they account for less than 1 per cent of students at institutes of technology in Athlone, Galway-Mayo, Tralee, Letterkenny and Waterford. Geography is a clear factor, given the majority of second-level fee paying students are in the south Dublin area. However, the social ide is also stark when enrolment numbers are broken down by students from disadvantaged areas or Deis schools.Disadvantaged students account for 20-30 per cent of undergraduates at institutes of technology in Blanchardstown, Tallaght, Tralee and Letterkenny.The proportion of Deis students at Trinity and UCD, by contrast, is below 5 per cent.The figures are contained in a study by the Higher Education Authority and relate to the 201516 academic year.The social ide in the enrolment patterns to third level are likely to lead to a fresh focus on whether top universities are doing enough to attract students from more disadvantaged areas.For example, the proportion of school-leavers progressing to third level in affluent areas such as Dublin 4 and Dublin 6 is in excess of 95 per cent, while it falls to about 20 per cent in less well-off areas such as Dublin 17.The Government points out that it is funding a range of programmes to boost the numbers of “under-represented groups” at third-level institutions.For example, a three-year national access plan, published by the Higher Education Authority in 2017, aims to increase the number of students with disabilities and mature students who have never been to college at third level by 1,500.Inidual institutions also have targets, as part of funding agreements with the Higher Education Authority, for the proportion of students from disadvantaged or non-traditional backgrounds to enrol in a given year.Institutions such as Trinity and UCD have been exploring different approaches to boosting these numbers.A recent Trinity study, for example, found that secondary students in poorer areas of Dublin were three times more likely to plan to go to college after being assigned a mentor.Other research shows that students from disadvantaged backgrounds face a much bigger challenge in staying in third level once they get there.A recent HEA study found the rates of students who fail to progress beyond the first year of their college course is almost double for students from Deis schools compared to fee-paying schools .While 19 per cent of students from Deis schools failed to progress, this compared to 10 per cent from fee-paying schools.Research indicates that academic performance and financial considerations are some of the key factors which help determine if students progress.The third level institutions with the highest proportions of Deis students included institutes of technology in Letterkenny (28 per cent), Tallaght (23 per cent), Blanchardstown and Tralee (21 per cent) and Waterford (15 per cent)."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3573118.1532287642!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"primary school teachers may be converted for second level roles","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIreland’s secondary school population is projected to rise until 2024.

Other potential measures include sharing teachers across schools in certain subject areas exploring the potential to train native speakers as language teachers and financial incentives to take up teacher training programmes, which can cost €10,000-15,000.Teachers’ unions insist the teacher supply “crisis” is the result of austerity era pay rates for teachers hired after 2011.However, the department has only accepted that there are “pinch points” in certain areas, such as key subjects and substitute cover at primary level.Steering group members – which include officials from the department, the Teaching Council, nominees of the higher education sector and the school management bodies – have identified “cost of living” challenges as a significant issue for young teachers.In addition, they have focused on the “casualisation” of the profession, with many working part-time hours for long periods.A spokesman for the department said proposals such as converting primary teachers to secondary teachers were being considered as part of the steering group’s work.He said the group was established earlier this year to develop a programme of actions on teacher supply and oversee its implementation.The spokesman said that, in the meantime, more new teachers were being hired than at any other time in the history of the State."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3572966.1532275753!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"false information about dublin bus agenda slated by planner","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Dublin Bus network redesign sees the replacement of all existing route numbers with a simplified lettering system. Photograph: Alan BetsonThe US transport planner behind the redesign of the Dublin Bus network has hit back at TDs and union officials for spreading “false information” about the proposed new service.Jarrett Walker, who has redrawn the network for the National Transport Authority, has urged bus users to “beware of rumours” about the changes to routes and read the redesign plans which are currently open to public submissions.The redesign sees the scrapping of all existing route numbers, and their replacement with a simplified lettering system, along with the creation of new orbital and local “feeder” bus routes.Mr Walker’s comments follow complaints last week at an Oireachtas Transport Committee about the plans.Social Democrats TD Catherine Murphy said commuters on the outskirts of the capital would be “the real losers” under the plan. “The further you get from the city the greater the loss is,” she said.Independents4Change TD Joan Collins said bus users in working-class areas would have worse services than those living in in Rathmines and Rathgar. Double-decker buses with 99 people on them travelling in or out from the city centre will link up with smaller buses for the orbital routes that will only be able to take 28 passengers, she said.The committee heard from National Bus and Railworkers’ Union general secretary Dermot O’Leary who said the changes would end many direct services to the city centre and damage services to working-class communities.Mr Walker said these comments showed a fundamental misunderstanding of how the new network would operate.“Unfortunately, in the first weeks since the plan was released, we’ve seen lots of false information circulating about it, including in statements put out by some people commenting on the report,” he said.“A big idea is that most services into the city centre would be organised into spines with branches. So for example, the A Spine, going south from the city centre toward Terenure, is made up of buses marked A1, A2, A3, and A4. Any “A” bus will go to Terenure, but after that, A1 continues toward Knocklyon, A2 continues toward Tallaght, and so on. So every bus on every branch still has direct service to the city centre.”The current inner city bus network was “insanely complex”, he said. “Do you want to get from the city centre to Rathgar? Then you need to know you could use the 14, 15, 15a, 15b, 65b, 83, 83a. In the new network, you just remember A, because all the A buses do that, no matter which number is after the letter.”However, there were “trade-offs”, he said. “Some trips require an interchange that do not today, although shorter waiting times mean these trips can be faster than they are now.” The system would create a more efficient network for inner Dublin “while still serving many suburban areas directly”, he said.The plans are available to view at busconnects.ie. “We want everyone’s comments on the plan, but first, make sure you understand it.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3572989.1532277429!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"greener public transport fund has gone virtually unused","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Virtually none of a multimillion euro Government fund set up last year to encourage the use of greener buses  has been spent.  File photograph: Eric LukeThe Virtually none of a multimillion euro Government fund set up last year to encourage the use of greener buses in Ireland’s cities and towns has been spent. Minister for Transport Shane Ross’s €2.5 million Green Public Transport Fund was heralded last year as one of his department’s six flagship climate change measures. It was established to help buses and taxis switch away from using diesel and petrol. However, Mr Ross has revealed that, in terms of what has been spent so far, none of the money has gone towards buses, while just €45,000 – or less than 2 per cent – has been drawn down under a grant scheme for taxis. Just €500,000 of the fund was earmarked for taxis. The National Development Plan, the Government’s blueprint for the country over the coming years, states that fossil-fuel-powered buses in cities and towns will be replaced with cleaner alternatives. However, State-owned transport companies will continue to buy diesel buses until July next year, under the National Transport Authority’s BusConnects fleet renewal programme.The Government has set a target for half of the national bus fleet – about 500 buses – to be low-emission vehicles by 2023, with plans for full conversion of the fleet by 2030.One of the aims of the Green Public Transport Fund was to jump-start the use of energy-efficient and alternatively-fuelled buses among so-called public service obligation bus operators. These are publicly-subsidised bus services – considered necessary but not financially viable – run by Dublin Bus, Bus Éireann and M\u0026ampA Coaches. “However, an up-to-date and comprehensive set of vehicle trials is being planned to commence later this year to help inform purchasing decisions for new buses over the coming years.”Mr Ross said “it is envisaged” that the National Transport Authority will use the fund to start alternatively-fuelled urban bus trials this year.Just seven taxi drivers took up a grant under the fund since the start of this year. There are more than 20,000 taxis in Ireland. The Republic is the second-worst performing EU member state for tackling climate change, after Poland, Europe’s largest NGO coalition working on climate and energy issues said last month. The Climate Action Network Europe, which is supported by the European Commission, rated the State second last in efforts to reach its targets under the Paris Agreement on climate change. “Ireland is set to miss its 2020 climate and renewable energy targets and is also off-course for its unambitious 2030 emissions target,” it warned.The coalition said that without new, immediate and substantive efforts to cut emissions, the Republic “faces annual non-compliance costs of around €500 million”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3567962.1531835019!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"nature takes refuge as drought dries the landscape","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t“Like our neighbours, we once depended wholly on the stream, piped to the house by gravity from one of its higher pools.”The hill stream ducks under an old stone bridge to swerve through a corner of our acre. Flash floods, carving through a layer of ochreous clay, have deepened its bed decade by decade, so that the tangle of fuchsia bushes arching from its banks now hide and muffle its day-to-day passage below.At the umpteenth day of drought I took binoculars across the road to look at the stream in the open ravine that ides the sheep’s rocky meadow. Down among mossy boulders, a slow gleam showed.Like our neighbours, we once depended wholly on the stream, piped to the house by gravity from one of its higher pools. Ours needed a tight little dam of rocks and sods to keep water above the pipe’s end. A flood of rain could sweep the dam away a drought could leave the pipe sucking air.Either way meant a long trudge up the hill. In summer sun that could be blissful: a big blue sea and chirping wheatears. Backside to the wind, in Paul Durcan’s treasured phrase, it was often more of a penance.Today we have the luxury of pumped water. With a well drilled down to 240ft (73m – at the deeper range of some 100,000 such wells in the nation), why should I bother if the stream is still running?It gathers itself in a small stretch of bog in the lap of the ridge. I have seen this, perhaps too breezily, as our upland reservoir. If months of drought dry it up, what then? An accomplished worrier, I choose to discount the endless, squelching abundance of the spring.I also try to picture what it’s like, down at the well pipe’s end. A big pond full of water, replenished by trickles from above? Or a crevice that will just keep flowing, so long as we don’t flush too often?The man with the rig, from Donegal and an excellent judge of these things, stopped the remorseless rumble and chatter of the drill when enough of the right-coloured water came gushing up. Then the health people had to test it, or we wouldn’t get a county grant. But no iron, sulphate, arsenic or E coli just sometimes, in a frosty winter, a bit cold to drink from the tap.According to the map of The Geology of South Mayo, our hillside wedge of bedrock is “grey-green lithic turbidic sandstones with blue-grey slates with black laminae”. They came from the seabed of the vanished ocean of Iapetus and were fractured and cracked in the big heave into mountains,.But there’s sandstone and there’s sandstone. The Environmental Protection Agency says: “In contrast with most other EU countries, the bedrock aquifers in Ireland have fissure permeability only.” Water flow, it insists, “is predominantly through fissures or fractures and not through pore spaces in the rock itself”. That’s clearly true of much limestone, but some dense, fine-grained Irish sandstone can also be as hard as steel.For much of the natural world, meanwhile, the trials of drought are recurrent and familiar. A holiday in Provence once showed me little snails clustered together at the top of tall, dry stems at the roadside. They were aestivating – hibernating, staying dormant – clear of the baking soil and up in the wind.In much of Ireland, our earthworms have been aestivating (Latin aestes  summer), wrapping their bodies into knots at the bottom of their holes and sealing their chamber with mucus to keep in some humidity. And snails, rather than climbing, work their way into the soil and exude more mucus as protection while they sleep.Our woodshed swallows are flying overtime to catch midges for their young: a depleted generation is missing, as their eggs dry out in the dwindling of bog pools, marsh and mud. Dragonflies eat midges, too, but exceptional droughts can threaten their own populations of aquatic larvae.Bats need midges for food, but also night-flying moths. In Britain, which shared with Ireland the three-month summer drought of 1976, the withering of specific wild food plants and loss of caterpillars brought a crash in some species of moths and butterflies.In rich ecosystems, such as streams, droughts can have complex effects. Studies of hill streams in Scotland and Wales have shown that even when a long drought has killed all the trout, many invertebrates survive in the moist gravel of the streambed. Timing can be critical in deciding what lives and dies, but a couple of years will bring back vagrant mayflies, stoneflies, caddis flies and the rest, along with questing trout, to lay their eggs and colonise."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3573095.1532285995!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"sites worth more than 430m vacant in dublin","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe most expensive vacant site in Dublin is the former Player Wills cigarette factory on the South Circular Road, valued at €23.8 million. Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillVacant sites worth more than €430 million, which could be used for the development of thousands of houses, have been identified across Dublin city and county.Since January, local authorities have had the power to impose a levy on property owners who fail to develop prime housing land.The levy, set at 3 per cent of the value of the land for this year and 7 per cent for subsequent years, must be paid from 2019. Local authorities had until June 1st to inform property owners of the intention to impose levies on their land.More than 100 properties with a combined value of just under €250 million have been listed on Dublin City Council’s register of vacant sites. However, the council has yet to value 21 of the listed sites, including several in its ownership, making the likely value of the vacant lands in the city significantly higher.Currently, the most expensive site in the city is the former Player Wills cigarette factory on the South Circular Road, valued at €23.8 million. Its neighbouring site, the former Bailey Gibson packaging plant, is also on the register, valued at €12.5 million. Players Square Ltd had permission to build more than 500 homes on the combined sites, which are now under the control of receivers Grant Thornton.Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council has just 13 sites listed on its register, only six of which have been valued to date. However, those six sites have a combined value of €140 million, again indicating a substantially higher value will eventually be placed on the hoarded development land in the area.Fingal County Council has listed six sites, four of which are owned by two companies registered at the same address in Tyrrelstown Town Centre, Hasak Ltd and Bardus Ltd, and refer to sites in the Tyrrelstown and Hollystown area. Two of the sites have been valued at €13 million each.South Dublin County Council has registered eight sites, but has so far valued just five of them. These lands have the lowest values in Dublin, coming to a combined total of just under €6.8 million, with a €2.75 million plot in Newcastle attracting the highest valuation.To be hit with the levy, the vacant sites must be bigger than 0.05 of a hectare, excluding gardens. The majority of the site must be “vacant or idle” for more than 12 months, be zoned for residential or regeneration purposes, and be in an area in need of housing."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3573123.1532288016!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"four irish jobs available for every qualified nurse seeking work","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLatest figures show €293 million – or €800,000 a day – is being spent on agency nursing staff and locum doctors. Photograph: Frank MillerFour nursing jobs are available in Ireland for every qualified nurse applying, the latest Health Service Executive figures show.Intensive care units and operating theatres around the country are among the worst hit for shortages as the HSE says it is having particular difficulties recruiting specialist nurses.The HSE has also said it is 20 per cent less expensive to directly employ nurses rather than paying an agency to bring in temporary staff.Latest figures show €293 million – or €800,000 a day – is being spent on agency nursing staff and locum doctors. The figure has almost doubled over the past seven years.A 20 per cent staff saving would amount to almost €60 million a year.Liam Woods, HSE director of acute operations, said it was working to reduce agency staff numbers but there remained a “challenge” in recruiting nurses.“There are some reasons we will have some agencies some of the time that are just endemic in the business,” he said.“The challenge is to recruit to replace that. We will have some natural movement of staff that gives to agency just for short periods.”Mr Woods said there was some success last year in retaining graduate nurses and “that is a key focus for us again this year”.“That is helping us fill some of those roles and to reduce agency staff. It is hoped in time it will help us staff the capacity to come.”Although the number of nurses rose by 400 last year, the HSE is having particular difficulties getting recruits for “theatre and intensive care where specialist skills are required”.Before the Oireachtas Public Accounts Committee (PAC), Independent Galway West TD Catherine Connolly told Mr Woods two operating theatres at Merlin Park Hospital and an entire ward at University Hospital Galway were shut because of staff shortages.“A ward is closed in the hospital in Galway where there are huge waiting lists,” she said.“When I ask why it is closed, I find it is an absence of staff. If there is an absence of nurses at that level, we have an emergency.“We need proper packages, and the package that was provided to attract nurses home has not worked.”Pressed if there is a crisis, Mr Woods said: “Yes.”“Some of the work taking place at present in intensive care units, for example, is training.“There is training under way within our system to grow the number of nurses available for that, but both that and the theatre have been two areas of critical deficiency that we have had to address. It remains a challenge.”The PAC was examining the latest annual report and financial statement of the HSE, which showed “the ratio of nursing jobs in Ireland to nurses looking for them is four to one and it is particularly difficult to fill specialist nursing roles”.To tackle the crisis, the HSE said it was offering all graduating nurses and midwives full-time contracts and improving educational opportunities and career pathways.A Bring Them Home package has also been implemented to recruit Irish nurses from abroad."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Ibrahim Musa (64) is currently living in a shelter despite risk to his kidney transplantIrish representative on European Union Military Committee used service \u0026lsquoalmost daily\u0026rsquoSt Patrick\u0026rsquos National School seeking evidence of \u0026lsquoparochial engagement\u0026rsquo among childrenSupply crisis solution suggested as pupils in post-primary set to reach record highsTughans were paid \u0026euro21,000 in fees last year but the agency refuses to elaborate on detailsIrish ratification of UN convention on rights for people with disabilities is \u0026lsquoironic\u0026rsquoHoarded development land could accommodate thousands of dwellingsPlan is downgraded to long-term goal, while Donohoe criticises Harris\u0026rsquos HSE proposalsPortable apartments scheduled to be installed in Dublin city centre by MarchEx-minister claims Stepaside station will be just a \u0026lsquoprefab\u0026rsquo across four car park spacesFee-paying students much more likely to attend top Dublin-based universitiesTDs, union officials say some communities will be worse off following network redesignService will be held for Amanda Gilbert in Bray following her death on FridayAA survey finds motorists paying more overall due to forecourt pump expensesTaoiseach to visit Croatia, Romania and Italy as Dominic Raab criticises Brussels stanceDepartment says without heavy rainfall in coming weeks, further restrictions inevitableShane Ross announced the \u0026euro2.5m fund last year as part of climate change measuresSeveral hospitalised and roads closed on Sunday as investigation commences into M2 collisionFormer taoiseach says hard Border debate has obscured loss of EU\u0026rsquos financial supportAirline announces further cancellations amid dispute with pilots over conditions"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3573031.1532280784!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"general s private car rental cost 310 000 over four years","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGuidelines for the use of the car and driver state the service should only be used in “exceptional circumstances” to attend functions in uniformA €35-an-hour hired luxury car, used by Ireland’s representative on the European Union Military Committee (EUMC) cost more than €310,000 over a four-and-a-half year period, according to an internal Department of Defence audit.Guidelines for the use of the car and driver state the service should only be used in “exceptional circumstances” to attend functions in uniform, where using the officer’s own car or a taxi “would not be appropriate”.According to the audit, from March 2015 to June 2016, the car was booked on average 20 times a month, for an average six hours per trip. At the time, Brig Gen Murray Piggott was Ireland’s representative on the EUMC.The audit examined the use of the car from April to June 2016, and found it was used “every week day with the exception of one”.Over the three-month period it was used 64 times, for a total of 384 hours, with journey logs varying from three to eight hours in duration.“A service, reserved for ‘exceptional circumstances’ was used on an almost daily basis for large periods of time and at a cost of over €4,000 per month,” the audit report states.The private car hire firm used was Bvba Vanderbiest, and the Belgian company’s website says their fleet is made up of luxury passenger cars.Reasons cited for using the car included “attendance at meetings, lunches, dinners and receptions”, according to the audit and there were four instances of use “for the distribution of classified documentation”. The audit was completed in June 2017 and released to The  under the Freedom of Information Act.The EUMC provides advice and recommendations on military policy and strategy, and is made up of the heads of each country’s military. Chief of Defence vice admiral Mark Mellett is head of the Irish Defence Forces. The military representative acts on his behalf on the EUMC and is stationed permanently in Brussels.Brig Gen Piggott was appointed military representative in December 2013 and was replaced, on retirement, by Brig Gen Philip Brennan in February 2017.The military representative can claim mileage for the use of his personal car at work, guidelines state, and “this should be the norm in almost all circumstances” where public transport or taxis would not be appropriate. A review of invoices from a financial support package for the post, paid by the Department of Foreign Affairs, “did not identify any instances of claims for mileage or public transport usage”, the audit said.Spending on the Brussels car hire firm from 2012 to June 2016 made up two thirds of the almost €471,000 in Defence Forces expenditure on transport hire during the period. In 2014 almost €79,300 was paid to Bvba Vanderbeist.The audit recommended that a review of the service should be undertaken “urgently” to ensure its use was complying with guidelines.The Defence Forces finance branch said on foot of the audit a comprehensive review showed it “was evident the facility was used on a more regular basis than as advised”, and the guidelines “appear to have been misinterpreted”.Following the audit, further checks and scrutiny on the use of the service were put in place by military authorities. Spending on the private car hire over 2017 fell to €22,501, and €19,600 to date this year, according to a Defence Forces spokesman.Decisions to use the vehicle take into account necessary “security requirements”, the spokesman said, these include advice not to use public transport in military uniform.The Defence Forces spokesman said as Brig Gen Piggott is now retired, the Defence Forces could not respond to queries from The  on his behalf. However, he was made aware of the queries and of the publication of this article."},{"url":null,"title":"it s a huge find megalithic passage tomb discovered in co meath","story":"  July 16, 2018Archaeologists uncover burial chambers on historic Br\u0026uacute na B\u0026oacuteinne heritage site   July 19, 2018Department warned against changes to house built above 5,000-year-old tomb   July 21, 2018Br\u0026uacute na B\u0026oacuteinne finds have captured public\u0026rsquos imagination, and raise questions for the State "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3573195.1532292031!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"nama urged to tell of dealings with belfast law firm at centre of project eagle","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSeán Fleming, chairman of the Oireachtas Public Accounts Committee, said he was stunned that Nama was continuing to pay fees to Tughans. Photograph: Cyril Byrne The National Asset Management Agency (Nama) has been urged to disclose all its dealings with a Belfast law firm at the centre of the Project Eagle controversy after it emerged it paid the solicitors €21,000 in fees last year.The State toxic assets agency said the money was paid to Tughans for legal services connected to “a number of residual assets located in Northern Ireland”, but refused to identify or elaborate on the assets.Nama also declined to answer whether it had made any further payments to the firm this year or in the preceding years.Tughans, along with US law firm Brown Rudnick, were advisers to US vulture fund Cerberus when it bought the £1.2 billion Project Eagle property portfolio from Nama in 2014.Ian Coulter, former managing partner of Tughans, resigned in the wake of revelations that he transferred £6 million to an Isle of Man bank account without his firm’s knowledge.Another US company, Pimco, said it pulled out of an earlier bid for the portfolio – the biggest property deal in the North’s history – because it was asked for a fixer payment of £16 million for three parties behind the scenes – Mr Coulter, Belfast businessman Frank Cushnahan and Brown Rudnick.All parties have denied any wrongdoing.Seán Fleming, chairman of the Oireachtas Public Accounts Committee, said he was stunned that Nama was continuing to pay fees to Tughans.“If it is unconnected to Project Eagle, I am wondering why they were even dealing with Tughans last year at all,” he said.“And if it is connected with Project Eagle, I don’t think they should be making any payments when a commission of investigation headed by a High Court judge is looking into the matter. They should be awaiting the outcome of that.”A commission of investigation into Project Eagle, headed by retired High Court judge John D Cooke, was set up by the Government in June last year, following a welter of controversy over the deal.Mr Fleming called on Nama to explain the payment and disclose if any further payments have been made by the State agency.“This is a matter of public interest,” he said.“It is such a matter of public interest, not only did the Comptroller and Auditor General do a special report on it, but the Public Accounts Committee did a special report on it, the Oireachtas had a special debate on it and the Government set up a commission of investigation – on the Richter scale, this matter is 10 out of 10 when it comes to public controversies and the public interest.“Nama should not be withholding on matters that are of such heightened public interest.”Gordon MRM, a PR firm that is paid €90,000 a year in public money to deal with media inquiries for Nama, said last year’s payment to Tughans “relates to legal services provided in respect of a number of residual assets located in Northern Ireland”.Asked for further details on payments to the firm and whether it was appropriate for Nama to retain its services in light of the Project Eagle controversy, a spokesman said the State agency had “nothing to add” to the comment already provided.The commission of investigation into Project Eagle was supposed to have concluded its report last month, but said Nama’s failure to hand over certain documentation has delayed its findings until December.Nama was co-operating with the investigation but its method of collecting documents had omitted relevant material, the inquiry said in an interim report.The commission received 34,000 documents on Project Eagle in two separate tranches in February and March this year.However, an analysis showed certain documents provided to the commission by other parties had not been captured by the agency’s trawl."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3573116.1532287572!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"leo varadkar to begin european tour amid fresh brexit tensions","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar will today begin a tour of three European capitals to discuss Brexit and other issues. Photograph: Brian LawlessPA WireTaoiseach Leo Varadkar will today begin a tour of three European capitals to discuss Brexit and other issues, amid signs of continuing ision between London, Brussels and Dublin on preparations for a possible no-deal Brexit next year.Mr Varadkar will visit the Croatian capital Zagreb today for meetings with Croatia’s president Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic and prime minister Andrej Plenkovic, before travelling on to Romania tomorrow.In Bucharest, Mr Varadkar will meet with president Klaus Iohannis and prime minister Viorica Dãncilã.On Wednesday, Mr Varadkar will travel on to Italy, where he will visit the Venice Biennale, before a meeting in Rome on Thursday with the new Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte. The Department of the Taoiseach said Mr Varadkar would use the meetings to develop trade and cultural relations with all three countries, but it is the exchanges on Brexit that will be most closely watched.It is expected that talks between the European Commission Brexit negotiating team, led by Michel Barnier, and the British government, led by new Brexit secretary Dominic Raab, will resume in Brussels this week, but the European Commission could not confirm any details last night.Mr Raab criticised the commission yesterday for issuing a warning to member states to prepare for all Brexit eventualities, including a no-deal Brexit, saying it was “irresponsible”. Separately, in an interview with the Sunday , Mr Raab said that if Britain exits the EU without an agreement, it will not pay the EU the €50 billion orce bill previously agreed.In Dublin, Government sources said they expected engagement on Irish issues this week, with a possible new legal text to give effect to the political agreement on the backstop reached last December.The backstop deal stated that in the absence of another solution for the post-Brexit Border, Northern Ireland would effectively remain within the EU customs union.Since December, the UK has rejected a draft EU text on the backstop, while the EU has rejected British proposals to allow all of the UK access to the single market for a time-limited period after it exits the bloc.Both Dublin and Brussels have said that without an agreement on the backstop, a treaty on the UK’s withdrawal cannot be concluded. If there is no withdrawal treaty, the UK will leave the EU next March, without a transition period, throwing all trade and operational relations into confusion.Most of the elements of the withdrawal treaty have already been agreed, but the Irish Border – and specifically the requirement for a guarantee of no hard Border in Ireland in the event that no EU-UK trade agreement is reached in the future – remains a barrier to finalising the accord.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

It is essentially a prefab, which carries a certain irony. “I don’t know whether anyone has analysed how many gardaí are going to occupy a modular building that occupies four car parking spaces. It will just be about big enough to provide two toilets and a washing facility unless what is proposed is for some public toilet to visit.“The idea that you could provide a modern facility in the space of four car parking space is completely bizarre,” Mr Shatter said.Mr Ross championed the reopening of the station at the last election and insisted it be examined as part of the programme for a partnership government.However, figures given by the Office of Public Works estimate it will cost in the region of €2 million to reopen the station as it needs significant refurbishment.If a modular facility is to be established, it will be significantly cheaper and will take less time to built.The Minister is understood to have seen the plans for the station in recent days. Three other options have been presented but the Office of Public Works and An Garda Síochána are believed to favour this option. Mr Ross said: “I welcome all suggestions about the best way to reopen Stepaside Garda station but criticism from the man who closed the station is a little bit rich.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3572847.1532277732!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"second brexit vote morally justified says john major","story":"Speaking on the BBC\u0027s Andrew Marr Show, former British prime minister Sir John Major says that Brexiteers had made such “pie in the sky” promises during the campaign that another vote should not be ruled out.\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSir John Major said Brexiteers had made “pie in the sky” promises during the campaign. Photograph: Leon NealGetty ImagesA second Brexit referendum would be “morally justified”, former British prime minister Sir John Major has said.He said the concept of a second vote had difficulties and “democratic downsides”, but Brexiteers had made such “pie in the sky” promises during the campaign that a another vote should not be ruled out.“If you look back at the Leave campaign a great many of the promises they made were fantasy promises. We now know they’re not going to be met,” he said.“Would you buy a house without knowing the price? No, you would not. Should we finally decide to leave Europe without knowing the cost of doing so? “And by the cost I don’t just mean to the government, to the nation, I mean to the lives of inidual people in every constituency in the land.” The ex-leader of the Conservative Party, who was interviewed on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show, said once the cost was known, and if it was as damaging as he believed it would be, there would be a “huge amount of disillusion”. Meanwhile, British Brexit secretary Dominic Raab has signalled the UK could refuse to pay its €39 billion orce bill to Brussels if it does not get a trade deal, Mr Raab said there had to be “conditionality” under the Article 50 withdrawal mechanism between settling Britain’s exit payment and creating a new relationship with the EU.Meanwhile, he indicated he was still trying to persuade all members of the Cabinet that British prime minister Theresa May’s Chequers agreement was “the best plan to get the best deal”.Former Brexit secretary David Davis has urged the prime minister to “reset” her negotiating strategy.In an interview with the Sunday , Mr Raab suggested the orce bill could be used as leverage in the talks with Brussels.He said: “Article 50 requires, as we negotiate the withdrawal agreement, that there’s a future framework for our new relationship going forward, so the two are linked.“You can’t have one side fulfilling its side of the bargain and the other side not, or going slow, or failing to commit on its side.“So, I think we do need to make sure that there’s some conditionality between the two.”Pressed on whether he would put such a provision into legislation, Mr Raab said: “Certainly it needs to go into the arrangements we have at international level with our EU partners. We need to make it clear that the two are linked.”The comments appeared at odds with UK chancellor Philip Hammond, who said of the orce payment last December: “I find it inconceivable that we as a nation would be walking away from an obligation that we recognised as an obligation.“That is not a credible scenario. That is not the kind of country we are. Frankly, it would not make us a credible partner for future international agreements.”Mr Raab also defended the controversial Chequers Cabinet compromise on withdrawal aims, insisting he wanted to persuade voters and Cabinet colleagues that it is the way forward.The Brexit secretary said: “I want to make sure we can persuade everyone — grassroots, voters, parliamentary party and ministers, including in the Cabinet - that we’ve got the best deal and the best plan to get the best deal.”Mr Raab said critics were mistaken to think Ms May would not walk away without a deal if she had to.“The ball is now in the EU’s court, and don’t get me wrong, there will be plenty more negotiations, I’ve made that clear, but if they show us the same level of ambition, energy, pragmatism, this deal gets done in 12 weeks.”Mr Davis, who quit as Brexit secretary in protest at the Chequers agreement, said Ms May needed to “start again” on withdrawal plans.“We’re going to have to do a reset and come back and look at it all again,” he told the Sunday Express.“I think when we get to the autumn, if we are in the situation where we don’t have any degree of agreement, we’re going to have to start again.”Mr Davis suggested the Government draws up fresh proposals based on an amalgamation of the “best bits” of deals the EU has already struck with other countries, such as Canada, South Korea, Switzerland and New Zealand. Meanwhile, preparations for no deal need to accelerate from the current position of “consult and cajole” to “command and control”, he told the paper.“By the end of the summer it should be plain we are making proper preparations for this,” he said.The comments came as a new poll suggested only 16 per cent of voters think Ms May is handling negotiations well, while 34 per cent believe former foreign secretary Boris Johnson would do a better job.And 38 per cent of people would vote for a new party on the right that was committed to Brexit, while 24 per cent are ready to support an explicitly far right anti-immigrant, anti-Islam party, according to the You Gov survey for the Sunday Times.The poll found that one in three voters are prepared to back a new anti-Brexit centrist party.–PA "},{"url":null,"title":"second brexit vote morally justified says john major","story":"  July 22, 2018Brexit secretary says UK could refuse to pay \u0026euro39bn \u0026lsquoorce bill\u0026rsquo without trade deal "},{"url":null,"title":"introducing telegraph new way get news","story":"Head of Digital PublishingMedia and Telecoms industryWe’ve made it even easier for you to get the news you want, when you want it. Introducing My , a new way to get the news.When you login to your  account you can now follow your favourite  writers and the subjects you’re most interested in to create a feed of news that’s just for you.Whether you want the wisdom of Charles Moore, want post-match insight from Paul Hayward or need straight-talking lifestyle advice from Bryony Gordon, the My Feed feature gives you a truly personalised experience of The .The first time you use My , we\u0027ll present a selection of popular subjects and writers to get you started.

He has been jailed for fraud after using charity money to purchase watercolour paintings and hotel staysThe chief executive of an education charity who used the company credit card to splash out on a his honeymoon and paintings at Bonhams auction house has been jailed for six years.Philip Bujak, 58, swindled more than £180,000 from the Montessori organisation to fund his luxury lifestyle and four family reunions at a four star hotel.Bujak, who earned up to £170,000 a year as CEO from 2003 until mid-2014, also arranged kickbacks with a friend who owned a printing company to overcharge Montessori around £60,000.His most lucrative scam came from the sale of Montessori\u0027s St Nicholas Prep school, at Princes Gate - a £13m property overlooking Hyde Park.Bujak used a company called Foris Fortuna to act as \u0027agent\u0027 in the sale of Princes Gate and net himself and Adrian Dugdale, 46, a total of around £150,000.The former army officer was finally rumbled when the charity\u0027s finance officer noticed one supposed business trip coincided with his honeymoon.Bujak shook his head and sighed in the dock as he was sentenced at Southwark Crown Court.Judge Peter Testar, said: Mr Bujak has an extremely strong personality - I think for the first time in my career, I saw a defendant bullying counsel.The sustained high levels of aggression shown by Mr Bujak were quite extraordinary.Right thinking people will be astonished and appalled to discover what Mr Bujak did in taking advantage as the CEO.Dugdale was spared jail for VAT fraud after Judge Peter Testar described him as a decent man who was led into this by others.Bujak was issued with a company credit card shortly after joining the charity as Chief Executive Officer in 2003.He created false invoices to cover up personal spending on the company credit card, describing hotel bills and Selfridges shopping sprees as conference and PRadvert.Bujak even used the credit card to pay for restoration and framing of the watercolours of warships which he had bought at auction with the very same card.He billed Montessori four times between 2010 and 2013 for various family reunions at The De Vere hotel at Dunston Hall, in Norwich.This hotel was a favourite haunt of the Bujak family,\u0027 said prosecutor Benjamin Douglas-Jones QC.On four occasions between 2010 and 2013 Mr Bujak, through the use of the credit card, paid for various family events that where held there.He one bill for £465 on 2 October 2010 was for a charity conference when it was really for his mother\u0027s 80th birthday party.Several other family reunions costing nearly £2,000 each time were also labelled on bank statements in this way.Chinese premier calls for severe punishment amid growing anger over vaccine scandalBritain will \u0026#39thrive\u0026#39 even if there is no Brexit deal, minister says, as David Davis calls on PM to \u0026#39reset\u0026#39 her planOctober \u0026#34National Album Day\u0026#34 launched by record industry to revive formatUK recycling system \u0026#39open to fraud and error\u0026#39, watchdog warnsFly-tipping and speeding: rural communities living in fear as confidence in police dropsUnforgotten, series 3 episode 2 recap: beware the red herrings UK drops death penalty and Guantanamo opposition and opens door to execution of \u0026#39Beatles\u0026#39 jihadists in USThey killed in cold blood - now the \u0026#39Beatles\u0026#39 face prospect of trial in US, the country they reviled the mostComment: Why does it appear there is one law for jihadis, and one for the rest? TV advertisers should have a mental health duty of care, health chiefs demandVince Cable missed key Brexit votes to attend \u0026#39confidential dinner\u0026#39 where \u0026#39anti-Brexit movement was discussed\u0026#39Comment: While Sadiq Khan virtue signals, young Londoners are dying.

In 2013, Burberry incinerated £5.5m of unwanted stock, less than a fifth of last year’s total.“The stuff that Burberry is burning is not waste – it is surplus, which is a very different concept. It is perfectly useable stuff,” said Orsola de Castro, cofounder of Fashion Revolution, a not-for-profit group that campaigns for greater transparency in the supply chain.The fashion designer told The Independent clothing brands destroying “vast quantities” of stock was a “massive, massive issue” that was “absolutely not unique to Burberry”.“In the case of the big brands, it’s absolutely very negative for them to suddenly have the same product with slashed prices,” she said.“Burberry, I can imagine, is particularly concerned about this because we all know that it went through a huge image change from sort of shabby to high gloss, high fashion. So they are probably worried about making things cheap and rolling back the clock.“It is brand protection, in this case. They don’t want it to go to the wrong people.”Burberry’s clothes are priced at the high end of fashion retail, with men’s polo shirts selling for as much as £250 and its famous trench coats priced at around £1,500.The company also sells perfumes and cosmetics, which accounted for £10.4m of the products destroyed last year.Fashion Revolution in picturesDestroying stock has become common practice for the industry, with retailers describing it as a measure to protect intellectual property and prevent illegal counterfeiting.Burberry\u0026nbspsaid it only destroyed items that carried its trademark and only worked with specialist companies who were able to harness the energy from the process.A spokesman said: “Burberry has careful processes in place to minimise the amount of excess stock we produce.\u0026nbspOn the occasions when disposal of products is necessary, we do so in a responsible manner and we continue to seek ways to reduce and revalue our waste.”\u0026nbspBurberry\u0026nbsprecently joined the Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s Make Fashion Circular initiative to help prevent waste in the industry, he added.Last year it emerged a Swedish power plant was burning unwanted H\u0026ampM clothes instead of coal.\u0026nbspThe plant in Vasteras, northwest of Stockholm, incinerated 15 tonnes of the retailer’s products in the first 11 months of the year.H\u0026ampM stressed it did not burn “any clothes that are safe to use” and said much of the destroyed stock was mouldy\u0026nbspor contaminated with lead.Ms De Castro called on the industry to be more open about the amount of clothing that was going to waste.She added: “We need to slow down. It doesn’t need to be drastic but it does need to happen, because whatever Burberry does with this stuff is not going to be environmentally friendly. There is no way of disposing of this amount of clothing in a way that is not environmentally invasive.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

They are named as a Schedule 1 animal in the 1972 Wildlife Protection Act –\u0026nbspmeaning those who abuse them can face up to seven years in prison.Yet the fate of around 3,500 captive elephants remains a grey area in India’s laws. Licences to keep them can be obtained from the state’s chief wildlife warden, and in 2016 the Supreme Court observed that the animals could be kept as long as owners are not “unkind to elephants”.Mr Satyanarayan said international tourists and the public in general “need to understand what goes on behind the curtain, the ugly, vicious, evil trade that this whole thing inculcates”.\u0026nbspWoman mauled by lion after entering enclosure to take photographThousands more scientific experiments being carried out on horsesBadger cull exercise cost taxpayers £76,000 for each animal killedCircus elephant falls into audience in GermanyCommercially successful elephant attractions “create a demand that drives more poaching, more brutality, more illegal elephant trafficking and more captive elephants”, he said.“Every person who rides an elephant must know that, for a few minutes of their joy, it’s a life of nightmares for that elephant.”In a statement to The Independent, TripAdvisor said its 2016 policies to improve animal welfare standards in the tourism industry “focused on the experiences sector”, while Jungle Book was classified as accommodation on its website.“We do not have a direct booking relationship with all accommodations on our site, the booking options are often provided by partners, and therefore we are not currently in a position to vet them in the same way,” a spokesperson said.“That said, our commitment doesn’t stop with experiences.\u0026nbspWe are always considering the evolution of this policy, including exploring ways in which TripAdvisor can drive positive change in the tourism accommodation sector too.” Travellers who were unhappy with animal welfare standards at their accommodation should “write a review to warn others”, the spokesperson said.Thomas Cook said the review mentioning its rep was from 18 months ago and that the agency “does not sell that excursion and has not for some time”.A TUI spokesperson said at the time of publication that they would not be able to provide a full statement until they can “investigate this thoroughly with the resort”.The company that operates Jungle Book, Goa Ecotourism Adventures, did not respond to multiple requests for comment by email. A person manning the phones at the resort said they were unable to comment on the elephants’ welfare, and that director Joseph Barreto was out of country. Calls to a man identified as the manager of the hotel went unanswered.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

With an estimated worth of $1bn, a trade body and a recognised marketing award, they have finally been tamedClick to followThe Independent OnlinePep talk: Kendall Jenner’s Pepsi advert was pulled shortly after it aired for appearing to trivialise demonstrations tackling social causesLast month, the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity –\u0026nbspthe biggest grouping of advertising and marketing people you could ever hope to avoid –\u0026nbspintroduced a new award: the Social and Influencer\u0026nbspcategory.Yes, those\u0026nbspgurning thumb-flexers forever punching #YOLO, #instacool and #nofilter into their smartphones as they plug products have come of age.\u0026nbspInfluencer-dom is now a fully-fledged industry. Yet only a year or two ago we were told by many (rather gleefully in some cases) that the influencer was dead or at least in crisis.Earlier this year, this seemed to be confirmed as the owner of the White Moose Cafe in Dublin turned the tables on\u0026nbsp22-year-old YouTube vlogger and influencer Elle Darby, by exposing her demand for five free hotel nights in return for exposure.His public burn spoke for many: “If I let you stay here in return for a feature in a video, who is going to pay the staff who look after you?” The twitter-mob turned on influencers. Who were they? How do they get away with it? Do they actually earn money?When the influencer marketing industry began (around 2008-10, attest the form’s historians) the notion took hold that like celebrity endorsement before it, aspirational people could become marketing tools, accessing the consumer mind as if a recommendation from a friend.YouTuber with 139,095 subscribers, was refused a free hotel stay (YouTubeElle Darby)As one observer put it:\u0026nbsp“They emerged almost overnight and in 10 years have gone from a small network to a worldwide community.” Some sources suggest that there is now a baseline of 1.1 million influencers worldwide.\u0026nbspMediakix estimated\u0026nbspthe industry was worth more than $1bn\u0026nbsp(£750m)\u0026nbspin 2017. Malcolm Gladwell’s coinage, “the tipping point”, was used a lot in meetings.\u0026nbspBy about 2014, a baffled world had started to understand influencer marketing, but the industry’s breakthrough year was probably 2016 when, as Hamda Issa-Salwe of Bravado, part of Universal Music Group, found when she did a research thesis called Investigating the Use of Influencer Marketing on Social Media.“It began to soar,” she says. “Google classified ‘influencer’ as a breakout keyword with a 5,000 per cent month by month increase in the number of times the search term ‘influencer marketing’ was typed.”Also in 2016, it was established that Kendall Jenner was paid an estimated $300,000 per social media post. Advertising agencies took more careful notice of influencers and Instagram –\u0026nbspfounded in 2010 – became the key station of the social media cross, along with other key platforms\u0026nbspsuch as YouTube, Snapchat and Pinterest.Even the fustiest legacy-media type can now see the point. The barrier to entry is low. All you need is a smartphone and a certain brio. And the research seems to add up. According to Nielsen, 84 per cent\u0026nbspof consumers trust opinions from people they know, while 70 per cent\u0026nbsptake action based on other consumer’s opinions online.vlogger Zoella reportedly has a net worth of £2.5m (InstagramZoella)The Association of National Advertisers found that 75 per cent\u0026nbspof members already work with influencers, and the growing industry will take 20 per cent\u0026nbspof the total global marketing budget by 2023.No wonder that 82 per cent\u0026nbspof millennials hope to become influencers at least, according to a survey by London-based dating app CLiKD.\u0026nbspSo the money’s talking, and influencers can do well.It seems a great life but you don’t want to be that person with a fridgeful of isotonic drinks and unable to pay the rentAs Anthony Svirskis, CEO\u0026nbspof TRIBE and a juror on the\u0026nbspSocial and Influencer award says:\u0026nbsp“On a post by post basis, brands should expect to pay £50 for someone with 3,000 followers and upwards of £300 if someone has more than 100,000 followers.” Small wonder the market is seething with aspirant influencers.\u0026nbspYet influencers are still derided as being without any particular skills: even that they’re the apotheosis of the entitled “Me” generation, spreading paid-for blandishments in vocal-fry vlogs on YouTube.While it’s hard to blame someone who travels the world in return for Instagram snaps, is there an influencer bubble waiting to burst? Paul Dyer, of marketing company Lippe Taylor, believes it will, as trust has disappeared from the sector in the sceptical Facebook-Cambridge Analytica era.“There is tremendous value in influencer marketing,” he said recently. “However, many current practices are only speeding us to the precipice where the bottom falls out.”Indeed, there have been several influencer #epicfails, perhaps the most notable being\u0026nbspFyre\u0026nbspFestival, the ill-fated 2017 Bahamas musical festival that paid Kendall Jenner and Bella\u0026nbspHadid\u0026nbspto drum up support.\u0026nbspFyre\u0026nbspbombed and the repercussions are ongoing.There’s also an undergrowth of freebie-hunting influencers harassing hotels and providers. Some hotels – the\u0026nbspDusit\u0026nbspThani\u0026nbspresort in the Males among them – now use weeding out processes. “When they work hotels love them,” says one travel PR.\u0026nbspThe influencer economy … is a market irrationality. Companies are self-correcting in the face of so much wasted money“Influencers are uncritical and often share films and photographs that would otherwise be paid for. But there’s a trust problem.”There are other cracks in the influencer edifice as brands begin to ask questions about the business efficacy of influencers. As publicist Mark Borkowski says:\u0026nbsp“More brands are beginning to realise that influencer activity doesn’t necessarily drive ROI.”And the pain is on both sides, he adds. “It seems a great life but you don’t want to be that person with a fridgeful of isotonic drinks and unable to pay the rent.” Anti-influencers are coming of the woodwork –\u0026nbspand they’re not all crusty oldies with a grudge.“The influencer economy … is a market irrationality,” wrote Sam Biddle of Gawker in 2016. “Companies are self-correcting in the face of so much wasted money.” As for bots and fake followers, that’s a real problem.Fyre Festival attendees locked in airport ‘for their own safety’At Cannes, Unilever’s chief marketing officer Keith Weed called for industry action to clean out the influencer stable, and vowed never to use influencers found to be buying followers.So the sands are shifting. Hamda Issa-Salwe says that while influencer activity remains hard to define and audit, it’s still growing. Although trust and authenticity (the great influencer bon mot) are major factors, brands still spend a lot on influencers: after all,\u0026nbspInstagram has more 800 million monthly active users.And the influencers themselves are fighting back. It’s a new industry: of course legacy dinosaurs wouldn’t get it. It’s just another marketing tool. And what are –\u0026nbspsorry, were –\u0026nbspnewspapers half the time, but a vehicle of paid-for information?“Indeed, there’s a growing distrust of traditional media advertising,” says Harry Hugo, cofounder at The Goat Agency, Europe’s leading influencer agency, which claims to be growing at a rate of 600 per cent\u0026nbspa year.“Just look at the rise in ad blockers, investigations into media transparency and big networks like WPP struggling. Influencers can be one of the most trusted, and therefore highest converting, information sources for people.”\u0026nbspAlso, we jeremiahs just don’t get the craft and graft that goes into an influencer’s brand persona, adds Florencia Lujani, influencer marketing manager at agency We Are Social London.“People struggle to see why brands would pay money to partner with influencers for something which appears relatively simple,” she says. “But it takes time and effort, talent, passion and commitment.”\u0026nbspAnd even the thorny issue of disclosure –\u0026nbspthat is, whether you should know what someone is being paid to promote –\u0026nbspis a smaller issue than is often supposed, says Svirskis. “Influencers are very compliant of requirements to disclose and are often represented by an influencer agency.”There is tremendous value in influencer marketing. However, many current practices are only speeding us to the precipice where the bottom falls outMost importantly of all, influencers make money for clients. Currently, the average ROI of influencer marketing is £7 back for every £1 spent, says Amelia Neate of Influencer Champions.\u0026nbspSo,\u0026nbspdo you have to be pretty? “It’s definitely not reserved for those with looks,” says Svirskis. “The cheesy smiles are long gone.” It’s about style and tone, he says, and as the industry matures it’s moving beyond lifestyle products like travel, beauty and fashion to finance, automotive –\u0026nbspeven dog food.“There are new influencers emerging every day, in every single vertical,” says Lujani. They’re marshalling themselves into communities: mummy bloggers, healthy eaters, sports fans – why, possibly even news organisations.\u0026nbspWith the maturation of the influencer world comes a shakeout: Influencer 2.0, if you will. Sheer numbers don’t matter so much anymore.\u0026nbspThe smart talk is now about engagement and micro-influencers,\u0026nbspthose with fewer than 100,000 followers and possibly as low as 5,000, but with proper peer recognition.\u0026nbspYouTuber Alfie Deyes came under fire for his recent video, ‘How I lived off £1 for a day’ (YouTubePointlessBlogVlogs)“Data shows that influence by measure of engagement actually increases as the audience size reduces,” says Svirskis. In a hedge-betting strategy, brands now prefer to work with 50 micro-influencers rather than one mega-influencer, and brands are taking influencer management in-house as influencer marketing moves into the mainstream.If children are obese then blame food manufacturers, not ZoellaInvestigation promised into Trump campaign data firmThree arrested after Facebook group raid cannabis field – only to Sexist men who abuse women on Facebook and Twitter are compensating“Most new industries go through periods of turbulence as they form foundations,” says Svirskis, who thinks that many of today’s influencers will become tomorrow’s creative directors and entrepreneurs.He has a point. Beauty influencer Emily Weiss now has a cosmetic company, Glossier, and within the last couple of weeks M\u0026ampC Saatchi bought a stake in two influencer agencies. There’s even a new trade body, the Influencer Marketing Association.Circle the wagons and don’t be a #filterfaker\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspthe wild influencer west is being tamed.Cannes Lions International Festival of CreativityEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

However Mr Bannon did not indicate how the project would be funded.He said he believed that right-wing populist nationalism is the future of Europe after decades of integration.The Brexit referendum victory in 2016 was followed by the election of Donald Trump in the US and the rise of right-winger Matteo\u0026nbspSalvini to become Italy\u0027s deputy prime minister this year.World news in picturesIsraeli-annexed Golan Heights  shows a smoke plume rising across the border in Quneitra in southwestern Syria, as rebels destroy their arms stocks prior to their departure.

Some 98 of 204 households from\u0026nbspGrenfell\u0026nbspTower and Walk have not yet moved into a permanent houses, more than a year after the blaze that killed 72 people, according to a statement released by housing secretary on Thursday.“Some survivors still remain without a home of their own, and the council has accepted that a significant number of other households affected by the disaster are not likely to have their housing needs met potentially for years,\u0026nbspMr Diner continued.“These vacant properties could be vital to rehousing Grenfell survivors and those whose lives have been changed forever by the disaster. The council must therefore urgently get a grip on its vacant housing stock and bring it up to standard to address the chronic housing need in the borough.”Grenfell Tower Inquiry: photos of inside the flat where fire beganKitchen in flat 16 where the fire startedThe kitchen from flat 16The kitchen from flat 16Hallway in flat 16, leading to the kitchen where the fire startedThe kitchen from flat 16The kitchen from flat 16Bedroom in flat 16Living room in flat 16Toilet in flat 16Living room in flat 16Bedroom 2 of flat 16Bedroom in flat 16Bedroom 2 of flat 16The kitchen from flat 16Kitchen in flat 16 where the fire startedDoor to flat 16 from the lobby on floor 4Living room in flat 16Hallway in flat 16Kitchen in flat 16 where the fire startedThe kitchen from flat 16The kitchen from flat 16Hallway in flat 16, leading to the kitchen where the fire startedThe kitchen from flat 16The kitchen from flat 16Bedroom in flat 16Living room in flat 16Toilet in flat 16Living room in flat 16Bedroom 2 of flat 16Bedroom in flat 16Bedroom 2 of flat 16The kitchen from flat 16Kitchen in flat 16 where the fire startedDoor to flat 16 from the lobby on floor 4Living room in flat 16Hallway in flat 16Shadow housing minister John Healey said: “It is shameful that council homes sit empty while fewer than half of the families who survived the Grenfell Tower fire have been rehoused, more than a year on from the fire.“Government ministers could and should have taken over this failing council but have chosen not to.“What was a national disaster is becoming a national disgrace and the Government must now step in to ensure all survivors have permanent homes so they can start to rebuild their lives.”The Independent\u0026nbsphas contacted the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea\u0026nbspfor comment.\u0026nbsproyal borough of kensington and chelseaEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

In preparation for the demo, David and our guitarist Neville Wills wrote two to three songs.“We had decided that we would do a couple of guitar instrumentals and one original song.

She’s travelled in and out of the UK with this passport many times before. But the woman on the gate didn’t understand the IDLR stamp.\u0026nbspIt was a shock for us. I tried to explain that she had been through Heathrow and Gatwick with this stamp with no issue whatsoever many times before, but they denied us on board.Ahmed said his\u0026nbspfamily were left waiting on the floor in the airport for more than two hours after missing their flight due to the questions over Ms Begen\u0027s passportHe added: “My five and nine and 11 year old were really upset. My daughter was crying. They’ve been left traumatised by what happened.”Mr Ahmed said that after they had missed the flight staff took the family to customer services, where\u0026nbspthey waited on the floor outside the office for two and a half hours\u0026nbspwith no refreshments.They were then told\u0026nbspthey should go home and wait for them to get in touch.“This was a family holiday which we don’t often do because I have a busy job. We were really looking forward to it. We had booked the\u0026nbsphotel, everything was paid. We’d been planning this for a long time, he said.“My wife has been discriminated against. It looked like the staff at the gate were inexperienced and not specialised in immigration control.

That’s not fair and it’s why we want to see further progress quickly.”The criticism comes after Dominic Raab, the Brexit secretary, hinted that – even in a no-deal Brexit – the UK would unilaterally guarantee the rights of EU citizens here.Theresa May has been criticised for refusing to act in the two years since the referendum, having blocked David Cameron’s proposal to guarantee all rights back in 2016.A government spokesperson defended its plans for settled status, saying: “The process will be straightforward and streamlined and we will support applicants to get the right outcome.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

It has difficulties,” he warned, but he added: “Is it morally justified?

We now know they are not going to be met.“A referendum isn\u0027t an easy option, but it\u0027s not one at this stage that I would rule out.”Sir John’s comments came after the new Brexit secretary refused to set out the no deal planning the government is making – despite insisting the UK would “thrive”.Dominic Raab condemned “hair-raising stories” that food will be stockpiled, and motorways turned into lorry parks, if Britain crashes out of the EU with no agreement.However, Mr Raab would not say what preparations are being made, beyond the hiring of extra border staff, while hinting the public would be told more in the coming months.Nicky Morgan, a leading pro-EU Tory insisted parliament would not allow a no-deal outcome – provided her fellow Conservatives were brave enough to speak out.Raab refuses to set out government\u0027s no deal Brexit planCable refuses to say if he missed Brexit votes to discuss new partyFox launches bid for US trade deal and to join Pacific trade groupMinisters will be sent across Europe to rescue Brexit planHome Office doesn\u0027t know how many customs officers it has“I do believe there is a majority in parliament, there’s a majority on the Conservative benches, who would not accept a no deal,” she told the BBC.“They have got to find the courage to voice that and to make that very clear – and we are running out of time.”Asked if he backed a further referendum, Sir John replied: “Would you buy a house without knowing the price? No, you would not.“Should we finally decide to leave Europe without knowing the cost of doing so? And by the cost, I don’t just mean to the Government, to the nation.

claim that Bank study shows no deal outcome \u0027worse for EU\u0027Dominic Raab is under fire after partially retracting a claim that the Bank of England believes the EU will be hit harder than the UK by a no-deal Brexit.The Brexit department\u0026nbspadmitted\u0026nbspto The Independent\u0026nbspthat the Bank’s analysis referred only to one aspect of financial services – not to each side’s overall economic performance.The embarrassing concession sparked accusations that Mr Raab was trying to keep voters in the dark about the impact of crashing out of the EU without a deal.The row blew up after he refused to explain the no-deal planning the government is making – despite insisting the UK would “thrive” in those circumstances.“Dominic Raab tried to claim that a no-deal Brexit would be worse for the EU than for the UK,” said a spokesperson for the anti-Brexit People’s Vote campaign.“Now he says he only meant derivatives, so he must know that for manufacturing, services and every other sector of our economy, no deal is the worst possible outcome.”Derivatives are financial instruments typically traded by hedge funds to speculate on the future direction of interest rates, or the value of commodities.Last week, Mark Carney, the Bank of England governor, warned the EU against failing to put in place a contingency plan for tens of trillions of pounds of outstanding derivatives after Brexit.Such a failure would hurt the EU more than Britain because its banks and corporations trade mainly in the City of London and would be left scrambling to make alternative arrangements.However, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned the overall UK economy would suffer more than the EU’s – losing 4 per cent of national output, compared with 1.5 per cent across the Channel.Brexit Resignation: July 10th 2018 Maria Caulfield MP Conservative Party\u0027s vice chair for women July 10th 2018Brexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conservative MP for Bolton West Chris

organisations have reached similar conclusions, including, before the referendum, the OECD, which estimated a 5.1 per cent hit over 15 years from a no-deal Brexit.The government’s own leaked internal analysis of a falling back on World Trade Organisation rules estimated a loss of up to 10.3 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP).On the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show, Mr Raab was asked if he accepted the “really dramatic decline” for the UK’s economy, forecast by the IMF.In reply, he said: “Well, there’s been all sorts of analysis done.Brexit will allow tighter controls on sale of real fur in UK, say

groupMinisters will be sent across Europe to rescue Brexit plan“The Bank of England has produced an analysis which showed that it wouldn’t be the best outcome for either side, but it would – in a material way, aspects – be worse for the EU side.”Asked what Mr Raab was referring to, a spokesman for the department for exiting the European Union (DExEU) said it was the comments made by the Bank’s governor in evidence given to MPs last week.Asked if he could point to any study predicting a bigger overall loss for the EU, he replied: “The Brexit secretary was referring to Mr Carney’s comments about derivatives.”During the TV interview, Mr Raab condemned “hair-raising stories” that food will be stockpiled, and motorways turned into lorry parks, if Britain crashes out of the EU with no agreement.However, he declined to say what preparations are being made, beyond the hiring of extra border staff, while hinting the public would be told more in the coming months.Enter your email

Trade unions called the delays “scandalous” and suggested minsters were trying to brush the issue under the carpet.In 2016, ministers announced plans to crack down on exploitative practices by banning or restricting employers taking tips that are given to staff, and making a voluntary code of practice for employers legally binding.It followed The Independent’s Fair Tips, Fair Pay\u0026nbspcampaign, which revealed that a number of large restaurant chains were taking staff tips and using them to top up the wages of workers who were being paid less than the minimum wage.UK news in picturesExiting the European Union Secretary Dominic Raab on The Andrew Marr ShowGreat Britain\u0027s Tom Bosworth poses after winning the men\u0027s 3000m race walk with a new World Record time at the IAAF Diamond League athletics anniversary games meeting in LondonBritish Prime Minister Theresa May delivers a keynote speech at the Waterfront Hall in Belfast.

Others, including Italian chain Strada, take a proportion of tips paid on card as a “handling charge”.Some firms, including Jamie Oliver’s Italian chain, have also been found to charge waiting staff a proportion of the bills paid by the people they serve, which is then distributed to other staff.The official consultation on clamping down on the practices closed on 27 June 2016 but the government is yet to respond to it.Ministers do not appear to have even started work on a response. Asked whether the government\u0026nbsphad\u0026nbspa copy of any\u0026nbspdraft response to the consultation, a Department for Business, Enterprise and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) official said: “Following a search of our paper and electronic records, I have established that the information you requested is not held by this department.”Pushed on why it has still not published a response to the consultation, a BEIS spokesperson said: “The government is still considering options and will respond in due course.”Announcing the plans in 2016, Sajid Javid, then the business secretary and now the home secretary, said: “We’ve been very clear. As a one nation government we want workers who earn a tip to be able to keep it. That’s why I, like many others, was disappointed by the tipping practices of some of our well-known chains. This has to change.”Ministers were prepared to make legislative changes to protect workers, he added.An earlier government call\u0026nbspfor evidence had found more than 80 per cent of people thought staff should be allowed to keep the tips they earn.Commenting on the lack of government action, Ms Peacock, who recently introduced a Commons bill on protecting workers’ rights, said: “This month marks two years since the government closed its consultation on fair tips. The Tories promised it would lead to action, yet they now admit that they haven’t even started drafting a response.“While ministers drag their feet, workers and customers alike are being ripped off by rogue bosses who are grabbing tips that were intended for staff.She added: “It is appalling that staff, often in precarious employment, are going into another busy summer season without the basic protection they deserve, with workers at TGI Fridays worked to take strike action to demand their share.“Government inaction will only fuel the suspicion that they have quitely abandoned their promises and\u0026nbspwant to let rogue bosses off the hook. Ministers should come clean, and if they’re going to take real action to stop this scandal, they need to get on with it.”Dave Turnbull, regional officer at Unite,\u0026nbspsaid:\u0026nbsp“It’s scandalous that the government appears to have not even started drafting a response yet.“Every day that passes since its consultation on fair tips closed is another day that allows bad bosses to exploit low paid workers. It gives the likes of TGI Fridays the opportunity to interfere and manipulate the systems used to distribute tips internally to rip off workers and customers alike.“Government ministers will be sorely mistaken if they think this issue will go away and they can brush it under the carpet. Unite will not allow that to happen.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

In the new year, new groups may emerge.“I’m not sure who, or how they’ll be configured. But I predict it is going to happen and my instincts are that if they’re aligned with us on basic values, we can work with them.

Up to 8,000 lions are kept in more than 200 “canned hunting” breeding facilities. But experts believe they are helping to fuel wildlife trafficking by creating demand.Between 2008 and 2015, the South African\u0026nbspDepartment of Environmental Affairs issued permits for the export of more than 5,363 lion skeletons, research has shown. Last year the business brought in an estimated 16m South African rand (£908,000), according to the Captured in Africa Foundation.The new report’s key recommendations include:A zero-export quota on lion and other big-cat body parts for commercial purposes, including from captive sourcesA forensic investigation into the financial affairs of all lion breeders and bone tradersRestricting the keeping and breeding of big catsReviewing and improving animal protection and welfare legislationEnsuring that animal protection, welfare, care and respect are included in law, particularly in relation to permits for the keeping, sale, hunting and exporting of wild animals and body partsHowever, the department has approved an annual quota of 1,500 lion skeletons for export, almost double the previous year’s quota of 800.Linda Tucker‚ founder and head of the Global White Lion Protection Trust‚ wrote a heartfelt letter to President Cyril Ramaphosa‚ appealing to him to reverse the move.“Factory farming lions for killing is not a policy South Africa can defend, neither the old nor the new South Africa,” she wrote.Hunter \u0027gored to death by buffalo\u0027 moments after killing herd memberBig game hunter shot dead as he aimed at lion he wanted to killBig game hunter trampled to death by elephant in Namibia“As I write to you‚ 1,500 of our lions‚ incarcerated under abysmal conditions‚ have been committed to slaughterhouses in the inappropriately named ‘Free State’.“Once vilified for apartheid‚ our country will go down in history for legalising crimes against nature that supersede the wrongs perpetrated by the illegal trade in animal parts.“For our international reputation and true moral compass‚ I call upon you with all my heart to repeal this heinous legacy.”The South African government has justified the trade in bones as a by-product of the hunting industry and claimed the increased quota has been prompted by a growing stockpile.Spokesperson Albi Modise said the quota was based on a research project established by the SA National Bioersity Institute with Oxford University and the University of Kent which said there had been no discernible increase in the poaching of wild lions, although there appeared to be an increase in the poaching of captive-bred lions for body parts.But The Extinction Business\u0026nbspreport said by calculating the weight of consignments, experts believe\u0026nbspexporters are exceeding the export quotas – unchecked by Cites.It stated the industry is de facto fully supported by the state, “despite widespread opposition to the practice which is considered extremely cruel, linked to international criminal networks, a threat to Africa’s \u0026nbspwild animals population and run by a small monopoly \u0026nbspof operators purely for financial gain.Where not to visit if you love animalsChimpanzees are forced to perform demeaning tricks on leashes and are often subject to cruel training techniques. Animals who are confined to small, barren enclosures and forced to perform unsurprisingly show symptoms of stress and depression. Chimpanzees have been documented rocking back and forth, sucking their lips, salivating and swaying against enclosure perimeters in distress.29 Swimming with dolphinsSome marine parks use bottlenose dolphins in performances and offer visitors the opportunity to swim with dolphins. Unfortunately, people are often unaware that these animals are captured in the wild and torn from their families or traded between different parks around the world.Tigers are forced to live in an unnatural and barren environment and have to endure interactions with a constant stream of tourists. Since tigers never lose their wild instincts, across the world they are reportedly drugged, mutilated and restrained in order to make them “safe” for the public. However, every year, incidents of tiger maulings are reported at this type of tourist attraction.Sunning on the beach is great for humans – we can take a quick dip or catch a bite to eat when we get too hot or hungry. But it\u0027s pure hell for donkeys who are confined to the beach and forced to cart children around on the hot sand. Some donkey-ride operators at beach resorts in the UK even keep the animals chained together at all times. Some parks confine orcas to concrete tanks and force them to perform meaningless tricks for food - many die in captivity. Orcas are highly intelligent and social mammals who may suffer immensely, both physically and mentally, when they\u0027re held in captivity.Lions are confined to fenced areas so that they can easily be cornered, with no chance of escape. Most of them will have been bred in captivity and then taken from their mothers to be hand-reared by the cub-petting industry. When they get too big, they may be drugged before they are released into a hunting enclosure. Because these animals are usually kept in fenced enclosures (ranging in size from just a few square yards to thousands of acres), they never stand a chance of surviving.79 Running of the BullsEvery year, tourists travel to Pamplona for the Running of the Bulls. The bulls who are forced to slip and slide down the town\u0027s narrow cobblestone streets are chased straight into the bullring. They are then taunted, stabbed repeatedly and finally killed by the matador in front of a jeering crowd. The majority of Spaniards reject bullfighting, but tourists are keeping the cruel industry on its last legs. City streets are no place for horses. The animals toil in all weather extremes, suffering from respiratory distress from breathing in exhaust fumes as well as numerous hoof, leg and back problems from walking on pavement all day long. As easily spooked prey animals, horses subjected to the loud noises and unexpected sounds of city streets are likely to be involved in accidents, even deadly ones. The zoo community regards the animals it keeps as commodities, and animals are regularly bought, sold, borrowed and traded without any regard for established relationships. Zoos breed animals because the presence of babies draws visitors and boosts revenue, yet often, there\u0027s nowhere to put the offspring as they grow, and they are killed, as we recently saw with Marius the giraffe in Denmark.

The Campaign Against Canned Hunting believes the bone trade is one of several damaging activities involving lions: the others are captive breeding, cub petting, volunteering and lion walks.President of the Born Free Foundation,\u0026nbspWill Travers, said earlier this year: “Unwitting tourists fuel this despicable industry by participating in activities such as petting cubs and walking with lions, while unsuspecting volunteers rear cubs in the mistaken belief they are destined to be released into the wild.“Once adult, many of these animals are moved to canned hunting\u0026nbspfacilities to be shot in enclosures by ‘sport hunters’. Their bones are then sold into an international trade sanctioned by the South African government.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Outside academics were brought in to collect and study the resulting data.In a survey of staff taken late last year, only 54 per cent of respondents said they felt able to manage their work-life balance. After the trial, that number jumped to 78 per cent. Stress levels decreased by around seven per cent, while metrics used to measure team engagement rose by around a fifth.Mr Barnes said employees also became more productive, spending less time on social media or non-work activity. One staff member told the CEO he had stopped looking at emails from his wife about an apartment search during work hours.What happens is you get a motivated, energized, stimulated, loyal work force, said Mr Barnes.

Kosher meat requires all animals to be conscious at the point of slaughter.“We are checking whether the meat requirement can be linked to the place of residence,” he said, according to Austrian newspaper Wiener Zeitung.\u0026nbspWorld news in picturesIsraeli-annexed Golan Heights  shows a smoke plume rising across the border in Quneitra in southwestern Syria, as rebels destroy their arms stocks prior to their departure.

Only the ruling\u0026nbspUnited Russia fraction voted for, with all of the controlled “opposition” parties voting against.\u0026nbspSeveral deputies in the ruling party, hitherto known for demonstrative displays of loyalty, were mysteriously absent from the vote.\u0026nbspThe main provisions of the reform see the pension age increase from 60 for men and 55 for women, to 65 and 63 respectively. Its sponsors say the changes are necessary to bring the law into line with new life expectancy figures. Pension ages were last set in 1936, when pensioners accounted for no more than 2 per cent of the population. \u0026nbsp“Life has changed,”\u0026nbspthe employment\u0026nbspminister\u0026nbspMaxim\u0026nbspTopilin\u0026nbsptold parliamentarians. “We can’t remain in the 1930s.”\u0026nbspThe contentious issue of pension reform has been raised several times in the last two decades, but the government has repeatedly chosen to delay. It presented the bill in\u0026nbspless than auspicious economic times. Most Russians have faced real-terms wage falls since 2014, and the outlook is grim.\u0026nbspMr Putin’s trust ratings have\u0026nbspfallen to the lowest recorded ebb since 2011 – below 38 percent, according to state pollsters.Critics have also railed against the way the pensions plan was communicated, announced with no discussion a few hours before kick off during the opening match of the World Cup, between hosts Russia and Saudi Arabia. Fnance\u0026nbspminister Anton Siluanov has insisted that this was a coincidence, but the public outcry was real.\u0026nbsp“It is a bastardly way to introduce reform,” said the former Kremlin adviser Gleb Pavlovsky in an interview on the Echo of Moscow radio station. “The people have a deal with the Kremlin in return for not protesting – and the most important part of that deal is that they are given the chance to survive.”\u0026nbspIn some regions\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspproposed pension ages fall below average life expectancy\u0026nbsp– in Chukotka,\u0026nbspin the country’s far east, the male life expectancy is 60.33, nearly five years below the proposed pension age.\u0026nbspFor many families\u0026nbspthe change will represent a fundamental shift to their way of life. Even according to state pollsters, eight out of\u0026nbsp10 Russians do not agree with the plans. There have already been\u0026nbspprotests against the reform.\u0026nbspOn the eve of the bill, 14 people were arrested at an unsanctioned rally in St Petersburg.\u0026nbspRegardless of whether significant protests follow, the relationship between the people and the state has changed forever,\u0026nbspsays the political analyst Ekaterina Schulmann\u0026nbsp“It is a tectonic shift. Even before the pension reform, people were viewing the state as less and less of a father figure. But the reform strengthens that perception.”In Ms Schulmann\u0027s view, these changes will affect the transfer of power between Vladimir Putin and his anointed successor, a process which may begin as early as 2021.\u0026nbspThe paw of Mr Putin has remained strangely hidden throughout the process. His press secretary,\u0026nbspDmitry Peskov, has distanced the president from the unpopular bill.\u0026nbspReports, on the other\u0026nbsphand, suggested the president approved the plan before its first reading. And all the while, state media have been kept under strict control. They have been told to avoid the word “reform”, to avoid associations with the “chaotic” 1990s, but nonetheless to keep close to a line emphasising the necessity of reform.\u0026nbspThere may not be protests, but the relationship between the people and the state has changed forever\u0026nbspBut the attempt to differentiate a\u0026nbspgood tsar from bad\u0026nbspboyars might not have been altogether successful.On the back of the controversy, trust\u0026nbspin Mr Putin has fallen to\u0026nbspthe lowest recorded\u0026nbspebb since 2011 – below 38 percent, according to state pollsters. And perhaps more significantly, the president’s ratings are falling steadily\u0026nbspin line with government popularity. This is the first time this has happened since the annexation of Crimea in 2014.\u0026nbspSome now wonder if the president is in danger of losing his Teflon coating.\u0026nbspIt may, of course, have been another coincidence, but on the eve and the day of the vote\u0026nbspthe Russian military released several videos purporting to show the testing of new cutting-edge “Avangard” and “Kinzhal” missiles. Russians are generally supportive of the president’s assertive foreign policy stance – as opposed to domestic policies with which they interact with every day.Propaganda directors may have decided to use the opportunity to play down\u0026nbspreaction to the proposal.\u0026nbspWelcome to the real Russia, on eve of electionRussia\u0027s imperial capital is the starting point of our journey Chudovo was one of the first stops of Radishchev\u0027s journeyThey say the fish rot from the head down429 On the way out of ChudovoWe choose our president, we choose our futurePeople have become fussy and want clear waterLife is just great Once the seat of a forward-looking republic — Russia\u0027s first experiment with democracy Once the seat of a forward-looking republic — Russia\u0027s first experiment with democracy Once the seat of a forward-looking republic — Russia\u0027s first experiment with democracy Navalny\u0027s activists continue campaign despite their leader being barred from the elections Thatcher was a bitch, but I liked her.

But the government had little choice but to press ahead – which it will now do.\u0026nbsp“Some concessions in timings and in exceptions may be possible, but the reform is inevitable,” Mr Kostin\u0026nbsptold The Independent.\u0026nbsp“You can’t ignore a situation where there will soon be one pensioner for every working age adult.

Hun Sen has accused the United States of supporting the CNRP and plotting a colour revolution to overthrow his government.In June last year, Khoeun Virath was elected as a commune councillor in the capital of Cambodia, but months later his political party was banned and most of its leadership fled into exile - so now he works as a tuk-tuk driver to make ends meet.He said: \u0026ldquoPeople here are afraid, people don\u0027t want to speak out.Cambodia election 2018: Government supporters pictured following last year\u0027s vote (Image: )The government said calls for a poll boycott are illegal and has invited 50,000 observers, including some from China, Myanmar and Singapore, to monitor the election.Soeung Sen Karuna, 41, an investigator for rights group Adhoc, one of the oldest rights groups in Cambodia, said his organisation had been accused of plotting a revolution and was finding it increasingly difficult to work.He said: \u0026ldquoNGOs who work in other sectors are scared of cooperating with us.Five members of Adhoc were detained without trial for 14 months before being released on bail last year. They were charged with bribing a witness in a case against the now-jailed opposition leader, Kem Sokha. Supporters of Kem Sokha say the charges are politically motivated.Another person who knows the lengths to which authorities will go to silence critics is Ma Chetra, 28, who runs the Social Breaking News Facebook page, said he has also been targeted by the government over the page, which hosts news about land-rights protests, forced evictions, and other issues the government considers sensitive.Ma Chetra said he has fled Cambodia several times since 2017 after police sent a photograph of him with a group of activists at Phnom Penh\u0027s international airport. The activists were heading to Indonesia for a workshop on democracy, he said, but police circulated the image with the caption: A group of youths who went to train to conduct a colour revolution.The photograph, seen by Reuters, lists the names and some of the mobile phone numbers of those on the trip.Some of the group have since fled to the United States and France. Others are in Cambodia, but are keeping a low profile.Khoeun Virath said the best hope for opponents of Hun Sen is pressure from exiled leaders and the international community.He said: \u0026ldquoWith diplomatic pressure from abroad there can be a lot of momentum."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/galleries/x701/204942.jpg","title":"iran earthquake kerman Hormozgan","story":"Iran earthquake: More than 250 people were hurt in today\u0027s earthquake (Image: EMSC-CSEM)Houshang Bazvand, governor of the affected province of Kermanshah in western Iran, said at least 287 people had been hurt in the 5.9 quake.\u0026nbspEight of the injured had been hospitalised and the rest were released after treatment, he said.Eastern Iran was also struck by a separate 5.5 magnitude quake today, with residents of the city of Kerman expressing their shock on earthquake tracking website EMSC-CSEM.One Kerman resident said: \u0026ldquoWow.

Sadly, a year or so later they also voted to keep the appalling Anna Soubry as their local MP. Let’s hope they never make that mistake again.For the last year this bilious, jabbering woman has done everything she possibly can to thwart the will of her electors.She is a staunch Remainer and is seemingly prepared to bring down the Government to get her way. Her actions suggest she couldn’t give a monkey’s about what the people in her constituency think.Two nights ago she was one of 12 Conservative rebels who voted against the Government. She wanted Britain to remain part of a customs union with the EU. That would mean — effectively — no real Brexit. And if they had won, it would have been catastrophe for the Government. And in my opinion, the country.The reason they didn’t lose is solely down to a bunch of courageous Labour MPs, including the excellent Frank Field, who voted with the Government. Soubry isn’t alone, of course. The people of Loughborough, Leics, also voted by a large margin to leave the EU.But they are represented in the House of Commons by Nicky Morgan, who appears not to give a toss what they think. She also voted for a customs union. Nicky is famous among many for being the second worst Education Secretary this country has ever had. She’s pipped to the post for that particular prize by Justine Greening.Being useless in their Cabinet posts isn’t the only thing that unites these two women. Greening is also opposed to Brexit and she has even called for a second referendum. Because she didn’t like the result of the first one.The people of Beaconsfield, Bucks, voted to leave the EU. But their MP, the grim Dominic Grieve, who resembles a funeral director from about 1923, appears not to care less. He has said he’s prepared to “collapse” the Government if he does not get his way.Sarah Wollaston is another one. Another embittered MP. Her constituency, Totnes in Devon, voted to leave by a sizeable margin.Because while it is true that the majority of Labour MPs are also opposed to Brexit, they have been nothing like as dangerous as the Tory rebels.We are in a mess. The Prime Minister staggers from crisis to crisis, striking meaningless deals whenever she can to stave off defeat for a few more days.She surely cannot last much longer. A Remainer herself, of course, I think she should be persuaded to call it a day. Go home, put her feet up. And let her party elect a leader who will take no more c**p from Brussels.And no more c**p from the likes of Soubry and Greening, either.THE top scientist Richard Dawkins – Britain’s most famous atheist – has got himself into trouble.He has said that he prefers to hear the sound of cathedral bells to the muezzin wail calling Muslims to prayer.  Saying something as inoffensive as that is enough to get you into hot water these days.Dawkins has been called a bigot as a consequence. I have to say I disagree with him. I love the sound of cathedral bells, sure.But I also enjoying hearing the Muslim call to prayer – when I’ve been on my travels in Morocco or Malaysia. But, over here, it’s cathedral bells for me every time.Here’s a tip, then.Take them to an expensive shoe shop and make them look at the display through the window.And remember the noise they make.KATIE PRICE is on holiday in Thailand and of course she’s got her baps out.  This might be a problem for Katie, pictured with boyfriend Kris Boyson.Topless sunbathing is against the law over there. This is because tourists enjoy looking at the scenic islands. Without having their view obliterated by a pair of breasts the size of Koh Samui.So watch yourself, Katie. And as a break from lying on the beach, how do you fancy a spot of caving?YOU’VE got to love the toffs, haven’t you?  Most of them are absolutely crazy after years of inbreeding.Take the brilliant Lizzie Purbrick who described herself as “a very well-bred toff”.  She went round to her married lover’s home after he’d cheated on her with a third woman.No messing with Lizzie. She took with her eight litres of pig’s blood which she sprayed across his flat. She daubed the words “slut” and “whore” and “big d**k lord” on his walls and sprayed a giant penis on the floor.  She said: “So many people have said I should write my life story, but I’m so bonkers I can’t remember it.”The judge said – in one of the great under-statements of the decade – that she had “real concerns about the defendant’s ability to make rational decisions”.No s**t, Sherlock.It started out a few years back with just a couple of stalls. Now the entire town centre is closed off and thousands turn up to pig themselves on cuisine from scores of nationalities.I got so stuffed last year I needed to be helped home. And not a chicken parmo – the supposed Teesside dish of choice – in sight.IT’S not often that the Labour peer Dame Margaret Hodge says something worth repeating. But in telling her party leader Jeremy Corbyn that he was a “f***ing anti-Semite and a racist” I think she kinda hit the nail on the head.Meanwhile, the decent, moderate Labour MP John Woodcock has resigned the party whip and become an independent.Long-time party members – like I was, until last year – know that Labour is currently led by a hard-left anti-Jewish rabble of thickoes.I hope the voters twig this sooner or later.AND now it’s time for Hypocrites of the Week. A special award for Pimlico Plumbers of London.They’ve put up a giant banner outside their premises about Brexit, saying: “Nobody voted to be poorer!”Pimlico Plumbers has just lost a landmark case brought by one of its employees. He, like almost all of their staff, was kept on a contract which allowed the firm to pay him less than the proper rate.They were done under a UK Supreme Court decision, using laws designed to stop unscrupulous firms exploiting cheap labour.I wonder what it is about the EU that Pimlico Plumbers likes so much?

And the impossibility of its own airlines avoiding UK airspace. It won’t happen.Varadkar must believe that these grenades he brainlessly lobs into the Brexit negotiations help Brussels. He is not bright enough to realise how absurd and unstatesmanlike he looks.But he let something else very revealing slip too.Varadkar reportedly said that EU leaders have assured him no hard border or customs checks will ever be needed between Ireland and Northern Ireland.That’s under ANY scenario, including a No Deal.Since we will never build a hard border either, why is “avoiding” one still being discussed, let alone a huge sticking point?Answer: It is a ruse, confected by a Brussels desperate to keep us in its grip.Eurocrats yesterday tore apart Theresa May’s Chequers offer. Yes, the same offer already so over-generous it almost collapsed her Government.The Sun has never been more gloomy about the chance of a deal. There is nothing more Mrs May can compromise on.But Brussels is run by deluded bullies who apparently think they cannot lose.Martin Selmayr, the German who is effectively in charge, dislikes Britain and insists any deal must be punitive.The EU, while apparently negotiating with us, is also advising its members how to lure away our job-creating firms.Parliament, and its Remainers, must not be cowed. They must back Britain over Brussels. No Deal wasn’t our choice. But the EU is pushing us into it and telling its members to be prepared.Within eight months we must be fully ready too, economically and politically.THE huge surge in serious crime shames the supposed party of law and order.It is no coincidence murders, rapes, robberies and knife attacks are soaring with police numbers at a 36-year low.For years the Tories considered their necessary cuts to budgets safe enough. The evidence against is now irrefutable.But more cash is not the only answer.Many forces are appallingly led, obsessed with their image, with social media virtue-signalling and investigations driven by political correctness, all while ignoring the basics of keeping the public and their property safe.Home Secretary Sajid Javid must secure more money and reverse this horrific trend.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She would have let Charlotte run riot in her bedroom, trying on all her designer clothes and shoes and raiding her make-up bag.It’s so tragic that all of these happy times were not to be. When William saw all of his children come into the world, most especially baby Charlotte, he must have felt the loss of his mother even more keenly.Diana would have been there with her arms full of presents, and not just for the babies. There would have been thoughtful gifts for Kate and lots of hugs and happy tears.You can well picture her ­giving newlywed Harry a cheeky nudge and telling him to “get on with it” so she could have more grandchildren to spoil.I also think that if Diana had still been alive this sad situation between Meghan Markle and her dad would never have been allowed to turn so toxic.Diana would have seen this potential problem looming even before the engagement was announced and nipped it firmly in the bud.She would have insisted and ensured he was invited to the UK and would have dispensed shrewd and invaluable advice on how to deal with all of the hoopla surrounding the wedding. Diana learned the hard way how to deal with the media and palace officials. She was misquoted, manipulated and misunderstood during her time as a royal wife and knew all the pitfalls and how to avoid them.Skittish Meghan would have been soothed and calmed and all of the bad feeling among the Markle family would have surely evaporated.Diana would have advised Meghan’s dad on his wedding suit, helped him with his speech and rehearsed him walking down the aisle.She would have put this rather shy and ordinary man completely at ease.Rather than watching his daughter getting married on TV while cowering in a cheap bed and breakfast in the US, he would have been an integral part of the happiest day of her life.Instead, we have a constant stream of ill-advised interviews given by Thomas where he appears to have been ignored and abandoned and, whether it’s fair or not, Meghan seems increasingly cold-hearted.Photos yesterday of. him celebrating his 74th birthday alone with just a fast food takeaway for company don’t exactly help, whether they were staged again or not.A present, phone call or card from Meghan would have gone a long way to build bridges.It’s all turning a tawdry soap opera meaning commentators such as Sharon Osbourne will keep the pot boiling.Just this week she inferred Thomas has a drink problem and should get clean, ensuring more lurid headlines and bad feeling as he furiously has to deny all of the allegations.No one is coming out of this well and never has Princess Diana been more missed.Harry needs her wise counsel and William knows what an important part she could have played in the lives of his ­children.I know her sons will never really get over her death, but I do hope when William looks into his daughter’s beautiful eyes he is heartened to see a reflection of his mum rather than finding it ­unbearably sad.THE way BBC News treated Cliff Richard was utterly shameful and I’m not in the least surprised it lost its court case.The poor man went through years of hell and became a virtual recluse – and his physical and mental health was profoundly affected.At a time when he should have been enjoying the rewards of a lifetime’s graft, he was enduring sleepless nights and often crying in anguish on the kitchen floor.Many in the media have expressed fear and disquiet that any sort of Cliff’s Law will mean restrictions on newspapers, radio and TV, and this is indeed troubling.But the blame should be pointed firmly at those who thought it was a good idea to send a helicopter to film and report an OTT police raid on an innocent man.Seeing Cliff outside the courtroom this week looking extremely fragile and on the verge of tears was heartbreaking.Clearly the sunny, friendly, optimistic Peter Pan of Pop has gone for good and in his place is a haggard, careworn, wary victim.Before the court case, Cliff told me he doesn’t have photos taken with fans and their children any more.It was painful to see the hurt and mistrust in his eyes.He then revealed this week that his VIP status meant he was allowed to use the secret Wimbledon tunnel under Centre Court and Court No1 to bounce quickly between both venues and view as much tennis as possible.Cliff doesn’t do that any more, and never will, because the tunnel goes past the ball boys’ changing area and he doesn’t want to put himself in a situation where he could potentially be accused of something unspeakable.I really hope that when enough time has passed he can get some of that old “glass half full” spirit back, but he will never be the person he was.And no one else should have to go through such a hideous ordeal when they have done nothing wrong.IF you don’t want to watch a movie that will make you laugh, cry and come out singing Abba songs, we can’t be friends.I thoroughly enjoyed Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again – a rare example of a sequel that is better than the original.The starry cast includes Meryl Streep, Julie Walters, PIerce Brosnan, Andy Garcia and Colin Firth. But the cherry on the icing on the cheesecake is the legend that is Cher.I was lucky enough to host the world premiere this week in London and had the chance to talk to the cast, who were effusive in their praise of Her Cherness.It was surprising to hear she STILL gets nervous before going on set and she was genuinely bewildered by all the love in the air for her.I thought one elderly gay gentleman was going to explode with happiness when Cher blew him a kiss.It was so endearing – and there is nothing more deliciously camp than Cher stepping out of a helicopter in a blonde wig and sequins before going on to sing Super Trouper. She’s a class act and a throughly lovely woman.WATCHING politicians squabble like ferrets in a sack soon loses its novelty value – and our eyes are now glazing over whenever the dreaded subject of Brexit rears its ugly head.But we should never forget that when we woke up the day after the referendum – to discover a majority had voted to leave the EU – there was NO actual plan.Bupkis. Nada. Zilch. Diddly-squat.There wasn’t even a “to do” list.Instead, all the rats deserted the sinking ship, claiming the dog had eaten their homework or a big boy did it and ran away – leaving the (female) PM to tidy up their reeking mess. Funny that.No matter which way you voted, surely we can all agree on one thing.There was little or no thought put into how to actually implement such a seismic change. Not even a few notes on the back of a fag packet.Now, two years down the line, the whole big, fat mess is farcical and beyond parody.As a nation, we are a laughing stock.Shame on all those careerists and fence-sitters for their arrogance, stupidity and downright mendacity in not having even a half-arsed plan in place.A parcel of rogues, right enough.IF you fancy a right good laugh at some silly, bonkers, hilarious fun and games, tune in to BBC1 today at 5.05pm for another helping of Wedding Day Winners with myself and Rob Beckett.One couple will actually get married at the end of the show and it’s all very lighthearted and joyful.DID Burberry REALLY need to make a bonfire of its overpriced designer swag and burn an eye-watering £28million worth of clothing and cosmetics?In line with other designer labels, the fashion house claims the move was to stop counterfeiters getting their hands on garments and using them to produce fakes.But surely that just doesn’t add up.If criminals want to reproduce any designer clothes or handbags, they can go into any shop and purchase something – or, even simpler, just order it online.Could Burberry not instead have the mother of all sales in aid of Help for Heroes, or for the homeless charity Centrepoint, or any number of deserving causes here and in the Third World?That £28million would have gone a hell of a long way to help those in need.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Politics is a man’s world and, to many, women still feel like token visitors.Even when Tony Blair famously had 101 “babes” in his 1997 intake of MPs, only four of his Cabinet appointments were female.Here we are, 20 years later, and yes, we have a female Prime Minister but there is still a prevailing view that the Cabinet, in particular, belongs to men.Clearly there’s something profoundly wrong with that equation.Given that this country is made up, more or less equally, of men and women, things would undoubtedly be fairer, not to mention calmer, if more women were on board.So the big question is, why aren’t there?Things are better than they were. Since the 2017 election there are 208 women in the Commons, up from 191 in 2015.But there are still not enough and you don’t have to look far for reasons why that might be.Most women are put off by the environment and the culture and wonder why on earth they would want to put themselves within a country mile of either.Take Prime Minister’s Question Time, which appears to be a bunch of overgrown public school boys booing, jeering and jostling with each other in their bid to establish who is top dog.What woman in her right mind would choose to enter that fray?Then there are the practicalities. This week, Lib Dem MP Jo Swinson was “cheated” in a crunch Brexit vote by the breaking of her pairing pact.This is an arrangement where one MP agrees not to vote to cancel out the fact that another MP on the opposite side is unable to vote — in this case Swinson was at home with her three-week-old baby.The problem was, her pairing partner reneged on the deal and voted.Then there are the hours, which can be difficult if you have a family. Any woman would need a very understanding partner and family to do the job.Also, any MP is opening themselves up to the line of fire and a lot of personal criticism — which multiplies for female MPs.Some have to deal with endless comments and speculation about their appearance, as well as threats of rape and death on a regular basis. Just this week a man was arrested over abusive Facebook posts aimed at various female MPs.If it’s true voters are biased against women, any female has to be ten times as talented, determined and tenacious to get the job in the first place.It’s no wonder women are put off entering politics.But if we want true equality then more women need to go into Westminster and the culture needs to change.That is why I support the campaign group Women To Win and will be taking part in an event called The Voice Of Women In Politics.The idea is to try to encourage more women into Parliament, outlining some of the changes that need to take place to raise the number of female candidates.Getting more women into politics is a no brainer.Women tend to work collaboratively to solve problems whereas — in my experience — men are more likely to lock horns, point fingers and try to shout the loudest. All too often men are interested in progressing to be a leader, whereas women are more focused on getting the job done.And when women DO find their voice in politics, it can be very powerful, and they often hae the balls to say things that men just wouldn’t.Look at Tory minister Anna Soubry, who this week suggested the PM should take control of her hardliner MPs and stop pandering to the likes of Jacob Rees-Mogg.I know she’s got a lot on her plate at the moment, but if I was Theresa May I would be spending a good proportion of my time and energy on making real changes to politics in order, specifically, to attract many more women.It could be one of the greatest legacies she could hope for.Thomas Markle is a concerned dad who just wants to be reconnected with his daughter.Meanwhile this HALF-sister has turned a constant shade of green and wants to get involved in any way she can.Is it any wonder she wasn’t invited to the wedding?MY heroine of the week is 21-year-old Emilia Holden a waitress in Georgia, US, who was at the end of a shift when a customer casually grabbed her bottom as he walked past.Her response? She followed him, grabbed him and body slammed him to the ground, then called the police – after which he spent two nights in a police cell.What a fantastic response. Good for her.But also, who are these men that think that they can just grab a woman’s behind just because they want to?But hearing about elaborate plans by Pixie Lott which include a total of 18 bridesmaids all wearing the same dress, left me feeling a bit stressed out.Apart from anything else, it will take them all an hour to travel up the aisle.JAMES GODDARD-WATTS, the businessman whose family founded the hardware firm Screwfix, is still locked in a multi-million pound divorce battle with his ex-wife, Julia.They reached an agreement eight years ago ­– following the end of a 13-year marriage – that Mrs Goddard-Watts should get a £3.25million house and a £4million lump sum.But she complained that Mr Goddard-Watts had not revealed the full extent of his wealth at the time of the settlement and court fights began.Critics say Julia is a leech, greedy and after his money.But when you consider the worth and value of building a home, looking after children and a family while supporting a spouse, that should be worth at least half of whatever the partner who didn’t do all of that has earned in the meantime.So why shouldn’t she take him back to court?The law states that assets are divided equally.So people who hide theirs from their spouse only have themselves to blame if said spouse feels forced to take them to court to get what’s fair.ELLE Macpherson’s diet regime is enough to make me reach for the pizza delivery menu.The model is up at 5am. She has warm water, lemon and cayenne pepper.She has no booze, almost no carbs, no meat and no dairy. She is such a follower of the alkaline diet – based on the theory you can change the pH of your body through food – that she checks the acidity of her urine.I’m sure the diet is good for her – but who wants to add years to your life if those years are going to be so, well, dull?“The only chance I have of being on TV again is if I were very ugly,” he said.“I think only old, ugly women can get on TV. Like Mary Beard.”David added that he would only be hired now: “If I had tombstone teeth and rather funny hair and made a lot of noise about that fact.”Oh dear.Where even to start? When you resort to attacking someone’s appearance, you are in trouble.It’s not Mary Beard that has held back his career. It’s David himself.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Or a crap remake of Fight Club — except they DO talk about Fight Club. All the time.Theresa May has the leadership skills of a damp dishcloth, no authority and no political vision.A strong leader needs a clear mission. You may not agree with it, but you know what they stand for.“Live each day like it’s your last,” is our Prime Minister’s political strategy, except she’s not dancing in the rain.She is waiting for the sharks to circle. And soon they will come for her.Buffoon-in-chief Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg — a man so old-fashioned he could have been dug up by Time Team — wait to pounce. And Brexit is a mess. Things are so bad, even Elon Musk is out of ideas. No one will be happy with where we end up.And because there is no party political or Brexit majority in the Commons, politics is stuck, trapped in what feels like a never-ending Brexistential crisis.Normally, I’m with “Brenda From Bristol” when it comes to more elections and referendums.But maybe a People’s Vote on the final deal or another election is the only way to unblock Brexit.Think of it like a political plunger — unpleasant, nasty but necessary.You’d think the Opposition would be gleefully capitalising on all this chaos. Think again. Instead of going after the Tories, Labour has decided to traumatise the Jewish community. Again.Labour has had a horrible problem with anti-Semitism, yet instead of healing the wound, it has poured vinegar on it by choosing not to adopt the full International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance code of conduct.These guys sound pretty authoritative and the code is good enough for government departments and the Crown Prosecution Service.Many Jewish groups and leaders, including the Chief Rabbi, are distraught, confused and angry. And you can see why.This shameful decision led to an angry clash outside the Commons chamber where Jewish MP Margaret Hodge confronted Jeremy Corbyn, allegedly calling him an anti-Semite and a racist.Hodge lost family in the Holocaust and fought off the BNP in her Barking and Dagenham constituency.Instead of acknowledging her pain and offering to sit down with her, Team Corbyn are taking disciplinary action against her.I bet they deal with her far quicker than they did with Ken Livingstone, who couldn’t stop banging on about Hitler.What dark times for Labour, which once had a proud tradition of fighting racism. They must sort it out.Then we have the Lib Dems, who have proved useless. They have one policy — stop Brexit.Yet leader Vince Cable and ex-leader Tim Farron missed crucial votes on Monday. Talk about Dem and Dumber.To top it all off, the DUP’s Ian Paisley Jnr has been suspended for 30 days — which hasn’t happened since 1949 — for failing to declare lavish holidays to that well-known Northern Irish stakeholder, Sri Lanka.And to think Theresa May planned to give MPs an extra five days off as a reward for all their hard work.The country has had enough of these fools’ infighting, incompetence and filling their boots. Especially when we face so many big problems, from NHS funding to housing.Parliament’s end-of-term report is a big, fat fail. British politics should be taken into special measures.THE premiere of Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again was sun-kissed, frothy fun –  and no one mentioned the ­Customs Union. Bliss.The stars were out in full, including Cher. She is magnificent, but it is a little odd that at 72 she has fewer wrinkles than any other cast member, including 29-year-old Lily James. And the baby.She told Lorraine Kelly it was down to not drinking, smoking or doing drugs. Yeah, right.We women may be naive when it comes to the quest for eternal beauty, but we ain’t stupid.WHEN you hear of people getting up in the middle of the night and queuing, you think of the Boxing Day sales or the release of the latest Apple gadget.You don’t think of childcare.Yet more than 100 parents queued from 3am – armed with chairs, flasks and biscuits – trying to bag their child a coveted place in the breakfast club at a primary school in Cardiff.For many working parents, breakfast clubs are a lifeline.They can drop off the children in a safe environment where they can get a decent breakfast, then make it to work on time themselves.Though parents have the right to request flexible working hours, many fear the sack if they come in late.These spaces were limited and dished out on a first-come, first-served basis, which is why the parents took such drastic measures.This shows how desperate parents are for childcare that matches their working hours.The scrapping of Labour’s extended school programme and the first real-terms cuts to schools mean all these extras that were provided are no longer affordable.Childcare isn’t a luxury.It’s a necessity for millions of families and they are crying out for more breakfast and after-school clubs.JEFF BEZOS, the boss of Amazon, is a man clearly in his “Prime”.He’s now the richest man in modern history.Good for him.I’m all for celebrating entrepreneurs and hard work – but shouldn’t that apply to his poor workers toiling away in his warehouses?They would probably give Amazon working conditions zero stars.I wish our business leaders remembered some of their forefathers, who felt a moral and civic responsibility to look after their employees and took some pride in that.It makes business sense too. Happy workers are better workers.So after Bezos pops open the champagne, maybe he could spare a thought for his staff, who told an undercover reporter they pee in bottles because the loos are too far away and they are afraid of being accused of time-wasting.C’mon, Jeff – that’s really taking the p**s. ONE school in Liverpool had to apologise after kids as young as four were left in tears when they were denied an ice cream treat because they didn’t have a 97 per cent attendance record.How mean is that? What if they were ill? And surely it’s the parents’ fault.CARERS got another kick in the teeth this week when the Court of Appeal overturned a decision that those doing sleep-in shifts should earn at least the minimum wage.If the decision had gone through, it would have cost the UK care sector billions – so charities and local governments were relieved.But it shows what a raw deal carers get.Judges said only hours spent awake counted as work – but that is completely out of touch with the reality of what carers do.Many of the elderly and vulnerable people they look after need their help through the night, whether it’s a trip to the loo, to take medication or dealing with more serious situations such as seizures. Carers can’t exactly fall into a deep sleep. They have to be alert and listening in case they are needed.The rooms they sleep in may not be comfortable and they will be away from their own families.Many carers are paid so little that they live hand to mouth and barely get by.When I met a group in the West Midlands, they told me they couldn’t afford to put the heating on in winter and had to take their kids to the grandparents’ for tea once or twice a week just so they would be fed.Some were struggling so much they had to visit food banks.But they also loved their jobs and took great pride in looking after their clients as if they were family.They get paid a pittance, with some earning just £30 for a ten-hour shift.These low-paid workers – the majority of whom are women – are unsung heroes and deserve more.New Health Secretary Matt Hancock must make social care a priority and enforce minimum-wage law properly.It’s time we took better care of our carers.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We are pushing the envelope.”But when discussion turned to the loss of two Cabinet big guns, the usually gloomy Chancellor delivered a rare upbeat verdict.He declared: “The two main bogeymen have been taken off the board.”Last night his off-the-cuff remark was described as “arrogant” and “disdainful” by angry Brexiteers.They claimed it betrayed his staunch Remainer tendencies and determination to keep Britain shackled to the EU.A senior Brexiteer said last night: “With each day that passes, it is clear that this is more and more a Remain-run Brexit.“We have a Remain Prime Minister, a Remain Cabinet Office and most clearly of all a Remain Chancellor who is happy to undermine British interests and wave the white flag of surrender to Brussels as these comments prove once again.“It shows he is on the side of Brussels and not the 17.4million people who voted to leave the EU.”Former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith added: “There is no room in the Conservative party for arrogant and disdainful remarks about colleagues.“Who’s to say that, for some, it may well be the Chancellor who turns out to be the bogeyman.”Grant Shapps, who called for an “orderly” change after the 2017 election shambles, urged MPs to close ranks and get EU talks done.Tory MP Andrea Jenkyns, who quit as a ministerial aide over the Chequers blueprint, added: “I have nothing but the highest admiration for my colleagues David Davis and Boris Johnson.“They both made a brave and principled stand in putting the country before their party or their careers.“As for the Chancellor, if I were him, I’d be worred about the reaction of 17.4million people who voted for Brexit and already feel betrayed. They won’t be going away.“Philip Hammond has become nothing more than a mouthpiece for the PM’s EU-loving Europe adviser Olly Robbins.”Mr Hammond’s outburst has put Theresa May’s attempts to restore Cabinet unity at risk.The Chancellor, who is no stranger to Cabinet bust-ups, has clashed with several colleagues over Brexit and the squeeze on spending.He was accused of likening Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson to Private Pike from TV comedy classic Dad’s Army.After a clash over lack of military funding, an ally of Mr Hammond said: “Williamson doesn’t know one end of a rifle from the other.“When he is with all these grizzled old forces types, he just sites there looking like Private Pike from Dad’s Army.”An ally said: “I’ve never heard Philip use the word bogeyman against any colleague. He is a great admirer of David Davis and would never talk in a disparaging way about him.“Perhaps he was saying that the EU saw these two people as bogeymen. I’m sure Philip never has.”A senior Cabinet source said Mr Hammond was expressing the harsh reality – in his trademark clumsy way.He said: “I agreed with Philip’s sentiments but not the language used.“I suspect he was trying to say it is important to have a Cabinet united behind the same plan and removing two outspoken critics is a positive step.“However, to call hem bogeymen is over the top and will only inflame the precarious peace between the Leave and Remain camps.”If that’s the case then surely we won’t be conceding any more to Brussels.The evidence on Friday — when the EU slapped down Theresa May’s Chequers offers — suggests otherwise.Hammond’s disparaging remark shows that Remainers are at the heart of Theresa May’s Government, running the show at the expense of Leave voices.This Government sees Brexit as a damage-limitation exercise rather than a golden opportunity for Britain to reinvent itself as a global and buccaneering free nation.How can we ever achieve Brexit in full if the Government itself is so institutionally Euro-phile? We need more Brexiteers at the heart of the project.Meanwhile, it is clear that the PM’s Chequers plan has not only failed to win over Brussels, but also her party. The grassroots are livid.It was as generous an offer as Mrs May could politically have tabled.Every time we are reasonable in our approach, the EU slaps us down. They are determined to punish us.We can’t just keep giving while the EU arrogantly takes. Enough is enough.It is clear Mrs May needs to change her approach to Brexit - and fast.The PM has repeatedly said: “No deal is better than a bad deal”.She must be true to her words — and properly start planning for such a scenario.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It said the payouts were in line with retail price inflation and its five-year growth policy.A spokesman said: “We deliver a range of benefits and long-term value for customers, the environment, and shareholders.Between 2015 and 2020 , we are investing over £3.5bn in essential infrastructure.”Thames Water last month announced it would halt bonuses to bosses this year and suspend dividend payments to its shareholders.The ban means customers will not be allowed to use either a hosepipe or sprinkler to water their gardens.They were also told not to fill up paddling pools, or face fines of up to £1,000.A statement added: Please use a watering can instead or, even better, reuse any water from the home such as water from washing up bowls or bath water.We know hosepipe bans can be inconvenient but by taking these steps now we can make sure we have enough water for more essential things like drinking, washing and cooking.The North West is the second region facing a hosepipe ban after Northern Ireland."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000421357317.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"chief remoaner claims no deal would put britain in state of emergency but dominic raab says well thrive no matter what","story":"The pro-EU Tory insisted that no-deal would spark a huge crisis in the country and we would run out of food and medicine.Mr Grieve, who has been in charge of leading other Remainers to water down Theresa Mays Brexit Bill in the Commons on numerous occasions, denied his comments were another attempt at Remains Project Fear today and insisted it would be absolutely catastrophic if talks broke down with Brussels.He told Skys Sophie Ridge on Sunday this morning: Its right to take emergency measures, but we will be in a state of emergency.And he even claimed basic services like flights abroad wouldnt be able to take place, and there would be trouble getting food into the country.It is so serious - I find it difficult to see that no deal is better than a deal on offer, the Beaconsfield MP said.Ministers have drawn up secret plans to stockpile processed foods in case of a no-deal Brexit, and have started putting in place contingency plans.Last week Mrs May and the EU told businesses to start stepping up their preparations for not securing a Brexit deal with the EU.Advice will be given out across the summer for how to start getting ready.But Brexit Secretary Dominic Grieve insisted that we will thrive when we come out of the EU - no matter what happens.He insisted that far-fetched, fanciful predictions of what would happen when we leave would not come true, and he was confident of securing an arrangement.Mr Raab said the UK was hiring extra border staff and pumping in money to departments to prepare.Speaking to the Andrew Marr Show he said: People need to know we are getting ready and Britain can thrive no matter what happens.And he was confident that we would be able to get a deal by October, with his fresh injection of energy, ambition and pragmatism.80 per cent of the withdrawal agreement is already sorted, he confirmed today. And he insisted the Government would do everything it needed to smooth over any bumps we may face in the coming months.We will act responsibly and set out the details of that through technical notices over the coming months, he added.If we have no deal, we will make sure we are prepared - we will have all the planning in place and the infrastructure to deal with that.But he said that Mr Barnier asking questions about the UKs plans for Brexit was a good positive sign and ministers were pleased to see it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They pause and gawk at my blue bob, fruity tutu and 7in platforms.It may sound like the set of a fantasy film but I am in fact just one of the 80,000 wig-wearing guests at Hyper Japan Festival in London to celebrate Cosplay — costume role play — and Japanese culture.Youngsters from across the UK are dressed as their favourite characters from anime — a type of animation featuring futuristic heroes in action-led stories — as well as from cartoons, video games and comic books. Even the odd US comic supervillain is wandering round.All have been warned to not wear outfits smaller than a swimsuit as it is a “family event”.One of the first to greet me is Efe Aighorr, 28, a digital director from Canada Water, South East London, who has more than 45,000 followers on Instagram.He is dressed as Golden Jaguar from Marvel’s Black Panther. He says: “I’ve been doing it for two-and-a-half years and love it. I have a serious job so it’s great to morph into a different person and have fun.”But it was not known as Cosplay until 1983, when it was used by film director Nobuyuki Takahashi in Japanese magazine My Anime.The doll-like Kawaii style is common here among young British girls — and is the one I have opted for.As Princess Fairy Kei, I have blue hair, fake eyelashes, pink eyeshadow and am in a pastel dress adorned with cartoon ice creams.Another popular choice is Lolita fashion, a street style inspired by Victorian dolls. Fans include pop stars Gwen Stefani, Katy Perry and Nicki Minaj.All this does not come cheap. I meet impeccably dressed Sade Kaye, 20, a student, from Stratford, East London, who has “blown” £10,000 on her neon-heavy Harajuku street style, which originates from the Tokyo district it is named after.She says: “It’s an expensive addiction. I used to spend £1,000 a month on clothes. At the time I was working in a call centre and taking home around £1,500 a month.“I live at home so saw it as disposable income but just wasted it on outfits. I buy some I don’t even need.”She adds: “I once had an interview at a stationery shop. They were gobsmacked when I rocked up in silver space boots, a mini skirt and crop top.”A job is not the only thing she struggled to get. Sade’s look is stopping her from getting a boyfriend too, as “a lot of guys look and think I’m crazy”. But she admits she would “rather have amazing clothes”.She is in the right place. An entire floor is devoted to exhibitors hawking schoolgirl outfits, maid uniforms and other cute dresses, along with wigs, accessories and make-up. There are also craft shops where designers teach new Cosplayers how to make their own outfits.I run into London street performer Matt Johnson, 35, who is dressed as a Japanese warrior, and later Tabitha Hastie, 27, a software developer from Canada Water.Her outfit, inspired by Mercy from the Overwatch video game, cost £200. She has another which cost £500. She says: “I dread to think how much I’ve spent. But I love the whole experience and feeling part of a community, so it is worth it.”60% are aged between 23 and 3940% of Cosplayers are male£300 the amount most would spend on a costume It is easy to forget that away from Hyper Japan, these are all normal people with normal jobs.Laura Johnston, 26, is a civil servant. But today she is Morrigan, from computer game Dragon Age.She says: “I wear office attire to work but as soon as I’m home I dress only in Cosplay. My fiance doesn’t understand it. He doesn’t know it yet but I’m going to take weapons to our wedding.”Cosplaying for confidence and escapism are common themes.Emma Langley Soryu, 27, a warehouse worker from Birmingham, is dressed as Asuka, from Nineties’ Japanese TV series Neon Genesis Evangelion. She tells me how she is quite shy but “gets to be a different person in my costume”.With the compliments and selfie requests rolling in for me as I walk round, it is easy to see why Cosplaying is so addictive.Saya Elyn, 29, an accountant who has flown from Belgium to be here, says: “It makes me feel special. I like creating costumes and being someone else, as my job is so boring.“It’s a great way to make new friends. Everyone is so supportive and guys really like it, too. I even Crossplay, which means I dress as a man and become one of them.”Upstairs, a fashion show is beginning. A long queue of Cosplayers and Kawaii girls wait backstage, keen to show off their over-the-top costumes.Essex student Shannon Gallagher, 22, Harriet Day, 22, a pharmacy assistant, and Jade Mogford, 23, a waitress, are turning heads in their Arabian princess outfits. Each have tailored theirs to match their favourite anime.Shannon says: “We love dressing up and have hundreds of amazing outfits. We are getting stopped for a lot of pictures today, it’s great people love our outfits so much.”Like others I have spoken to, the three girls are single — a common theme. Perhaps it is because the scene can be hard to understand as an outsider.Kawaii girl Jess Redman, a single 24-year-old customer service worker from Bristol, says: “Sometimes people love it and say you look great and other times people look terrified and run away.”Yet there is a more sinister side to Cosplay. A 15-year-old female guest tells me: “People think they can touch you and lift up your skirt. It can be scary if you’re by yourself.“They see Lolita as a sexual thing but that’s because some people try to turn it into a fetish. Those people aren’t welcome in the community.”But not all the youngsters I spoke to had a problem with Lolita being perceived as sexual.Emma Barnes, 20, a student, started adopting the style when she was 12, as it “made me feel confident and sexy”.She adds: “I was an outcast in school, no one looked at me. But when I’m in my cute Kawaii costume I feel like a million dollars.”I can vouch for the fact that getting all dressed up makes you feel special, but after eight hours my feet are killing me, I am sweating under my wig and my body is aching under the heavy outfit.Now, where are my Primark PJs?Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But the evidence we have heard suggests it is far from being finalised.“In evidence to our inquiry, we heard the hopes and fears of UK citizens in the EU as well as of EU citizens resident here in the UK. These are people who have made their lives in the EU in good faith or came to live and work in the UK, paying taxes, raising families and putting down roots.“The rights of UK citizens living in the EU27 and of EU nationals in the UK should be based on full reciprocity, but as things stand, both groups are likely to lose some of the rights they had previously. That’s not fair and it’s why we want to see further progress quickly.“And whatever happens with the negotiations, we urge all governments to make it clear to all EU citizens who have made somewhere else their home that they can stay.”A Government spokesperson said: “We have made great progress on citizens rights, securing an agreement which will see EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens in the EU be able to continue their lives broadly as now.“The Home Office has also announced further details about how EU citizens and their families can obtain settled status in the UK. The process will be straightforward and streamlined and we will support applicants to get the right outcome.“We are working with our European partners to encourage them to confirm their own processes will be in place to provide UK citizens living in the EU with the certainty they need.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Since Michel Barnier responded to Theresa May’s Brexit White Paper with a very polite “non” on Friday, it’s been all out war in the Tory ranks. Between the outcry over Vote Leave cheating in the campaign, the claims of Mad Max style armageddon if we don’t get a deal and Jacob Rees-Mogg being his most Jacob Rees-Mogg self, the rhetoric has seldom been so charged. So we thought it’d be helpful to have all this weekend’s most alarming Brexit pronouncements all in one place. Here’s a roundup. 1. Dominic Grieve: No-deal Brexit will leave us in a \u0027state of emergency\u0027  The Tory remainer told Sky News’ Sophy Ridge today: “I think no-deal would be absolutely catastrophic for this country. Clearly if the government thinks there’s a risk of no deal it’s right to take emergency measures, but we’ve got to be realistic about this, we will be in a state of emergency.” He added: “I don’t think it is scaremongering. Another way of looking at it is that it is so serious that one would hope that even if we weren’t able to reach any agreement with the EU on the economic framework we would still at the last minute put together some side-deals to address some of these issues. But you’ve got to understand that the language of some of my colleagues at Westminster is that they are actively seeking no-deal because they are so absolutely fixated on leaving the European Union without any ties or obligations at all. If that is what they want to pursue, then they themselves will be the people who precipitate this particular crisis.”  2. Dominic Raab: ‘Forgive me if I don’t keep a laser like focus on the substance’ The Tory Brexit Secretary told the BBC’s Andrew Marr this morning Brussels raising concerns about the legal position of UK citizens in the EU and EU citizens of the UK if we don\u0027t get a deal was irresponsible. He added: We ought to be trying to reassure citizens on the continent and also here. I think they’re trying to, in lots of ways…and of course neither the commission or the EU as a whole speaks with one voice. And there’s obviously an attempt to ramp up the pressure, and that’s fine. Forgive me if I don’t keep a laser like focus on the substance. He also refused to deny Britain planned to stockpile food, just in case.  Tory Remainer Anna Soubry told the : “Since the referendum, the forces of darkness have taken over and they have continued to take over and this week if there was every any doubt who was running this government it was quashed.” 4. Jacob Rees Mogg: It could take 50 years to know if Brexit has been a success  He told Channel 4: “We will know at some point, of course we will. But it’s a question of timescale. We won’t know the full economic consequences for a very long time, we really won’t.” He was challenged by Krishnan Guru Murthy, who said: “Of course not, but I mean we’ll have an indication. We’ll know if there’s been chaos, we’ll know if there have been job losses.” But Moggy insisted: “The overwhelming opportunity for Brexit is over the next 50 years.” He refused to say he’d resign if Brexit wasn’t a success, saying he puts his own future on the line at every election.  Asked if there should be a second referendum, Tory Brexiteer told the BBC’s Sunday Politics: “Absolutely not. Why do we need a second referendum? If nothing else we would need an act of Parliament to pass one. It would take at least another year or 18 months for that to happen. “But what is this, bullying? Do we say to the British people we don’t trust you in your last decision and your last vote, you’ve got to go again? Is it best of three?” 6. John Major: A second referendum would be ‘morally justified.’  Tory former prime minister Sir John Major told The Andrew Marr Show a second referendum is morally justified. He told the show: It has downsides. I mean, frankly, a second vote has democratic downsides. It has difficulties. But is it morally justified? I think it is. If you look back at the Leave campaign a great many of the promises they made were fantasy promises. We now know they are not going to be met. A referendum isn\u0027t an easy option, but it\u0027s not one at this stage that I would rule out.

President Moreno is in London to deliver a keynote speech at the Global Disability Summit, which is being hosted by Ms Mordaunt, the International Development Secretary. The Mirror understands the pair will meet on Tuesday, and are expected to discuss a range of bilateral issues, which could include Assange\u0027s asylum claim.  Assange has been holed up in London\u0027s Ecuadorian Embassy since 2012, when he asked the state for asylum. He was wanted in Sweden over sexual assault allegations, but claimed asylum fearing he would be extradited to the United States. He\u0027s currently wanted by British police for breaking bail conditions by failing to attend a court hearing in an attempt to resist extradition to Sweden. The Swedish sexual assault investigation was closed in 2017, but it\u0027s still possible the US Department of Justice could pursue him on espionage charges over the leaks of government documents relating to the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.

It would prevent perishable goods being delayed at the border. But it could lead to EU countries blocking exports from the EU because of a cavalier approach to safety standards. Academics say they have been informed by a Government adviser of the plans being developed should delays emerge.  The warnings are contained in the Food Research Collaboration briefing, Feeding Britain: Food Security After Brexit .  In the section entitled Preparing for a no deal food Brexit, the report says it believes the UK will need to maintain open and unhindered borders with the EU for food.  It adds: The Prime Minister told the Cabinet in July to prepare for no deal. She is right but it is already happening in Defra (Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs) in some worrying directions. In recent months, we have learned from a senior Government adviser that plans are being prepared to \u0027suspend food controls\u0027 if there are any delays to imports of perishable foods at our borders. We learned too that other policy commentators had been told the same by senior Defra personnel. One Government adviser even informed us that the plans were being devised \u0027to avoid parliamentary scrutiny\u0027. Senior industry people have told us in no uncertain terms that this would be folly and must be avoided, not least because it would threaten exports from the UK to the EU. If the UK were to suspend food safety controls, others might block exports from a country taking such a cavalier approach to public health. It would go completely against all the protestations of commitment to high consumer and health standards. Yet this appears to be what Defra envisages.

Some 55% of families are holding down a job despite having nowhere stable to live, research by Shelter\u0027s social housing commission has found. It estimated that there are currently around 33,000 working homeless, which has risen from 19,000 in 2013. The homeless charity analysed official Government data on temporary housing, benefits and employment and conducted a tenant survey. Shelter said the increase has been caused by a combination of expensive private rents, the ongoing freeze on housing benefit and a chronic lack of social homes.  Mary Smith lives in temporary accommodation in Watford with her three sons. The 47-year-old, who works full time in a shoe shop, said they became homeless after being evicted by their landlord and can not afford to rent privately. She said: I nearly lost my job when I first became homeless because the transport links from my hostel were so bad. We\u0027ve lived in three different temporary places in two years, and it\u0027s been really tough on the children. We don\u0027t want a palace, we just want a place that we can call home.  Shelter said that high housing costs are a major area of concern for many working families and that losing a tenancy accounts for 27% of households accepted as homeless in the last year. CEO Polly Neate said: It\u0027s disgraceful that even when families are working every hour they can, they\u0027re still forced to live through the grim reality of homelessness. My mum was a very proud Irish woman.  She brought us up to work hard, stand on our own two feet, and not discuss our finances or money problems with other people.  I’ve always worked and even though I didn’t earn much, as long as I had enough to get by, I was happy. But times have changed. What used to be enough to get by just isn’t enough these days – and I learnt that the hard way. In July 2016, I asked my landlord to make some repairs to my rented property up in Harrow.  And instead of fixing the problem, my landlord handed me an eviction notice.  When he arrived with the bailiff arrived at the door to chuck me out, they were so rude and sneering to the point they made me feel like some kind of dodgy tenant.  But that couldn’t have been further from the truth.  I really looked after the property.  I had refurbished it myself, put in doors and paid for other things when really that was the landlord’s responsibility. After I was evicted, I tried to find somewhere else to rent that was near my work and my now grown up children.  But everywhere I looked, I couldn’t find anywhere I could afford with my wages.  I was working a 40-hour week as an assistant manager at a shoe shop – literally every hour I could manage - and rents were still so far out of my reach. . So I had no choice but to go to the council and tell them I was homeless. It was very hard on my Irish pride. The council first put me in a hostel in Wembley which was infested with fleas.  Sometimes I’d see rats run past too.  The hardest thing was holding down my job while I was in that hostel.  When you choose somewhere to live, you make sure the commute to work is manageable.  But I had no choice about where I lived anymore, and the trains between Wembley and where I worked were so bad that they’d often be cancelled at the last minute.  I ended up running late so many times that I nearly lost my job over it. After a horrible three months there, I was moved to temporary accommodation in Edgware. I was there for nearly two years and it wasn’t too bad.  It was one bus to get into work, and I wasn’t too far from my old life and friends in Harrow. That was until it flooded. In June 2018, I woke up at 5.30 in the morning with water pouring down over me.  For a second, I thought I must have fallen asleep in the rain, but quickly realised that the building was flooding.  It was so bad, they had to call the fire brigade, and the building was uninhabitable after that. The council have now moved me to temporary accommodation in Watford.  I’ve had to pay to have all my things moved, which has left me very short this summer. I’m very ashamed to say that I’ve even had to apply for a hardship fund from the council, because I was down to about two days’ worth of food in the fridge. They gave me some food vouchers but said they couldn’t help with travel, so I’ve been walking to work.  It takes about an hour there, and an hour back, every day. The worst thing is the humiliation.  Luckily, I have a very understanding manager, but explaining to my colleagues why I am occasionally late, or telling them what’s happening with my housing situation is really embarrassing for me. I’m glad the children are grown up now and I don’t need to worry about them so much.  Actually, I think they worry about me now. It really hurts them to see their mum struggling so much at this age, especially when I’ve worked so hard all my life.  I’ve got a roof over my head, but it’s not my home.  It’s like they call it temporary accommodation to remind you that it’s not yours, so don’t get too comfortable.  I feel constantly in limbo, when all I want is to be settled.  I work hard, and I love my work. So a home of my own isn’t too much to ask, is it? In many cases, these are parents who work all day or night before returning to a cramped hostel or B\u0026ampB where their whole family is forced to share a room. A room with no space for normal family life like cooking, playing or doing homework.

Mr Raab was a board member of Vote Leave, who the Electoral Commission ruled this week had broken the rules by overspending during the campaign.  But he suggested there was a problem with how the Tory Government, under David Cameron , had behaved during the campaign.  Mr Raab served as minister for Civil Liberties during the period in question. Asked if he believed the watchdog was politically biased, Mr Raab said: I\u0027m not getting into all of that - we\u0027ve got the rule of law and I respect it, and there\u0027s been a report out in the papers today about whether actually the Government\u0027s campaigning was correct.  Mr Raab was referring to the Independent Commission on Referendums\u0027 report on how such polls should be regulated in future. The report does raise concerns about the potential for potentially unlimited spending of public money in favour of one side of the debate before the final four weeks of the campaign. It suggests a the ban on government communications be extended for the whole referendum period, rather than just the final month.  However, the report also calls for a full white paper on how the government is to proceed to be published before any referendum is called.  And it called for a second referendum to be triggered if the Government significantly diverges from the original plan.

A devastated Mr Finnett described his talented filmmaker son as his best friend and travel companion as he spoke about the horror of the day.

They felt ready despite being so young and decided to foster before having children of their own, reports Coventry Live.   Sally-Ann, who had previously worked in early education , initially thought she would foster a child under seven, but was delighted to welcome a 15-year-old into her family.  At first, we were a little nervous about what to expect and how the match would work, Sally-Ann said. Would she respect us as carers, would we get the balance between understanding her and parenting right?  Fortunately, other than a few minor challenges expected with parenting a teenager, the placement was very successful and she fitted really well into our family. We found that people would just assume that she was our family member or a friend, which helped when transporting her to social activities with friends and to school, as she preferred to keep her peers from knowing that she was in foster care. One of the most special moments for the young couple was when their foster daughter agreed to be their bridesmaid at their wedding last year.

There\u0027s so much family turmoil right now — they want things to settle down before tying the knot, a source told The Sun .

The unnamed Reddit user decided to use the Google Street View mode in Google Maps to walk through the streets when he spotted two ladies near a building. Wanting to get a closer look, he zoomed in and changed the angle at which he was looking at them. But it seems Google\u0027s Street View car captured a lot more than an innocent image of two holidaymakers. Bizarrely, the up-close image appears to show that one of the girls has a third leg. A third limb with toes can be seen sticking out from the sorts of the blonde girl on the right.  Users immediately dubbed the three-legged tourist mutant girl. But all may not be as it seems, with many pointing out the third leg is actually just a glitch on the Google system.

The newlyweds have already been for a viewing and fallen in love with the sprawling manor in Home Park after being offered it as a gift from the Queen, according to a source who told Mail Online. Nestled in the heart of the Crown Estate\u0027s private 655-acre royal park, Adelaide Cottage was built in 1831 as a retreat for William IV’s wife Queen Adelaide. The home boasts a master bedroom with gilded dolphins on the coved ceiling and rope ornament from a 19th century yacht, Royal George along with a Graeco-Egyptian fireplace.  The cottage, which underwent renovation in 2015 and is described as picturesque by the heritage organisation Historic England, is just a few minutes walk from Windsor Castle - where the couple married on May 19. The source added: There are seven gated entrances and exits to Windsor Castle so the newlyweds could come and go without worrying about being photographed.  It was formerly known as Adelaide Lodge, incorporating part of John Nash\u0027s original Royal Lodge. It has been home to Royal dignitaries and courtiers, most recently Simon Rhodes, son of Margaret Rhodes, who was first cousin of the Queen and a Lady in Waiting to Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother. The Queen helped Rhodes move his family to Britain from his home in Zimbabwe after he was driven out by the continuing violence in the country. But perhaps its most famous resident has been Group Capt Townsend - who was equerry to King George VI from 1944 to 1952 and who moved into the property in 1945 with his wife Rosie Marchioness Camden. Soon after the couple’s divorce in 1952, his doomed romance with Princess Margaret became public.

But when her then-husband got a job in Worcester, the couple had to move more than 200 miles to Middlesbrough and her life changed dramatically. Saying goodbye to her family and friends proved harder than she expected, and she turned to food for comfort. Before long Vanessa, who was working in a coffee shop, had put on six stone and hated the way she looked. She said: I\u0027d always been really fit and healthy right up until my early 20s. I\u0027d danced at the same dance school for over 17 years and had never worried about my weight or what I was eating.  After getting married, my ex-husband got a job in Worcester and we moved over 200 miles south from Middlesbrough. Looking back, it was a really unhappy time for me. I moved away from my friends and family, from the dance school I loved to a place where I knew no one and food became my comfort. I\u0027d eat broken breakfast pastries and cakes throughout the day at work then would come home and cook three course dinners every night. We\u0027d always have a starter followed by a huge pasta meal and favourites like toad in the hole and cottage pie. But it wasn\u0027t until her mum had a terrifying cancer scare that she decided it was time to change her life.  She said: It wasn\u0027t until my really health conscious mum was diagnosed with breast cancer that I looked at my own health and realised just how heavy and unhealthy I\u0027d become. I was unhappy with how I looked and felt, I wasn\u0027t enjoying my job and I felt trapped in my marriage. So, I decided to address one thing at a time. I started doing workouts at home – I was too embarrassed and ashamed to go to the gym – and saw results pretty quickly.  Vanessa then decided to make bigger changes, and started buying healthy food products from MuscleFood .   She said: I overhauled my diet and found MuscleFood. I love to cook and love food so didn\u0027t want to cut out all the things I enjoyed. Instead I made a few adjustments to make them healthier – swapping regular bread and pasta for the low carb versions I could buy from MuscleFood. I can still have my treats – the protein pizza is amazing – and I know I\u0027m eating healthy, wholesome meals, like the Easy Cook meal bags. She joined a proper join and was training four times a week, and before long she even managed to get a job there.  And Vanessa, who now weights 11 and a half stone, is no long content with just being in good shape, and has become a bodybuilder. She recently won her category in the UKBFF (UK Bodybuilding Fitness Federation) competition. She said: My husband and I separated, and I took a new job working for a gym chain. I began to feel like my old self again.

Lindsay Taylor, 33, moved in with her ex after she and her husband suddenly became homeless. When Lindsay and new love, Mike Taylor, 50, suddenly became homeless, her open minded former husband Chris Kelley, 46, suggested they all move in together. Mum-of-four Lindsay describes it as “a very modern family” - and the two men now get on like a house on fire. She met Mike shortly after her daughter Joanna, now two, was born.  Knowing her marriage to Chris was over, Lindsay began divorce proceedings in 2016 but the couple remained on good terms. In July last year, Mike and Lindsay tied the knot in a beach ceremony, when she was pregnant with baby Harrison, now aged five months. Chris looked after their children, Joanna, and Lucas, five, who suffers from a rare immunodeficiency disorder, chronic granulomatous disease or CGD. Lucas’ stepsister Rachel, 17, who Lindsay gave birth to as a teenager, is finishing her final year of high school at home. Lindsay moved back in with her mum and began seeing Mike and soon they decided to move in together. But when they were evicted because the landlord was renting to them illegally, Chris suggested they all move into his five-bed house in Connecticut, USA.  Lindsay said: “We started to look for another place, but Chris made a suggestion that no-one was expecting. “He said: \u0027Why don\u0027t you both move in with me? We can pay one mortgage, one set of bills and keep all the kids together?\u0027. “Chris is very open minded, so for him, this wasn’t a big deal at all – it just made sense.” Moving in with Chris also gave them both the chance to see their children every day. Lindsay added: “We were willing to do anything to keep the flow of our family going. “Mike found it quite hard. He’s more classic and not as ‘go with the flow’. “It took him a while to be comfortable in our blended home.”  The men quickly struck up a friendship and helped each other out with painting and decorating. Mike joked to Chris: I took your wife, the least I could do was paint your kitchen. In October last year, Lucas underwent a bone marrow transplant which it is hoped will regenerate his immune system and cure him of CGD. He needs to live in a semi-sterile environment, and the five-bed home the family share is ideal. Lindsay said: “Lucas is a complex kid that needs a village around him and this is what we’re doing. “It might seem a bit strange that I live with both my ex-husband and my husband, but it’s what we need to do to get through this as a family. “Lucas’ immune system is so fragile right now that we need to limit his exposure to the outside world, and this means as a family we need to do this as well. “We can go to the store and little things like that but we avoid large gatherings and restaurants where we can easily pick up infections and pass them on to Lucas. “It’s a big sacrifice that everyone is making but hopefully it will all be for the best when Lucas gets better.” Cinema manager Chris has taken leave from work to care for Lucas, while Lindsay extended her maternity leave from her job. Mike also took leave from work to dedicate his time to his family, including Destiny Taylor, 20, and Danny Taylor, 19, who live with their grandparents a few doors down. Lindsay explained: “It was during the end of my pregnancy with Joanna that mine and Chris\u0027 marriage began to break down.

The adorable youngster was pictured beaming outside Clarence House in an official snap celebrating his big day. William and Kate have previously said they want George and his siblings, Charlotte, three, and two-month-old Louis, to have as “normal” an upbringing as possible, but they are still subject to certain Royal rules. Eagle-eyed royal fans will have noticed that George already complies with the tradition that boys within the monarchy are expected to wear shorts until the age of eight . It is believe to be a rite of passage dating back to the 16th century that they only graduate to long trousers at that age to signifying they are growing up.  The only time George has been seen publicly in long trousers was at Prince Harry’s wedding to Meghan Markle earlier this year. Another royal rule - that many five-year-olds would be heartbroken by - is that he may have to return a number of his gifts. According to official royal guidelines, “gifts offered by private individuals living in the UK not personally known to the member of the Royal Family should be refused where there are concerns about the propriety of motives of the donor or the gift itself”. This strict rule meant the Duke and Duchess of Sussex had to return millions of pounds worth of wedding gifts earlier this year, reports the Sunday Express .  Old tradition also dictates that no two direct heirs to the thrown are allowed to travel together at any one time . The rule dates date back to when air travel was a lot less safe and so far the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have so far ignored that rule - as did Charles with William and Harry when they were young. They are believed to have done so to be more cost efficient and to keep the family together. However, it is thought that George may be obliged to fly separately once he turns 12. Growing up in the smartphone age many of his peers will be taking selfies, but George will be reportedly discouraged from doing so.  As for why this has become part of royal protocol, US ambassador Matthew Barzun was able to shed some light on this in 2014, after having a meeting with Her Majesty who is reportedly not a fan. He told Tatler magazine: She was essentially saying, \u0027I miss eye contact\u0027. However, while whatever Her Maj says goes, the \u0027no selfie\u0027 rule hasn\u0027t exactly been strictly enforced. Signing autographs has long been banned for Royals amid fears the signature could be forged and used maliciously , however, in recent years, the same rules have been extended to selfies.  Kensington Palace shared George\u0027s official birthday snap last night , which was taken shortly after his brother Louis was christened, and by the same photographer who covered the event earlier this month. George will today enjoy private celebrations, with mum and dad Kate and Prince William keeping the plans under wraps this time. According to reports the party may take place in the Caribbean as William and Kate are rumoured to have taken their children on a summer break to the exclusive island of Mustique. The past 12 months have been an exciting period for George, from completing his first school year to once again joining his great grandmother the Queen on Buckingham Palace\u0027s balcony to mark her official birthday. Last year the young royal spent the run-up to his big day on an official tour of Poland and Germany with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and his younger sister Charlotte.

His first was a tour of Australia and New Zealand with his parents in 2014. Two years later he was joined by Charlotte, born in 2015, for the Cambridges’ tour of Canada – their first as a family of four.

The private camp, labelled a \u0027festering sore\u0027 by a local councillor, was granted permission in the 1980s for just 50 caravan pitches for travelling showmen to use during the winter months.

There are also a considerable number of mobile homes, which are being rented out by site residents to eastern European gypsies and the settled community.

Tony Jones, 48, told the Sunday Express : ‘For years the council has let them get away with it.’   A woman in her 60s added: ‘I have lived here more than 30 years and the showmen have never caused a problem.

The \u0026pound180million dividend payout comes as seven million United Utilities customers across the North West of England face restrictions on the water they use in their homes from August 5. As the heatwave continues, those who hose parched gardens or fill paddling pools for kids to cool down in during the long school holidays face a \u0026pound1,000 fine. Households are also urged to take shorter showers to help save water – while the equivalent of a bath and a half per household is wasted through leaking pipes that United have failed to plug. Water industry expert Professor David Hall of the University of Greenwich said bosses should spend more on infrastructure and less on the investors’ bonanza. He said: “The money’s available but it’s not reaching the right places, which are the leaks. It’s reaching the wrong places, which are the pockets of shareholders.  “Every water company in the world should be planning its resources so as to be able to cope with the worst scenarios. “And the water companies clearly haven’t been doing that. It’s been a month of hot weather, but it’s following a wet winter and spring. This isn’t really extreme circumstances.” United Utilities was handed an \u0026pound8million “under-performance” penalty last year and it lost 25% of supplies through leaking pipes. The firm said its total dividend of 39.73p a share is in line with a “five-year growth policy” of payouts that rise in line with retail price inflation. The company has handed more than \u0026pound1billion to investors in the last four years alone. Its largest shareholders include US finance giant BlackRock, which has ex-Tory chancellor George Osborne as an adviser, and asset management firm Lazard. Both will get over \u0026pound12million. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told the Mirror yesterday: “Water bosses cashing in while bills soar is outrageous. Instead of splashing cash to private shareholders, Labour will bring our water services back into public ownership so they work for the many, not the few.” Shadow Business Secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey added: “This exposes the obscenity of our privatised water industry. Labour is clear that water should be run in the interests of the people who use it.” The nine major water firms made \u0026pound18.8billion in post-tax profits in the decade to 2016, but paid out most of it – \u0026pound18.1billion – in dividends.  Severn Trent paid out \u0026pound123million last Friday, while South West Water’s owner Pennon will hand \u0026pound112million to shareholders in September. Thames Water last month announced it would halt bonuses to bosses this year and suspend dividend payments to its shareholders. It followed criticism from Ofwat, which forced Thames to repay \u0026pound15 to each customer over the next two years for failing to tackle leaks. Water companies across England and Wales lost a total of 659million gallons of treated water every day in 2017. A National Audit Office study showed water bills have risen 40% above inflation since the industry was privatised by Margaret Thatcher’s government in 1989. South East Water, which supplies Kent, Sussex, Surrey, Hampshire and Berkshire, has also asked its customers to cut their use. A hosepipe ban introduced in Northern Ireland on 29 June was lifted on Thursday. Reservoir levels have fallen after the driest January to June since 1929. The summer so far is also the driest since modern records began in 1961, with less than two inches of rain across the UK from June 1 to July 16. United’s last hosepipe ban in the North West lasted six weeks. The 2010 restriction lasted from July 9 to August 19 despite flash flooding and torrential rain in the region at the time. United Utilities’ top man has enjoyed a \u0026pound12million package over the past five years. Steve Mogford, 62, is the country’s second highest-paid water company boss, earning \u0026pound2.3million in 2017, according to research by the GMB union. The chief executive has seen his pay rise by 49% since 2013. His \u0026pound12million five-year earnings, the GMB says, include salary, bonuses, pensions and benefits. In January, Mr Mogford cashed in by selling \u0026pound1.7million of company shares. The boss has a \u0026pound1.5million farmhouse at Chorley, Lancs, and owns a \u0026pound2million yacht moored in Menorca. He also owns a villa on the island. United Utilities insisted that last week he was in the office working as the company applied for permission to extract water from three Cumbrian lakes, including Windermere."},{"url":null,"title":"worlds first computer book written","story":"NewsWorld\u0027s first computer book written 175 years ago by female programming pioneer Ada Lovelace found in box of junkA copy of Sketch of the Analytical Engine - written by Lord Byron\u0027s daughter, who helped fellow mathematician Charles Babbage in inventing the world’s first computer - was found in a box of junk\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByStephen White20:33, 22 JUL 2018Updated21:02, 22 JUL 2018NewsAda Lovelace\u0027s Sketch of the Analytical Engine which has sold at auction (Image: Moore Allen \u0026amp Innocent / SWNS)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA book written 175 years ago by the world’s first computer programmer has just sold for \u0026pound114,000 after being found in a box of junk.

It was written by Lady Ada Lovelace , who helped fellow mathematician Charles Babbage in inventing the world’s first computer, the Difference Engine, in 1822.  When he developed his follow-up Analytical Engine 15 years later, Lady Lovelace – a daughter of poet Lord Byron – was the first to recognise its wider potential.  She published the first set of programmed steps, or algorithm, such a machine could follow. The book, signed by her, contains her translation of a presentation in Turin by Babbage, along with her own interpretation of his theories.

Researchers identified and turned off a gene mutation in mice that causes skin to become lined and hair to thin out. It could mean that humans are also able to retain youthful looks as they grow older. Scientists at the University of Alabama, in Birmingham, induced a mutation that led to wrinkles and balding in mice. But they were able to reverse the effects by turning off a gene responsible for “mitochondrial dysfunction”, which refers to problems within the body’s cells.

Genevieve Pascolla was getting some shut eye on the United Airlines flight from London to Chicago when she woke to find the man appearing to pleasure himself under a blanket.  Terrified by what was happening, the 26-year-old raised the alarm with the woman sleeping beside her and informed the cabin crew. But what happened next left Genevieve appalled. She claims that after being given a new seat, the crew started making jokes and laughing about her ordeal - suggesting he was carrying out the sex act because of her. And shockingly she says the man was allowed to finish, with a child sitting close by.  Writing on social media, Genevieve said: They then started making jokes about the situation asking \u0027what perfume are you wearing\u0027 and excusing him saying \u0027he’s had a bit of wine\u0027. No one stopped him. He was allowed to finish, with a child sitting closely by. After exiting the plane first to talk to security, the security guard asked me if I’d like an apology from the offender. I immediately rejected the request. Genevieve has since shared a video of the man appearing to carry out the sex act, along with the email she received from United Airlines after she complained about what happened. In the email, sent to her by Lauren Michaels from customer care, it states Genevieve\u0027s request for a refund for the flight on June 4 has been refused and they are unable to offer goodwill compensation. It adds: Again, I apologise for the uncomfortable situation you experienced. I appreciate that you chose United for your travel. We hope your next trip with us will be a more positive experience.  In response Genevieve said: It took United Airlines a month an a half to respond to my complaint. And I received this email today. I am appalled at the lack of action taken in this situation in which as a woman, I was terrified. This man is clearly capable of much more. So women and men out there pick an airline that cares about your safety. Referring to being assaulted on one of your flight as a \u0027uncomfortable experience\u0027 is a bit of an understatement. Your lack of action is disgusting #metoo.  Maddie King, a United Airlines spokesperson, told BuzzFeed News in a statement that the inappropriate and offensive conduct like this is exceedingly rare on their aircraft, but we have a protocol to ensure our customers’ safety because it is our top priority.

Officials believed the blast, which left at least 11 dead, was carried out by a suicide bomber. Pictures showed the dead and wounded strewn across the road. Kabul police spokesman Hashmat Stanekzai said the blast went off near the main airport entrance, where supporters had been waiting to greet Dostum as his motorcade passed on its way to the city centre. The number of casualties may rise. The blast happened right after Dostum\u0027s convoy left the airport, he said.

Much of the area around the presidential palace was shut down for the arrival and there was a heavy security presence on the streets, emphasising the increasingly volatile political climate in Kabul. Dostum faced outrage from Western donor countries including the United States, after reports in 2016 that his guards had seized political rival Ahmad Eshchi and subjected him to beatings, torture and violent sexual abuse. He denied Eshchi\u0027s accusations but, amid international demands that he be held accountable, he left the country in May last year, ostensibly to seek medical treatment in Turkey. Dostum is one of Afghanistan\u0027s most infamous figures, loved and loathed in equal measure. He is a notorious warlord who supported the West against the Taliban - but he is accused of committing numerous atrocities dating back decades.

Even Darren O’Dea has been helping me with my defending and Graham Gartland has helped a lot and every day I’m trying to learn.“If my chance comes I’ll back myself to do the best I can.”Curran came off the bench in the 4-0 win over Stirling last weekend and is hoping to make it appearance No 2 nice and quickly against the Pars on Sunday.He added: “Dunfermline have always been a strong team in the Championship, always competing to get promotion to the Premiership so it will be a good test after they beat Peterhead 3-0 the other night.“There was a great turnout to the Stirling game so, hopefully, we’ll get another good one this weekend.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b51aaeebafbd-480x564.jpg ","title":"betfred cup ties remain vital as dundee united work to get going","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFor Dundee United, this season’s Betfred Cup looks all but over but don’t trying telling stand-in skipper Stewart Murdoch the final two group fixtures are meaningless.The 28-year-old knows today\u0026#8217s Tannadice clash with Alloa and next week’s trip to Elgin will be vital games as the Tangerines work to make sure they are a force in the coming Championship campaign.And while the ties so far against Arbroath and Ross County have ended in disappointment in terms of results, he believes they provided proof they’re heading in the right direction.“I think the thing is it’s really early doors and the manager will tell you we are still building, that’s maybe why we haven’t had the results we wanted,” he said.“We are still basically in a pre-season phase, so, for us, Tuesday was a really good competitive game up at County and gave us an opportunity to see exactly where we are right now.“It was another 90 minutes for the lads together and to help get to know each other. When you get the penalty at 0-0 and late on, if you score you probably go on and see out the game.“We didn’t and it was disappointing to lose but at the same time everybody could see the other night that already we can compete and we can take that forward. Now we move on to the next game.”And that need to be ready for next month’s league kick-off against Dunfermline means, for Murdoch and his team-mates, the next two outings are massive.“It will be difficult to qualify from our group now but we will take every game the same way we’ve always done and that’s as big ones.“We probably need to win both games now to have any chance and that’s what we’ll aim to do.“And they are another two big games leading into the start of the season in the Championship. We can get match sharpness and we will have another few boys who’ve had wee injuries back available.“It’s also another opportunity as well for the gaffer to maybe tinker with the team a bit and get boys some game time.”And, despite what the Betfred group table suggests, his belief this rebuilt United side is going to be a force to be reckoned with in the second tier, is growing.“I think everyone is confident we are building a good team and the manager will be wanting a few more players – I’m sure he’d said that.“I think the more good players we add the better we’ll play and the more we play together the better we’ll become.“It gave us confidence going to a place like County and competing the way we did. It was a good performance, it was just the result that was poor.“We are all excited about the season ahead and I think it’s going to be a positive one.”In the absence of newly-appointed club captain Fraser Fyvie, who’s likely to be out for another month or so as he completes his recovery from knee surgery at the turn of the year, the games so far have seen Murdoch wear the captain’s armband.Well aware of United’s history and some of the greats who’ve undertaken the role, he regards even having it on a temporary basis as a big feather in his cap.“I was captain a couple of times towards the end of last season and to be handed it again while Fraser is still out is nice,” he added.“This is a massive club, so to lead Dundee United out in any game is a huge honour for me.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"csaba laszlo urging dundee united to speed up","story":"\t\t\t\t\tCsaba Laszlo wants Dundee United to speed up when their Betfred Cup campaign continues at home to Alloa today.Despite a draw and a penalty shoot-out loss against Arbroath and a narrow defeat at Ross County in the two group ties so far, Csaba has been pleased with the signs coming from his rebuilt Tangerines.The next step forward he wants to see, though, is quicker use of the ball leading to more chances being created.“If I watch the team, Matej Rakovan, Adam Barton, Christoph Rabitsch, Callum Booth and others, they are really good football players,” he said.“They keep the ball well and have some good ideas, but we have to do more in the offence.“You can’t just control the game, you also have to go and finish, bring more danger in front of the opponent’s goal, be quicker.“I told them that for the second half at Ross County, ‘OK we are comfortable with the ball but we have to bring more danger’.”Fraser Aird will be in the squad after he sat out the County trip.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee boss neil mccann says craig wighton needed half time telling off","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee boss Neil McCann revealed Craig Wighton needed a proverbial kick up the backside at half-time in the weekend victory at Stirling – and he won’t be letting him “rest on” his talent in the future either.After going in at the break 1-0 to the good, Wighton’s second-half performance did show more urgency, with the 20-year-old delivering a telling cross for Sofien Moussa’s second and a classy finish himself.That strike was the Scotland U/21 international’s first since a 5-1 win over Motherwell way back in February 2017 after a serious knee injury curtailed much of the last campaign.And his manager is looking forward to seeing what Wighton can bring to the side in the season ahead.Neil said: “I’m delighted for him.

I’ve come down from Inverness to pay my respect, and I’ll be raising a drink in his memory tonight.”Born in Coupar Angus, Gilzean is considered one of the finest players to grace Dens Park and netted an unrivalled 169 goals during the halcyon days of the 1950s and 60s.His eye for a goal was a crucial factor in Dundee’s title-winning season in 1961-62, before the club went on to reach the semi-final of the European Cup.Season ticket holder George McLaren, 73, said: “He has been such a big part of Dundee FC. My favourite memories of him are probably the goals against Dundee United.“I was shocked to hear of his passing and wanted to come here today to pay my respects. He will never be forgotten. He proved himself here at Dens and at Spurs.“An absolute legend for both clubs.”Fellow fan Daniel Smith, 33, from Maryfield, added: “There’s been a good turnout of people paying their respects here today at Dens.“He is a Dundee legend. I grew up on stories about Gilzean through the years and the things he accomplished at Dens. He still holds a number of records at Dens Park.”A tribute on the Dundee FC website stated: “Everyone at Dundee Football Club was devastated to learn of the death of Dundee legend Alan Gilzean aged 79 after a short illness.“A true Dundee legend in every sense of the word, we may never see his goal scoring like again and the thoughts of everyone at Dens Park are with Alan’s family and friends at this difficult and sad time.”He made the jump from Tayside to Tottenham in 1964 for a £72,500 fee, lifting two League Cups, the FA Cup and the UEFA Cup.As well as the dark blue of Dundee, Hall of Famer Gilzean earned 22 Scotland caps between 1963 and 1971, bagging 12 goals.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b51aab022de5-e1532091100625-751x564.jpg ","title":"dundee kiltwalk stet for biggest year as 2000 signed up","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee\u0026#8217s Kiltwalk is set for its biggest year yet — with all the signs pointing towards a record number of walkers for 2018.Paul Cooney, chief executive of the Kiltwalk, said the number of sign-ups was close to 2,000 with four weeks to go until the big day — almost the same number of people who took part last year.He met up with members of the Tay Road Bridge Joint Board and Dundee United midfielder Scott Allardice to launch the new start point of the five-mile Wee Wander.It’s one of three routes walkers can choose to complete, and follows the banks of the Tay from the refreshed urban art space underneath the road bridge to Monifieth.All three walks take place on Sunday August 19 — with the start points at the Tay Road Bridge, Tayport and St Andrews — and any registered charity can be supported.At the end of the Kiltwalk, all funds raised are given a massive 40% boost by the Hunter Foundation, run by philanthropist Sir Tom Hunter.The Kiltwalk takes no cut of the cash raised — instead funding the events through registration fees, which means every penny raised goes direct to good causes.Paul said: “Dundee has been brilliant with us. This year, we’re closing in on 2,000 people with four weeks to go, and last year we had 2,000 people taking part.“It’s a brilliant way of raising money for your chosen charity.

We just captured events and places that we thought were significant,” he said.“There are photos of people, of events, the arts, dance activities, things such as the New Year’s Day Dook and a lot of buildings that we thought either were significant or would become significant.“I was given access to Dens Park, for example, because I imagine in 10 years or so it might no longer exist as we know it.“I’m quite surprised at what we’ve been able to achieve.”The Tele was given access to some of the archive and the differences in city life now and then are stark.The 1916 survey features street scenes in the city centre and atop the Hilltown – and couldn’t be any more different from the snaps from 1991.Many of the later images show the city at its post-industrial peak, complete with questionable fashion choices and a City Square yet to be pedestrianised.Red Sky’s modern day survey is packed with sights that are likely to be familiar now – the new railway station entrance under construction, rusted-in tram rails on the Murraygate and dance performances in front of Caird Hall.Rather topically, there are also photos of William Halley’s mill – now reduced to rubble.Alistair Wilson, of Dundee Libraries, said the relevance of these photographic surveys becomes very clear after just a few years, giving people a fresh perspective on a city that might have changed without them really noticing.“The 1991 survey was carried out by Dundee Photographic Society. It and the other surveys act like a social record of how the city was at that time,” he said.“Looking back at 1991, which doesn’t feel that long ago, you can see so many things have changed – the way people dress, the jobs they have, even the cars on the streets.“Once the exhibition finishes the plan is that it will move about so everyone can see it.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee united set

kerr","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee favourite Cammy Kerr has called on the club’s supporters to give Alan Gilzean the send off the Dens legend deserves this weekend.The Dark Blues take on Dunfermline this Sunday in the first home game since Gilzean passed away at the age of 79.The club legend’s funeral takes place tomorrow and Sunday’s clash promises to be one full of emotion for everyone associated with Dundee.A special matchday programme will be available while there will be a minute’s silence and black armbands worn by the players but Kerr expects a bumper home crowd to give Gilzean a roaring send-off.The 22-year-old said: “It’s a terrible thing to happen.“Sadly, I never got to see him play or have the privilege of meeting him but what a figure to have played at this football club.“To know you are at the same football club as some of the greatest footballers have played at is fantastic.“I’d like to send my regards and best wishes to his family at this time, obviously a tough time.“In terms of the game, I think it will be emotional and, hopefully, the crowd turn out for a very special player for this football club.“I’ve read a few of things in the papers about the player he was and I actually remember watching the thing on TV at White Hart Lane when they closed the old stadium.“I knew he was a good player but I didn’t know how big he was for Tottenham.“When they said ‘The Original King of White Hart Lane, Alan Gilzean’ it just shows the regard he was held in down there.“Naming a lounge after him doesn’t do him justice because he was, obviously, a great talent.”Being a fan himself, Kerr knows the kind of supporters Dundee have and the loyalty they show their team – something he experienced in a very noisy welcome and send-off at last week’s friendly against Farense in Portugal.“We could hear them when we got off the bus in Albufeira but you can’t see how many there were,” Kerr added.“At the end I got a few photos and things and they were singing away.“The best bit was when we were leaving and they were all banging on the bus – it was great!“You see European games and all the fans waiting on the buses so it felt like that, it felt great.“For the fans to go across there just shows the loyalty that they’ll go across to Portugal for a friendly. That’s fantastic to see.“I gave away a pair of my boots and I think someone had them on running about the streets about 10 minutes later!”Allan Johnston’s Pars side will be looking to spoil Dundee’s return to the newly-named Kilmac Stadium at Dens Park by putting themselves into pole position in Betfred Cup Group D.And Kerr knows the Dark Blues will have to be right on their game to see off a Dunfermline side that swept past Peterhead in midweek.He added: “The game is on the TV as well which is good and the pitch is coming on really well, too. The groundsmen do a great job to give us a good pitch.“It’s always good to come out and have a game on the TV, it’s exciting, but Dunfermline are a side that will definitely try to push this year.“They’ve made some really important signings throughout their side and they’ll be a really tough test, so we’ll have to be firing on all cylinders.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/chelsea4.jpg-e1532095520810-772x564.jpg ","title":"inspirational dundee woman chelsea hoping mentor others and help to change their lives","story":"\t\t\t\t\tShe is the inspirational young woman whose harrowing open letter to her drug addict parents thrust her on to the national stage and led to her sharing a platform with the first minister.Now Young Scot of the Year Chelsea Cameron wants to use her experiences to mentor others and offer them the chance to do life-changing voluntary work.Chelsea, 20, a former head girl at Menzieshill High School, made headlines in January last year after she wrote to mum Tammy and dad Alexander about her upbringing in Menzieshill.Chelsea with First Minister Nicola SturgeonShe described her parents’ behaviour and the devastating impact drug addiction could have on families.Her life has changed dramatically since then and now she wants other young people to be given experiences and skills to build themselves a future.Chelsea, who works as a PA, said: “I’m looking to informally mentor and give a voluntary opportunity to a young person between the ages of 16-20.“If it turns out that I get a huge response I will need to sit down and work out how to make the selection.“It may be possible to take on more than one young person initially – maybe a boy and a girl.“Over the past year I’ve had so many opportunities to attend great events and meet so many incredible people that I used to think were so far out of my reach.“As Young Scot of the Year, I’m committed to helping another young person to have opportunities to broaden their horizons and realise the world is their oyster.“I attend many events ranging from speaking to young people, policy makers, politicians and everything in between – there was even royalty once.”Chelsea added: “I have given this a lot of thought and would love to hear from people who think they would like to take up this opportunity.“I feel a responsibility to do something to help someone else in the way I have been helped.“Along the way, I’d hope this young person develops self- confidence, good communication, presentation and public speaking skills, time management and how to prioritise.“This is a fantastic chance to develop some skills and build networking opportunities that can be advantageous for future employment.“All of this is combined with lots of fun and plenty of chocolate cake. If I can give another young person the opportunities I’ve been given, why would I pass it up?”Chelsea said she would love to identify a suitable candidate by next month.She added: “I have a lot of

charities,” she said.“If this is something you would love to do, please send a short piece about yourself and why you feel this would be a good opportunity for you to Chelsea-cameron@hotmail.”After her letter was made public, Chelsea was invited to London to appear on television and radio, beginning with the Victoria Derbyshire show.She was also interviewed on various news programmes and within

club are hoping the damage is minimal and the use of the boot is purely a precaution.However, it’s unlikely he’ll be risked for the weekend game with Allan Johnston’s side.That means French midfielder Madianga is in line for a first competitive start since signing for the club over the summer.The former French U/17 international joined the club from Bulgarian side Lokomotiv GO – the same side Sofien Moussa was signed from.He made his competitive debut for the Dark Blues last weekend in the 4-0 victory at Stirling Albion, coming off the bench for fellow-new boy Elton Ngwatala.And manager

have some real exciting talent in there,” the Dens gaffer said.Also missing at the moment for Dundee is winger Roarie Deacon.He’s continuing his recovery from ankle surgery and is expected to be out

for old iconic dundee pie shop site","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA famous Dundee pie shop bakery left to decay for more than 40 years is to be transformed into a quirky new home.The Auld Dundee Pie Shop at 18-20 Castle Street, which served up the famous Wallace peh, was a household name in the city from the turn of the 20th Century until it closed down in the late 1970s.Owned by David Wallace, it was once part of a string of pie shops run by the family, also featuring a restaurant named Wallace’s Tea Rooms.Dundee-based Castle Development has now been granted planning permission to convert the C-listed bakehouse at the back of the former shop and tearooms into a two-bedroom home.The development will add to the ongoing conversion of the adjacent St Paul’s Church, which is being transformed from a pub into residential accommodation.The business originally opened in 1892 in the Vault under the Caird Hall, an area now being converted into trendy restaurants such as the recently-opened Brassica.In the early 1920s Mr Wallace moved to the building on Castle Street, when the Vault was due for demolition, as the building was big enough to open the tearoom as well as the two-floor bakehouse.During the Second World War it is reported the queues for pies and bridies used to stretch down to the bottom of the street as they were able to supplement the meat ration. Now hidden from street view, the bakehouse has not been used since it closed 41 years ago, in 1977.A pend between two shops allows access from the street, which then opens up into a large courtyard and the entrance to the bakery.A design statement submitted by RDA Architects, on behalf of Castle Development, says the history of the building will be incorporated.It states: “The proposals seek to highlight the historic elements on the replacement elevation highlighting the area from which the dilapidation began, visibly documenting the history of the site and ensuring the preservation of the remaining structure.“The materials have been carefully considered against the context of the former bakery, its perceived history and gradual dilapidation and eventual demolition of its western elevation.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b4f0793923bf-771x564.jpg ","title":"stirling albion or celtic its all the same to dundee new boy jean mendy","story":"\t\t\t\t\tIn his very short time at Dundee, Senegalese striker Jean Mendy has already shown he can get fans off their seats at Dens Park this season.And he plans to continue doing that – as well as getting goals – whether he’s playing against Stirling Albion or Celtic, it’s all the same to him.He told the Tele: “I don’t know the teams at the moment!“For me, playing Stirling is like playing against Celtic, it’s the same for me – I just play my game, it doesn’t matter, and try to win every game.”The 28-year-old was delighted to start his career in dark blue with a goal after he knocked in a good strike from the edge of area as his new team began the season with a morale-boosting 4-0 victory at Stirling Albion.“It was good and we won of course – it’s very important to start winning,” Mendy added.“It was a little bit hot, I think, on the pitch on Saturday, we could feel it.“The performance was good, can be better you know, it was the first game but it was good to get the confidence with this game.“It was great for the team to score a lot of goals and we have shown we have people who can score.“I was pleased to get the goal, I got the chance and I put it in.“It was perfect for me to start with a goal and good for my confidence so I’m very happy to start like this.”Mendy joined the club from Belgian top-flight side Lokeren where he struggled to make an impact.That was after piling in the goals in the Norwegian lower leagues.Back in 2012, he banged in 27 goals in 25 league games for Elverum in the third tier before 27 in 52 in the next tier for Kristiansund. A move up to the top flight only brought a return of six in 23 for Sandefjord before returning to Kristiansund and then getting the big move to Belgium.Manager Neil McCann said he’d been keeping an eye on Mendy’s progress after missing out on him when he departed Norway.He’s finally got his man and the forward is delighted to be at Dundee, even if he’s not spent much time in the city with the club spending a week-long training camp in Portugal.He said: “I’ve enjoyed my time so far, it’s a good club with good players, too, and I think this year will be a good one.“Portugal was a lot of training. That sort of preparation is normal and it was good for us but you feel it when we played the games over there.“We didn’t get the wins in the friendlies, maybe one win against Sunderland but we lost the last two but they were only friendlies – more important is winning the games when the season begins, like Saturday.“It was very good to show we are ready.“There are a few new players, myself as well, and it’s very important for us to get together with the team and start to know each other in training, talk together and know how we all play.“It’s looking good. We’ll obviously continue to work more but I think the season will be good.”After starting off Group D with victory, Mendy and his new team-mates take on Dunfermline at home in front of the television cameras on Sunday.Even if he doesn’t know much about his opponents just yet, Mendy knows the Dundee fans will be expecting a good show from their side and he’s hoping to add to his goal tally.“I’m looking forward to my first home game this weekend.“That will be very important in front of our supporters.“Of course, we want to play a good game, put on a show for the fans and win the game, too.“We are going for a victory.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7486028.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film

School of Highland Dance and travelled to the ScotDance Canada Championships Series in Calgary, Alberta recently, where she took on fellow dancers from all over the world.Clearly not fazed by the competition she was ultimately named Open Canadian Champion for her age group.The competition was her fifth championship event and she won all three categories she entered \u0026ndash Highland competition, Premiership National Championship and Open Highland Championship.This latest victory followed on from a runner-up spot at the SDTA Central Scotland Championshps earlier this year, an impressive placing that was itself followed by her first Open Championship title secured at the UK Alliance Championships in Edinburgh, in which she saw off 33 other top competitors.Her younger sister Grace (9) also competed in the Canadian event, in the intermediate section, and came home with five medals.Provost Helen Carmichael had met both girls before they set off across the Atlantic and was delighted to welcome them back to Inverness Town House this week.\"Lily is an excellent example of what our young people can achieve with commitment and sheer endeavour,\" she said.\"While I congratulate Lily on her personal achievements I also commend the role that she is playing through her participation in international Highland dance competitions as a young ambassador for Inverness and the Highlands.\"She added: \"Before Lily and Grace left for Canada, I was delighted to donate Inverness Town House pin badges to both girls so that they could take part in the pin exchange which took place at the start of the championship series.\"The girls acted as ambassadors for Inverness, exchanging pins between dancers of many different nationalities.\"Lily\u0027 mother Yvonne said: \"A

This can cause restricted use of the path for pedestrians and customers.\"Our plans for the area are to tidy it up and improve the landscaping, insert some tables and benches and a secure area for housing bicycles.\"The plot, she added, would be serviced by the Castle Tavern\u0027 CCTV and be maintained to a high standard.There are also possible longer-term plans to install a charging point for electric bikes.\"The use of this land would be mainly seasonal as we do not intend to put any building on it and it would be used primarily for visitors who currently cycle or walk the Great Glen Way,\" she said.Inverness Central councillor Bet McAllister said she thought it was a \"wonderful\" idea for tourists and residents alike.\"It will be perfect for when the weather is nice and people want to sit outside for their meals,\" she said.\"The Castle Tavern is always very busy, especially their outside area.\"Cllr McAllister wants to encourage more restaurants and bars to utilise outdoor areas as long as they are able to ensure that people with disabilities are not impacted.\"In Inverness our streets can be quite narrow, so it has to be done properly,\" she said.Glad to hear that the move by the Castle Tavern could benefit cyclists, she added: \"The more bikes on the roads in Inverness the better the quality of air for everyone.\"Monday 23 Jul 2018 3:35 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116631.jpg","title":"Inverness street closures ahead of Highland Games","story":"THE Inverness Highland Games take place on Saturday at Bught Park.The programme, however, will start on Friday with the Inverness Gala evening including the Inverness Wheelbarrow Grand Prix, organised by Inverness Culloden Rotary Club, and performances in the High Street by the City of Inverness Pipe Band, the Elizabeth Fraser School of Highland Dancing and the Inverness branch of the Royal Scottish Country Dance Association.There will also be a parade across Ness Bridge to the Northern Meeting Park at 7pm where the Highlands\u0027 Strongest Man and Strongest Woman Championships organised by the Forge Gym will take place.As part of these events a number of city centre streets will be closed between 6.50pm and 7.25pm on Friday evening.Closures planned are as follows:1.

Children love jumping from stone to stone and guddling about in water.\"It has all been looked at from the safety point of view, but let\u0027 face it, if you take children to the beach they jump from stone to stone. I think it is a good project and if necessary I will be the first to dip my toe in the water there.\"Inverness city manager David Haas said: \"This has had youth engagement all along and I think it is something that is going to sit well in the environment of a place that will become even more popular as people engage with the river.\"Masterminding the project is Bespoke Atelier, a Glasgow-based design studio.Its design statement, which will be discussed at a planning meeting later this summer, explains the lades and weirs already around the River Ness were used as inspiration. The stones would be patterned, partly to minimise slips and also to reflect foliage patterns from trees growing on the islands.A report from Inverness City Artworks Group states: \"While it was preferable to use natural stone, the cost might prove prohibitive and alternative materials might need to be considered.\"It was also minuted that if concerns were raised regarding the cost of this feature, the high cost of \"providing basic play equipment should be highlighted.\"The group was given assurances that the design would, when completed, look like part of the landscape, and members were told that Bespoke Atelier was confident that all aspects of the design could be met within the available budget.Path improvements in the vicinity are included in the application.Company director Yvonne Elliot-Kellighan said the stepping stone forms envisaged were inspired by the shape of the Ness Islands, and the stones themselves could be engraved with botanical patterns \"creating a ow and connection between stepping stones\".The children\u0027 feature is not far from MY Ness, a \u0026pound300,000 centrepiece which was unveiled as a concept in May and has still to receive planning permission.The River Ness Public Art Project is funded by Creative Scotland (\u0026pound305,000), Inverness Common Good Fund (\u0026pound250,000), HIE (\u0026pound66,000) and Highland Council (\u0026pound106,000).At a time of heightened concern about public spending, Highland Council has stressed that the vast majority of the money for the projects comes from third parties and cannot be used for other purposes, and the council\u0027 \u0026pound106k is from capital investment and not revenue spend.Monday 23 Jul 2018 3:35 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116731.jpg","title":"New cinema proposed for the Black Isle","story":"\u0026nbspA THRIVING film society on the Black Isle looks set to take its next big step after plans were submitted for a permanent cinema to cater for growing demand.The brand new cinema, which would be located on the seafront in Cromarty, will cater to Cromarty and Resolis Film Society events and serve as a base for the town\u0027 increasingly popular annual film festival.Cromarty Estate, which owns the land, has lodged the application in partnership the film society, which would act as its tenant.The plans feature two key elements. The first is the cinema, which would be built on land close to the ferry slipway and next to an existing boat storage shed.The cinema would seat roughly 30 people and host weekly screenings throughout the year, rising to twice a week in the summer. It would also be used to help house Cromarty\u0027 growing film festival, which attracts fans and famous faces from across the country late every autumn.Cromarty Estate also plans to build an office hub alongside the cinema in a bid to cater for growing business demand in the town.In a supporting statement submitted by the estate alongside its application, its agents said: \"A dedicated cinema space will allow screening all year which currently is not possible using existing buildings with poor black out facilities.\"The cinema may also be available for other users to hire for screenings, presentations and lectures.\"They added that the cinema would also \"ideally\" feature an outdoor area \"for summer screenings and festival events\".Making the case for new office space in the town, the estate said: \"Cromarty has a thriving entrepreneurial community but this is not matched by suitable office accommodation with the result that many find themselves having to move their business bases from Cromarty to Dingwall, Tore or Inverness when they outgrow their own homes, with the resulting loss of employment opportunities in the town.\"Addressing this need... will make Cromarty a more balanced and sustainable community.\"In a statement supporting the application, the film society said that a survey of Cromarty residents found that 82 per cent backed a cinema in the town and the same number would go to more screenings if the venue was better than what is currently on offer.Justifying the decision to proceed with an all-new site for the cinema, the estate\u0027 agents said the site\u0027 position close to adequate parking and its location away from homes were both positives, as was the existing vehicle access from the harbour.The buildings would feature dark metal cladding to the walls of the cinema, with timber cladding on the office hub.If the plans are approved construction could start as early as spring next year.Monday 23 Jul 2018 3:35

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 25","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 23/06/18, 5:52 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,Labour and the Lib Dems must recognise and respect the recent vote in the Scottish Parliament and the views of their Scottish colleagues who refused to give consent to the damaging Brexit legislation proposed at Westminster.Labour amendments to former clause 11 of the bill require consent of the Scottish Parliament unless a UK Minister ‘has reasonable grounds for believing that regulations are required for the purpose of giving effect to any international obligations’.It would be catastrophic for Scotland if Labour left the door open for the Tory Government to breach the devolution settlement.Leaving Holyrood exposed to powers taken without consent in any area connected to an international trade agreement would be disastrous. This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

The pair were steady, neat and quick all day and broke the timing beam on stage eight, Bishop\u0026#8217s Glen, to complete the rally in 23rd overall and third in class four.Everything finally came together and the car and crew got the result they deserve. The collective sigh of relief could be heard in body shops and garages all across the land, with annual leave in  most of them on hold until Douglas\u0026#8217s result came in.Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker were out in the mighty Peugeot 106 once more and were having a decent day, with a few hairy moments when the intercom wasn\u0026#8217t working (or so Duncan tells it) and unfortunately breaking a gearbox mount which, though fixed between stages, saw them over their time limit and out of the rally.Mull ace Ally Currie and his Oban co-driver Grant MacNiven continued to chase the bigger more powerful machinery in his 150bhp Fiesta and was sitting third in the 2WD section when a problem that they had been experiencing for most of the day became worse \u0026#8211 and the passenger side front wheel decided to part company on the approach to the start line of stage seven.The family duo of Cara and Donald MacNeill made a welcome return to the stages, in new machinery this time, debuting their Subaru Impreza and bringing it home in one piece in 31st overall and second in class nine.Mull\u0026#8217s James Campbell and Claire Tilley also got their Mitsubishi Evo to the finish and will be happy with the result.The event was won by Kilmarnock\u0026#8217s Andrew Gallagher with Jane Nicol on the notes in the CobbleShop Ford Focus WRC.The next rally action for Argyll is the Mach 1 Stages on the weekend of July 14/15 at Machrihanish.\u0026nbspPICS:Photographs by West Coast PhotosAlly Currie and Grant MacNiven blasted it while their Fiesta was still on four wheels. no_a27ArgyllRally01no_a27ArgyllRally02Overall Winners Andrew Gallagher and Jane Nicol in their Ford Focus. no_a27ArgyllRally03Donald MacNeill from Furnace and Cara MacNeill, Glasgow, make light work of the hairpin in their Subaru.  no_a27ArgyllRally04James Campbell and Claire Tilley from Mull in their Mitsubishi. no_a27ArgyllRally05Kicking up dust in their Peogeot 106 are Lochgilphead team Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker. no_a27ArgyllRally06\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"tv company seeks argyll adventurers","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 11:20 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowCould you travel to The Far East without stepping on a plane?If so, a television production company is looking for you.Studio Lambert, the company behind Gogglebox, is seeking folk from Argyll to take part in a trans-global race for a cash prize.Flightless is described as an \u0026#8216ambitious real-world adventure series\u0026#8217.

I am still receiving many justifiable complaints about the terrible condition of Mansefield Road in Port Ellen and the hospital road in Bowmore. With long overdue road works going on across Islay and the rest of the Kintyre and Islands ward, it\u0026#8217s only fair these roads are not ignored.The poor condition of the Bruichladdich toilets continues to be raised by local residents.Since contacting the appropriate department I have been informed repairs and maintenance are planned for them.While checking on the progress of pothole repairs I had previously requested, I noticed some of the recent street light repairs leave a lot to be desired. While a quick fix is better than nothing, many of these short-term fixes need to be looked at again.I have been speaking to the BT Openreach staff across Islay who are expanding our island\u0026#8217s internet capabilities. I have contacted BT to make sure recent issues with phone lines in some local households are not a result of the broadband upgrades.There has been progress with local housing associations after pointing out many of their tenants are having trouble with mould in their housing. Measures are now being implemented to to rectify the problem. I was happy to hear Argyll Community Housing Association has fixed gate latches on four of its houses at Cnoc Na Faire in Port Ellen after I raised this with them a few weeks ago.I met with environment, development and infrastructure committee member councillor Gary Mulvaney about Kintyre and Islands\u0026#8217 crumbling infrastructure, alongside our growing industrial output with the success of distilleries on Islay and Jura.Later that day I spoke directly to my constituents in Tarbert after a number of locals \u0026#8211 some business owners \u0026#8211 contacted me about the recent flood of sewage on Harbour Street as a result of blocked drains. Scottish Water were coming under fire from locals because of its slow progress on the matter.I made my anger about the poor conditions in Tarbert very clear when I contacted Scottish Water. A long-term solution to needs to be put in place.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Scottish Water is asking customers to use water wisely in their daily activities to help maintain supplies during the current hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer use has increased significantly.In some areas, there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of use and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce use wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their use and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible and use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.More advice on using water wisely is online at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or call 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer, Chief Operating Officer, Scottish Water.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"riverside fun day sparkles in the sun","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 9:44 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe sun shone on the Riverside in Lochgilphead for a day of fun.Mid Argyll Community Pool and Riverside Rascals nursery hosted the family day on Sunday July 1, featuring a variety of colourful craft and charity stalls.The unmistakeable aroma of barbecue wafted across the car park from Riverside Rascals nursery, which opened its doors to the public for the occasion, complete with children\u0026#8217s activities.MACPool lifeguards were on hand to keep an eye on the youngsters in the pedal boats while the sunshine glistened across the splashing fun.PICS:Four-year-old Kaiden Abel from Lochgilphead has fun splashing in the inflatable outdoor pool. 06_a27RiversideFun01Kyra Robertson, aged 11, from Cairnbaan, tries to hook a duck on the MS centre stand \u0026#8211 and it\u0026#8217s not as easy as it looks. 06_a27RiversideFun04On the MS Centre Mid Argyll stall were Maggie Dodd and centre manager Karen McCurry. 06_a27RiversideFun07Mary Stewart of the Loch Awe Pottery helps sisters Abby and Chloe McCallum, from Glasgow, to decorate their pottery. 06_a27RiversideFun08Cathleen MacDonald was there with her Woolly Bobbins textile-base crafts. 06_a27RiversideFun09Alongside Cathleen was her mum Margaret Davidson, who creates soft toys under the name Twisted Yarn.

John\u0026#8217s 72 was the best gross score on the day with Peter Mclean Jnr moving into third place when he recovered from a horror start to post a 76.The handicap trophy was another tight affair with Jimmy MacNab showing the youngsters how it is done with a superb net 64 taking a one shot lead over David Ronald and a two-shot lead over James Smyth.The John Reid Quaich which is played as part of the championship was won by Duncan Johnstone on 134, edging out Iain Macalister by one shot.Despite the weather conditions, the members gathered in good spirits for the final round of the championship, a day that everyone looks forward to and with all competitions very close an interesting days play lay ahead.In the leading group, play was a bit nervy with neither player at their best on the front nine with Iain reducing the deficit to one shot with eight holes left to play. John got one back at the 11th and then another two at the 12th before a birdie at the 14th pretty much saw him home and dry.

His problems did not end there, though, as injury also ruled out Gordon Whyte, Thomas Whyte and Dunky Kerr although the latter was stripped as Kyles only substitute, while Robbie MacLeod was unavailable.Caberfeidh manager Jodi Gorski had Ally MacLennan back but he was also short of players, with Jamie Matheson and Colin MacLennan among his absentees and they lined-up with the Cabers with the second team.Kyles settled into the game with a goal on four minutes. There was a scramble in the goal area where Colin MacDonald fought for possession with Caberfeidh keeper Ewen Pilcher and defender Blair Morrison, and it was actually Luke Thornton who got the final touch to put the hosts ahead.Luke Thornton got Kyles and his second on eight minutes. Sandy MacKenzie played the ball across from the left wing forward position to Luke Thornton who smashed a shoulder-high volley past the Cabers keeper from 15 yards.Kevin Bartlett made it 2-1 on 13 minutes when he latched onto a loose ball in defence and carried the ball forward before thumping it past John Whyte from a central position.However Kyles restored their two-goal cushion on 42 minutes to make it 3-1 at the break. Former Skye Camanachd player Neil MacVicar, playing in attack, switched play from right wing forward to Sandy MacKenzie at left wing forward and he rifled the ball past keeper Pilcher from 18 yards.Grant Irvine got in on the act on 55 minutes. A ball forward from midfield was brought out of the air by Colin MacDonald, who slipped it out to the right wing forward position to the onrushing Grant Irvine, who swept the ball across the keeper into the right-hand side of the net.Sandy MacKenzie put gloss on the win with a rather fortuitous effort on 62 minutes. MacKenzie turned full back Blair Morrison and as keeper Pilcher came out to clear the ball, it rebounded off MacKenzie into the net.Donald Irvine was superb for Kyles, while Grant Irvine was an instrumental figure at full centre.Caberfeidh did not perform at the levels seen when they took shinty’s top flight by surprise in the earlier part of this season.\u0026nbspMarine Harvest South Division 1Title hopefuls the Kyles Athletic second team march on, beating Ballachulish 1-0 at the Jubilee Park.Balla’s Cain MacPhee was free of a one-match ban, while Kyles were without Luke Thornton who was on first team duty.The only goal of the game came on 19 minutes and it was a superb strike from Martin MacFadyen whose 25 yard piledriver from the middle of the park gave the keeper no chance.Balla’ had the chance to level on 35 minutes when referee Callum Duff awarded them a penalty, penalising a \u0026#8216kick\u0026#8217 inside the D.Lorne Brown took the penalty and he struck the ball well enough but his effort was superbly saved by Kyles keeper Douglas Nicolson. It was one of a number of great stops by the Kyles custodian.Kyles have a five point lead on second place Bute although they have played a game more.Bute 4 Bute scored three times in the final third of the game to defeat Aberdour 4-1 in their 12.30pm throw up at The Meadows.Bute’s Craig MacKay was unavailable as he served the second game of a two-match suspension.Aberdour travelled without Cameron McCue and David McDougal.James Craig gave Bute the lead after just five minutes and that proved to be the only goal of a tight first 45 minutes during which Bute goalie Kevin Queen saved well from David MacKenzie, tipping his effort over the bar.Referee Robert Baxter pointed to the penalty spot when Ruairidh Reid was wiped out inside the D, taking a stick across the knees, when he looked set to equalise. Angus Thorburn struck the penalty well but Kevin Queen made a brilliant save to keep his side in front.The visitors were awarded a second penalty shortly after when Roddy MacColl was felled inside the box. Angus Thorburn stepped up again but this time he did not catch the ball as he would have liked and his effort went past the post.The penalty misses were a blow for Aberdour and Bute took advantage and, with some good running and quick passing, they went on to score three more times.Robert Walker made it 2-0 on 65 minutes and Iain McDonald added a third with 15 minutes remaining.Chris Lawrence made it 4-0 on 80 minutes, although there was some consolation for Aberdour when Ruairidh Reid finished well a couple of minutes later. Angus Thorburn battled to get the ball to Reid and his powerful strike from just outside the D gave the keeper no chance.Bute were sharper on the day and they deserved the win but the final scoreline was a little harsh on Aberdour in what was only their second league defeat of the season.Bute now leap-frog Aberdour into second place in the league on goal difference and the Islanders have a game in hand.Kilmory 1 MacRae Park was in perfect condition to host the local derby between Kilmory and the Inveraray second team.A large crowd gathered to watch two teams filled with youth and experience.Kilmory started with top scorer Alister MacArthur in defence and they had young Andrew Innes up-front, supported by the more experienced Hal Jones.Inveraray went with a mature forward line which included Euan McMurdo, John MacKenzie and Neil Campbell but their back five were all aged under 18.But it was across the centre line where all the action happened in the first half.Referee Alex MacVicar had a busy afternoon and David Macpherson was first into the book for a cynical challenge on Sandy Leiper.It wasn’t long before Leiper joined him, yellow carded for a late swing on his fellow winger, young Ruaraidh Graham.Duncan MacBrayne was next to fall foul of the official for persistent fouling.In-between all the yellow cards, Alister MacArthur was dictating the play from the Kilmory defence, with young Hamish MacLennan doing the same for Inveraray and the first half ended scoreless.Inveraray came out the traps the quickest in the second half. A long range effort from David Macpherson was easily saved by the Kilmory keeper, but Neil Campbell was quickest to react and slot the rebound home to open the scoring on 48 minutes.Inveraray added a quick second following a well-worked set-piece routine on 56 minutes. Euan McMurdo’s free-hit found Campbell Watt, whose movement caused the Kilmory defence problems all afternoon, and he made 2-0 with fine finish.The goal sparked life into Kilmory who pulled one back on 65 minutes when Hal Jones blasted home an unstoppable shot from the edge of the penalty area to make it 2-1 and it was game on.After getting themselves back in the game, Kilmory’s discipline let them down soon after, with both Duncan MacBrayne and Sandy Leiper receiving their marching orders from referee MacVicar within minutes of one another.Inveraray capitalised on their two-man advantage and former Kilmory player David MacAllister scored his first goal for his new club on 69 minutes to make it 3-1.Euan McMurdo finished the day’s scoring off with a well-constructed goal to make it 4-1 with 15 minutes remaining.Inveraray will be happy with their league first win of the season, while Kilmory will be disappointed with the result and the fact that they will be missing two influential players over the weeks to come.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"a look at the advertiser of yesteryear","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 20/07/18, 11:54 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowWith the success of the Islay Mòd still fresh in our minds, it is clear that taking part in regional and the national Mòd is a long-standing tradition for Mid Argyll youngsters.For more than 20 years Mid Argyll students have done us proud at the Gaelic singing competitions, as seen here in our edition from 1998, when singers from all over Argyll made their way to the Royal National Mòd on the Isle of Skye.The Lochgilphead Primary Gaelic Choir came fourth in their competition, with the Lochfyneside Junior Gaelic Choir gaining top music mark in their unison singing competition.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"cinema paradiso as screen machine parks up in lochgilphead","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 20/07/18, 1:31 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA familiar large blue lorry rolled into Lochgilphead recently, offering the latest movies to the public for two nights.The cinema on wheels parked itself outside Kilmory resource centre for movie buffs to enjoy on Tuesday July 10 and Wednesday July 11, with screenings of Gnomeo and Juliet sequel, Sherlock Gnomes superhero epic Avengers: Infinity War Part I and LGBT rom-com, Love, Simon.The Screen Machine has a busy few weeks ahead.

It is also the story of a family trying to reunite cousins on both sides of the Atlantic.Except this is not fiction. This is the mysterious story of James Campbell Hay Robertson, known as Jim, who was born and raised in Lochgilphead, and who was so determined to make a fresh start in America that he never saw or spoke to his Scottish family again.Why Jim would cut himself off from his family is something his granddaughter Morgan has been trying to find out and she has asked the Argyllshire Advertiser to help solve this mystery.James Campbell Hay Robertson was born in Lochgilphead and lived in Calman Villa in Ardrishaig. He was the son of the schoolmaster, a noted talent on the Lochgilphead football team and an aspiring doctor. Born in 1896, he had just turned 18 when the Great War began. He enlisted and, when the call for new officer candidates came, he signed up, becoming a \u0026#8216temporary gentleman\u0026#8217 rising to the rank of acting captain in charge of a battery of 4.5-inch Howitzers at the Ypres front. When the war ended, he spent six months in the army occupying Germany near Bonn.Jim was a smart boy, who loved his parents, and he was especially fond of his older sister Alexandria – a very talented pianist. She is often mentioned in the Advertiser as leading musical events in Lochgilphead, and was known as \u0026#8216Miss Lala Robertson\u0026#8217. According to Jim, she went off to study piano around 1910 in London or Edinburgh, but returned to Lochgilphead by the time the Great War broke out.After the war, Jim left for America and banished all of them from his life. It is here the mystery begins: what caused Jim to turn his back on his family and keep their existence hidden, from leaving Scotland in 1921 until his death in 1995 at the age of 99?Jim had a long and happy marriage and he and his wife Ruth had four boys who have grown up without extended family and under the impression that no relations existed in Scotland, which is not true. On a visit to Lochgilphead, Morgan found cousins in Furnace.Jim did share some clues about his family, but they were not all they seemed. He said his older brother William was in the Navy during the Great War, but had become an alcoholic, fallen overboard and drowned. This was not true. William\u0026#8217s signature was on their mother\u0026#8217s death certificate, signed in Aberdeen in 1943. William clearly lived a long life after Jim left Scotland and perhaps had his own family, themselves unaware of their American relatives.Jim\u0026#8217s telling of Alexandra\u0026#8217s story is even more tragic, saying she volunteered as a nurse in the war, fell in love with a South African soldier and left for Cape Town, only to die of food poisoning six months after arriving. This too was false, as the Advertiser\u0026#8217s obituary for their father in 1926 stated he \u0026#8216is survived by three children\u0026#8217, including Alexandra. Part of the story was true, however, as the Advertiser noted in 1920 that she married Henry Beck of Cape Town, in Dorset.Why Jim wanted to make a clean break with his family to such a degree he pretended his brother and sister had died will never be known. But it is possible his brother and sister lived long lives and had large families. Jim\u0026#8217s family in the United States now amounts to three surviving children, six grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.Jim\u0026#8217s father, William Robertson, came from a family of printers and dyers in Bonhill, Vale of Leven, and served as a schoolmaster from 1883 to 1920.

Council bosses have sized up the task, fearing the iconic structure has reached the end of the line. Large parts of Ayr railway station are closed to the public as safety teams comb the site. But the Post has learned that even a short-term salvage mission will cost more than \u0026pound300,000. Senior councillors have been briefed to expect a hefty hit to the wallet. South Ayrshire bosses will bid to retrieve whatever they spend from the hotel’s absentee Malaysian owner. But a senior adminsitration source said: “We have to face the reality of the situation. “The cost of refurbishing the hotel would be well in excess of \u0026pound10m, so that’s a non-starter. “I think that knocking it down is quickly becoming our only option.” That prospect is likely to face a strong challenge from groups such as Historic Scotland. And political tensions could further complicate the picture.  It comes as the hotel’s safety cordon was extended to take in part of the road over the railway. Teams are inspecting the condition of the building’s gable end amid concerns it could collapse on to people and cars below. Trains continue to run as normal, but access for commuters has now become fraught with difficulty. And worried rail chiefs are now said to be hatching contingency plans, should Ayr become become a no-go zone. But council bosses this week refused to confirm whether an official briefing on demolition had taken place. In a statement, they said: “Work to fully assess the condition of the former Station Hotel is continuing on site. “However, a decision on any future action will be dependent on the findings of the ongoing works and surveys.” But the council’s opposition group claim they are being kept in the dark over developments. Tory boss, Martin Dowey, said the public need to be kept informed. “I’m surprised this figure appears to be being quoted by members of the administration,” he added. “The SNP’s claim of inclusion and transparency is just one more empty promise. “The public need to be kept informed about the hotel and the council’s plans for its future, if that does indeed involve demolition.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnHistoric ScotlandScottish National PartySouth Ayrshire CouncilTransportAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12945474.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_IBP_AYP_110718WINDOW_01JPG.jpg","title":"ayr window cleaner keith mckissock","story":"NewsAyr window cleaner Keith McKissock says South Ayrshire Council parking wardens are \"stopping\" him from workingFurious Keith McKissock claims he is being \"stopped\" from going about his business in Ayr town centre.\u0026nbspShareByStuart Wilson10:49, 19 JUL 2018NewsKeith has won support from customers and some councillors (Image: AYRSHIRE POST)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA popular window cleaner claims council bosses are blocking his bid to work. Keith McKissock washes up to 50 properties – many of them businesses – in Ayr town centre. But the dad-of-two faces a stand-off with parking wardens on his tail. Keith, who runs Craigie Cleaning Services, wants a special permit allowing his van into town. But despite offers to pay an annual fee, red tape and fines have dogged his progress. The 53-year-old said: “I’m just trying to go about my work – what I do actually improves the town. “If I wasn’t cleaning these windows, would the council? “I can’t carry 22 litres of water on my back with all my ladders. “Maybe they expect me to balance everything on my bike.”  Keith, once a top Scottish cyclist, was backed all the way by customers this week. Kenny McLachlan, of Ayr, said: “Keith’s been washing our windows for five years and you couldn’t meet a harder working guy. “The High Street needs all the support it can get – we shouldn’t be harassing people doing it a turn.”  Now Tory councillors are  hoping to ride to the cleaner’s rescue by proposing a new parking charter.  Group chief Martin Dowey said: “Examples exist in other councils where they charge an annual window cleaner permit. “Keith is someone who legitimately services our High Street and there needs to be a common sense solution.” Ayrshire’s roads boss Stewart Turner said: “Vehicles can’t remain in the same location for longer than 10 minutes without activity. “In addition, it is not possible to move a vehicle from one bay to another in attempt to buy time. “In Mr McKissock’s case, he can use the bays to undertake cleaning operations but can’t use them to park or collect money from customers. “He was recently asked to move his vehicle from a bay by a parking attendant as he was not carrying out any window cleaning activities. “The Alliance wrote to Mr McKissock, once again, regarding his behaviour towards our parking attendants. “Our employees deserve to be treated with respect and we have a responsibility to protect them.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"former wwe star hurricane tops","story":"NewsFormer WWE star The Hurricane tops bill as Pro Wrestling Elite stages anniversary show at Ayr CitadelPWE will stage their latest extravaganza - and are promising fans one of their biggest and best shows yet.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet16:03, 19 JUL 2018NewsPWE will stage their big event this weekend (Image: Copyright Unknown)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailGrappling fans are in for a treat this weekend as a host of wrestling stars will descend on Ayr.

The Honest Men were relegated at the first time of asking in the second tier in the 2016/17 season when they finished bottom with 33 points. But former Ayr hitman and manager, Roberts, reckons being part-time was what held them back. Marko, who played second tier football with Ayr under Brian Reid, said: “I think Ayr will be fine, I really do. “Being full-time in that league is a massive thing. “The last few times Ayr have been in that league it has been very difficult to compete with the full-time teams. “But the fact they have got that now will make a big difference and I don’t think they will have any issues staying in the league. “When I was there under Brian Reid, being part-time was what held us back. “You didn’t have enough time to go and work on things on a daily basis but Ayr will have that now.  “You can beat any team in a one-off game but over the course of a season of 36 games it’s difficult to compete. “But the fans should be excited this time as there should be no problem – Ayr can even start looking up rather than looking down.” Roberts, who hit the net 43 times for Ayr, was more than impressed with Ayr’s impressive goal-scoring form last season as they topped League One, pipping Raith on the final game of the season. He said: “I thought they were really good to watch. “You always thought they were going to score every game they played. “And I don’t mean just scoring one, you always thought they’d grab three or four. “Sometimes they were left open all over the park – but they had too much quality up front and that’s the reason they went up. “Fair play to them as they had three really good strikers in Shankland, Moore and Moffat.” Roberts added: “The way the league was won was certainly a bit of a way to win it.  “I’ve been in teams that have won titles and been promoted with five or six games to go, which gives you a great feeling of accomplishment, but there’s nothing more exciting than winning the title in the last 10 minutes of the season. “Both teams had the chance to run away with it but kept faltering.” Roberts managed Ayr for three years before getting sacked, He then had a player/coach role at Clyde for a season. He has now gone back to playing at Junior Cup finalists Hurlford United. But he insists that his managing days aren’t over.  He said: “I won’t give up on it, I just wanted to play again for now. The best days of your life are when you’re kicking a ball and I am still fit enough.  “Any manager who tells you they prefer coaching is talking rubbish. When you’re out there playing it’s  just great.  “I do want to get back to managing eventually though, but it’s all about finding the right club and what suits my life at the minute.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12935909.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_emp_ayp_080618maragret_12JPG.jpg","title":"meet this weeks class act","story":"NewsMeet this week\u0027s Class ActAyr United striker Michael Moffat popped along to Queen Margaret Academy to visit the youngsters who were holding a Soccer Aid event.\u0026nbspShareByAbi Smillie15:12, 17 JUL 2018NewsMichael Moffat of Ayr United pictured with the senior sports leaders (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailFooty fans and soccer stars joined together for a special charity event last month.

The pair met on a night out in November 2013 in Irvine town. Catherine said: “We exchanged numbers and the rest was history. “We dated for several months before Jamie settled into family life with my little boy David and since then the two of them have been inseparable.” The couple tied the knot on Friday, June 8 at the Gailes Hotel.  “We had a Rugby Glam theme with lots of sparkle,” said Catherine. “We had centre pieces with feathers, rugby balls going down the aisle and silver sparkly table covers. “My son David wrote and shared a reading at the ceremony, which no one knew about, for Jamie about how he has made his mum so happy and how he is proud that this man is his step dad. The bride wore a strapless princess ballgown with cathedral train and sparkly cathedral veil. The 32 layered dress was MoriLee from J’Taime Bridal in Stevenston. The groom and groomsmen wore full kilt attire from Kilts4U in Kilmarnock.

Hair and Make-up was styled and created by Forever Diamonds, Prestwick Catherine added: “Hair and make up and all things beauty were done by my cousin Sean Diamond’s salon. His team worked very hard to give us exactly what we wanted. “We can not thank all our suppliers enough - but to the venue Gailes Hotel, the effort the staff put in down to every detail and ensuring everything ran on time and smoothly . “Also, our Venue dresser John at LG Wedding and events he made everything look so magical and sparkly, this guy is a miracle worker. “As I work in the industry and have met many brides over time, it was such a strange feeling having the day being about me and having my very own photobooth and marryoke that my boss Marc from Foxy Photobooth provided. “All my guests loved it and the marryoke video ‘She is a belter’ has hit 5k views.” For more photos of Catherine and Jamie\u0027s wedding, pick up your copy of this week\u0027s Ayrshire Post.

And United proved that underdogs can upset the odds by finishing sixth and leaving Aberdeen, Dundee United, Dundee and St Johnstone in their wake. It was a stunning effort but McSherry, who was signed by Ally MacLeod on a free from Kilmarnock, reckons Ayr can once again confound the pundits and enjoy a great season. United kick off the league at home to Partick Thistle on August 4 and midfielder turned publican McSherry expects them to be up for the challenge. He said: “Consolidation should be the aim but there is no reason why Ayr can’t rise again and enjoy the good times that we enjoyed in the 70s.” An old team picture that surfaced in McSherry’s Wee Windaes got punters rewinding the years and reliving past glories. It was taken at the start of season 1975-76 and showed Ayr in their change kit of Barcelona strips. Proudly standing tall are, back row – Davie Wells, Alex McAnespie, Ally MacLean, Hugh Sproat, Rikki Fleming, John Murphy. Middle row – Alex Ingram, Gerry Phillips, Johnny Graham, Johnny Doyle, Hugh Cameron, Jim McSherry. Front row – John Dickson, Danny MacDonald, Davie McCulloch.   Jim recalled: “No one could work out why the team weren’t in their usual black and white if it was an official  team picture.  “We were also puzzled why there were 15 players in it, including two goalkeepers. “Then one of my regulars, Stephen Robb, came up with the answer – it was taken before a pre-season friendly.  “We wore it in a 7-2 defeat at home to Celtic and it was never seen  again. I think it was binned as a bad omen.  “These were good times at Ayr and the team was loaded with some great players. “We were the only part-time team in the Top Ten and were quoted at 66/1, which seemed about right given the teams we were up against. “I remember Ally signing me on the wall at Central Station and then telling me to look out my passport. “He told me ‘You’re going on tour to Canada next week’. It was quite a start to my Ayr career.” Only three months into that season, Ally was lured to Aberdeen and replaced at the helm by Alex Stuart who quickly appointed McSherry as captain. Ayr sealed safety with a last-day 2-1 win over Motherwell, who were bossed by Willie McLean and Craig Brown. Gerry Phillips got a dramatic late winner to spark euphoric scenes at a packed Somerset. The second season of top-flight football saw Ayr again more than hold their own.  They finished eighth in the table on 30 points, three ahead of Hearts and a distant 13 more than rock-bottom  rivals Kilmarnock.  Season 1977-78 marked Ayr’s third campaign in the top flight, a remarkable achievement considering they stayed part-time. Robert Connor, Ian McAllister, Derek McCutcheon and Iain Sim were called up from Ayr United Boys’ Club. But Ayr were always up against it and their life in the Premier League ended when they finished second-bottom on 24 points and were relegated along with Clydebank. Now as a new league season beckons with renewed optimism and a totally full-time structure, it’s time to dream again.

Prestwick Airport were delighted that the UK Space Agency (UKSA) continued to support their plans to be one of the UK’s three horizontal space launch sites. This follows the Space Agency’s announcement that Sutherland will be the UK’s first vertical spaceport, a significant step for the UK space industry. Prestwick bosses believe they are by far the most suitable spot for horizontal space launch in the UK in terms of location, capability and the thriving satellite manufacturing industry that exists on their doorstep. An independent assessment said most of the anticipated infrastructure required for space launch capability is already in place at the site, meaning that they could move speedily to achieve a licence once the legislation is defined. Airport bosses say the development of a spaceport at Prestwick is a real opportunity for the Scottish and Ayrshire economies. The spaceport project is an integral part of the Ayrshire Growth Deal and supporters say it would attract new investment to the aerospace cluster located around the airport, safeguarding existing jobs and creating many new ones. Stewart Adams, chief executive of Glasgow Prestwick Airport, said: “We are extremely grateful for the support we have from South Ayrshire Council and look forward to our continued collaboration with them and our other partners as we look to successfully deliver on our joint vision, a vision that places Glasgow Prestwick Spaceport as a centre of excellence for the space and aerospace industries. “We will be having further discussions with all our stakeholders to review our strategy and how to take our plans forward in light of the additional funding available. “We will also be talking to potential customers and launch partners willing to support operations at Prestwick.” South Ayrshire Council leader Douglas Campbell said: “Prestwick is still the most advanced site currently in the running for the UK’s first horizontal space launch and we’ll seek to use the development fund to cement our position. “Our focus will continue to be on supporting our partners to ensure Prestwick can deliver the significant levels of jobs and investment that we know can be realised.” Ayr MSP, John Scott, said: “The case for Prestwick hosting this facility is a strong one, including the availability of a 2,987m runway and many aerospace businesses already on site with and land to accommodate more.” And MP Bill Grant added: “I am delighted that Sutherland in North East Scotland has been selected for the UKs first vertical take-off Spaceport facility and equally important is the fact that Glasgow Prestwick is still in the running for a Spaceport licence for horizontal take off facilities.” The commercial space sector is worth an estimated \u0026pound3.8billion to the UK economy over the next 10 years.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnPrestwick AirportSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12953553.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Craig-Ferguson-Promotes-American-On-Purpose.jpg","title":"talk show host holds giant","story":"NewsTalk show host holds giant showbiz party at his South Ayrshire mansionAnd the telly alter egos of two of the guests were certainly more at home in a council tower block.\u0026nbspShareByStephen Houston15:23, 20 JUL 2018NewsStill Game stars Isa, Jane McCarry, and Tam, Mark Cox (Image: AYRSHIRE POST)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailFamed American talk show host Craig Ferguson has staged a giant showbiz party at his South Ayrshire mansion. And the telly alter egos of two of the guests were certainly more at home in a council tower block. For Tam and Isa actors in Still Game - Mark Cox and Jane McCarry - were among those clinking champagne glasses. It was staged at his country mansion near Dailly which has become the Scottish seat of Ferguson. The party follows shooting of his new movie has been filmed in Argyll. Along with 140 cast and crew he was staying near Arochar while filming for ‘Love You To Death’ at locations around Argyll and Bute.  Stars include male lead Craig, Craiglang favourite Ford Kiernan and Liz Hurley Producer Matthew Weiner - the creator of the hit TV series Mad Men, said: “Our experience of filming in Argyll and Scotland as a whole has been phenomenal, we have never felt so welcomed and supported as Americans.” Sources say the party was a grand affair, with “lots of great people.” One guest said: “Craig really put on a show and his house is incredible. “As well as actors some of the Ayrshire gentry were there. They had a ball . . . and it was so funny to see ‘Tam and Isa’ there. “Craig is a huge fan of Still Game and appeared in it alongside Jane and Mark. “While Jane and Mark had no problem fitting in to the glamour surroundings, Tam and Isa would have been completely overawed.”  Craig bought his Ayrshire property for \u0026pound2million cash six years ago, bidding over the \u0026pound1.85m asking price. The 56-year-old was once the highest earning talk show host in the US, taking home \u0026pound8m a year. He fell in love with the mansion in the Girvan Valley and was keen to have a Scots base for his three sons. The house is 336 years old and has 14 receptions and 15 bedrooms over four floors. But it also boasts facilities fit for a Hollywood superstar with cinema, games room, billiard room, gym and tennis court. Craig has kept a low profile since, but four years ago popped up to watch the panto at the Ayr Gaiety with the family and wife Megan. Amazingly he actually trod the Gaiety boards 20 years ago in a touring show, starring with the late Gerard Kelly in ‘The Odd Couple.’ "},{"url":null,"title":"drivers-facing-10-weeks-of-disruption-during-galafoot-bridge-works","story":"DRIVERS using the Galafoot Bridge will face 10 weeks of disruption from next month.\nEssential maintenance work is being carried out on the A6091, beginning at 8pm on Sunday, August 5.\nThe work will include the replacement of the road and footpath surfacing the waterproofing of the bridge deck deck repairs and a repair of the expansion joints \u0026ndash subject to investigations.\nThe scheme will require a full closure of the eastbound carriageway of the bridge \u0026ndash travelling from Galashiels to Tweedbank \u0026ndash with a signed diversion route in operation.

Galashiels has been especially hard hit, with its proportion of vacant retail units now standing at 15% representing a total of 37 empty stores.\nHawick and Selkirk lag not far behind, with 14% apiece of their shops lying empty, and 13% of Jedburgh\u0026rsquos shops are also going spare.\nPeebles, Kelso, Duns, Melrose and Eyemouth have all kept their proportion of empty shops in their town centres at 8% or below, though.\nThe purpose of the town centre core activity area pilot study is to suggest updating the council\u0026rsquos planning policy in a bid to save the region\u0026rsquos high streets.\nIn it, lead planning officer Charles Johnston says: \u0026ldquoRetailing patterns continue to fluctuate, and the role of town centres is changing\u0026nbsp for example, the increase of online shopping and competition from larger national retailers.\n\u0026ldquoThe impacts of the current challenging economic climate are being felt across the country, and these trends are not unique to the Scottish Borders.\n\u0026ldquoPlanning policy must adapt to these changing circumstances.\n\u0026ldquoIn recent years, the council has amended its town centre policy in its local development plan to adapt to such changes, and whilst these changes have helped, it is acknowledged that a further review of relevant planning policy could be tested via this pilot study.\n\u0026ldquoThere are specific immediate concerns regarding Hawick and Galashiels, where reduced footfall and vacancy rates have had a detrimental impact on how these town centres have performed.\n\u0026ldquoThis is of particular concern as Hawick and Galashiels are the two largest towns within the Borders and have a strategic economic and social significance for the region.\nThe report recommends the council tries out pilot schemes in Hawick and Galashiels, either scrapping or altering their core activity area status marking out the boundaries of their commercial centres to allow a greater range of activity to take place within them.\nPlanning permission is usually only granted in such town centres if proposals are for business use in keeping with the surroundings of the sites in question, but\u0026nbspabolishing core activity area status would allow non-commercial enterprises to occupy empty high street properties.\nIn Hawick, the report says, a radical approach is needed, so it recommends councillors to vote to abolish the core activity centre there altogether.\n\u0026ldquoReducing the core area completely would, in essence, allow a greater number of other uses within the town centre, it says.\n\u0026ldquoWhilst there is the threat that complete removal of the core activity area may cause longer-term footfall issues, it is considered that some significant action is required in Hawick.\n\u0026ldquoTo implement this as a test case via a pilot scheme would seem an appropriate course of action in the circumstances.\nIn Galashiels, it is recommended that core activity area is retained but that the scope of activity allowed be expanded to include professional service businesses, non-profitable institutions and leisure activities.\nThe outcomes of those proposed pilot schemes in Hawick and Galashiels would then be used to draw up similar proposals for other towns.\nFootfall figures % change from 2007 to 2017:\nHawick

More of the same please.It was a good day for the Argyll favourites. A positive start which should continue at Kintyre Park against Pollock under 19s tomorrow with a 2pm kick off.

A planning application for the substation by Inch Cape Offshore Limited (ICOL) was called in by Scottish Ministers in a controversial move in April and will now be decided by the reporter instead of the council.  ICOL wants to bring offshore energy from a planned windfarm off the Angus coast onto land at Cockenzie by building the substation on the footprint of the former power station.  A previous planning application siting the substation further inland had been given planning permission but that permission lapsed instead of renewing it, ICOL decided to pursue a new site.  In its argument to Scottish Ministers, the council will state that the substation is \u0026ldquonot the best use of the land and point out that planning permission had been given at another site.  Councillor Norman Hampshire said: \u0026ldquoBecause of the location, we have to recommend it should be refused. We have done a lot of work to move this proposal forward and this action jeopardises that.  \u0026ldquoI think if everybody had worked together we could have got a development on a site the council, developers and communities could have supported.  Earlier this month, representatives of ICOL were challenged by Prestonpans Community Council to name any independent party that support the planned location of the substation.  Brian Weddell, community council chairman, told the ICOL representatives that there had been no public consultation about the new site.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are against it, Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council are against it, East Lothian Council and Scottish Natural Heritage are against it.  \u0026ldquoShow us anyone, apart from Inch Cape, who think it is a good site.  Ian Johnson, ICOL project manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe are naturally disappointed that East Lothian Council officers have recommended refusal to the application on the grounds that it could prejudice future development of the area. ICOL have been and will continue to work with the council to look at options to reduce the footprint of the site and ensure that other potential future developments can co-exist next to the substation.  However, he made it clear there were no plans to consider an alternative site, telling the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe have no intention of moving the proposed site of the onshore transmission works again.  The reporter is due to visit Cockenzie on Monday as part of her investigation into the application."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7994954.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"glory-days-of-golf-remembered","story":"  Musselburgh Museum on High Street is hosting an exhibition called \u0026lsquoMusselburgh \u0026ndash Cradle of Golf\u0026rsquo which is aimed at reasserting the Honest Toun\u0026rsquos importance in the sport\u0026rsquos rich heritage.  Boasting one of the oldest golf courses in the world \u0026ndash Musselburgh Links, The Old Course \u0026ndash the town was once home to the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, who now play at Muirfield, near Gullane.  The Honourable Company brought other Edinburgh clubs to the town such as Royal Burgess, Bruntsfield and the Warrender.  The exhibition celebrates the days from 1836 to the early 20th century when Musselburgh was at the forefront of the game\u0026rsquos development.  It not only celebrates the golf clubs which played in the town over the years but also the many golf club and ball makers, and professional players, who made their living in the town between 1836 and 1900 \u0026ndash a period of dramatic growth in the game.  The display has been organised by Musselburgh Museum and Heritage Group in partnership with Mungo Park, whose great-grandfather Willie Park Senior, from Wallyford, won the first Open Championship at Prestwick in 1860 and went on to be a four-time Open champion.  Willie\u0026rsquos brother Mungo and son Willie Junior were also Open champions at Musselburgh Links.  Two other local men \u0026ndash Bob Ferguson, who won a hat-trick of Open Championships, and David Brown \u0026ndash complete the town\u0026rsquos five Open champions, with 11 wins between them.  Support for the exhibition has also been received from East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos economic development and strategic investment department and Musselburgh Common Good Fund.  The exhibition, which runs from July 6 to September 1, is to be officially opened by Lord Wemyss, whose family has been involved with golf since the early 18th century.  On display are a large number of golf items and memorabilia donated by golf clubs that were formerly located at Musselburgh Links. Artefacts from the British Golf Museum and private collections can also be viewed.  The exhibition includes significant artefacts that have not been seen publicly in Scotland for decades, among them Charles Lees\u0026rsquo famous painting A Summer Evening on the Musselburgh Links: Golfers, which recently sold at Bonhams.  Organisers say the display shows Musselburgh\u0026rsquos leadership in developing golf and exporting it.

Mattie Edmond, club steward, handed over a cheque for \u0026pound1,410 to Fiona Brown and Alison Clancy from the charity after they hosted Pancreatic Cancer Scotland following two events on Easter Sunday and a show with the Jersey Beats organised by Pete Barrie with support from the Prestonpans Hearts Supporters Club.

They also found five secondary tumours at the top of his spine.  By the age of 13, the brave teenager had completed a high dose of radiotherapy to his brain and spinal cord following a biopsy.  Despite his health challenges, Paul, who is now 30, received a Bachelor of Engineering with Honours in Computer Systems and Networks degree at a graduation ceremony at the Usher Hall last week.  His family, including mum Angela, 52, and sisters Laura, 34, and Aleigh, 21, were filled with pride to see him receive his degree.  He was also awarded the Rob Kemmer Prize, receiving \u0026pound100 in recognition of his \u0026ldquooutstanding achievements on his individual programme of study.  Paul, of Burns Wynd, is now planning to return to Napier after the summer to complete his Master\u0026rsquos Degree.  Angela, who has been Paul\u0026rsquos full-time carer, said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom incredibly proud of Paul.  \u0026ldquoDespite his challenges he just gets on with things and has achieved his degree.  \u0026ldquoHe has had a tough life but he does not give up and is an incredibly caring young man.  \u0026ldquoNothing is going to stop Paul.  Angela revealed that Paul was a pupil at Musselburgh Grammar School when his condition was first diagnosed.  She said: \u0026ldquoPaul was having trouble with his eyesight and the school contacted me to say they thought it was getting worse.  \u0026ldquoIt was when he was referred to the Eye Pavilion in Edinburgh they discovered the tumours were the cause of it.  \u0026ldquoHe had multifocal germinoma tumours and secondary cancer caused the spinal lesions.  Although the radiotherapy cured his tumour, it had other detrimental effects.  Paul is registered blind as a result of the radiotherapy to his visual nerves and also has a curvature of the spine.  The pituitary gland in his brain has failed completely, so he needs to take hormone replacements and he also finds it difficult to open his jaw, which is thought to be due to scar tissue following radiotherapy.  It was when he was working as a volunteer at Musselburgh Citizens Advice Bureau that Paul first became interested in developing his computer skills, attending both Edinburgh College and Napier for four years.  Angela said: \u0026ldquoPaul doesn\u0026rsquot have an assistant at Napier and he travels there independently.  \u0026ldquoHe has some vision out of the side of one eye and the centre of the other.  \u0026ldquoThe university helped with extra large screens for him and giving him more time his teachers are all delighted for him.  Paul hopes that his achievement will inspire others with illness and disabilities to follow their dreams and aspirations.  He said: \u0026ldquoTo graduate with a degree is massive. It took a while to get here from secondary school.  \u0026ldquoI am looking forward to returning to Napier for a year to do my Master\u0026rsquos Degree. They have given huge support.

The company, which provides a link to many of the Scottish islands from the mainland, dates back to 1851 and has become famous for the red and black funnel, complete with the Lion Rampant, on its ships.  Kit said: \u0026ldquoWe self-published it the first time and having, finally, persuaded him to write down all the stories I found a way of getting it published.  \u0026ldquoWe printed about 400 copies and the punchline is, despite him giving a few away, we got enough money back to cover the publication cost.  \u0026ldquoAs far as I know it is sold out \u0026ndash I have got a copy and so do both my sons but I think that is about it.  \u0026ldquoThe reason we published it in the first place was, certainly to us, the highly entertaining stories about MacBrayne.  \u0026ldquoThere was a lot in it about his army service and, after coming back to it after all those years, the reason for publishing it again was just to make sure those reflections on a way of life long gone did not die with him.  Kit \u0026ndash who last year released The Triumph and Tragedy of the Bantams, which focused on a band of \u0026ldquobrave but largely forgotten soldiers \u0026ndash has added his own stories of being a \u0026lsquoMacBrayne Child\u0026rsquo.

The artwork will be completed with a series of stainless steel arrows installed at different locations around Musselburgh.

Dunbar and East Linton ward member Councillor Norman Hampshire encouraged members of the public to go along and have their say.  He said: \u0026ldquoThere is a high demand for the parks that we have in Dunbar.  \u0026ldquoAs the town grows in size, we have got to make sure we make best use of every bit of green space that we have.  A proposed theme for the park would be to celebrate the varied geology of the county.  Information cairns and distance markers could be created around a circular path.  The creation of paths, additional trim trail equipment and the retention of the putting green are among the ideas highlighted, as well as a new football area with permanent goals.  However, potentially the most ambitious aspect of the scheme is the creation of a new pavilion with access to public toilets.  The potential of a pavilion comes after Winterfield Pagoda, which dated back to the 1920s, was torn down in March last year.  Capital investment could also be made in a tree shelter belt, rural parkour \u0026ndash or free-running \u0026ndash elements in timber and additional benches and seating.  Another major project could be the creation of \u0026ldquoa low-key but iconic \u0026lsquogateway\u0026rsquo feature which would welcome walkers off the John Muir Way and into the park.

Five of those who lost weight suffered a \u0026ldquosignificant loss, according to the report by the Care Inspectorate officers who visited the home during an unannounced three-day inspection in May.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership confirmed it had suspended admission to the home following the report, which has now been fully revealed, after it emerged last month the home had been ordered to make urgent improvements after inspectors raised \u0026ldquoserious concerns.  HC-One, which operates the home, says it has introduced a new home manager and it pointed to some of the more \u0026ldquopositive comments in the report which acknowledged staff were praised for their approach to residents.  A spokesperson for HC-One said: \u0026ldquoThe health and wellbeing of our residents is our highest priority and we take all feedback from the Care Inspectorate extremely seriously. We are pleased their full report included some positive comments about the home, particularly noting our staff team are \u0026lsquokind and caring\u0026rsquo in their approach to residents.  \u0026ldquoWe also recognise we need to do better in some other areas. To do this, we have a new home manager in place who is being supported by the wider management team, and we continue to work closely with the Care Inspectorate and relevant authorities as we implement our improvement plan.  \u0026ldquoWe are pleased significant positive progress has already been made, and are confident the home is in a better place than at the time of the original inspection.  \u0026ldquoWe will continue working hard each and every day so that we are consistently providing the standard of care that Residents deserve.  \u0026ldquoThe Care Inspectorate have recently returned to the home to commence a new inspection, and we look forward to demonstrating the positive changes to them.  Drummohr is the second nursing home in East Lothian operated by HC-One to have admissions suspended in two years.  In 2016, Tranent Care Home was temporarily stopped from admitting new residents by the partnership, which oversees adult care services, after reports of residents being ignored as they asked for help to eat, with others eating with their fingers because of a lack of cutlery or being unable to cut their food themselves, while others were seen wearing clothes soiled or left unchanged after spilling food on themselves.  The report into Drummohr said: \u0026ldquoThere was a lack of oversight and management of food and fluid intake in the home. Nineteen residents were recorded as having lost weight in March 2018. Five had significant weight loss.  \u0026ldquoWe observed instances where residents did not take their meal and nothing else was offered, teas were often left cold and untouched and one resident walked around taking others\u0026rsquo meals and drinks.  \u0026ldquoWe also noted that there was specific guidance in a care file from the dietician in respect of food and fluids that one resident could have. The instructions were not followed. These issues, together with the lack of guidance to staff in respect of monitoring, recording and evaluating intake, is concerning.  The report added that \u0026ldquosome of this lack of care could be attributed to a lack of staff.  Drummohr scored a 2 out of 5 on all four areas inspected, a score regarded as \u0026lsquoweak\u0026rsquo. The four areas were quality of care and support environment staffing and management and leadership.  An East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe wellbeing of residents is always our paramount concern and in this case we will continue working closely with Care Inspectorate to ensure that HC-One delivers the required improvements as soon as possible.  \u0026ldquoAs an interim measure, we have decided to suspend new admissions to Drummohr to enable staff there to focus on what needs to be done. They will be supported in this by a multi-disciplinary team from the partnership."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8061096.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"bus-mounts-pavement-in-tranent","story":"  The 62-year-old, who was driving an empty Prentice coach at the time of the incident, is understood to have taken ill at the wheel as it pulled out from a bus stop.

WHAT do we remember of our childhood in our later days? Think for a moment of the key happy memories which have framed your childhood. They are often simple ones involving play outside. Sadly, research is showing that children are increasingly less able to explore and play in the outdoors.  There are various reasons for this and there is a horrible irony at the centre of it. We have become far more obsessed with material things, it\u0026rsquos all around us. We are literally buying into the idea that happiness is about purchase and we are passing this on to our children.  It\u0026rsquos in our brains that the economy needs us to spend our money on things we don\u0026rsquot need. We are fed an ideology that spending money on stuff is not just a pleasure but a civic duty. It keeps the economy going and makes us all prosperous. That\u0026rsquos what we are made to believe.  But the result is that more than ever, for our children and ourselves, we are enslaved to the interests of corporate profit at the expense of what really matters: simple time to be and enjoy free pleasures.  These were my thoughts as I set off for the second of this summer\u0026rsquos journeys of discovery. I didn\u0026rsquot share them at the time, and of course I stopped thinking about them as the magic of the wood engulfed us.  We began our journey amongst yew trees which surrounded the ancient kirk of Garvald. It was a scorching day and the shade of trees was such a relief. The plan was to spend the day exploring the wood and discover Stoneypath Castle.  Garvald Kirk has a simple beauty. While parts of its wall are 800 years old, it has been subject to renovation and alteration over the last 200 years. There is a welcoming atmosphere inside and I reflected that when not being used for services it would make a perfect storytelling venue.  By the door there is a reminder of how religion can change its spots. A set of jougs hangs on the wall: an iron collar and chain once used to humiliate and degrade \u0026lsquosinners\u0026rsquo by chaining them up. The victims of this would have been mainly young women who became pregnant out of wedlock.  It\u0026rsquos right that it remains there, I think, as a reminder that religion can be used as a justification for intolerance, hate and cruelty as well as a source for love and compassion. The choice of which version to adhere to is a human one.  We followed the rabbits which scattered from the kirkyard into the wood. I was surprised that the Papana Water, which flows through the wood, was so full given there had been no real rain for weeks  It\u0026rsquos impossible to be bored in a wood. Hours were soaked up under the cooling shade of the tree canopy. It was quite simply a day of utter magic. We had our picnic under the shade of two giant Scots pine trees with the sound of running water in the background. It was the only real quiet moment in what would be hours of constant play. The kids just sat for a while, listening to the running water, and looking up at the trees. It was a communion of simple joy.  The walk isn\u0026rsquot so long in distance but it took us around five hours to complete. It could be done in 20 minutes or less if you just walk. But we didn\u0026rsquot just walk, we explored. There are three bridges which cross the Papana. Each one had a different attraction. Shoes were soon off and clothes got wet but the heat meant none of this mattered. A new game was devised when our youngest, Lewis, tried to use a piece of half-eaten banana as a substitute for a stick while playing \u0026lsquoPoohsticks\u0026rsquo . The girls rushed into the river to reclaim it, but then came up with a new game \u0026lsquohunt the banana\u0026rsquo.  After spending time at various points by the river, getting wet and discovering lots of things, we finally reached the walk\u0026rsquos end: Stoneypath Tower. It suddenly appears above the trees as if out of a fairy tale, its newly restored red walls and parapets a contrast to the green we were surrounded by.  There is much history in the castle, but then again there is history in the woods and hills.  As we headed back to Garvald the kids were quieter, tired by adventure, but in a joyful way. The image of my kids standing in the water, playing and searching for fish seemed to symbolise something immemorial: a powerful and simple truth that what we really need is an immersion in nature, not stuff that hijacks our wellbeing in the name of profit.  We surely stepped on the footprints of Robert Neillans on our return. He was a well-known cooper who lived in Garvald over 200 years ago. Perhaps he came foraging here, I thought. As the water sparkled in the sunshine I reflected that the making of \u0026lsquoillicit whisky\u0026rsquo was once common hereabouts and that Robert was, according to local historian Irene Anderson, one of those involved.  We walked past the house he built on the banks of the Papana when we returned to Garvald. What tales this village could tell!  We\u0026rsquod been \u0026lsquoaway\u0026rsquo for a total of nearly six hours in a magic place. But we\u0026rsquod met only one person walking her dog. In one sense that was a joy, and the absence of litter was another.  But it was tinged with a sense of sadness that the magic is something being lost to so many of us, and indeed that so many of the magic places are themselves being lost.  But my melancholy did not last long. It was a day of joy and we thanked the wood as we left."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8067093.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"day-two-of-the-aberdeen-standard-investments-scottish-open-at-gullane-golf-club","story":"  Rock is 13-under-par, two shots better off ellow countryman Tyrell Hatton.

Taylor Wimpey East Scotland has teamed up with Mactaggart and Mickel Homes \u0026ndash both of which are already building on the adjacent Letham Mains site, where more than 800 homes are being built \u0026ndash for the plans on Haddington\u0026rsquos south-western edge.  The early proposals, which will be unveiled to the public later this year, show about 300 homes, with a quarter of those being affordable.  Included in the plans are provision for roads and drainage infrastructure, off-site road improvements, as well as land being set aside for play areas and open space.  The Proposal of Application Notice (PAN) is the first step in the planning process, with the idea of housing on the site, off the A6093.  The land outlined for the development is identified for housing in the new Local Development Plan and, according to the developers, will be designed to integrate with the Letham Mains development.  The public exhibition will give both housebuilders the opportunity to share their proposals for the development with members of the public and other interested parties, and for feedback to be passed to the developer.  A detailed planning application is expected later this year.  Joanne Casey, director of Mactaggart \u0026amp Mickel Homes, speaking on behalf of both developers, said the PAN allowed the developers to \u0026ldquobegin the important process of community engagement.

The 63-year-old passed away on March 2, having been minister at St Mary\u0026rsquos Parish Church for more than a decade.  Now her sister Susan Gibson, along with daughters Laura Burgess and Elaine Macrae, will be joined by nieces Clare Furze and Kara Wallace and granddaughters Ciara Burgess and Isla Burgess in the running-themed fundraisers.  Susan said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom the runner in the family and I have always done a fundraising event every year.  \u0026ldquoJennifer was a great supporter, she was not a runner herself but she would tease me about the time I had done at the event.  \u0026ldquoShe was a huge supporter and always contributed generously to what I was running for.  \u0026ldquoAfter she had the terminal diagnosis, one thing we talked about was that I would organise some kind of running thing for the family.  \u0026ldquoIt was her choice to go with Edinburgh Maggie\u0026rsquos Centre because she had such amazing support there.  The charity, which has been based in Edinburgh since 1996, offers support to people with cancer and their family and friends.  The centres offer not only practical advice about benefits and eating well but qualified experts provide emotional support and the centres offer a chance to meet people or simply sit quietly with a cup of tea.  Team Jenny, which includes seven-year-old Isla, will in varying combinations be clocking up nearly 200 kilometres of timed runs throughout the summer.  Originally, the plan was for the seven family members to take part together in the same event.  However, with the family spread out in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Coleraine, it proved impossible.  Instead they are taking on half a dozen different events before combining both the distance and fundraising totals together.  Elaine, 32, has already completed the Baker Hughes 10k in Aberdeen, while Kara, 28, and her husband, Duncan, will be joined by Clare, 32, Elaine and Susan at the Run the Blades event at Whitelee Wind Farm, near Eaglesham, this month.  Meanwhile in Portrush, Northern Ireland, Susan will join Laura, 36, together with her daughters Ciara, 13, and Isla, at the Portrush Park Run.  Clare, Elaine, Kara and Susan will all take part in the Great Aberdeen Run 10k next month before Susan\u0026rsquos attention turns to the Scottish 10k, which starts and finishes at Musselburgh Racecourse in September.  Finally, Elaine and Susan will take on the Great Scottish Run Half Marathon in Glasgow, with Laura\u0026rsquos husband Barry competing in the Belfast City Half Marathon in September.  The family set an initial fundraising target of \u0026pound1,000 before increasing that to \u0026pound3,000 but both have already been smashed, with nearly \u0026pound5,000 already raised.  Susan said: \u0026ldquoIt is amazing.  \u0026ldquoPeople are just so incredibly generous and I think that is a measure of Jennifer and Maggie\u0026rsquos and the affection and respect people have for Maggie\u0026rsquos.  \u0026ldquoWe are very fortunate it is a very close family.  \u0026ldquoJennifer was very caring, had a great sense of humour and she was honest.  \u0026ldquoYou could always depend on her \u0026ndash it might not be what you wanted to hear but what you needed to hear.  \u0026ldquoShe had that ability to be completely honest without ever being harsh or unkind.  \u0026ldquoShe was incredibly supportive of the family and everybody in it.

The 90-year-old, who also met Scotland\u0026rsquos new Health Secretary Jeane Freeman MSP, added: \u0026ldquoMy first memory of work was the knowledge that the hospital was getting much busier and there were more children coming in and going out cured. Before that, the parents couldn\u0026rsquot afford medical help and were leaving it too late for their children to come in and many of them didn\u0026rsquot make it.  \u0026ldquoAlso I remember saying to the sister I was working with at the time: \u0026lsquoThe parents coming in now have lost their terribly haunted look because they know now they can bring their children in.\u0026rsquo  She told how the nurses had to live on-site in those days and would therefore tend to give up work when they became married.  Mrs Reid added: \u0026ldquoWe weren\u0026rsquot allowed to live out of hospital, we had to stay in the nurses\u0026rsquo homes.  \u0026ldquoI loved it \u0026ndash I loved the camaraderie, I loved the company, I loved everything about it.  \u0026ldquoIt wasn\u0026rsquot all drudgery and hard work, we had lots of fun into the bargain.

The trip, which costs about $50,000, is an eight-day creative expedition and will result in experiences, observations and documentation transformed into an exhibition in 2020.

Graham set up the Clackmannanshire Investment Forum (CIF) to discuss how to spend \u0026pound8 million of the \u0026pound90m of UK and Scottish Government money provided as part of the Stirling and Clackmannanshire City Region Deal.  However, the Clackmannanshire Commission \u0026ndash overseen by the local authority \u0026ndash has responsibility for identifying and developing projects which will receive funding in Graham\u0026rsquos constituency of Ochil and South Perthshire.  Graham MP boasted that \u0026ldquoUK Government civil servants from the Scotland Office will attend his CIF meetings, and it is understood one of the most senior civil servant from David Mundell\u0026rsquos Government department was at the first CIF meeting held in Alloa Town Hall last week.  Brock, the MP for Edinburgh North and Leith, has written to Prime Minister Theresa May to complain. She said: \u0026ldquoIt is clear that the organisation set up by the Member for Ochil and South Perthshire \u0026ndash a Conservative backbencher \u0026ndash is a party political organisation set up in opposition to the usual official consultation carried out by the council.  \u0026ldquoIt is also clear that the Secretary of State has asked his officials to take part in these meetings which are clearly party political rather than an exercise in governance. Mundell told a recent meeting of the Scottish Affairs Select Committee that he is \u0026ldquovery open to allowing civil servants to \u0026ldquoengage with MPs directly.  When Brock asked if that extended to \u0026ldquopotentially party political promotions, Mundell said: \u0026ldquoI don\u0026rsquot think that is in any way an accurate characterisation.  The leader of Clackmannanshire Council, Ellen Forson, has also complained to Mundell that Graham\u0026rsquos CIF meeting is \u0026ldquoextremely confusing to locals who, she claims, may have been \u0026ldquomisled. She added: \u0026ldquoIt was my understanding, as with every other City Deal, that it was for the local authority to determine governance structures for the area and this seems to fly in the face of that.  Mundell accepted that \u0026ldquoit will ultimately be for the council to submit proposals to Government but he added that \u0026ldquoI hope that Luke\u0026rsquos Forum will help to generate some ideas and that you will give these some consideration through the work of the Clackmannanshire Commission.  A spokeswoman for Graham confirmed that Mundell\u0026rsquos deputy, Lord Ian Duncan, was at the MP\u0026rsquos meeting along with civil servant Neil MacLennan, the head of City Deals and Local Government at the Scotland Office.  Graham was not available for interview. A spokeswoman supplied a prepared statement in Graham\u0026rsquos name which accused the SNP of \u0026ldquotrying to make this overtly political. It added: \u0026ldquoI have fought for the additional investment from the UK Government directly with the Treasury and will continue to stand up for my constituency by looking for long-term opportunities. To this end, I will work with all parties to ensure its success but will not be bullied by the SNP.

Chancellor Philip Hammond previously said it would be \u0026ldquoinconceivable to walk away from such an obligation.  Mr Raab also rejected comments from Brussels suggesting a no deal scenario would mean there would be no specific arrangements in place for UK citizens living on the continent, or for EU migrants in Britain after withdrawal.  He told the Andrew Marr Show said: \"Well, I think that\u0027s a rather irresponsible thing to be coming from the other side.  \"We ought to be trying to reassure citizens on the continent and also here. There is obviously an attempt to try and ramp up the pressure.\"  Asked about reports the Government is preparing to stockpile food, Mr Raab at first denied it, but then added: \u0026ldquoThat kind of selective snippet that makes it into the media I think is \u0026ndash to the extent that the public pay attention to it \u0026ndash I think is unhelpful.\"  He insisted it would be \u0026ldquofrankly irrational for the EU to pursue the \u0026ldquoworst case scenario of a no deal outcome.

Wernher coined the phrase \u0026ldquosplendidly ugly for many of the treasures that he loved.  \u0026ldquoSir Julius Wernher had a distinct eye for quality, fine materials and craftsmanship and collected objects from across Europe and beyond,\u0026nbspDr Sarah Moulden, curator of collections at English Heritage, said.  \u0026ldquoHis particular passion was for what he called the \u0026lsquosplendidly ugly\u0026rsquo, artworks mainly from the medieval and Renaissance periods, which were typically small, unusual in their subject matter and expertly crafted from rare or richly embellished materials.  Many are\u0026nbspreligiously infused pieces such as memento mori: small objects encapsulating \u0026ldquothe fear of going to Hell,\u0026nbspa portable reminder to continually affirm your devotion to God.  People who could afford them were so attached to these objects they were\u0026nbsp \u0026ldquointeractive to an extent, almost like our smartphones are today, small enough to be looked at and engaged with at close range in the palm of one\u0026rsquos hand.  At the time they were created, the church was at the centre of medieval life and there was \u0026ldquoa fear of having a \u0026lsquobad death\u0027.  One \u0026ldquotiny and splendidly ugly ivory pendant, dating from 1500, shows on one side \u0026ldquoa medieval woman in the prime of her life, with a little dog tucked under her arm.  \u0026ldquoBut on turning it around you see the full horror of the fate that will become her, a rotting skeleton infested with salamanders, frogs, and worms, Dr Moulden said.  She said it reminds the viewer that \u0026ldquoyou may be living in this world with your good looks and earthly possessions, like your pet dog, but you will leave it with nothing so there is no point in clinging on to wealth or vanity.  The Wernher Collection is home to\u0026nbspmore than 700 works of fine and decorative works of art.  The collection at Ranger\u0026rsquos House will reopen to the public from today and will be open Sunday to Wednesday until the end of September."},{"url":null,"title":"edinburgh-fringe-to-have-contactless-technology-to-tip-street-performers","story":"  Artists entertaining at specific spaces along the Royal Mile\u0026nbspwill be equipped with special readers to take fixed-amount payments during the 25-day cultural event.

The first recognised album in the UK, the Mendelssohn Violin Concerto in E Minor on the Columbia Masterworks label, was released in June 1948.  The day will mark the culmination of a week-long series of events across the country, celebrating both new and classic releases across all genres, and paying tribute to sleeve artwork.  The event\u0026rsquos official broadcast partner BBC Music will air support for the initiative across BBC Radio 1, BBC Radio 1Xtra, BBC Radio 2, BBC Radio 3, BBC Radio 4 and BBC Radio 6 Music stations, and also on BBC iPlayer and BBC Four.  There will also be retail events, online listening parties and a social media campaign, which will invite people to nominate and share their most inspirational albums.  At 3.33pm on National Album Day, fans, shops, radio stations and public spaces will be invited to play their favourite album in full.  The format\u0026rsquos influence on music lovers is said to be growing, as data from the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) shows that 135 million albums, or their equivalent, were purchased or downloaded in 2017, an increase of 9.5% on the previous year.  The BPI estimates that five billion albums have been sold in the UK over the past 70 years.  Singer-songwriter Paloma Faith is one of the first artist ambassadors of National Album Day.  She said: \u0026ldquoI vividly remember being excited by so many classic albums as I was growing up, like Marvin Gaye\u0026rsquos What\u0026rsquos Going On, Dylan\u0026rsquos Freewheelin\u0026rsquo, and Erykah Badu\u0026rsquos Mama\u0026rsquos Gun, although, if I had to pick one, the album that most inspired me was Tracy Chapman\u0026rsquos self-titled debut.  \u0026ldquoIt featured the incredibly powerful Why? \u0026ndash a song that has become a real anthem for me not least as it was the first to bring home the emotional power of lyrics.  \u0026ldquoThe way we engage with music may be changing, but for me the album remains the ultimate expression of the songwriter\u0026rsquos craft.  James Stirling, head of content commissioning, BBC Music, said: \u0026ldquoBBC Music is proud to support the first National Album Day.  \u0026ldquoThe role of the album has evolved over 70 years \u0026ndash through vinyl and beautiful artwork to current streaming consumption \u0026ndash yet the story behind a great album remains an important part of British culture.  \u0026ldquoWe look forward to exploring the album in all its glory and telling these stories across the BBC.  National Album Day is jointly organised by Entertainment Retailers Association and the BPI, and is supported by the wider music community, including the Official Charts Company, and industry umbrella body UK Music.

According to data from\u0026nbspreal estate adviser Altus Group, 1,292 pubs have disappeared from the high street, which also means they are not contributing to the Government\u0026rsquos business rates pot.

The report, to be presented to the UN\u0027s Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women on Monday, makes 27 recommendations for improvements.  It highlights the \"disproportionate\" impact of UK welfare reforms, particularly on disabled, black and minority ethnic women and lone mothers.  SHRC wants Scottish ministers to ensure the problems experienced by women are addressed or mitigated in the development of the new social security system for Scotland.  The report points out that only 26% of public bodies are headed by women, with the gender pay gap reaching nearly 15% when the overall hourly wages of men and women are compared, putting Scotland second from the bottom of the 45 EU member states.  Access to mental health services is also highlighted as a concern, with young women more than twice as likely to be depressed as men.  With those on low incomes, disabled or from black and minority ethnic communities particularly affected, SHRC calls for equal access to services for all women.  The report praises progress made in tackling violence against women, including the recent Domestic Abuse Act, but said further concerted action is needed, particularly in relation to misogynistic bullying and sexual harassment.  It also highlights uncertainty about the implications of Brexit for the protection of human rights and women\u0027s rights, and backs a ban on smacking children.  Commission chair Judith Robertson said: \"Recent campaigns like #metoo have exposed the reality of just how many women experience day-to-day violations of their rights to safety, security and justice.  \"At the same time, women continue to be under-represented in public life, and to bear the brunt of austerity policies, with women from black and minority ethnic communities, disabled women and women on low incomes often experiencing a double or triple-whammy of disadvantage.  \"While the Scottish Government is to be commended for many of its actions to progress gender equality, our latest report to the UN shows that it must now go further, faster, to ensure that all women in Scotland are able to enjoy all of their rights - economic, social, civil and political - on the same terms as their male counterparts.\"  A Scottish Government spokesman said: \"We welcome that the Scottish Human Rights Commission recognises the significant progress in women\u0027s equality made in Scotland in recent years, including passing the Domestic Abuse (Scotland) Act, expanding our commitment to free early learning and childcare and establishing an Advisory Council on Women and Girls.  \"We are determined to go further, which is why we are continuing to pursue measures to improve women\u0027s opportunities in the labour market, ensure women are properly represented in decision-making positions, and tackle all forms of violence against women and girls. And we continue to lead by example, with the Scottish Government having one of very few gender-balanced cabinets anywhere in the world.  \"It is deeply worrying that the UK Government\u0027s welfare cuts are having a disproportionate effect on women and hard-pressed families.

While I appreciate that Inverness is the larger and most busy airport, there is a real public perception that, at present, Inverness gets a lot of public money spent on it in terms of development and jobs, to the detriment of other regional airports.The Caithness, Sutherland and Ross MSP added: \u0026ldquoI have consistently made the case that Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport should be considered as a real possibility for the future of the air traffic control service in the Highlands, not least because of the real benefit and impact it would have on the socio-economic climate of the county.\u0026ldquoWe need sustainable, quality jobs and I am worried that this decision will limit many who have seen themselves as having a career in the aviation industry in the Highlands to only being based in Inverness.Mrs Ross added: \u0026ldquoIn May, the rural economy and connectivity committee, of which I am vice-chair, took evidence on this issue and were assured by the then minister, Humza Yousaf, that a full consultation and scoping exercise would take place and that there would be no decisions made until this work was carried out.\u0026ldquoI was very disappointed to learn of the decision to base the new service in Inverness, which seems like a real kick in the teeth to smaller airports that have been working hard to train, support and develop the expertise in their ATC staff.Trudy Morris, chief executive of the Caithness Chamber of Commerce, was also unhappy with the decision.She said: \u0026ldquoWe were extremely disappointed by the Hial board\u0026rsquos decision to select Inverness in principle as the location for a planned centralised air traffic management facility. Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport would have made an excellent base for this facility, and would have offered an opportunity for Hial to reverse the trend of centralisation of public services in Inverness.\u0026ldquoIt is our understanding that Inverness offered significant benefits to Hial with regard to retention of existing and recruitment of new staff, and we can appreciate why this proved to be a significant factor in the decision-making process. Unfortunately the end result will be a loss of skilled jobs from the rural communities which most need them.Ms Morris added: \u0026ldquoAt a time when the future for the north Highlands is looking bright, with significant investments in oil and gas, renewables, tourism and indeed the airport itself, we feel this is a missed opportunity to maximise these. We will be working closely with Hial, public agencies and local businesses over the coming years to understand and address the impact that this decision will have on the north Highlands.Inverness was picked as the preferred location for a new state-of-the art air traffic control centre following a study by consultants.Monday 23 Jul 2018 3:42 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"New record set for Lands End to John OGroats cycle run","story":"THE record for cycling from Land\u0026rsquos End to John O\u0026rsquoGroats has been broken by Michael Broadwith.The 40-year-old from Hertfordshire did the marathon bike run in 43 hours, 25 minutes and 13 seconds \u0026ndash more than 30 minutes faster than the previous record held by Gethin Butler.His record of 44 hours, four minutes and 19 seconds had stood for 17 years.Veteran local cyclist Alasdair Washington was a record-keeper for the Road Records Association (RRA) at the north end of the trip.Mr Broadwith, a maths teacher, joins a select number of people to break the record since George Mills, riding a penny-farthing, made the first successful end-to-end attempt in 1886.Broadwith also broke the RRA 24-hour record with 507.511 miles covered at an average speed of 21.1 miles per hour.Bill Mowat, vice-chairman of the Dunnet and Canisbay Community Council, congratulated Mr Broadwith on his remarkable achievement.The women\u0026rsquos record holder is Lynne Taylor who lives in the West Midlands. \u0026ldquoShe is the only one with a Canisbay parish relative to do so, said Mr Mowat, who pointed out that the RRA only recognised female racers in the late 1930s.

Its expertise is thought to have formed part of the case for siting the facility at the Moine, which is about 40 miles west of Dounreay.Cavendish Dounreay Partnership (CDP) and its subsidiary Dounreay Site Restoration Ltd (DSRL) have invested resources in the spaceport proposal as part of its bid to identify and develop new jobs after the closure of the plant.Mr Craig said: \u0026ldquoEvery single one of us here at Dounreay recognises the importance of seizing opportunities like these to create new job opportunities, not just for this generation but the one that follows when Dounreay is gone.He added: \u0026ldquoOur skill sets in engineering, environmental science, programme management and a range of technical disciplines are easily transferable to industries such as the space sector and I am committed to working closely with the developer and operator to make the most of this amazing opportunity for our people.CDP chairman Simon Bowen said: \u0026ldquoDecommissioning a complex nuclear site like Dounreay is about more than getting it into a state that is safe for future generations \u0026ndash it is also about securing the social and economic prosperity of future generations.\u0026ldquoThe UK vertical launch facility is a key priority, with the potential to deliver high-value employment and supply chain opportunities.Sutherland was one of three potential spaceport locations to submit outline business cases to Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE) earlier this year. The others were Scolpaig on North Uist and Unst in Shetland.All three were assessed by independent consultants with specialist knowledge of the space sector.Each one met key criteria, including the ability to stage north facing launches over the sea into both polar and sun-synchronous orbit.However, the business case for Sutherland was judged stronger overall, including being successfully awarded UK Space Agency funding for its proposals in collaboration with potential launch operators.HIE chief executive Charlotte Wright said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore very clear that we want to work with others to ensure the benefits of a spaceport in the Highlands and Islands are not confined to Sutherland, but extend well beyond.\u0026ldquoA central part of our approach as we develop this project will be to explore opportunities throughout our region.Monday 23 Jul 2018 3:42 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Vet finds Major mess on record paddle run","story":"A VET caused a bit of a splash when she swapped her stethoscope for a paddleboard to complete a memorable Land\u0026rsquos End to John O\u0026rsquoGroats journey.Cal Major was paddling along the seas, rivers and canals of Britain in order to raise awareness of plastic pollution in our waters and to also raise money for mental health charities the Samaritans and Vetlife.The 30-year-old completed her momentous journey inside 59 days \u0026ndash as she\u0026rsquos the first to do this by paddleboard, she is now the official world-record holder.Cal, who hails from North Devon, is keen to highlight not only the untidiness of plastic litter left on our beaches and in our seas but also the damage it can do to both the sea wildlife and the environment.She found many examples of plastic pollution along the way to John O\u0026rsquoGroats and hopes people will give more though to their use and disposal of plastic products.\u0026ldquoThere was plastic wherever I went.

This means 42 per cent of all eligible LFASS 2017 claims have now been paid, with more payments to follow in the coming weeks.Rural Economy Secretary Fergus Ewing said: “Given the pressures that farmers and crofters continue to face, due in part to the extreme weather conditions during the winter and summer periods, I’m glad to see these important payments starting two months earlier than last year.“Earlier in the year we provided a loan option for farmers in advance of these payments, to help provide cashflow and financial certainty. Farmers are the backbone of Scotland’s rural economy and the Scottish Government is committed to supporting them wherever possible.\u0026#8221On behalf of the Scottish Farmers Union, NFU Scotland, LFA Committee Chairman, Robert Macdonald, welcomed the news saying: “The news that LFASS payments will be reaching farmers and crofters is welcome, particularly for those who did not apply for or receive an LFASS loan of 90 per cent through the LFASS loan scheme. The current prolonged period of extraordinary weather, and the economic impact that it brings, once again underlines the importance of these payments to business stability.“As we look ahead its vital that support for the less favoured areas, for hill farms and crofts, continues. NFU Scotland continues to press the Scottish Government for a timetable for payments, delivered in a timely manner to allow farmers and crofters to efficiently plan their cashflow.“Whilst these payments will bring relief for some, NFUS continues to highlight to farmers and crofters the importance of planning ahead for straw and feed supplies with three key messages — Plan ahead, Be flexible and collaborate.”\u0026nbsp\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We created the FitHomes concept to help Highland residents take charge of their own wellbeing and health needs through innovative technology and design.\"Thanks to the support we\u0026rsquove had from Centrica, both financially and advisory, we will be able to deliver digital health and assisted living technologies in a way that has not been possible before.\"The investment has been made by Centrica\u0026rsquos Ignite social impact investment fund. Established in 2017, Centrica Innovations aims to invest \u0026pound100 million by 2022 in new technologies that will transform the way people live, work and move.Sam Salisbury, Centrica Innovations labs director, said: \"As a market leader in connected home products, we are always on the lookout for opportunities to solve real world problems with new technology and innovation. The lack of affordable, energy efficient, desirable homes is one that is affecting families across the country so we\u0026rsquore delighted to be able to support an initiative that shows such potential in transforming how people, young and old, live in their homes.\"The origins of the FitHome go back to 2008 when a tenant was found dead in his home, having lain unnoticed for over a year. Vowing to put new preventative systems in place, Albyn commissioned research exploring potential solutions. As a result, the society decided to develop its own system that could be adopted across its growing portfolio of homes.Matt Stevenson of Carbon Dynamic said of FitHomes: \"I truly believe that this housing method can change the way that we view construction of new housing developments as well as feeding into the wider healthcare and societal issues.\"Monday 23 Jul 2018 3:43 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

It has been credited with helping some people to turn their lives around.Confirmation that Mr Harper, who has also sold on the streets of Inverness, had found a successful new niche for himself came when he was handed a Scotland\u0026rsquos Top Seller accolade.Mr Harper, who has overcome major health challenges, averages around 160 copies a week. He has been selling the magazine on and off since it was launched back in 1991.The secret to his success is fairly straightfoward, he believes: \"I speak to everybody who walks past me. You don\u0026rsquot know the last time they talk to someone. That\u0026rsquos the nitty gritty of it.\"Smile and say hello, and help them if they need it. I gave an old lady a hand with her shopping trolley earlier, and when she came back out she bought a magazine off me.\"I love selling the magazine, it\u0026rsquos my job. I don\u0026rsquot get benefits, this is my only source of income, and I travel up on the bus here from Inverness every day to do it. I\u0026rsquom always on my pitch. I love it, I\u0026rsquoll moan and groan when it\u0026rsquos snowing but apart from that it\u0026rsquos great.\"My customers are amazing, I\u0026rsquom well looked after and I have good banter with them. I feel like a part of the community here. People bring me stuff all the time \u0026ndash recently I was given a bag of clothes \u0026ndash not all of them fitted me, so I took the rest to a charity shop so they could use them. And recently one of my customers bought me lunch.\"The staff at Tesco always ask how I\u0026rsquom doing \u0026ndash I get on really well with Steve, the manager, he tells me I\u0026rsquom good with the punters.

As a result, Newton Road will be closed from July 19 at 7am to July 22 at 11am. And Dingwall No.1 in Craig Road will be shut from 7am on August 2 to 11am on August 5.Final installation and testing of the new barriers will also require fortnight-long road closures at both sites \u0026ndash Dingwall Middle from October 15 to 29 and Dingwall No.1 from October 29 to November 12.David Dickson, infrastructure director for Network Rail Scotland, said: \"These level crossing upgrades represent a significant improvement for rail and road safety.\"Our consultation work with the local community earlier this year indicated support for these improvements and we look forward to seeing them delivered.\"Our aim is to deliver this work with as little disruption as possible, however, we will require two short closures this summer plus two week road closures for each crossing to install and test the new equipment this autumn.\"Train services are not expected to be affected by any of the works.Monday 23 Jul 2018 3:43 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Visitors will then be able to access behind the scenes areas of the museum, experiencing objects up close.Curator Dr Karen Buchanan explained: \"We want to make as much of the material in our collections accessible as possible. This includes not only our objects in storage, but also the wealth of archive and library material we hold, which document the history of Gairloch parish. This funding will maximise our storage space, protect our collection for the future and enrich our visitors\u0026rsquo experiences.\"Museums Galleries Scotland is the National Development Body for museums and galleries in Scotland and offers strategic development support to the sector. This round of funding saw over \u0026pound550,000 awarded to 15 different projects in 14 museums across Scotland. Gairloch Heritage Museum museum plans to move its collection early in the new year and to start opening its stores to the public next summer.Its new premises have been fashioned from a former anti-aircraft operations room, a piece of local history in itself.Monday 23 Jul 2018 3:43 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

A spokesperson for the judges said:\"He is someone who thoroughly deserves to be recognised for the great contribution he has made to both the industry and the community. A wonderful role model and ambassador.\"Stories shared by his colleagues when nominating him, included times when he dug out roads during a storm to deliver bottled gas and a generator to a terminally-ill customer delivering flowers to a customer who had recently lost her husband, and caring for a customer who had suffered a severe stroke.\"For me, it isn\u0026rsquot about going above and beyond, it\u0026rsquos about doing what I feel is the right thing to do and making sure our customers are cared for and supported when they need us most,\" said a modest Mr Sutherland, who said the award was as much recognition for the Highland team as for himself. \"I\u0026rsquom delighted to take this award home to my wife and girls, who have supported me along the way as I disappeared for days during storms, sometimes missing important events and occasions at home. It\u0026rsquos all worth it as I\u0026rsquom glad to say I still love my job as much as I did when I joined 44 years ago as an apprentice.\"Colin Pirie, SSEN\u0026rsquos head of Region for the Highlands and Islands, added: \"Mike is without doubt the most dedicated, conscientious person I have ever met in my 28 years with SSEN.\"He genuinely cares for everyone he meets. His selfless attitude and his devotion to customers, colleagues (especially young people and trainees) and his family is well known.

Depute fiscal Alison McKenzie told Sheriff Margaret Neilson the 15-year-old was being trained in lifeguard skills and it was when they were alone at the pool Russell repeatedly fondled him over his trunks: \"It happened so frequently he could not recall the number of occasions he was molested,\" said the fiscal.The boy didn\u0026rsquot report the assaults and told no-one until many years later as a father of two he received a letter from Russell offering to act as a football scout for his children.The fiscal said: \"The complainer was furious, recalled the abuse he suffered at the hands of the accused, and made a statement of complaint to police.\"Russell admitted assaulting the boy on various dates between 1977 and 1979 at Dingwall Sports Centre Swimming Pool and between May and June 1981 at the Mackay Hostel sexually assaulting a 16-year-old.He further admitted assaulting an 18-year-old by handling his buttocks over his kilt in 1983 at a street in Dingwall and exposing himself to him.He also pleaded guilty to indecently assaulting an 18- year-old at the hostel in 1984 by sitting on his bed uninvited, placing his hand under the bed covers and repeatedly attempting to touch his genitals.Sentence was deferred after his last appearance for reports.Russell is due to appear in court again on August 2.Monday 23 Jul 2018 3:43 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The first is the cinema, which would be built on land close to the ferry slipway and next to an existing boat storage shed.It would seat roughly 30 people and host weekly screenings throughout the year, rising to twice a week in the summer. It would also be used to help house Cromarty\u0026rsquos growing film festival, which attracts fans and famous faces from across the country every autumn.Cromarty Estate also plans to build an office hub alongside the cinema in a bid to cater for growing business demand in the town.A statement submitted by Cromarty Estate said: \"Cromarty has a thriving entrepreneurial community but this is not matched by suitable office accommodation, with the result that many find themselves having to move their business bases from Cromarty to Dingwall, Tore or Inverness when they outgrow their own homes, with the resulting loss of employment opportunities in the town.\"Addressing this need... will make Cromarty a more balanced and sustainable community.\"Film society trustee Tanya Karlebach said the group was \"really excited\" to reach this milestone and the move would help increase the frequency of screenings in Cromarty.She added that there is still some fundraising to do before the \u0026pound240,000 cost of the venue is covered, but that by lodging the application now, they are hopeful permission will be in place to begin as soon as the target is met.They hope to hear about their remaining grant applications and other fundraising by late autumn.She added the society had opted for a new-build because none of the existing sites in Cromarty were suitable for conversion. They would also have cost more to take on than building a cinema from scratch.\"We hope the community is supportive,\" she said. \"We\u0026rsquove had positive feedback so far and it\u0026rsquos in a great location down by the ferry.\"A survey of Cromarty residents found that 82 per cent backed a cinema in the town and the same number would go to more screenings if the venue was better than what is currently on offer.The plans for the cinema and office hub have won support from a leading Highland business figure.David Richardson, the Federation of Small Businesses\u0026rsquo Highlands and Islands development manager, said the organisation \"wholeheartedly supports locally-managed collaborative ventures that make our small rural communities even better places to live, especially for the young people and families that we desperately need to retain and attract.\"Cinemas appeal to all ages and to locals and visitors alike, and they can also be great social hubs.\"Equally, the presence of purpose-designed office space can do much to encourage would-be entrepreneurs to take the plunge and start new businesses existing small business to expand and to attract businesses from outside to relocate.\"It approved the buildings would feature dark metal cladding to the walls of the cinema, with timber cladding on the office hub.Construction could start as early as spring next year.To donate to the cinema project go to www.justgiving/crowdfunding/cromartycommunitycinemaMonday 23 Jul 2018 3:43 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The Oil \u0026amp Gas Technology Centre (OGTC) is leading the industry-backed “Facility of the Future” initiative that could halve the cost of developing and operating an oil and gas facility and help to access the equivalent of more than 3.5 billion barrels of reserves in so-called marginal discoveries.            A discovery is classed as marginal when the risks or technology involved make it too challenging to develop economically, for instance because of its geographical location or the specialist equipment needed.            The project wants to design a new approach that will make this process more efficient than traditional methods, such as fixed platforms.It aims to develop lower-cost, reusable facilities that can be remotely operated from onshore control centres, thereby increasing reducing the requirement for staff to work in the hazardous offshore environment and creating skilled onshore jobs. Chris Pearson, the OGTC’s small pools solution centre manager, said: “Oil and gas is playing catch-up with many industries when it comes to automation and remote operations. We’re exploring how the combination of existing and new technology can be best used in the offshore environment to improve safety, reduce life cycle cost and increase efficiency.“New, smarter and more automated ways of developing oil and gas fields are required if we’re to fully unlock marginal discoveries and maximise economic recovery from the UKCS. “The Facility of the Future initiative will help to significantly reduce life-cycle costs and strengthen the investment case for both marginal discoveries and more traditional reservoirs.”            The initiative will kick off with a study led by Crondall Energy and Buoyant Production Technologies to develop a floating facility adapted from the type of installations currently used for shallow water gas fields, known as NUIs, to make them suitable for oil discoveries. It hopes to design an NUI concept that will function at any water depth and uses a minimal manning approach by involving remote control and automation technologies.Niki Chambers, project manager at the marginal development solutions centre, said: “This study is looking at unlocking the capabilities of these floating facilities to work across any kind of discovery. It is opening up the whole of the UKCS.” The OGTC is supported by the Scottish and UK governments, Aberdeen City and Aberdeenshire councils and Opportunity North East. It also generates funding from industry and university partners, and is currently in the process of securing further funds for subsequent studies as part of this initiative."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4772278.1532255228!/image/image.jpg","title":"bid for free bus travel for over 60s to be enshrined in law","story":"        Scottish Labour is calling for free bus travel to be protected by law for people aged over 60.

What you’ll need:              • 500g Canadian strong white bread flour (or a flour with a high gluten content, i.e. at least 14 per cent) • 30g lard or vegetable shortening • 10g sugar • 10g salt • 5g fast action yeast             • 400ml cold water For the Coating • 50g plain flour • 50g rice cones/flourView our STEP BY STEP GALLERY HERE            Method: 1 Rub the fat into the flour in a large mixing bowl. Stir in the sugar, salt and yeast. 2 Now pour in the water and mix until it is all incorporated. This is a wet dough but when you are using bread flour with such a high gluten content it can easily take that much water without becoming sloppy. 3 Remove the dough from the bowl and knead it for 1 minute until the dough has just become smooth with all the ingredients thoroughly combined. 4 With such a long ferment you don’t need to knead it too much. Put the dough back into the bowl and cover loosely with cling film. Put the bowl in the refrigerator to leave it to ferment for 12 – 16 hours.             5 The next morning combine the rice cones and plain flour for the coating. Take a large baking sheet and dust it liberally with the coating mixture (make sure to leave enough to coat the rolls). 6 Empty the dough on to a work surface which has been liberally dusted with the rice/flour coating mixture. This is where a large silicone spatula or scraper is useful. 7 Now using a dough scraper divide the dough into 8 pieces. Don’t worry if it is sticky or messy as these rolls aren’t supposed to look perfect. 8 Dust your fingers with the coating mixture and take each piece of dough, one at a time, and dip it into the coating mixture and place it on the baking sheet. They don’t need to be in the shape of a roll but try to keep in the air that is inside the dough. 9 Do this with each piece, placing them near to each other so that when they rise they will bake together. Despite the stickiness of this dough the coating mixture works wonders for stopping the dough from sticking to everything. Leave them to rise for 1 – 2 hours or until doubled in size. 10 Bake in a 250˚C preheated oven on a high shelf for 15 – 20 minutes or until the tops are dark. The rolls should be well fired for the right flavour.• Recipe submitted by Fraser Wright Read more: The history of morning rolls, including a recipe for making your ownRead more: A history of the square sausage, including a recipe for making your own"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4772349.1532277551!/image/image.jpg","title":"in pictures one summer s day competition your best photos of the scottish summer","story":"        We asked you to send us your favourite pictures illustrating sums up the perfect summer\u0026#8217s day is for our readers, and boy you didn\u0026#8217t disappoint!

Take former foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, for example. Having backed the Leave campaign in 2016 because he calculated that would maximise the chances of him one day becoming prime minister, Johnson now sits on the back benches, from where he may pontificate about how to solve a crisis for which he is in great part responsible. Last week, days after his resignation from Theresa May’s cabinet, Johnson could be heard to complain that “a needless fog of self-doubt” had descended on the process of departure from the EU.            To those already duped by Johnson, this was stirring, statesmanlike stuff.            It was nothing of the sort. Rather, Johnson’s resignation statement to the House of Commons was stuffed with meaningless platitudes which refused to acknowledge that the EU has every right to negotiate as it sees fit. It boiled down \u2028to a rather Trumpish “make Britain \u2028great again”, with neither detail nor \u2028logic playing any kind of part in achieving this.Throughout the referendum campaign and in the two years since, the Brexiteers’ response to legitimate questions about how exactly departure from the EU might be painlessly achieved has been to fall back on platitudes about confidence, as if somehow “self-belief” will protect sterling and prevent job losses.In Johnson’s cynically constructed fantasy world, if we walk meekly into a lion’s den, we should expect to be mauled to death. But if we hold our heads up and instruct the lion that we’re here to take back control of the den then the beast will roll over in defeat. Oh, and if that doesn’t work and the lion does eat you, well that’s the fault of all those people who told you not to go into its den in the first place. Having failed in the two years since he and Nigel Farage and sundry snake-oil salesmen won the referendum to come up with anything approaching a workable version of Brexit, Johnson took the coward’s way out. He did not resign because of principle (a concept entirely alien to the man), he resigned because he had no idea how to make that victory look like anything other than a spectacular act of national self-harm.May is not, even her fiercest critics would surely concede, a politician in the mould of Johnson. Charged with leading the UK out of the EU, she has to come up with ideas more substantial than “just be confident”. She has to engage with the real world – a real world in which the UK has no cards to play during Brexit negotiations with the EU.            Yet May has begun to show worryingly Johnson-esque tendencies.A call from the Prime Minister for the EU to “evolve” its position on Brexit, for example, is pure Johnson.Support for May’s white paper on Brexit – the document that provided rats such as Johnson and Brexit secretary David Davis with the excuse they required to flee the ship they helped sink – would require huge compromise (or evolution) from the EU which would have to be willing to allow the UK to retain the benefits of a trade deal while absolving us of any responsibility to honour the free movement of people or to recognise the jurisdiction of the European Court.Little wonder, then, that the EU Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, has signalled his… let us diplomatically describe them as “concerns” over the document.            According to Barnier, the Prime Minister’s plan for a future trade relationship could weaken the single market and create burdens for business. The white paper, he said, opened the way to a “constructive discussion” but it had to be “workable”.Those labouring under the misapprehension that the EU is in the business of ensuring the UK gets precisely what it wants (whatever that is) will seize on that word “constructive”. They would do better to pay attention to his warning about the things being “workable”.In the febrile atmosphere created by cabinet infighting over Brexit, the fact that the white paper represents nothing more than a series of aspirations is frequently ignored. The arrogant assumption that the EU is obliged to take seriously proposals that would undermine the integrity of the institution might comfort true believers in the Eurosceptic mission but, meanwhile, back on Planet Earth, the reality of a no-deal Brexit looms ever closer.Johnson once said that when it came to Brexit, he was pro cake and pro eating it. A pithy little soundbite, to be sure, but one that assumed the UK could force the EU to make compromises in our favour.It is time, surely, for us to get real about what exactly we can expect from the EU by way of a Brexit deal. And what we can expect is nothing.            Yes, the EU might be willing to give a little here or there but it will only do so when such concessions are in its interests.The European Union will, inevitably, be weakened by the United Kingdom’s departure. This will be welcomed by Russian President Vladimir Putin along with various nasty little blood and soil nationalists around the word. And that, among other reasons, means the EU will want to do all it can to discourage other member states from leaving.It simply makes no sense for the EU to send a message that says a nation may walk away from the shared responsibilities of membership and then pick and choose what parts of the relationship it wishes to maintain.Countless analogies about divorce or golf club membership have been made in pursuit of driving home this point in recent months yet the ludicrous idea that the UK has cards to play persists.Barnier had said nothing to encourage the belief that the UK can strike a deal on Brexit. Rather, his remarks should remind us that our European partners have more important things to worry about than playing along with the fantasies of right-wing ideologues who insist cake may be both had and eaten."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4772171.1532176550!/image/image.jpg","title":"sir tom devine revisiting the nation s historic bestseller","story":"        John Prebble\u0026#8217s The Highland Clearances, published for the first time in 1963, is the best-selling Scottish history book ever written, having achieved worldwide sales of more than a quarter of a million copies. It still sells well and is the most widely read text in the United States on any aspect of Scottish history.                 The book is part of his Highland trilogy, Fire And Sword, which also includes Culloden (1961) and Glencoe (1966). In the foreword to Glencoe, Prebble revealed his objective: “I have written this book because its story is, in a sense, a beginning to what I have already written about Culloden and the clearances – the destruction of the Highland people and their way of life.”            John Prebble (1915–2001) was born in England but emigrated, aged six, to Canada with his parents, later returning to the UK as a young boy of 12. It is suggested that early friendships among members of the Scottish emigrant communities in Canada first stimulated his interest in Highland history. He joined the Communist Party of Great Britain as an adult but left after the end of the Second World War. However, Prebble never lost his hostility to the human impact of market capitalism or sympathy for its victims.            Many scholars have rubbished The Highland Clearances as a work of faction, or a fusion of fact and fiction, rather than a serious history. Predictably the book rarely features in the prescribed reading lists of Scottish universities, except perhaps as an exemplar of partisan historical interpretation. I recall a colleague once setting students the essay question: “Prebble’s The Highland Clearances is not good history but it is a good novel. Discuss.”But most readers seem not to care about the ferocious criticisms which the volume has sometimes attracted from members of the academy it continues to sell well long after his death. For the general public, Prebble tells a compelling story in very readable prose presented as a dramatic saga of betrayal, loss, tragedy and forced exile of the Highland clans from their native glens which in his interpretation remain empty to this day as silent memorials of man’s inhumanity to man.The author makes his own position perfectly clear from the outset: “This is the story of how the Highlanders were deserted and then betrayed. It concerns itself with people, how sheep were preferred to them, and how bayonet, truncheon and fire were used to drive them from their homes.” The book is an accessible and fluent read, in part because the author does not even try to come to grips with any of the many challenging complexities of Highland history. Those in the dock are always the former chieftains of the clans, by the later 18th century transformed into commercial landlords, whose greed, Prebble insists, led them to sacrifice their erstwhile clansmen for filthy lucre. At root, indeed, the volume is concerned with a classic struggle between the forces of good (the defenceless people of the Highlands) and evil (the brutal landlords and their callous lackeys, the notorious factors – estate managers – of ill fame). Prebble’s perspective on clearances had been fashioned by almost a century of earlier polemic, political and fictional writing which stretched back into the Victorian era. Most of the documentation in the book relies on these earlier works with little evidence of original research by the author. Almost all of this passionate oeuvre was produced at the height of Victorian controversies about clearances between the 1840s and the 1880s. It was deeply sympathetic to the people who had been displaced, strongly supportive of the vital need for land reform and bitterly hostile to what was seen as oppressive and brutal landlordism.            It was significant too that The Highland Clearances achieved bestseller status in Scotland during the late 1960s and 1970s, when the country first began to experience the early stages of deindustrialisation and rising levels of unemployment as the postwar boom petered out and the old imperial connections which had sustained the great heavy industries faded into the past. As the country started to move politically to the left, the history of the evictions became a symbol for the emerging tragedy of an economy in decline, the social impact of deindustrialisation sometimes being described as a modern clearance.This was also the time when Scottish nationalism finally achieved some electoral purchase with Winnie Ewing’s famous victory in the Hamilton by-election of 1967. Nationalism, clearances and victimhood soon became intimately linked by some polemicists, a tendency which has continued to the present day through the proliferation of social media. The contentions were that the historic tragedy of the Gaels had taken place during the Union and sometimes also, against all the evidence, that English landowners and sheep farmers were mainly responsible for the draconian acts of eviction.Prebble himself never claimed to be a historian and always referred to himself as a historical writer. He seems to have been taken aback by the storm of criticism generated in some circles by his book, especially by the intervention of the late Professor Gordon Donaldson, a former Historiographer Royal,who bitterly denounced Prebble’s work on the Highlands as “complete rubbish”.Some thought the furore simply reflected jealousy on the part of an academic establishment whose works might be scholarly and rigorous but could never hope to achieve a fraction of Prebble’s sales. It is also fair to say that he had tackled an important and controversial subject which most historians up until that time had studiously ignored or consciously avoided. But scholars were also right to be concerned that a book which some of them believed to be riven by bias and distortion, as well as being under-researched and devoid of much critical perspective, was widely accepted by the public as the authentic chronicle of clearance.             There is indeed still much to be said about this controversial and emotive subject. In my new book The Scottish Clearances, which will be published later this year, I return to the saga of the dispossession of peasant communities, not just in the Highlands but throughout Scotland between 1600 to 1900. Based on four decades of research, writing, teaching and reflection I see it as my most ambitious and challenging project to date.Sir Tom Devine is Sir William Fraser Professor Emeritus of Scottish History and Palaeography in the University of EdinburghThe Scottish Clearances: A History Of The Dispossessed 1600-1900 will be published by Allen Lane: The Penguin Press on 4 October at £25.00"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006. Construction began in 2016 and is expected to be completed on schedule in late summer.\nLocated at Seafield the new centre is just a short distance from the long-standing Eric Gray Centre. Once opened the centre will provide specialist assistance for adults with complex care needs and learning disabilities.\nThe building has been designed by Richard Gibson Architects and construction is being led by DITT. The drone footage was shot by Nick McCaffrey.\nThe centre does indeed look good and is on schedule well done DITT , the clients and staff are all looking forward to being in the building. It has taken many years to reach this point  and is much needed.\nI wonder what, if any, proof you have that clients and staff are looking forward to being in the building? If you do have some proof to justify your claim, are they looking forward to being in before or after completion?\nGeorge Dickson\nI have along with other parents of clients that currently use the Eric Gray Centre worked hard, and against many obstacles to finally see the realisation  of a much needed new building where all clients who are at this moment in different buildings due to there being not enough space in the old building and facilities that have run there course in time. It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep it  for the new building. The building will provide not only better facilities and space but will also give staff the help in coordination and equipment to do there job under one roof with less strain and expense to all.\nI also claim nothing but most people that have lived in Shetland for the last 10 years will be aware of the problems associated with the Eric Gray building, whether directly involved or not although the thinking and planning of a new building goes farther back than that.\nSome parents and staff have had a look through the new building at different stages of build, and everyone to my knowledge was impressed. I like many other parents and carers look forward to the day its complete and our daughters and sons can enjoy the help and encouragement from staff to live their lives to the best of their ability.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"more seabirds entangled but fishing industry not always to blame says tour guide ","story":"\nDarron Smith cuts free a gannet.

It’s manufacture uses up valuable natural resources but this is a result of human exploitation. This begs the question, why are humans capable of natural behaviour and unnatural behaviour in what seems to be equal measure?  Is it normal and natural to drive cars, fly in ‘planes, build tower blocks, dig for coal, aim to fly to distant planet ? The list is endless. According to the experts, global warming and ice ages have occurred many times and certainly before life as we know it existed.  We are worried about what are threats to our welfare only because it is a seemingly an alien threat . Surely, if we are able to stand outside ourselves, we are now caught up in a “ normal” event. And in our short sighted stupidity we are adding to the dangers.

One of the most remarkable performances in the latter game came from Kari Arnason, recently deemed not good enough by Aberdeen but still able to do a pretty fair job on shackling Lionel Messi.\nThe introduction the Video Assistant Referee system, or VAR as it is commonly known, has caused a few talking points. There was the decision to allow Diego Costa’s first goal for Spain against Portugal, and also to award penalties to France and Sweden against Australia and South Korea respectively.\nThese “assistants” are apparently not even at the game. They are sitting in a office somewhere in Moscow, but bizarrely kitted out in full referees’ uniform!\nWhy on earth they didn’t disallow Switzerland’s equaliser against Brazil is beyond me, however. Everyone seemed to notice Steven Zuber’s push on his marker before making room for himself to head the ball home.\nEveryone that is except the boys in black in Moscow. The ITV panellists were unanimous in their opinion that the goal should have been ruled out. Even Roy Keane, who used to think decapitation was just about permissable, appeared to agree with the others.\nOkay, so we will mention the commentary and punditry.

And surely it is high time Gary Lineker was pensioned off.

The cricketer with roots connected to these parts was none other than the man of the match himself – batsman Callum MacLeod whose magnificent 140 not out was largely responsible for Scotland’s thrilling win.\nMacLeod’s father Donald attended the Anderson High School in the late 1960s and early 70s. He was a goalkeeper himself, playing for the Ness United team in the Shetland under-18 competitions.\nHe went on to make somewhat of a name for himself as a photographer, working for The Press and Journal and The Scotsman at times before establishing his own business.\nMacLeod (junior) has obviously usurped any success attained by his old man, however. Even before his recent moment of glory he has been an established international batsman, making several centuries at one-day level.\nHe has been good enough to play grade cricket in Sydney, which is no mean feat, has had stints at English counties Warwickshire and Durham and has just signed a contract with Derbyshire.\nIt is going on half a century since I last saw Donald MacLeod, but I know a certain former Whitedale goalkeeper who keeps in touch. If he happens to read this he’ll maybe pass on congratulations from me, and I’m sure a few others, to the family.\n: : : : : : : :\nTwo weeks ago I suggested that having clubs competing in a local league structure could be of great benefit to preparation for junior inter-county sports such as hockey and netball.\nWhile there is no regular junior league set-up in the isles for hockey, it has been pointed out that in netball this exists for primary school-aged players upwards.\nThe sport appears to be thriving at the various age levels, with under-13 and under-17 squads regularly competing on the mainland with success.\nThe Anderson High School team has also regularly sent a team to compete in the Scottish Schools Open competition, where they have performed with distinction over the past few years.\nThe AHS team also plays in division one of the senior netball leagues, while a feeder team called “Hotfooters” was created to provide easier access for youngsters to join the league.\nAccording to the organisers there have been over 1,000 competitive matches in Shetland and 32 competitive matches away from the isles for juniors this season in various leagues and tournaments.\nCoach Sanna Aitken says: “Of course it is disappointing that we lost the junior inter-county this year \u0026#8230 the girls were really gutted.\n“As a coach, I am delighted that the netball continues to be really competitive [with] an incredibly high standard of match demonstrating the hard work and success of the sport and junior set-up in both isles.\n“I am confident when saying the loss was nothing to do with any weaknesses in the local league structure. It just didn’t go our way on the day. Only two years ago it went Shetland’s way where we won on Orkney’s home turf.

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildlife centre based in Lerwick.

It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion.

Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"rubber duck wins first bergen lerwick leg of shetland race ","story":"Espen Børresen (left) and Morten Offendal celebrate their victory.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another. But sadly, and I can envisage a few whistlers spluttering over their cornflakes at this, the words “consistent” and “referees” are an oxymoron as far as I\u0026#8217m concerned.\nOn the subject of the English progression in the tournament, it has once again thrown up the perennial question of whether Scottish people should support their oldest rivals.\nThere are no doubt many north of the border who would find the prospect of England winning the World Cup a terrifying one. They could even be in the majority. A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships. Someone should tell him that waistcoats are the most pointless item of clothing known to man.\nBut hey, most of it is good. I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct.

Just because he’s the best cyclist in the world does not mean he’s benefiting from a performance-enhancing drug.\n: : : : : : : :\nWith all the buzz of the World Cup an annual competition in southwest London has almost been forgotten about.\nYes, Wimbledon is in full flow once again and the British competitors are as usual struggling to make it into the second week.\nAndy Murray was probably sensible to withdraw, citing that he was not quite ready for five-set matches after his hip operation. There were signs at Queens and Eastbourne, however, that he may be able to scale the heights once more.\nThere is of course a capable replacement in Kyle Edmund, who is seeded having reached the Australian Open semi-finals earlier this year.\nEdmund’s half of the draw looks fairly open, and he could well still be involved come Monday. But of course anything can happen, and by the time you read this he could be gone.

Any avoidable delay in receiving essential treatment is unacceptable.\n\u0026#8220Many of these passengers have been waiting for their appointments for months if not years, and have no way to access the treatment and specialists they need at home.\n\u0026#8220Travelling out with the isles for medical treatment is already stressful for vulnerable isles residents without the added anxiety caused by cancellations. Rescheduling appointments is not easy for those living in remote communities and patients may have a lengthy wait for another opportunity to travel.\n\u0026#8220The right to strike is an important one and I understand that strikes have to cause disruption in order to be effective.\n\u0026#8220But, I urge your members to carefully consider this compromise: Loganair flights from the North Isles use smaller aircraft which require a lower level of fire service cover.\n\u0026#8220Therefore, Unite members could guarantee a minimum level of fire and security coverage on the proposed strike dates, allowing life-line Orkney and Shetland flights to continue for essential medical travel.\n\u0026#8220I hope further discussions will resolve the dispute before any strike action goes ahead and that the needs of North Isles passengers are at the forefront of your decision making.\u0026#8221\nMeanwhile, Loganair is giving passengers in Shetland the chance to change their flights.\nAbout 170 members, including key airport staff, security workers and firefighters have voted in favour of striking – with more talks expected next week involving conciliation service Acas.\nTwenty-four-hour strikes are planned for Friday 20th July as well as on Thursday 2nd August and Thursday16th August.\nLoganair managing director Jonathan Hinkles said passengers could change their flights free of charge.\nHe said: “Although there is still time for the strike to be averted and we hope it will be, we are offering customers booked to fly to or from Aberdeen on the strike dates the opportunity to change their travel date or route if they wish.\n\u0026#8220This is free of charge and designed to offer certainty of alternatives for those booked to travel.\n\u0026#8220We also have contingency plans to operate Aberdeen flights to alternate airports on strike days if this does go ahead, and will announce details of those if this action cannot be averted. Our website is up to date with the latest information.”\nUnite regional officer Wullie Wallace expected talks with Acas next week. The dispute is over pay for airport workers. A total of 88 per cent of workers rejected the latest pay offer.\nThe union said members had rejected two below-inflation wage offers on the back of below inflation increases over the last two years.\nMr Wallace said: \u0026#8220Aberdeen International Airport’s latest derisory pay offer has been emphatically rejected by Unite members. The workforce for several years now has received below inflation increases and the company’s idea of rewarding its hard working employees is by offering more real terms pay cuts.\n\u0026#8220Aberdeen Airport has been investing heavily into improving the airport facilities and amenities. It’s high time for the company to invest in its employees. Unite remains open to further discussions with a view to resolving the dispute.\u0026#8221\nAn unattributed quote from an Aberdeen spokesman stated: \u0026#8220We have been informed by Unite of their intention to take industrial action on Friday 20th July.\n\u0026#8220This follows the rejection of our proposed pay offer. We believe we have made an offer that is entirely fair and reasonable and we are committed to continuing discussions to reach a resolution acceptable to all parties.\n\u0026#8220We have made contact with Acas which has agreed to mediate between both parties. We are seeking a suitable date to continue our discussions in an attempt to reach a mutually agreeable position.\n\u0026#8220We will, as a matter of course, ensure contingency plans are in place in the event of any planned industrial action.”\nI am amazed that the Scottish Government will allow a union to hold hostage urgent healthcare for 45,000 citizens in Shetland and Orkney. It is reasonable to suspect that the SNP is in the unions’ pockets.\nI can only suggest that if Christopher wants to find out who is in the ‘unions pockets’ he should investigate the connection between the Labour Party and Unite,  and while he’s at it perhaps he should refresh his memory as to what powers are reserved at Westminster and which are devolved to Holyrood.\nThere are so many reds under beds these days \u0026#8230\n My primary concern is that Shetland and Orkney folk will be at risk for a number of August days while this irresponsible union strikes.

On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois (Belgium) Benjamin Pavard (France), Raphaël Varane (France), Diego Godín (Uruguay), Ivan Strinic (Croatia) Ivan Perisic (Croatia), Luka Modric (Croatia), Jordan Henderson (England), Eden Hazard (Belgium) Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal), Edinson Cavani (Uruguay).\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"vacancy kitchen assistant and dispatch assistant with sandwick baking co ","story":" We currently have a vacancy in our kitchen department assisting in making our range of filled products and also selected confectionery lines.\n We also have a vacancy in our dispatch department wrapping, labelling products and making up customers orders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"blue green algae found in tingwall ","story":"Another loch has been found to contain blue green algae, this time the Loch of Griesta in Tingwall.\nNotices will be posted next to the loch warning against contact with the algal scum.\nThe SIC\u0026#8217s environmental health department received notification of the discovery from the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency.

the eye of storm in Tornado Alley","story":"Nicole Webber\n\u0026nbsp\nA storm chaser from Newtonmore had to run for cover from some of the world\u0027s most extreme weather in Tornado Alley.\nScott Duncan (24), a former Kingussie High School pupil, has just returned from his dream adventure to the United States with a team of fellow meteorologists.\nHe got up close and personal with several tornadoes and massive electric storms during the trip of a lifetime which started on May 19, with the quartet returning on Saturday.\nThe daredevil and talented photographer captured breathtaking snaps of the huge storms as they crossed Nebraska, Kansas, Colorado and Texas.\nScott told the Strathy: \"The four of us flew out to Tornado Valley in the hope to witness some of the planet\u0027s most extreme weather.\n\"We decided to put our meteorological skills together and chase the storms ourselves.\"\nThe group of Reading University graduates rented a car and travelled 7000 miles over the course of the three weeks.\n\"We do it for the buzz as we all have a passion for extreme weather and it is also a great way to hit the open road and explore new states,\" he added.\nHe agreed that it can be a dangerous hobby but not for the reasons you would think.\n\"People often think tornadoes are the main concern but lightning, giant hail stones and flash flooding are often the hazards that prove most deadly,\" he said.\n\"Careful planning before and during a storm chase is absolutely essential.\"\n\u0026nbsp\nScott now works for MetDesk, a UK-wide weather service, and he took those skills across the Pond with him.\nThe friends used the latest weather model data, satellite and radar observations and invested in a portable internet device to ensure they had the best chance of remaining connected to signal while on the move.\nScott said it is incredibly important that the driver can access accurate directions quickly when faced with dangerous and often changing conditions.\nAlthough they had a few close calls, they managed to avoid getting themselves into \"major trouble\" by knowing when to back off and take shelter.\nThe Newtonmore man explained: \"We avoided driving through storms with tennis ball sized hail stones and 70mph straight line winds.\n\"But at one point we did have to take shelter in a gas station freezer room \u0026ndash the strongest room in the building \u0026ndash due to a tornado with confirmed flying debris just upwind of us.\"\nScott admitted that storm chasing is not for the faint-hearted but that \"it is an experience\" and in the US it is becoming an increasingly popular attraction.\nBecause the adventurers did not know where they would end up at the end of the day, accommodation had to often be found late and in an obscure towns in the middle of nowhere\nScott, who is now safely back in Hertfordshire where the weather is rather less dramatic, added: \"That alone makes the trip more exciting as it holds an incredible depth of freedom.\"\nTornado Alley is the name of the area in the United States where tornadoes are most frequent.\nThe term was coined in 1952 as the title of a research project to study severe weather in areas of Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, South Dakota, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Nebraska, Colorado, North Dakota, and Minnesota.\nMonday 23 Jul 2018 3:44

Even with the introduction of new flights our air connections remain some of the most fragile across these isles.\n\u0026ldquoThe Smith Commission was very clear when it stated that: \u0026lsquothe power to charge tax on air passengers leaving Scottish airports will be devolved to the Scottish Parliament. The Scottish Government will be free to make its own arrangements regarding the design and collection of any replacement tax\u0026rsquo, yet, as we have seen time and time again with this Government, the arrangements on offer, limits the ability of the Scottish Government to make changes to benefit the Scottish economy.\u0026nbsp\nIn his response to the Highland MP, Mr Jenrick confirmed that his department was willing to work closer with the Scottish Government to find a solution to the problem, recognising the commitment outlined in the Smith Commission.\nResponding after the debate, Mr Hendry said: \u0026ldquoI am glad that the UK Government recognises it has failed to hand over APD in a workable way, and that Airport Departure Tax cannot be implemented by the Scottish Government without a solution to this problem.\n\u0026ldquoI hope that the assurances from Mr Jenrick today, are followed up by meaningful action from the UK Government, to enable the Scottish Government to introduce its reduced Airport Departure Tax, while protecting the Highlands and Islands exemption.\"\nMonday 23 Jul 2018 3:44 AM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/IMG_0946-e1530785665580.jpg","title":"harold davis 1933 2018 from the korean front line to footballing glory and a spot of fishing in wester","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\n\nHis surname should in fact better reflect the Wester Ross area he’s called home for almost 40 years.\n“I like that to be known up here in MacKenzie country,” he notes from his home near Badachro, on the shores of Gairloch. “My mother was Catherine MacQueen Kirk, and my father was Angus Davis, though originally he was born Angus MacKenzie. The change came when my grandmother remarried, and so then the family name became Davis.”\nFor 37 years “MacKenzie country” has been his base, and these days it’s fishing rather than football which is his passion. Yet before making the move north with wife Vi to build the Craigmore Hotel in Gairloch, Harry Davis had enjoyed a remarkable sporting life — recovering from multiple bullet wounds in the Korean War to carve out a glittering football career with Rangers.\nTalk about “dual contracts” may have loomed large over Scottish football in recent months, but here was one ex-professional who really knew what it was like to serve two paymasters.\nA native Fifer, but brought up in Perth, Harry was an emerging talent with East Fife when he signed up as part of his national service to join the Black Watch. He soon found himself in the thick of the bloody, but often forgotten, Korean War where in the midst of conflict he suffered injuries from which it would take him over two years to recover.\nRemarkably, not only did he return to full health, he resumed his football career with gusto — signing for Rangers in 1956. He would enjoy a memorable eight-year spell with the Ibrox club, winning three league titles, two league cups and a Scottish Cup, as well as playing in the first Scottish side to reach a European final.\nA fearsome defender known as the “Iron Man”, he was never one to shirk a tackle on the pitch, and he’s not afraid to offer an opinion off it either — as he documents in a compelling autobiography which recently hit the bookshelves.\nHis is a tale far removed from the anodyne offerings served up by today’s breed of pampered millionaires. Having witnessed and experienced what he did on the battlefield, it’s hardly surprising that Davis had little time for those less appreciative of their sporting talents.\nTake, for example, the Rangers and Scotland great Jim Baxter.\n“I don’t dispute Baxter’s talent — he was a class player, but he wasted it,” he says ruefully. “He got privileges no one else got and it upset a lot of players in the team. He only turned it on once every three games and for the rest of the time, when your backs were to the wall, Baxter was nowhere to be seen.”\nHe describes Willie Waddell, the man who led Rangers to their only European trophy, as a “lucky manager” who had used his position as a sportswriter to undermine predecessor David White — a man Harry Davis had returned to Ibrox to assist.\n\nIT SEEMS CLEAR that wartime experience — and the discipline and work ethic it instilled — would leave a lasting imprint on everything Harry Davis did thereafter. But, ironically, his prowess on the football field might actually have spared him from active service altogether.\nHis military call came just after he had broken into East Fife’s excellent post-war team under Scott Symon — the man who would later bring him to Ibrox. And he adds: “I had a couple of opportunities, one to be a PTI in the army, and the other to take an airborne course.\n“It was all a scam to get you to play in the army team and I turned them all down. I was quite happy to go and thought it was all a bit of an adventure.”\nThat sense of wide-eyed wonder would soon give way to the full-blooded horrors of war, as he found himself fighting off Chinese forces intent on advancing further south on the Korean peninsula.\nHe remembers that many caught in the thick of the fighting were simple conscripts — scarcely prepared for the brutality they would encounter. Indelibly marked in his memory is the image of one desperate soldier running deliberately into enemy fire and to his death.\n“He was away with the birds,” he added. “I tried to stop him, but just at that moment a shell landed on top of our trench — all the hairs on the back of my hand were singed, but we were sheltered and escaped the full impact. But by the time I got up he was off again, and disappeared.\n“I couldn’t do anything about it, but that stayed with me. You can’t blame the guy — he was just a conscript as well.\n“There was always a little bit of ill feeling in that these conscripts were shipped out to the battlefield, yet regular, more experienced soldiers from the Black Watch were left behind in Germany.”\nHarry’s contribution to the war effort ended in the spring of 1953, though to this day he has no idea where the bullets which left him wounded actually came from. Years later, a former colleague contacted him to say he believed he had been responsible.\n“I said to him it might have been him, it might not have been. Who knows? But everyone was in a state of panic, and again we go back to conscripts. I certainly wouldn’t place any blame on him.”\nThe stray bullets had caught him on the back of the foot — fracturing his heel, but mercifully just missing the Achilles tendon. Having also suffered abdominal damage, Harry Davis would spend months recuperating in a Japanese hospital before returning to the UK to continue a slow road to recovery.\nIn the far east a nursing sister from Stornoway would become something of an inspiration, but it is Harry’s biggest regret that on leaving Japan he would never see the woman again.\n“She was marvellous and encouraged me so much through all the operations, the bad nights and bad days,” he added. “I made a point that I would go and see her, and when I built the hotel up here I thought I’d be able to find her. I only knew her as Sister MacKenzie, but she was from Stornoway and I believe she had something to do with the Post Office over there.\n“But then I did hear from one source that she had died — I never got to make contact with her. It’s one of the great disappointments of my lifetime.”\nON HARRY’S RETURN HOME doctors gave him little hope of ever playing top-level football again — sometimes in fairly graphic terms.\n“One doctor at the military hospital in London told me that my only hope was that my bowels were in such a state, defenders were likely to slip on what would come out! It didn’t look very encouraging.”\nYet after being helped back to fitness by David Kinnear — a physiotherapist and former Ibrox player — Harry Davis would eventually get his career back on track.\nHe resumed action for East Fife, and in 1956 got the call from Symon to follow him to Ibrox.\nIn Glasgow, he initially learned the ropes in the reserve side — one of his memorable early encounters bringing him into direct contact with the Celtic legend Charlie Tully, who by this time was at the opposite stage of his career.\nBefore too long Davis would join a first-team pool that included vintage names likes George Young, George Niven, Sammy Baird and Alex Scott, and Rangers lifted the league at the end of his first full season in 1957.\nIn something of a golden era for the Scottish game, Davis regularly played in front of crowds topping the 100,000 mark, and he remembers a vibrant and competitive league where in his first few years the main challenge came from a Hearts team which claimed two league titles.\n“If we had fewer than 40,000 at a game it was a disaster,” he said. “But regularly the crowds were 60-70,000 and for big games the 100,000-mark wasn’t unusual.”\nA degree of European success followed, as Rangers reached the European Cup Winners Cup Final in 1961. There they would be outclassed by a fine Fiorentina side, and tellingly Harry feels the Scots simply refused to heed their continental lesson. Half a century on, and the same basic mistakes continue to be made.\n“They were ahead of us,” he said. “Scott Symon was a great manager, no question, but he didn’t keep up with modern techniques. He still said get the ball to the winger, get the winger up the field and cross it and get the centre forward to head it into the net. That worked in the old days, but it didn’t work when you played these continental teams.”\nAfter winding down his playing career with a season at Partick Thistle, Harry took the manager’s job at the grand old institution of Queens Park. It was a time he enjoyed immensely, though the lure of Ibrox once again tempted him back across the city — this time to hook up with White.\nThat spell in the dugout was to prove less successful than his playing days, with Rangers then in the shadow of Jock Stein’s great Celtic side. Yet some redemption would arrive at Dundee where White and Davis led the Dens Park club to a memorable league cup final triumph over Celtic in 1973. A few months later the pair gained revenge over their old nemesis Waddell, dumping Rangers out of the Scottish Cup at Ibrox.\nDundee would prove to be Harry’s last staging post in football — and thereafter he set his sights on the quiet life in the north west Highlands.\nTHESE DAYS his football involvement is limited to appearing alongside former team-mates at charity fundraisers for the Erskine Trust, for which he is also to donate most of the proceeds from his book. However, he still keeps one eye on developments at Ibrox, even if he struggles to comprehend the team’s recent high-profile fall from grace.\n“The honest answer is that I just don’t know what to make of it all,” he said. “One conclusion is reached one week, and a week later it’s turned around again. But I do believe a number of teams were quite happy to get rid of them because they were strong competition. I don’t think that was right.”\nAsked for his personal highlights in the game, his answer is a simple one.  He just reels off a list of the players he played with, and it reads like a who’s who of greats for fans of the Ibrox club.\n“I joined Rangers and played with George Young, George Niven, Baird, Billy Simpson, Bobby Shearer, Alex Scott, Jim McColl — a great team. And then by the end I had also played with John Greig, Ronnie MacKinnon, Ian MacMillan, Millar, Brand, Baxter and Wilson. How many people can say that?”\nA Scotland cap may have proved elusive — “in those days they only picked 11” — with a place on the reserve list as close as he got to pulling on the dark blue.\nNevertheless, Harry Davis had long since proved his mettle on the international stage — and he still has the scars to prove it.\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/7s.jpg","title":"comhairle must replace barra housing","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nComhairle nan Eilean Siar must replace land they gave away for housing in Castlebay, Barra, because it was meant to be kept in perpetuity for recreational use.\nLast month, Housing Minister Kevin Stewart cut the turf on the Corran Ciosmul development at Horve. However, the six houses are to be built on what was a King George V Playing Field, which was set aside and protected in 1962.\nFor anyone to build on this land they must notify and obtain the consent of Fields in Trust, a charity that acts to protect all KGV land. Even though the comhairle took over the management of the land in 1984 they must still obtain the trust’s consent.\nThe Barra Sports Forum have been pressing the comhairle for years to transfer a piece of derelict land near the Co-op, which is adjacent to the KGV area, for use as an all-weather pitch.\nA spokesman said: “The sports forum urge the comhairle to fulfil their legal and moral obligations to the people of Barra and Vatersay to protect the sports and recreation land in Horve by righting this wrong: firstly, by filing for a change of land use to Fields in Trust from ‘sports and recreation’ to ‘housing’ and secondly, by transferring an equivalent area of land to the KGV playing field in compensation for land lost to housing. Only by doing this will the comhairle avoid the danger of stalling the desperately needed new housing that helps secure the future of our islands.”\nRichard McKeever of Fields in Trust the charity recognised that that “sometimes it may be necessary” to change the use of recreational land.\nHe added: “As part of our protection, we have a responsibility to ensure the local owners and managers of these spaces seek our consent to undertake any changes regarding land ownership, land transactions, erection of buildings and structures \u0026#8211 and that proposed changes fit with the purpose of the protected space and benefit its recreational use. We are currently in constructive dialogue with the council and await their proposals for replacement recreational land of an equal or better standard which will be protected for the local community to enjoy in perpetuity.”\nThe housing development at Corran Ciosmul is being undertaken by the Hebridean Housing Partnership, which has owned the land since 2006.\nKatrina Rowlands, HHP development manager, said: “Due to the nature of how the titles were transferred to HHP, the burden in relation to the Fields in Trust was not recorded therefore the responsibility to meet the Fields in Trust conditions remains with the comhairle. We are aware that the comhairle’s legal team are in discussions with Fields In Trust to resolve the matter.”\nA spokesman for the comhairle said discussion with Fields in Trust were continuing.\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/001WH0607NCA.jpg","title":"top four prepare to lock horns in ross cup","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nThe top four teams in the Skye and Lochalsh League will meet this weekend with two places in the Ross Cup Final up for grabs.\nLast season\u0026#8217s league champions Kyleakin will travel to Broadford to play Sleat and Strath, while Mallaig host Portree Juniors in the early kick-off.\n\n In what is their debut season in the Skye and Lochalsh Football Association, Mallaig have made a marked impression in the league \u0026#8211  where they currently sit fourth \u0026#8211 and in the associated cup competitions \u0026#8211 in which they are seeking to reach their second final today.\nWith six wins from their eight league fixtures so far, the Lochaber side are keeping pace with the top teams in the league.

The blues, however, will be keen to avoid a repeat of their performance in the final which saw Kyleakin run out 4-1 winners in a disappointing and underwhelming showing by Mallaig.\n\n \u0026#8220Another tough game for us, but it’s the type of games we wanted to be involved in at the start of the season. We now have a great opportunity to make a second cup final this season.\n\u0026#8220The season, in general, has been a learning experience but a very enjoyable one.

It’s good to be back playing at home especially in such a big game, especially after being away for so long\n\u0026nbsp\nWith four wins from their last five matches in all competitions, and 37 goals scored in the process, Juniors have really hit their stride and will approach their third meeting with Mallaig with great confidence.\nNow just four points point off leaders Sleat and Strath with one game in hand, Phil McCaherty will hope his team can transmit their impressive league form into today\u0026#8217s cup match against the only side who have beaten them domestically this season.\nWhile Juniors\u0026#8217 recent free-scoring display will have given Mallaig some food for thought in their preparations for the match, the Portree side must avoid the lapses in concentration which cost them in their heavy defeats at home against Mallaig in the league and Loch Ness in the Highland Amateur Cup.\n\nIt\u0026#8217s a tough task for us away to Mallaig who have beaten us twice already 5-2 and 6-0. We are going with the same squad (minus Angie MacPherson and Paul MacKinnon) that played GA United in last round, with Nick Flanagan added for goalkeeping duties to free up backup goalie Will Brown to his normal defensive duties. I am hoping that David Potter doesn\u0026#8217t get lost this week!\u0026#8221\n\nIt\u0026#8217s been a fantastic season so far for the Broadford-based side who are the current league leaders, joint top scorers, and have the meanest defence to boot.\nWith an average of 5.2 goals a game in the league, Sleat and Strath have developed a ruthlessness in front of goal and appeared to have a strong belief when they take to the pitch that they can beat any team whether it be at home or away. Their most recent win in which they turned a 3-0 lead at half-time into an emphatic 12-0 victory in last week\u0026#8217s quarter-final tie against much-improved Glenelg is evidence they have the weapons to transform a tight match into a comfortable victory.\nHaving put in impressive defensive displays against both Kyleakin and Portree Juniors in the league, DL MacKinnon\u0026#8217s team have proven they can stand firm when required against tough opponents. That said, he will still be mindful of his side\u0026#8217s loss in their last semi-final encounter against Mallaig \u0026#8211 in what has been their only defeat so far this season \u0026#8211  and will be keen to avoid missing out on a second final.\n\n \u0026#8220It\u0026#8217s going to be a battle at our tight pitch. Key to the result will be our ability to defend set plays, which is not our strong point as we are a very small team. If we can keep Gordy (Mccarroll) and Innis (Thompson) quiet we will hopefully cause them problems with our pace.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\nWith Sleat and Strath having burst out of the blocks in the league and new boys Mallaig also making their mark, it is perhaps easy to overlook the fact that Kyleakin is not only very much in contention for the league title but have already won a piece of silverware this season with a convincing victory over Mallaig in the GF MacRae Cup.\nWith 22 goals in their last three matches, which included their 10-2 quarter-final win over Kyle, the reigning league champions know how to win games, and ultimately trophies. As well as being well-deserved, their 4-1 victory in the GF MacRae Cup Final against Mallaig was a superb example of game-management against difficult opponents on a big occasion.\nAlthough Kyleakin have put themselves in a good position to challenge on all fronts, they will have to address their inconsistency this season which has seen them held to draws recently by Glenelg and GA United.\nWith back-to-back matches coming up against Sleat and Strath in the cup, then the league, the reigning champions will look to draw on their past successes in the big games.\nBy Adam Gordon\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/web-ad-sales.jpg","title":"recruitment highlighted as a priority at first emergency services","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\nRepresentatives of all the emergency services on Skye held their first ever partnership meeting in Broadford last week to discuss how they can support each other.\nPictured (left to right) are Dave Philips from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, Nick Mort from the British Red Cross, Station Manager Mike Colliar from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, Sgt Andrew Shaw from Police Scotland, Neil Urquhart from Skye Mountain Rescue, Inspector Lynda Allan from Police Scotland, Area Service Manager Alan Knox of Scottish Ambulance Service.

We are so very proud of her for being so strong and powering through this whole thing so far.\n  \n“This is by no means the end of Zoe\u0027s journey as she still has a lot of issues to deal with from the tumour, but it is the end of this part of her treatment which will hopefully do its job and stop anymore regrowth.\n  \n“At the end of treatment in Jacksonville every patient gets the chance to ring the bell (or chime) and it is so lovely to watch.”\n  \nIn her graduation speech Zoe said: “I would like to thank my amazing family, I am so grateful that they have supported me through my journey.”\n  \nShe also thanked the staff of the centre and everyone at home for all their support.\n  \nOver the last few months the local community has been rallying together to raise funds for Zoe and her family. \n  \n Michelle commented: “We can\u0027t thank everyone enough from family, friends, complete strangers, schools and local businesses for all their amazing love and support.\n  \n“Zoe still has a long way to go but with everyone behind her we know our girl will be ok. She has been a tower of strength since her diagnosis and during her time in America and we are so very proud of her.”\n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_866187.jpg--.jpg?1531813044000\n","title":"kittens get new home after being found by passer by","story":"  \nFOUR kittens have been rehomed after they were dumped at the side of the road in Portglenone.\n  \nThe black and white kittens were found in a box behind a hedge by good samaritan, Darren McFetridge.\n  \nDarren had been out on Thursday evening (July 5) walking his dogs around 7pm in Portglenone Forest.\n  \nHe went into the forest with his two dogs and around half an hour later when he was returning to his car he saw two of the kittens wandering around the road.\n  \nSpeaking to the , Darren said he immediately started looking for more kittens.\n  \nOn closer inspection he found two more kittens in a box behind the hedge.\n  \nThe cardboard box they were in seemed fresh as if it hadn\u0027t been there that long, Darren explained.\n  \n\n  \nDumped\n  \n\n  \nI think whoever dumped the kittens has possibly done it in the time that I was in the forest because I would have noticed them on my way in.\n  \nI think it is really sad that people will do this to poor, defenceless animals. \n  \nIt would have taken the person five minutes to bring them to a vets and they would have been rehomed without a shadow of a doubt.\n  \nDespite the kittens being left at the spot on the Gortgole Road they appeared to have been unharmed and \u0027perfectly healthy\u0027.\n  \nDarren waited on a friend to come and meet him where he found the kittens so they could transport them to Parklands Vets.\n  \n\n  \nRehomed\n  \n\n  \nThe vets confirmed to the Ballymena  that all four kittens were rehomed by the following morning.\n  \nA staff member at the vets said: All the kittens were perfectly healthy and they have now gone to a good home.\n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_866293.jpg--.jpg?1531813307000\n","title":"ballymena nursery gets a gold star report","story":"  \n BALLYMENA Nursery School has received a glowing report by the Education and Training Inspectorate (Eti).\n  \nThe report gave the nursery school the highest award for overall effectiveness with “a high level of capacity for sustained improvement”.\n  \nIt follows an inspection of the nurserys at Trostan Avenue, Ballymena which was carried out on April 26.\n  \nIn the report the inspectors commented that the nursery school leadership “understand fully the changing needs of the children and wider community”.\n  \nJust last year the nursery school celebrated its 50th anniversary with a community party.\n  \nAs it sits on the site where Ballymena Castle once stood, the celebrations involved a “castle theme” with knights, princesses, court jesters, balloon modelling and face painting.\n  \nThe inspectors also commented that parent\u0027s written comments “praised the staff\u0027s dedicated professionalism and care in meeting the children\u0027s individual needs” and highlighted the nursery\u0027s positive reputation within and contribution to the community.\n  \nThe staff comments “endorsed the supportive and productive working relationships at all levels and the caring and positive strategic leadership of the principal”.\n  \nThe inspectors reported that both indoors and outdoors, the staff provide a “stimulating, richly resourced and well organised learning environment the wide range of authentic and natural resources and displays are easily accessed by the children to progress their self-reliance and to promote their active interest”.\n  \nThe inspectors also commented: “The children\u0027s personal, social and emotional development is a key strength.
