It has also been switched from law to guidance in Northern Ireland.However, people are still required to isolate for at least one week in Scotland and six days in Wales. Outside of the UK, isolation duration periods vary from four days in Norway to 10 days in Germany. Dr Irwin-Knoester said a seven-day isolation period \u0027should be safe\u0027 in almost all cases, but five days \u0027strikes an acceptable balance\u0027 between the infectiousness of the virus and the desire to get back to normal.Dr Irwin-Knoester is expected to tell the European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases: \u0027The decisions being made by different countries around the world to shorten the period of isolation for Omicron infections are partly based on evidence from modelling.\u0027And she noted the move also takes account \u0027of the fact that Omicron is causing less severe disease, and fewer hospitalisations and deaths\u0027.She said: \u0027It is a way of returning to something like normal life and accept transmission of this less dangerous Omicron variant.\u0027From the evidence so far, I am not convinced that a person is likely to be infectious for a shorter period of time with Omicron as they would have been with previous variants.\u0027Dr Irwin-Knoester said a maximum of seven days isolation \u0027should be safe in almost all cases of infection\u0027.But a five-day isolation period \u0027strikes an acceptable balance between the infectiousness of the virus and what most communities are willing to accept going forward, especially after around two years of restrictions in many cases\u0027, she added.However, Dr Irwin-Knoester noted that people still suffering from respiratory symptoms, such as coughing and sneezing, after seven days should continue to isolate for 10 to 14 days.And those severely unwell with the virus often \u0027shed for longer\u0027, while immunocompromised people can transmit the virus for months.Dr Irwin-Knoester also warned that a new variant \u0027could throw everything up in the air\u0027, especially if it causes more serious illness or escapes the protection offered by Covid vaccines. \u0027If it is a new variant that makes us seriously ill, I would recommend returning to longer periods of isolation – with seven days as a minimum,\u0027 she added.In England, the legal requirement to self-isolate after testing positive came to an end on February 24, although people are still advised to do so. The requirement to wear face masks also came to an end on that date, while free tests are being scrapped from April 1.           "},{"url":null,"title":"Countries queuing trade deals UK says Minister","story":"Share this article ‘We do ourselves down, the rest of the world thinks the UK is amazing and they want to work with a trusted partner.’The minister, whose ancestors moved from the Isle of Mull in Scotland to Canada where her father was born, will wear a suit she has made herself from her family’s ancient hunting tartan.‘It\u0027ll just be lovely to be the person who moves us into that next stage,’ she said.Mrs Trevelyan, who has nicknamed the new deal ‘Canada 2.0’, said the continuity trade agreement rolled over from Britain’s member of the EU was ‘quite old fashioned’ and ‘not really very digital trade focused’.‘This is an opportunity to take it to a much, much higher level,’ she added. ‘Looking at things like digital trade, which is such an important area.By removing red tape, Mrs Trevelyan said the agreement would help ‘strip away costs for the consumer’ and ‘strip away cost and effort for business’.British officials believe thousands of smaller firms will be encouraged to start trading with Canada if barriers can be removed, such as by simplifying paperworkMrs Trevelyan said the new agreement would open access for British firms to Canadian government procurement contracts, which will be ‘really big business for some of our really important construction and industrial service partners’.‘There\u0027ll be some really chunky stuff in there to discuss, which will be good and they\u0027re really up for it, she continued.‘That\u0027s why they\u0027re top of my pile because they\u0027ve really leaned in and said we want to move to the next phase.

This latest cost of living squeeze comes hours before Rishi Sunak presents his spring statement - likely to be a mini-budget as the chancellor prepares a fresh package of measures to mitigate some of the inflationary pain. Sunak will expected to promise ‘security for working families’, and also tell MPs that a strong economy is vital in tackling Moscow’s aggression. He’s expected to say: Sunak has several options on the table. A cut in petrol duty seems likely, perhaps by 5p per litre, to ease some of the surge in fuel costs. There have been calls to postpone next month’s 1.25 percentage point rise in national insurance, introduced to fund health and social care. Another option is to lift the threshold at which national insurance kicks in. It’s currently set to rise to £9,900 from April, rather lower than the income tax personal allowance of £12,570. The chancellor has also been urged to lift benefits to help poorer families and pensioners cope with the looming surge in inflation. Sunak could also expand the £9bn package of energy support announced last month. Yesterday’s public finances showed the government has borrowed around £26bn less than forecast this financial year, with tax revenues £37bn higher. That gives some headroom for Sunak to intervene in the cost of living crisis. But rising inflation pushed up debt repayment costs, meaning February’s deficit came in at £13.1bn, ahead of forecasts of £8.1bn.Rising prices and the shock of the Ukraine war means the economic outlook is weaker, and more troubling.  It could mean higher-than-hoped borrowing, slower growth, higher inflation and higher interest rates in the next few years. As Mujtaba Rahman, managing director, Europe, at Eurasia Group put it: The Russian president said during a televised meeting with top government ministers: The legislation will need to be approved by EU countries and the European Parliament and traders said the target will be tough to meet, even in periods when demand is lower.Professor Jason Chuah, professor of commercial and maritime law at The City Law School, and Mick Lynch, general secretary of the RMT union, will form part of the packed schedule. Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist of CFRA Research in New York, told Reuters the main factors were: The move affects the vast majority of products manufactured by the Swiss company in Russia, with the exception of baby milk and some basic pet food.  The world’s top consumer goods firm was among the companies the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy called out last weekend for staying in Russia after its invasion of Ukraine. He accused Nestlé of not living up to its “Good Food, Good Life” slogan. The brands being suspended by the Swiss company make up the vast majority of its sales in Russia, worth 1.7bn Swiss francs last year. Production there has also been halted. The company had already paused non-essential exports to and imports from Russia on Monday, stopped all advertising, and suspended capital investment. It also said it was not making a profit in Russia. Nestlé said it would continue to pay its Russian employees. More than 400 companies have withdrawn from Russia since the launch of its attack on Ukraine on 24 February. Nestlé said it would continue to provide basic items for nutrition and hygiene, such as milk and nappies. Other consumer goods companies such as Unilever and Procter \u0026amp Gamble are also still selling essential products in Russia. If found guilty, the company faces fines running into millions of pounds, Johnson added. Johnson also told MPs that the government will close a loophole in legislation which allows some seafarers to be paid less than the minimum wage, and ensure everyone working in the UK exclusive economic zone is paid the living wage. Labour leader Keir Starmer says that is what Johnson promised two years ago. More here. It’s a packed schedule, with the Nautilus seafarers union, the Insolvency Service, and ministers among those appearing as witnesses. Further witnesses may be added to the list too.We’re tracking it all here in the Politics Liveblog: Sunak’s speech starts at 12.30pm, after prime minister’s questions, underway now. But he’s also insisting that dismissing the staff, and replacing them with cheaper agency workers, was necessary to save the company. Last night, P\u0026ampO said it was paying £36.5m to cover compensation for the 800 seafarers it sacked without warning, saying this settlement would be the “largest compensation package in the British marine sector”. The FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares is hovering around its levels before the Ukraine invasion began last month. It’s up 13 points at 7,489 points, having rallied over the last two weeks. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, says: Written evidence given to the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee by industry regulator Ofgem showed that energy providers could receive up to £2.4bn for taking on the customers of firms that have collapsed since 2021.  That money would be paid under Ofgem’s supplier of last resort (SoLR) regime, under which the customers of collapsed providers are moved to other firms  It is then recovered through bills charged to all UK consumers - which would imply almost £100 added to household bills. Gillian Cooper, Head of Energy Policy at Citizens Advice, told the committee: My colleague Nils Pratley covered the issue last December: According to the latest snapshot, soaring inflationary pressure was fuelled by rising costs for gas and electricity, as well as average petrol and diesel prices hitting record highs in a blow to motorists. Prices for clothing, footwear, furniture and flooring all rose after the end of the traditional January sales on the high street, reversing a trend from a year earlier when prices dropped during the third nationwide Covid lockdown when many shops were forced to close. It’s the largest annual growth rate since December 2016. In the travel sector, cruise operator Saga has reported that demand for its tour packages remained below pre-pandemic levels. The over-50s cruise and insurance business also cautioned that the war in Ukraine may also reduce travel bookings in the short term, and add to inflationary pressures. Pre-tax loss narrowed over the last year, from £61.2m to £23.5m in 2020, as Saga resumed trips after the pandemic disruption.

Photograph: EPAAndy RainMPs at Westminster voted on Tuesday night to reinstate the requirement for a US-style visa waiver for non-Irish EU citizens crossing the Border as part of proposed new British immigration laws.A majority of 298 MPs to 216 voted to back the UK government’s challenge to an amendment introduced in the House of Lords, which would have exempted Northern Ireland from the legislation.The human rights NGO the Committee on the Administration of Justice (CAJ) condemned the move, which it said was “unworkable and risks a hard border for many non-British and non-Irish citizens in Border communities who have been able to freely cross the Border to date”.The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Simon Coveney, said the decision was “regrettable” and “contrary to the approach that UK and Irish governments have supported for many years to protect free movement on the island of everyone.“Our concern on this has been communicated clearly but has been ignored.”Responding to Mr Coveney’s tweet on social media, the Northern Secretary, Brandon Lewis, said there would be “no controls on the Border.“UK and Irish citizens will continue to be able to travel freely. This new ETA requirement is about protecting the Common Travel Area from abuse.“Our commitment to the Common Travel Area is absolute, as seen throughout the pandemic,” he said.Under the Nationalities and Borders Bill, EU citizens who are not Irish will be required to apply online for pre-travel clearance –known as Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) –before entering the UK, including when crossing the Border into Northern Ireland.It will also apply to citizens of the European Economic Area (EEA) living in the State, which includes people from Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland.Non-British or non-Irish citizens from other countries, outside the EUEEA, which previously did not require a visa to enter the UK, will now need an ETA.The Bill is part of a wider, post-Brexit overhaul of the UK’s immigration laws and includes provisions on asylum seekers, nationality and immigration control.The amendment on Northern Ireland was one of a number of changes made to the Bill in the House of Lords which were overturned by a Commons vote on Tuesday. The Bill will now return to the Lords.The oppositionSpeaking in favour of the amendment during the debate, the Alliance MP Stephen Farry said the ETA was “essentially unworkable in the context of the island of Ireland” and urged the UK government to listen to the opposition of their Irish counterparts and to the “considerable concern” about it in Northern Ireland.He said current movements on the island of Ireland were “not a threat to UK security” but it could place people who previously enjoyed freedom of movement across the Border in “legal jeopardy”.It could also affect cross-Border tourism, he said, and with ten of thousands of cross-Border journeys taking place every day, it “could become fairly absurd” in Border areas where roads cross both jurisdictions.The Conservative MP Tom Pursglove said the UK government was clear there would be “no controls on the Border between Northern Ireland and Ireland”.However, he said exempting the Border from the ETA requirement could result in “an unacceptable gap in UK border security” and that it was important “all iniduals, except British and Irish citizens . . . continue to enter in line with the UK’s immigration framework to protect both the UK immigration system and the common travel area from abuse”.Mr Pursglove said the UK was “entitled to introduce and change its own requirements in the interest of securing the UK border” and would continue to liaise with authorities in Dublin on issues of border security in relation to the Common Travel Area.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"british and irish relationship should be based on equal respect says starmer","story":"Labour leader Keir Starmer speaks to the Labour Party Irish Society Annual St Patrick’s Day reception at the London Irish Centre. Photograph: Stefan RousseauPA WireBritish Labour party leader Keir Starmer has called for a relationship between Britain and Ireland based on equal respect that acknowledges both governments’ roles as co-guarantors of the Belfast Agreement rather than simply consultees.He said the relationship had been dominated by Brexit in recent years but it had a rich and long history that was bigger than the current dispute over the Northern Ireland protocol.“And I felt they were some of the most uplifting years in my working life because there was so much progress going on, so much change going on. You could feel it, you could see it, you could sense it when you were there. And that has given me a really strong sense of the importance of that partnership.“The relationship requires respect, equal respect and understanding of what it means to be a country and to have that status, that friendship, that relationship and that respect.”Mr Starmer was speaking at the Labour Party Irish Society’s St Patrick’s Day reception at the London Irish Centre in Camden, which is in his constituency of of Holborn and St Pancras. Other speakers included Trade Union Congress (TUC) general secretary Frances O’Grady, Labour MP Conor McGinn, who chairs Westminster All-Party Parliamentary Group on the Irish in Britain and Adrian O’Neill, Ireland’s ambassador to Britain.Mr O’Neill said that this year’s St Patrick’s Day events in London had been conceived as a celebratory return to personal contact after two years of the coronavirus pandemic but they had been overshadowed by the war in Ukraine.“To some extent, we have to kind of dial it down a little bit or at least recognise that while we are enjoying this opportunity to meet in person and celebrate all the things that we really cherish, our democracy, our human rights, our independence, sovereignty, all of those core values that they are absolutely now being trampled on in Ukraine,” he said.“In Ireland, we’re working very, very closely with the UK, with the US with like-minded partners in the Security Council of the UN, within the EU, the Human Rights Council in Geneva, the International Criminal Court, using all the mechanisms at our disposal to isolate and increase pressure on Putin and his regime.”"},{"url":null,"title":"healy rae says no apology due to varadkar over airy fairies remark","story":" Michael Healy-Rae TD was criticised by Leo Varadkar over his use of language. Photograph: Tom Honan The .Kerry TD Michael Healy-Rae says he will not be apologising to Tánaiste Leo Varadkar for telling him to go off “to the airy fairies” during a Dáil debate.However, Mr Healy-Rae said he would not be saying sorry and suggested the Tánaiste was deflecting attention from issues he had been raising in the Dáil on Tuesday around the development of a liquid natural gas facility in North Kerry.Speaking on RTÉ Radio Liveline programme, the Kerry TD was asked about his use of “airy fairies” during the exchanges.“Any time I’ve ever used it I have used it to describe something that I would consider to be nonsensical,” Mr Healy-Rae replied.“I would never set out to offend or upset anyone and the Tánaiste knows that.”Mr Healy-Rae said that in his opinion “she got it wrong.”Asked further if he would apologise, the Independent TD responded: “I can’t apologise when there is nothing to apologise for.”Mr Healy-Rae said it was not a clumsy use of the phrase. If it had been the first time he had used the expression, that would be a different story, he said. The whole argument was “lopsided”.Dyslexia The Kerry TD argued that the fact that he had dyslexia could have been used as grounds to take offence at some of Mr Varadkar’s comments, suggesting the Tánaiste had spoken down to him.The Tánaiste “in his heart and soul” knew that Mr Healy-Rae would not abuse a person about their personal life which was “nothing to do with me”.He “absolutely 100 percent supported gay rights” and dealt with issues facing gay constituents on a regular basis. If anyone asked him for help, he did so, he said, and it was unfair to try to make something out of it.When asked if he thought Mr Varadkar had been brave when he came out in 2015, Mr Healy-Rae said that it was “entirely his own business”.The Kerry TD said he had not been involved in campaigning on either side of the marriage equality referendum in 2015, but acknowledged that he had not voted in favour of the referendum.“I did not set out to hinder anyone, they can do what they want. Why would I be against anyone for being gay? It’s their business, not anyone else’s business.”At a press conference on Wednesday morning, prior to Mr Healy-Rae’s remarks on Liveline, Mr Varadkar said he did not ask for an apology from the Kerry TD.He said of their Dáil interaction: “He said what he said. I said what I said. I have certainly haven’t lost any sleep about it. “I just asked him to reflect on it. I didn’t ask him to apologise.”Mr Varadkar added: “I think the truth is all of us from time to time can say things that might be racist, homophobic or misogynistic or misandristic. “That can happen and I think that when it’s called out people should acknowledge it. But, you know… I’m not a fan of pile-ons or cancel culture either.”Put to him that Mr Varadkar was saying Mr Healy-Rae’s remarks were homophobic Mr Varadkar replied: “Look I’m not... I’m saying what I said. That’s all I’m saying.” "},{"url":null,"title":"no food and fuel shortages predicted but government expects higher prices","story":"Empty supermarket shelves, London. he Russian invasion of Ukraine is not expected to result in food shortages in Ireland in the coming months. Photograph: Frank AugsteinAP PhotoThe Russian invasion of Ukraine is not expected to result in food shortages in Ireland in the coming months but the Government is anticipating price increases.Tánaiste Leo Varadkar said it probably will be the case that there might be higher food prices and some products may not be available but shortages are “not modelled, predicted or expected”.He also said the Government is not expecting fuel shortages and but that further action to help people with the high cost of energy would have to be at a European level.It comes as inflation in the Irish economy is expected to surge to 8.5 per cent or even higher in the coming months.Mr Varadkar was asked what he could say to allay fears about the cost of living.He said: “There can be no doubt that inflation and the cost of living crisis is really affecting people, whether it’s households or businesses, particularly those on low income struggling to make ends meet.”He pointed to €1 billion set aside by Government to help with the cost of living including the increase in the fuel allowance, €200 deduction from the electricity bills and cut in excise on petrol and diesel.‘Significant interventions’Mr Varadkar said: “These are very significant interventions but the truth is, all we can do as a government is ease the pain and mitigate the effect of rising prices. “The underlying factors that are driving it unfortunately are international and are largely beyond our control.”There have been calls from the Opposition and lobby groups for a cut in the VAT rate on fuel, a move the Government has resisted out of concern at losing a derogation for the current Irish rate from the EU.Asked if a VAT cut could happen Mr Varadkar said: “I think any further actions like reduction in VAT would have to be something that we do on a European level.“We’ve already reduced excise considerably and I think that has helped to mitigate the increase in the price of petrol, the price of diesel.”On whether he expects the issue to come up at this week’s European Council meeting he said there will certainly be discussion about further action that the European Union could take to reduce the cost of energy and fuel and electricity in particular.The Fine Gael leader was speaking at the launch of a planned new Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI) Education and

If you back the Nationality and Borders Bill, Mr Farron told the Commons, “you are voting for deaths in the Channel!” - and though Andrew Mitchell, leader of a doomed Conservative rebellion, didn\u0027t go that far, he agreed it was unkind and expensive.Rather than processing refugees in Albania, he said, it would be cheaper to “house them at the Ritz and send the under-18s to Eton”. And wouldn\u0027t that mess with the Left\u0027s head? They might think twice about open borders if the children were groomed to become the next Tory prime minister.To defend this “utterly obscene” piece of legislation (to quote a one-star review by the SNP), the Government sent in the lovely but unexciting Thomas Pursglove. As the MP for Corby, land of the trouser press, rattled through the 54 amendments sent by the Lords in a tone that sounded, perversely, like he was enjoying himself, Mitchell wandered the backbenches trying to foment a mutiny among those still awake - before plopping down insolently in the middle of the Chamber, waggling his red socked-foot provocatively like a red rag to a Bill.Pursglove finished. The rebellion began, an orgy of cross-bench agreement that Tory liberals and opposition socialists pretended to find surprising, but they\u0027re always of one mind on borders. Let asylum seekers work, said John McDonnell (that way he can tax \u0027em, the crafty old commie). Process them in the UK, said David Davis, where it is humane. Australia tried offshoring, said the SNP, and it didn\u0027t work. Oh yes it did, said Thomas Hunt of Ipswich, noting that the number of those dying at sea fell. Oh no it didn\u0027t, said Double-D, claiming that the scheme was judged costly and dangerous, adding that, in his view, what actually made a difference was “pushing back” the refugees - a policy the Left thinks is tantamount to murder.So, what are we supposed to do?When someone knocks on your door, say the wets, and begs for help, you don\u0027t turn them away. Amen. But if they pay a thug to break in via a downstairs window, says the Government, you\u0027ve a right to complain.We need “control!” barked Sir John Hayes: yes to safe routes, no to the illegal. But while this Bill clamps down on criminals, it doesn\u0027t actually provide for new safe routes, which is akin to sticking a sign on your lawn that reads “All Welcome!”, while covering the garden path with mines and barbed wire.Mitchell noted that over 80 per cent of those entering Britain “illicitly” in 2021 came from countries that have no legal route. They\u0027re not dodging the forms. They\u0027re rolling the dice.The amendments were defeated, and the Government will be labelled heartless for trying to enforce the law, which is its basic job. “Disraeli observed,” said Sir John, “that it is easier to be critical than correct”. How true. But if only the correct course of action, namely protecting the border, didn\u0027t leave one feeling just a little bit crummy.More from News\u0026#39Chlorine gas leak\u0026#39 at Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park sees 29 hospitalisedRussia-Ukraine latest news: Nato vows to support Ukraine against \u0026#39chemical, biological and nuclear\u0026#39 attacks Spring Statement latest news: National Insurance increase should be \u0026#39scrapped in its entirety\u0026#39, say Tory MPsSir David Amess murder trial live: ‘He wasn’t like \u0026#34Oh my God\u0026#34, he was like \u0026#34I’ve done it, I’ve achieved something\u0026#34’, says witness of attackerWinners and losers from the Spring Statement 2022 – and what it means for your moneyNorthern Ireland Protocol in way of measures to ease cost-of-living crisis, says Rishi SunakMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"incident declared olympic park release gas results number casualties1","story":"People being treated by paramedics and wrapped in foil blankets as multiple ambulances attendNearly 30 people have been hospitalised after a high quantity of chlorine gas leaked at the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park.Darren Farmer, London Ambulance Service gold commander, said: This morning we responded to a major incident at the London Aquatic Centre in Stratford, alongside colleagues from the London Fire Brigade and politan Police.Our crews took 29 patients to hospital and assessed a further 48 patients at the scene.

Threshold changes to National Insurance. Cuts to income tax. Cuts to VAT. He was chucking sweeties about like an entertainer at a children’s party. But did any of it make any fiscal sense? Not really. The key fiscal backdrops here are the recovery of the economy after Covid and the implications of inflation. High inflation means higher VAT receipts, potentially higher income tax and NI take, etc. On the flip side, higher inflation means that spending plans already announced are smaller relative to the inflating economy and the burden of our accumulated old debt pile is lightening. The combination of these was always going to mean Sunak had some room.He could have used that room to eliminate the deficit faster. He could have tried to use fiscal tools to get inflation down quicker. But he chose to prioritise some high-profile tax cuts.And the tax priorities were politically-charged. Income tax rate down just ahead of the election. NI thresholds up to match income tax thresholds. VAT on energy improvements to houses outside Northern Ireland cut to 0 per cent (reminding us of how taxes can be different now because of Brexit, but not where the Protocol applies). But no changes to the Social Care Levy (which will proceed) and no changes to the Corporation Tax rises (still scheduled for a big leap from 19 per cent to 25 per cent from April 2023).Cutting the basic rate of income tax allowed Sunak to be the first Chancellor to do that since Adam was a lad. But I don’t see why it makes any sense as a policy. The basic rate of income tax applies to those earning above a threshold and applies at a certain rate. But it would be better if fewer people paid it and the rate they paid was a little higher. The structure Nigel Lawson established, with a 25 per cent basic rate and a 40 per cent higher rate was the perfect one and there was never a good reason to change it. We should just have modified the thresholds.Presumably the challenge for Sunak was that he wanted to be an income-tax-cutting chancellor, but since he’d just raised NI thresholds to equalise them with the income tax threshold, it would be a bit of a problem to announce decoupling them immediately via a basic rate threshold cut. There’s no good reason for the income tax and NI thresholds to be the same unless the aim is to abolish NI and fuse it with income tax. But we are where we are with that.More importantly, Sunak doesn’t have a strategy for getting inflation down. He just wants to leave that as a Bank of England responsibility. But it isn’t. He sets the target and decides what the toleration is around it and how it’s enforced. The Bank just does what he instructs them to do. He can’t pretend it’s nothing to do with him.Second, he doesn’t seem to have a plan for containing public spending growth other than via inflation. Maybe he doesn’t need one, for now, given how high inflation is. But if it starts to come down he may have a problem.Sunak appears today as a rather old-fashioned sort of Chancellor, whose popularity is based on his beneficence. But, like others, one day he may run out of other people’s money to give away.More from News\u0026#39Chlorine gas leak\u0026#39 at Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park sees 29 hospitalisedRussia-Ukraine latest news: Nato vows to support Ukraine against \u0026#39chemical, biological and nuclear\u0026#39 attacks Spring Statement latest news: National Insurance increase should be \u0026#39scrapped in its entirety\u0026#39, say Tory MPsSir David Amess murder trial live: ‘He wasn’t like \u0026#34Oh my God\u0026#34, he was like \u0026#34I’ve done it, I’ve achieved something\u0026#34’, says witness of attackerWinners and losers from the Spring Statement 2022 – and what it means for your moneyNorthern Ireland Protocol in way of measures to ease cost-of-living crisis, says Rishi SunakMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"tobias rustat jesus college cambridge slavery cancel culture","story":"A Cambridge University college has lost a legal bid to remove from its chapel a memorial to a benefactor with links to the slave trade.Jesus College has been told that a relief of Tobias Rustat, a former courtier to King Charles II, must remain in place after an ecclesiastical court ruled that its removal would cause “considerable harm” to the chapel’s historical interest.The ruling is a major victory for those campaigning against the “cancel culture” that has seen statues based on historical figures be destroyed because of their links to slavery or colonialism.Jesus College wanted to remove the memorial because it said it caused offence to students and put off potential users of the chapel, and Justin Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury, called it “a memorial to slavery” that should be taken down.But opponents of its removal argued that Rustat’s links to the slave trade had been hugely exaggerated as he had a relatively small investment in a company that traded slaves, and that his wealth came from his work for the king.Because of the chapel’s status as an Anglican place of worship, the decision rested with the Diocese of Ely, which ruled that supporters of the memorial’s removal had peddled a “false narrative” about Rustat’s links to slavery.Rustat, who lived from 1608 to 1694, commissioned the marble memorial himself from the studio of Grinling Gibbons, and it has been described as one of the most important pieces of funerary art in the country. Rustat is buried in the Grade I listed chapel.In his ruling, David Hodge QC, Deputy Chancellor of the Diocese of Ely, suggested the college should provide “context” for the memorial rather than removing it.He said: “I am satisfied that the removal of the Rustat memorial from the west wall of the Chapel would cause considerable, or notable, harm to the significance of the Chapel as a building of special architectural or historic interest.“The College must therefore demonstrate a clear and convincing justification for the removal of the memorial. I am not satisfied the College has done so: the suggested justification is clearly expressed, but I do not find it to be convincing.“I am not satisfied that the removal of the memorial is necessary to enable the Chapel to play its proper role in providing a credible Christian ministry and witness to the College community, or for it to act as a focus for secular activities and events in the wider life of the College.”Among those pressing for the removal of the memorial was Sonita Alleyne, the Master of Jesus College and the first black master of an Oxbridge college. She said: “In this day and age, in this community that we have in our chapel, with our very erse student body, are you really saying to young people as they come in, this is what part of being in a place like Cambridge is about?”However, opponents of the removal pointed out that while Edward Colston, whose statue was toppled in Bristol in 2020, was deputy governor of the slave-trading Royal African Company, Rustat’s investment in the company amounted to just 1.3 per cent of his wealth.The ruling said that any money Rustat made out of slavery “comprised only a small part of his great wealth and made no contribution to his gifts to the college”.Deputy Chancellor Hodge acknowledged that this did not excuse Rustat’s willingness to invest in the slave trade, but, quoting LP Hartley, noted that: “The past is a foreign country: they do things differently there.”He said that to remove all challenging imagery from places of worship would mean having “to do away with the painful image of Christ on the cross, or images of the martyrdom of saints”.He added that by contextualising the memorial it “may be employed as an appropriate vehicle to consider the imperfection of human beings and to recognise that none of us is free from all sin”.A spokesman for the Rustat Memorial Group, which opposed its removal, said: “We are pleased to read the judgment and hope that all parties can agree that the issues raised by the petition are now resolved. We wish Jesus College well as it focuses again on today’s challenges in the university.”A spokesman for Jesus College said: “We are deeply disappointed and shocked by the decision. Rustat’s involvement in the slave trade has never been in question, and the widespread opposition to the presence of his memorial in the College Chapel is the result of this involvement and not any false narrative apparently created by the College about the sources of Rustat’s wealth.“This celebratory memorial to an active participant in the slave trade remains a barrier to worship in our Chapel for some members of our community.“It was right for us to have submitted this application. We will now carefully consider our next steps.”Deputy Chancellor Hodge said that: “I would hope that when Rustat’s life and career is fully, and properly, understood, and viewed as a whole, his memorial will cease to be seen as a monument to a slave trader.”More from NewsHarperCollins under pressure to pull Anne Frank book over ‘discredited’ claims\u0026#39Chlorine gas leak\u0026#39 at Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park sees 29 hospitalisedRussia-Ukraine latest news: Nato vows to support Ukraine against \u0026#39chemical, biological and nuclear\u0026#39 attacks Spring Statement latest news: National Insurance increase should be \u0026#39scrapped in its entirety\u0026#39, say Tory MPsSir David Amess murder trial live: ‘He wasn’t like \u0026#34Oh my God\u0026#34, he was like \u0026#34I’ve done it, I’ve achieved something\u0026#34’, says witness of attackerWinners and losers from the Spring Statement 2022 – and what it means for your moneyMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"keir starmer calls government make","story":"Rishi Sunaks top six Spring Statement priorities to help Brits beat Cost of Living crisisThe Chancellor Rishi Sunak is expected to tell Brits how the Government will help them get through the looming cost of living crisis when he delivers his spring statement on WednesdayKeir Starmer has called for energy companies to pay a windfall tax Image: PAByPippa CrerarDaily Mirror Political EditorDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  Mar Updated:,  Mar |commentsKeir Starmer has urged Rishi Sunak to announce concrete plans including a tax on energy giants in his spring statement on Wednesday. Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak is expected to tell Brits how the Government will help them get through the looming cost of living crisis. He has hinted he may cut fuel duty by up to p per litre, with forecourt prices soaring since Russia ’s invasion of Ukraine.The Labour leader backed the move – and repeated calls for a windfall tax on oil and gas companies to drive down soaring energy bills.He said: “Everybody is talking about how they’re feeling the pinch. They want to know that the Government is hearing them, that it’s going to do something about it”. He added: “I think the simple things are a windfall tax on oil and gas companies who’ve made more profit than they expected, use that to bring down bills.  “If the Government is going to actually do something about fuel duties, then, of course, we will support that because I think, for most people, this is such a dficult situation.” As households and businesses struggle, No  admitted that the Government’s energy security strategy had been delayed again to next week. Mr Starmer also said a planned National Insurance rise was the “wrong tax at the wrong time”.There is speculation Mr Sunak could scrap the rise for lower-paid workers by raising the threshold it starts to be paid at. The Resolution Foundation said boosting benefits would bring nearly four times more support to lower-earning families than scrapping the NI rise. It emerged last night pensions could rise by more than % in April  after the DWP insisted it “remains committed” to bringing back the triple lock – despite inflation rising.Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey will base the increase on average wages, .%, or September’s CPI inflation figure – whichever is highest.It will likely bring a bumper rise for pensioners next spring - but only after hefty real-terms cuts this year. The Resolution Foundation has said inflation could hit .% by September, higher than last year though still below a peak next month of .%. That would lead to a pensions rise of £ a week.  But the think-tank blasted the “rollercoaster ride” and urged ministers to ease pressure now Parents are also being squeezed by rising childcare costs and a drop in places, according to the charity Coram Family and Childcare. It found the UK-average price of  hours of care a week for an under two in nursery is £.. More than one in five people fear financial pressures will drive them into problem debt this year, debt charity StepChange found. Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary Jonathan Ashworth claimed energy price rises will cause low earners and retirees to either “starve or freeze”. Below are six announcements expected on Wednesday: p fuel duty cut predictedFuel duty was frozen in October’s Budget for a th year in a row. But Tory MP Robert Halfon said it is “vital” it is now reduced as prices soar due to the Ukraine war. Mr Sunak has hinted it could be cut – amid speculation of p a litre. Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves said Labour will not vote against a cut but warned that p may not “rise to the scale of the challenge”.Inflation set to peak at .% Inflation is set to peak at .% in April after the Russian invasion of Ukraine made it even worse. Officials fear it could go even higher, beating the .% rate of . Some warn it could hit %. This will blow out of the water October’s forecasts that inflation would peak at .% this year and could rise to .%. It will mean more expensive food and goods, hitting the poorest hardest. National insurance to rise to .% National Insurance will rise from % to .% from April and will be paid by anyone earning over £, a year, up from the £, a year it is paid at now. There’s speculation the Chancellor could raise this threshold, taking some of the lowest earners out of paying. One Tory said: “If it’s about pride, they can now say Ukraine is the reason they need to change course.”Benefits to go up by .% Benefits will go up just .%, as little as £. a month on Universal Credit. In October the Chancellor cut UC for millions by £ a week.Pensions will also rise by .%. In a Budget “rabbit out of the hat” in October, he handed more generous benefits to . million working families by cutting the UC taper rate from p to p.But this only helps those who work, not the sick or unemployed.MoD budget to be increased Westminster sources told the Sunday Mirror the Chancellor is planning to raise the £bn MoD budget. One said: “Ministers are no longer talking about cuts. They see the need to beef up our forces to confront Russia.” It may reverse the cut of , troops to , by . But the Chancellor played down reports, saying he has led the biggest post-Cold War defence spending rise.Plan to wean off oil but not gas expected The PM is expected to set out an energy supply plan to wean the UK off Russian oil – but not gas – by the end of the year. It is set to invest more in renewable and nuclear power and aim for more oil from places like Saudi Arabia. But Mr Sunak is said to have called for a delay to assess costs of nuclear and eco power.

Instead his choices are making the cost of living crisis worseByAletha AduPolitical Correspondent:,  Mar Updated:,  Mar |commentsShadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves ridiculed Rishi Sunakaposs Spring Statement, claiming he had taken inspiration from the characters of Alice in Wonderland. The Chancellor appeared desperate to distance himself from phrase, high-tax Chancellor, as he announced a p cut in fuel duty for one year, scrapped % VAT for green household improvements and increased the National Insurance threshold by £,. Mr Sunak told the Commons he was delivering on his promise to cut taxes for hardworking families.But the NI threshold increase will only benefit households with middle and top tier incomes, and he has only undone a number of personal tax rises he announced last year, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility.Ms Reeves told the Commons: The chancellor proclaimed aposI believe in lower taxesapos, while at the same time as hiking National Insurance contributions.  We are presented with increasingly incredible claims. Perhaps the Chancellor has been taking inspiration from the characters in Alice in Wonderland. Or should I say – ‘Alice in Sunakland’, she added. It’s the sort of place where a Chancellor celebrates giving people £ to help with spiralling energy bills, before explaining that he needs it all back. Morgan Schondelmeier, Director of Operations at the Adam Smith Institute accused Mr Sunak of gaslighting Brits when gas prices are getting higher. At a time when gas prices are only getting higher, we don’t need to be gaslit by a Chancellor who continuously claims to be a low tax fiscal conservative.While the Chancellor is clearly paying lip service to conservative principles of low tax and personal responsibility, we are still facing an impending cost of living crisis with too few immediate solutions. Ms Reeves also blasted the Chancellor for claiming the work starts today a day before releasing his spring statement. She asked MPs in the Commons chamber is he serious , noting he had been in his job for more than two years and the Tories have been in Government for more than a decade. The Chancellor says the work starts today. Is he serious  The Conservatives have been in government now for  years, not  hours. What has taken them so long  In his spring statement, Mr Sunak told MPs his plan will deliver the biggest cut to personal taxes in over a quarter of a century, as he announced plans to cut the basic rate of income tax before the next election in . The Office for Budget Responsibility says he had undone around a sixth of the overall net tax rises he announced since becoming Chancellor.The centrepiece of the statement that the Chancellor has delivered today, is based on a disagreement with himself, Ms Reeves told the Commons. Today was the day the Chancellor could have put a windfall tax on oil and gas producers to provide real help to families. But he didn’t. Today was the day for the Chancellor to set out a plan to support businesses and create good jobs. But he didn’t. Today was the day he could have properly scrapped his national insurance hike. But he didn’t. We said it was the wrong tax. Wrong time. Wrong choice. Today the Chancellor all but admitted he got that one wrong. The Shadow Chancellor claimed families and businesses will endure signicant hardship from now on, as peopleaposs energy bills will be rising by % in eight days. People are worried sick, Ms Reeves claimed as she pointed out inflation has skyrocketed to its highest level for  years - .%. For all his words, it is clear the Chancellor doesn’t get the scale of the challenge. He talks about providing security for working families. But his choices are making the cost of living crisis worse - not better, Ms Reeves added.

And then he wonapost. What heaposll do instead is slice a few pennies off fuel, and while you might think this is a dandy idea all it does is reduce the governmentaposs cut, and leaves the profits to oil companies who may, or may not, decide to lower the price you pay at the pumps.By cutting the cost of petrol and diesel, Rishi Sunak will take money out of the NHS, road repairs, schools, bin collections, social work, home help, and a thousand other things you donapost notice as much as the cost of a full tank, but need in order to survive, just the same.The fact heaposll do it while telling you heaposs making le easier for the average man on the street is a flat lie from someone who is at no risk of ever having to choose between filling up on fuel, or food. Itaposs classic Torynomics - the maths of keeping rich people rich, as opposed to making the poor better off.But what more could he do, the backbenchers cry. Vladimir Putinaposs put up the price of oil and gas, the pandemic has caused supply chain problems, and working from home has pinched the economies of our cities. Weaposve lost £bn of trade since Brexit, there are traumatised Ukrainians and Afghan translators to accommodate, weaposre full, weaposre broke, weaposre buggered. Plus, it isnapost easy, being green! There are some quite cheap and easy ways that he COULD put some money in your pocket, though. And heaposs not going to bother with any of them.. Insulate every home in the UK The quickest way of saving money on energy bills is to insulate your home. The rate of doing this has stalled, and while not everyone wants or can afford full net-zero compliance of the sort which Insulate Britain crackpots demand, it is possible for lots of us to do better -we had help. Cutting % VAT on insulation of any sort, plus the same for adding solar , wind turbines, or heat pumps, would make a big dference. Heaposs not going to, because itaposs not sexy, and why should you lot get something for less. . Windfall tax on the energy firmsShell is on track to post a £.bn profit this year, while BP is likely to make £.bn. Oil firms are taxed high already - %, compared to most companiesapos % - but letaposs face it, theyaposre at no risk of the workhouse. And it would produce a massive, immediate, undodgeable payday for government which could use it to bring down bills. He wonapost, for fear that it sets a precedent, which was the opposite of his reasoning when he said heaposd have to raise taxes because of the pandemic.. Raise the NI thresholdNext month everyone with a job, and every firm, will be paying more for the privilege. The .% hike Rishi will talk about is more accurately described as % - because NI contributions will be going up by about a tenth, from % to .%. Itaposs expected to raise £bn a year for the next  years, and will be given to the NHS to repair pandemic damage.But heaposs also asking the NHS to save £.bn in waste. If you think the NHS is currently wasteful, itaposs not clear how throwing another £.bn at it will help. If you think the NHS is underfunded, giving it billions with one hand and taking billions with the other also wonapost help. So whataposs happening is youaposre getting taxed % more for something thataposs not helpful, in any scenario. In any event, it should not be paid by the poorest. Raising the threshold at which you start paying from £, to the same as the income tax floor of £, would be fairer - and he wonapost do it because it effectively creates a tax-free basic income for everyone in work. It would mean less poverty, less disease, better nutrition, better health, and in the years to come lower costs for the NHS and social care, but why should the bleeding obvious matter a jot   . Make Brexit betterThe UK waved goodbye to £bn of cross-border trade with Boris Johnsonaposs bad Brexit deal this year, at just the time the effects were worse thanks to the pandemic and, now, the war crime spree in Ukraine. Thereaposs a simple way to restore every penny of it, though, which is to end all tarfs and customs checks by complying with EU standards on goods and services.It turns out, they werenapost so bad after all. And there is not a human in the world who wants to fill in  pages of customs declarationsthere is an option to not do so. This wonapost happen either, because it would involve a government built on hoods and ignorance admitting publicly that it doesnapost know the first damned thing about what itaposs doing, which would make Rishi look like the best economist while stood in a field of financial morons. Read more . Resign The worst Chancellors in British history are the ones who presided over growing poverty because they did not know what it felt like. They never went hungry, never shivered, never missed out because they could not afford to exploit an opportunity. The better ones did experience that, and knew the price paid for being poor - they knew that it led to sickness, squalor, worse workers, lower tax takes, public health problems and generational, national failure. They could see how hungry children led to lower GDP, and wanted to fix it.Little Rishi argued that feeding children was too expensive. He said helping the self-employed was too dficult, unless they were able to provide some PPE and had a Toryaposs phone number, in which case he happily threw billions at them, no questions asked. He didnapost have a problem giving visas to rich Russians, and now the government heaposs part of is rationing the welcome mat for poor Ukrainians. He seems to resent helping to keep factories open and Brits in work, sohe pulls POaposs freeport contracts on the basis itaposs fired a third of its UK workforce and employed Filipinos on £ an hour, realism itself will seek the therapistaposs couch.There are global, and dficult, economic problems to resolve. It requires someone with empathy, experience, and imagination to tackle them. Instead this chancellor will do tiny things - bijou cashbacks, petite lies, small-minded solutions that solve nothing. Thataposs why heaposs Little Rishi - thinks little, knows little, does little. The Spring Statement will be nothing more than Torynomics - bedtime stories from a man whose only real goal in le is to replace the party-mad pillock in Number , rather than nurse a nation back to economic health.Youaposll never get any financial sense from a man who spends £ on a coffee cup and £ on slippers.Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON PO CompanyConservative PartyBPEuropean UnionNHSBoris JohnsonVladimir PutinTaxEnergy billsOil pricesWar crimesCrimePoliticsSolar powerRishi SunakThe BudgetSpring Statement\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Meanwhile tax and student loan repayment thresholds are being frozen in a ‘ stealth tax ’ squeeze on the cost of living.  The Mirror understands officials are braced for inflation to peak above % this Spring, with formal forecasts due to be produced tomorrow.Chancellor Rishi Sunak is considering cutting fuel duty by p a litre and is said to have looked at raising the National Insurance threshold, to take some of the lowest-paid Brits out of the soon-to-be-hiked tax.But heaposs resisting any bigger action like axing the NI hike entirely - or raising pensions or benefits beyond .%. Money Saving Expert Martin Lewis warned on Sunday: “I am virtually out of tools to help people now.  “It’s not something money management can fix. It’s not something for those in the lowest incomes, telling them to cut their bills will work. “We need political intervention.” So as we wait for Tory Rishi Sunak to deliver any help, let’s look at the biggest cost-of-living hikes he needs to deal with - and the dates they’ll hit. InflationDATE: NOWUK CPI inflation has already hit .%, raising the cost of food, energy and transport rises at the fastest for three decades.The war between oil giant Russia and wheat-producing Ukraine is now making this worse, with officials now braced for inflation to peak above % in April.It will mean the same pound in your pocket buys you less in bread or fuel, and tightens business margins to the point where firms could go bust. The Resolution Foundation expects inflation to remain high for most of this year and still be above % in September - a level not seen since the early s.  Interest ratesDATE: NOW Last week the Bank of England increased interest rates to .%, despite warnings it would “crush” households already drowning in the cost of living crisis.The Bank took the move to slow the economy down and cool soaring inflation . Governor Andrew Bailey recently appealed to workers not to ask for big pay rises, as that fuels inflation further. But it will mean new mortgage rates become more expensive, and inflicts an overnight rise to monthly payments for people on standard iable rates. Petrol pricesDATE: NOWPetrol prices have hit record highs due to Russia’s war in Ukraine, leading Chancellor Rishi Sunak to hint he’ll temporarily cut fuel duty.The average price of petrol reached .p a litre while diesel rose to .p a litre Sunday before last.A month earlier they averaged .p and .p a litre respectively. A family car with a typical -litre tank is now paying £.p to fill up compared to £. a year earlier.But Labour warned even a rumoured p-a-litre cut would make a dference of only a couple of quid to a family tank.And Mr Sunak would face pressure to make any cut permanent, despite Tories having frozen the duty for  years already while raising taxes on everything .Energy billsDATE: April The energy price cap will increase to a record £,-a-year for a typical household following soaring gas prices. Around million Brits on iable tarfs will be hit with a £ rise to the average annual bill overnight on April . Those on fixed tarfs will be hit by rises when their fixed-rate period ends. A second hike that could be just as big or even worse is expected on October . Rishi Sunak has announced plans to help, which include people living in bands A to D getting £ discount on their council tax in England, and a £ rebate off energy bills in October.But Labour has branded him the loan shark Chancellor as the rebate is effectively a loan which will need to be repaid over five years. Tory MPs say he must go further - for instance by increasing the £ discount or £ loan, or delaying repayments. But he was reluctant to announce help before April .  National Insurance riseDATE: April A £bn rise in National Insurance will hit working people as the Treasury looks to cut Covid backlogs in the NHS and begin funding social care.Employees will pay .p more in the pound on earnings above £, a year, a rise from % to .%. This earnings threshold has risen since last year, but only by .% - less than inflation. The Lib Dems brand this a stealth tax that makes Brits pay £ more.Those supportive of Boris Johnson argue the levy is progressive as the wealthier pay more.But Tory backbenchers hostile to new taxes baulk at the plans as the tax burden hits its highest in decades. While Rishi Sunak is unlikely to scrap the rise completely, there are claims he could change the earnings threshold - for instance, aligning it with income tax . Income tax ‘stealth tax’DATE: April Rishi Sunak chose to freeze income tax thresholds at a time when inflation is climbing at frightening speed. Youaposll have to carry on paying % on earnings over £,, and % on earnings over £, - just like this year. According to the Commons library, more than a million more people will be paying a higher rate of income tax by . And that was analysed before the latest rises in inflation. The IFS think tank now warns it’s a £.bn ‘stealth tax’, two and a half times bigger than first thought.  Real terms cuts to pay - including for NHS and teachersDATE: April Inflation means many planned rises to public sector wages - which are due every April - will be wiped out by rising prices. At this rate workers will need a rise of % to % just to keep up with rising prices, but the government is resisting these. Ministers have already spelt out plans to raise salaries for experienced teachers by only % in  . Health unions have also blasted plans to offer NHS staff in England a “miserly” % hike. The Royal College of Nursing is demanding % above inflation.  Council tax riseDATE: April  Most of England’s families will be hit with a Council Tax rise of % or more next Friday, Mirror research reveals. Of  councils that run social care, the Mirror found  were planning rises of .% - the maximum normally allowed this year. And a further  planned rises higher than .%, by using allowances that were unused in previous years. Now of course, most people’s council tax will be lower than last year due to the £ discount for Band A-D homes in England. But there are two big catches. First, that £ is meant to pay for energy bills - not absorbing the cost of a tax rise. In Rutland a Band D bill will go up by £, wiping out much of the £ discount. Second, the £ is a one-off. Next Spring, you’ll suddenly feel the force of not just this year’s rise but also the April  rise at the same time.Search for your council tax rise by postcode by following the link below. Covid testsDATE: April From April  the vast majority of people must paythey want a Covid lateral flow test - eventhey have a cough and fever. No has said spending £bn a month on free tests is not an effective use of taxpayers’ money at this point. This prompted a furious row with Labour, some medics and the Scottish and Welsh governments.Asymptomatic tests for NHS workers will be made available but not routinely, only as a surge effort where thereaposs an outbreak. But they will be available for care home residents. Exact lists of those eligible are being drawn up.Boots is preparing to charge £ for a pack of five. Student loans aposstealth taxaposDATE: April Millions will be forced to pay more on their student loans under what has been branded a “stealth tax rise”. Student loan repayment thresholds will be frozen from April  after plans to raise them by .% were scrapped. That means graduates will have to shell out more of their disposable income as wages and prices rise with inflation. The respected Institute for Fiscal Studies warned the freeze will cost £k earners £ a year more than they expected. IFS senior economist Ben Waltmann said it was “a further hit to real incomes”, adding it “effectively constitutes a tax rise by stealth on graduates with middling earnings.” It gets worse further in the future. Students starting university next year will begin paying off their loans when they earn more than £, - down from the existing £,-a-year threshold. And theof time to repay their debt will be extended to  years, up from . The IFS said this will leave poorer graduates paying £, more over their letimes.  Real terms cut to welfare benefitsDATE: April  Benefits will rise by .%, as little as £. a month on the rate of Universal Credit.Tory MPs pushed through the plans earlier this year - saying it was in line with inflation. But it’s only in line with what inflation was last September, before prices began to soar at an alarming rate. Many are warning that this will severely exacerbate the cost-of-living crisis for those who are struggling the most, with food bank use climbing. The Resolution Foundation has urged Rishi Sunak to raise benefits more generously as an urgent priority, ahead of any decision to cancel the National Insurance rise. Pensions are being cut in real terms - before rising next yearDATE: April Pensions could rise by more than % next April after the Tory DWP chief promised to bring back the triple lock - despite soaring inflation. Therese Coffey suspended the triple lock - a solemn manesto pledge - for one year in   because post-Covid wages were bouncing back in an “anomaly”.That sparked fury as it meant the state pension will rise by only .% next month, less than inflation. That is a real-terms cut of £ to Britain’s million pensioners, Shadow DWP chief Jon Ashworth said.But Ms Coffey said the triple lock wouldin   as promised. That could lead to a rise of .%, experts predict. A real-terms cut to childcare helpDATE: NOWPoor parents will be hit hard by April’s cost-of-living crisis as Tory ministers refuse to raise a crucial childcare allowance - despite soaring inflation. Parents on Universal Credit can claim back % of childcare costs, but only up to a £.-a-month cap - which has not changed since  and is not rising in April. Campaigner and working mum to a four-year-old and Gemma Widdowfield, , told MPs: “We’re all in the midst of a cost-of-living crisis. We’re all feeling the pinch. “My childcare’s going up slightly but the Universal Credit cap isn’t going up at all… that’s going to be passed on to us.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Spring StatementPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Mr Sunak raised the threshold at which workers start paying National Insurance by £, to £, - claiming itaposd save Brits up to £ a year. But this doesnapost factor in a . percentage point rise in the same tax that heaposs already announced. This will cut into the £ saving, and outstrip it entirely for anyone earning over £, a year. He also announced a p a litre one-year cut in fuel duty - but this doesnapost help people who donapost have a car. And he announced a tax cut for richer Brits who spend thousands sticking solar  on their homes to save the planet. In a bombshell election vow aposrabbit out of the hatapos, he promised to cut the basic rate of income tax from p to p in the pound - but not now, only in April  in an election bribe.There are serious questions about how itaposll be funded, as while Mr Sunak could have over £bn of spare aposheadroomapos, officials admit even slight changes in the economy will knock billions off Treasury funds.  The Chancellor was blasted for ignoring the poorest as the income tax and National Insurance changes donapost give a penny to Brits out of work. There was no increase to benefits as poverty-stricken families face a cost of living disaster, with inflation rising twice as fast as welfare and pensions.MPs shouted is that it  as he announced just £m for a Household Support Fund - which supports poverty-stricken Brits who fall through the cracks of current schemes. There was also no extra cash for defence despite the war in Ukraine and falling troop numbers, and no extra support for soaring energy bills. Officials claimed the measures announced today amount to £.bn of support for the cost of living. That is a £bn cut through National Insurance thresholds, £bn cut from fuel duty, and the £m extra for the Household Support Fund. That was on top of £bn set out previously, bringing total support next year to £bn. But the Office for Budget Responsibility said real household disposable incomes per person will fall by .% in   - the largest fall in a single year since ONS records began in .  It is only the ninth fall in real disposable incomes recorded since records began nearly  years ago. Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves fumed: The Chancellor has made the wrong choices. She said it was just jam tomorrow, rather than the support that is needed now adding: He’s not Nigel Lawson - he’s Ted Heath with an Instagram account!” She compared the Chancellor to Alice in Wonderland, blasting: We are presented with increasingly incredible claims. Perhaps the Chancellor has been taking inspiration from the characters in Alice in Wonderland. Or should I say – ‘Alice in Sunakland’, Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary Jon Ashworth added: “Thanks to the Conservatives’ choices, families and retirees will still face the biggest hit to household incomes on record.” The bullet points below arenapost an exhaustive list of everything hitting you because some measures - like the minimum wage and cigarette and alcohol taxes - were already announced in the Budget.They also donapost cover some of the biggest cost-of-living hits coming next month which the Chancellor did nothing to address.

The  cost of living crisis is hitting energy prices, fuel and the cost of food, with the governmentaposs only solution so far to offer all households a £ loan to help pay off their energy bills - which must be paid back eventually. Chancellor Rishi Sunakaposs Spring Statement saw him announce a cut in fuel duty, although this will cost the Treasury billions without putting cash back in familiesapos pockets.

Back to the s may prove Sunakaposs prospects of succeeding Boris Johnson are hitting the rocks. Taking more money out of peopleaposs pay packets and bank accounts when prices are rocketing is the Tory Treasury pouring petrol on the cost of living crisis. This Chancellor remains a record tax raiser, upping the National Insurance threshold giving back only a little of the extra £-billion to be grabbed. Reducing fuel duty p might never be felt at the pumps and is a fraction of an increase in the price of a litre since topping p since the start of the year.And that promise of a p Income Tax cut in two years is an election bribe suggesting a contest in Autumn  or Spring . It deserves to be greeted with the same suspicion generated by PO claims the ferry firm obeys the law.

A spokeswoman said: Chloe needed a very expensive and complicated operation in order to have the tumour removed.to our TeamDogs newsletter for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.But her recovery process also required a lot of treatment, weekly visits at the veterinary clinic and a lot of care.Although it is unknown how long Chloe had been living with the growth on her lower leg, it doesnapost seem to have caused her any other health issues.Following her treatment, the rescue, who rely on public donations to carry out their work, incurred a costly vet bill, and have been reminding people that rescue is not easy and is not cheap.  She added: Rescuing a dog like Chloe means an enormous vet bill for the rescue - and this is for just one dog. We don’t have just one dog at the rescue - we have a full shelter to look after. We have  cats at the rescue as well and we also have approximately  puppies in paid foster care. Just feeding the whole shelter daily costs a small fortune. We have enormous bills to pay and this is because we do the things right.  We don’t just take the dogs from the street, put them in a kennel and that’s it. We like to think that we do rescue in the right way and this involves enormous amounts of money. It’s frustrating and sad that rescue depends on money. We are very grateful to everyone that donates to support our rescue, we are very grateful to all our supporters. But the reality is that things are really hard, and the last months have been incredibly hard. Financially we struggle. Thanks to Every Le Counts Rescueaposs commitment, Chloe has now secured a home in the UK, where she has finally been shown what it is to be loved. The friendly dog is said to have settled into her new home and has been able to let her quirky personality to shine through. She has a loving family, she has been given a new le, she added.

A police patrol suspected the car was linked to a spate of high value thefts and set off in pursuit. Police bodycam footage shows Howard speed through narrow residential streets before being caught by police. The video shows Howard leap out of the car with his hands up begging cops to keep the police dog – called Gunner - on a lead.He later told cops: “I didn’t want to risk being bitten by your dog.” Howard, of Binley, Coventry, was jailed for  months after he admitted dangerous driving and driving while disqualied at Warwick Crown Court.Sergeant John Simpson, of West Midlands Police, who chased Howard, said: “Our amazing police dogs’ reputation obviously precedes them: they don’t even need to get out of the car for them to have a big impact.“In fairness to Howard it was a very sensible decision to pull over. “He’d been flying over speed humps at close to  miles per hour and, although it was the middle of the night and the roads were largely empty, it was very dangerous and could have ended with him or someone  being seriously hurt. “Andhe had tried to outrun Gunner there would only ever have been one winner.” Police suspected Howard and another man – who’d been dropped off earlier in the night – were scoping out high value cars to steal. Last year a heroic police dog was stabbed five time in the head while subduing a kneman in the line of duty. Brave Kaiser was lucky to be alive after the horror attack in south London on in June, the Met said. He and handler PC Mark Woolcott were on patrol when they were called to an intruder alert in Orpington at around pm. They responded along with other officers before finding a man down a track behind the house, the force said. Kaiser then attempted to subdue the man, who stabbed him up to five times on top of his head and once below the eye.

Richard will begin his fundraising for Brain Tumour Research this Friday when he will tour four Lloyds Bank branches in Worcester, Kidderminster, Droitwich and Cleobury Mortimer. It is part of a campaign organised by his sister-in-law who works for the bank. He was diagnosed with a Stage  glioblastoma multormetumour on New Year’s Eve - the same day he turned  and celebrated his ninth wedding anniversary with we, Lucy, aged . His symptoms began in September, , when he began experiencing severe pain at the back of his head which would last for days and gradually became more debilitating. Richard, managing director of Weldmax UK in Stourport-on-Severn, said: “I woke up feeling like I had been ‘on the pop’- which I hadn’t. I could see red and green lights in the corner of my right eye and remember a friend telling me about something similar they experienced whilst they were having a stroke and I thought that was happening to me.” His symptoms worsened and after losing his peripheral vision he was forced to pull over his van and seek help from strangers, who called Lucy to come and pick him up. She took him to AE at Alexandra Hospital in Redditch where his cancer was diagnosed. A further three CT scans and two MRIs were carried out to assess the tumour and he was transferred to the neurological unit at University Hospital Coventry and Warwickshire . Results revealed the tumour was the size of a satsuma and attached like a millipede to his optic nerve, deeming it inoperable due to risk of further damage. He underwent a six week course of radiotherapy which finishes this month. On March  he will undertake a day of fundraising as part of Wear A Hat Day with the aim of collecting £,, which represents the cost of a day of research at one of the charity’s Centre of Excellence. Richard said the diagnosis was devastating for his family. “Together Lucy and I have told the kids over time, he said. Max is eight and his school has been very supportive.

He also complained about being confined to his cell for  hours a day and demanded a supply of creamer for his coffee.Brueckner, who is being held at the Oldenburg correctional facility near Bremen, penned the letter to the Ministry of Justice.Madeleine, three, vanished from her parents’ holiday apartment at the Ocean Club complex in Praia da Luz in  as her parents were having dinner at a nearby restaurant. It sparked a worldwide hunt for the child and Kate and Jerry McCann have refused to give up hope of finding their daughter. Her whereabouts remain unknown, despite her disappearance being the most heavily reported missing person case ever. In the rambling note, suspect Brueckner said he was too scared to leave his cell over fears he would be attacked by other prisoners. “In the beginning, the fellow prisoners held back because they knew who I was, but had too little information about it,” he wrote.But after a TV documentary was aired he claims that he suffered “insults and death threats”. “I am forcibly self-isolating, since there is a high probability of a physical attack by fellow inmates,” he moaned.German newspaper Der Spiegel said he compared his long days in his eight sq metre cell to “torture”. Brueckner, who denies any involvement in Madeleine’s disappearance, refused to work in the prison factory over fears he would be attacked. “Should any of the inmates, due to ignorance or for whatever reason, think that they want to seriously injure me physically or even kill me, the locksmith’s shop is the ideal place for this,” he wrote. “Tools are lying around everywhere and it is possible a sharp blade can be found in a few seconds. “The repellent behavior of the prisoners working there was so threatening for me that I asked for the termination of my employment.” Brueckner also complained about the poor state of the pens provided to inmates at the high-security jail. German cops believe Brueckner abducted and killed Madeleine, who vanished from her parents’ Algarve holiday apartment in May . He is currently serving a seven-year prison term for raping a -year-old woman in Portugal in .

Faisal Shan, , allegedly attacked Beanca Zara Shah while she was walking home on a street in North East London after reporting him to the police, a court heard. During a trial at Snaresbrook Crown Court, jurors heard Faisal and Beanca had been in a relationship for  years and it ended in January , reports My London. Three months later, Ms Shah had taken out a non-molestation order, preventing him from directly having contact with her following a series of incidents, the court heard.  Giving evidence today, Ms Shah said that during their separation, Shan allegedly threatened her saying: “If I was to leave him, he’d give me a birthday to remember,” and to “throw acid on my face and kill me”. Jurors heard on the eve of her birthday on July , he made contact with her aunt, who resided with her at the same property in Romford. Immediately concerned, she and her aunt allegedly decided to travel to Romford Police station at around midnight, to report that he had breached the conditions of his order. On the journey, she said she noticed that Shan’s silver Golf was driving in the area, and reported it to the police, jurors heard. She was allegedly instructed tohome, where police officers would soon arrive to take a statement. The court heard how after she had parked her car near Eustace Road, she was allegedly struck by the silver Golf as she was crossing the road. The vehicle drove a short distance towards her before ramming its front bonnet into her left side, causing her to fall to the ground, jurors heard. She told jurors: “I was obviously on the floor, I was in pain, I couldn’t feel where the pain was coming from but I couldn’t move. I just remember my son coming to me, the police and the ambulance and they picked me up and took me into the ambulance. IYA Crime “It was a bit of a struggle, I thought I’d damaged something as I couldn’t move, it was quite painful. I had some scans, some X-rays, I was in a lot of pain so I was given painkillers and I was told I had damaged my lower coccyx bone, it was inflamed. My whole body was in pain as it was a shock to my whole body.” She has since been in physiotherapy for a year and has been advised to take pain killer injections to relieve discomfort in her lower back, the court heard.

Fishmongers have condemned Leeds City Council after the fishmonger was drenched in the p*** bag as it was nicknamed by local traders at Kirkgate Market.The stinky bag hangs right above Fish and Game Row in the Leeds city centre market, collecting rainwater which it then drains into buckets, reports Leeds Live.Paul Morgan, , has worked in the market for a couple of years. He worked at Tarbett’s Fishmongers at the time of the unfortunate incident which saw him having to strip off and hand over his work clothes to helpful launderette workers in the market. Paul spoke about how he had to wait around, just in his shorts, while his “stinky” clothes were washed. He didn’t bother reporting it to the Leeds City Council at the time, about  months ago. He didn’t think the council would help him and continued to work that day.Paul said: “It once burst all over me, all over my work clothes. It stunk. I had to get all my work clothes washed and that. I got a wash in here and then the council washed it [the area] up. I just had shorts and that on, I had to take my clothes off and I had shorts on underneath. “I didn’t complain, I just left it. As long as I washed my clothes and that, I wasn’t really bothered to be honest. I know they wouldn’t offer anything anyway.”  Paul now works slightly further up the row at another fishmonger – which is historically Tarbett’s rival – TE Bethell Best Quality Fish. His boss Suzanne Lemming,  and owner of TE Bethell, condemned the level of maintenance as a disgrace. She said the council officers ought to be “sacked”. Suzanne said: “Look at the market, it’s filthy. We’re working with a bag of p*** up there. That’s what we call it. “That’s to collect the rainwater and then they’ll come and empty it from the buckets in the back there. It just goes through the hose pipes and then they’ll come to empty it.  “The management is an absolute disgrace, everyone wants sacking. If you look on the roofs, there’s a whole load of tissue paper to catch the water and buckets. That’s to catch the rainwater. All the way across, that’s all tissue paper. It’s disgusting.”This comes after a series of complaints about the council have come to light. Well-known butcher-shop Malcolm Michaels Quality Butchers is leaving due to aposhigh rent and minimal footfallapos. Plus another butcher J.P. Johnstonaposs has condemned the council for serving him an eviction notice in the post after  years of trading there.Suzanne added her voice to these complaints, labelling the rent prices “horrendous” for what they get. Suzanne said: “The rent is horrendous, when I started in , my rent was £ a month and now we’re on about £,. There’s tons less footfall. Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday were our main days, on a quiet day our minimum take was £ in about , now it’s usually £you’re lucky.” Leeds City Council says they’re in “constant discussion” with traders over improvement works. The local authority says it aims to renovate units to a “modern day standard”, which is presently being carried out on all , block shops. These improvements will “put a stop to the water ingress issues we have in this area, removing the temporary measure we have had to put in place”.A spokesperson for the authority added the Covid- pandemic has caused work to stall, with “dficulties” arising from finding suitable contractors to carry out the work.The council spokesperson went on to say: “Over £m has been given over the course of the pandemic in rent concessions, over and above any government grants received by traders. Additionally, phase one of the market’s restoration for the  block shops will cost just over £m with phases two and three still to come. Additionally, during  , £, was spent on repairs and maintenance for the market.”The local authority said it’s discounted rents over most the pandemic period, with just over £million in concessions, and continue to offset service charges.

The teen has been without full-time education since April last year and his mum said it’s taken a toll on his mental health. Leanne - who has had to take unpaid leave to look after Jack - said she was given little warning before the decision was made. The school and Medway Council didn’t initially offer any kind of alternative educational programme while he waited for a new permanent school place, she claims. Jack had been at Bradfields - which caters for pupils with complex needs - for two years, which included pandemic lockdowns.Are you having similar issues finding a special school for your child  Let us know at webnews@mirror But on ing to the classroom in early  he lost his grandfather to Covid within a matter of weeks and then his auntie died suddenly. Leanne told the Mirror: “There was a lot of extra anxiety he had to deal with, on top of his own problems. “It was causing him extra stress. He went back to school and he was having more dficulties.” In March last year, Bradfields called Leanne in for an emergency review, with the council present. Jack had managed to escape the main school grounds the previous day and it was decided he would have his school hours reduced to one morning a week. But by the following month Leanne was told “it’s not working” and he has been at home ever since, she said.  Jack is still officially enrolled at Bradfields while the council makes enquiries for an alternative placement. However, Leanne claims the school - beyond sending a work pack last July - has never even checked how he is or sent him any work. Due to also having a daughter at mainstream school, Leanne needs Jack to get a place within a reasonable distance from their home so she can drop them both off, as he struggles to cope on other transport. But Medway has even looked outside the immediate area, with still no luck. And not once has Leanne had any contact with any of the schools, and none have ever met Jack before making a decision. “We are at the end of our tether now,” said Leanne. “It’s all just a waiting game and when you’ve got a child with severe needs and high anxiety, you’re left to just get on with it, which is quite disgusting. “It is a strain on the whole family.”  Leanne has put in a formal complaint to the council as she believes Jack is “not getting the duty of care he deserves”. “I have got a list of all the schools and they’ve either got a ‘no’ or ‘no space’ against it or ‘unable to meet needs’.” She said the whole system seems to be broken, and she feels discriminated against because Jack has multiple diagnoses, which the school were well aware of when he enrolled. She said: “It does feel like they are cherry picking children, taking the easier cases. That’s how it comes across.” She said Jack was highly reliant on the rigid routine school brought and is missing interacting on a regular basis with friends. He struggled in larger classroom settings and his tutor would often have to teach him in more secluded areas, sometimes out in school corridors. Leanne has since spoken to Medway SENDIAS, a local organisation which helps families whose children need special education support.She said they advised her to put in a complaint and to push for alternative education. Jack is now due to get a home tutor, but Leanne said that was never offered initially. In response to her formal complaint, in an email sent late last month and seen by the Mirror, the council said a referral to a tuition agency to provide tuition at home had now been made. Leanne said: “They didn’t give that to me without me pushing for it. It’s always been me having to push for it. “It’s upsetting because you know there’s a lot of other people out there that are not quite as wise and they take it as gospel what they’re being told and I don’t think it’s acceptable. “I am one of the ones that moan but you’ve got to, at the end of that day, it’s your child’s rights,” she added. The complaint response email added: We are very sorry that we have not been able to identy a school place for Jack as yet and we are continuing to work hard to resolve this. We understand your frustrations. There is a currently a lack of places within specialist educational provision nationally as well as in Kent and Medway generally. A statement from Medway Council said: “We are doing everything we can to help find a suitable school place, which is able to meet his complex needs. We have contacted a number of schools but unfortunately they either do not have any vacancies or are unable to meet his inidual needs. Whilst we continue to consult with suitable schools to find him a place we have arranged for a specialist tutor to help him. We are committed to ensuring every child in Medway receives the best education possible.” The Mirror has also contacted Bradfields for comment.

Workers on the site, on a plot of land neighbouring a number of bungalows on a housing estate in the Haughton Green area, were also captured leaning over a huge hole estimated to be around seven-feet deep.  Locals said they understood it was to become a swimming pool. The botched excavation work has now left one property on Gilbraltar Lane, close to the Haughton Dale Nature Reserve in the Tame Valley, aposunstableapos, said the Health and Safety Executive. Mr Matib was successfully prosecuted by HSE and was handed a suspended prison term at Manchester Magistrates Court.Those living nearby spoke of their anger and frustration at what had been happening at the site following the granting of planning permission several years ago. One man, Ernie Lamb, said it had been aposa nightmareapos. The -year-old said: Weaposve been here for two and a half years and itaposs been going on since before then. Itaposs been going on for up to four to five years I believe. Itaposs just gone on and on and on, and itaposs caused a lot upset round here.  I saw them working barefoot, everyone did! They were blaring loud music as well and we just couldnapost believe what we were seeing really. We kept asking how are they getting around that ground, because, as you can see itaposs rough down there. The whole idea was that it had a swimming pool and they dug it out and breeze blocked it. But it rained pretty solidly and it just filled with water. It must have been six or seven-foot deep. It also just had a really flimsy sort of wire mesh fence initially and this area is chocka with kids and people with dogs going down to the river in the valley and they were worried kids might get in and start playing in there. So I believe someone complained about that. Three dferent times, three dferent people came in with JCBs to dig and started digging. And the drivers were saying to us aposI donapost think he has any idea what heaposs doing, heaposs just telling us aposdig this, dig that.apos I donapost think a suspended sentence and a fine will mean much to him really.  John Hulme, , agreed. He said the work had been aposgoing on for yearsapos. Itaposs just been an eyesore and a consistent mess. They dug a massive hole which we think was meant to be the swimming pool and it just flooded. The last time I saw people working on there was probably when they had a cabin put in last April. When we did see people working on there they had no shoes, no boots, no protective equipment. It just saddened me really as they were just young lads and they werenapost being properly protected. It was an accident waiting to happen really. And I just donapost understand it or see the point. I canapost imagine how much they have spent on it. So either build it, and do it properly, or sell it. Thataposs how we see it.  You do obviously worry when such sub-standard work is being done on your doorstep. We werenapost too worried about our home but at other parts around it, fences have basically collapsed. AndI was the person who lived next door Iaposd be very worried about my foundations. Itaposs just been really frustrating for everyone. And who knows when it will get sorted as itaposs still an eyesore. On the sentence, he said: I donapost like to see people going to prison. The prisons are full as it is, and him going to jail wouldnapost solve anything so I think unpaid work probably is the most appropriate punishment.

Johnaposs we Sue, also  said: Heaposs a brick short of a loadhe doesnapost know how what people round there think of how heaposs behaved over it. I donapost think the sentence is strong enough. Shirley Hoyland, , said: Weaposve not been as affected as others as we have only been here under two years and we donapost directly overlook it. But you see lots of people coming and going, and they blatantly didnapost have the right gear or kit. It was shocking and pretty worrying, yeah. The HSE said they carried out an inspection in August  after neighbours raised apossignicant concernsapos over the work. A subsequent investigation found Matib had employed several groundworkers to excavate land ahead of the building of the new house.  However, he had failed to prepare risk assessments and method statements detailing how the work would be safely carried out, failed to appoint a site manager with suitable skills, knowledge and experience and failed to ensure the health, safety and welfare of the workers they said. A large, deep and unprotected excavation was found, meaning there was a foreseeable fall risk. In addition, excavations were not shored or suitably battered back to prevent the risk of collapse they added. Ultimately the work put workers in danger and rendered the neighbouring property unstable, the HSE said. Matib, of Allerton Road, Bradford, pleaded guilty to two charges under the Health  Safety at Work Act. He was sentenced to sixteen weeks imprisonment suspended for twelve months, ordered to carry out  hours unpaid work and pay costs of £,. Speaking after the hearing, Inspector Phil Redman said: Inspectors will not hesitate to take appropriate enforcement action against duty holders who fall below the required standards and put lives at risk.

The pubaposs stinging response described how a customer was particularly rude to a member of staff. The pub wrote: A party of diners came in today, and one lady, in particular, was particularly rude to a member of staff, so much so that this staff member had to go on an early break to compose herself. When they were given the bill she demanded money off otherwise she would leave negative comments on all local hubs and social media s, I told her I was not a party to being blackmailed by anyone, and to go ahead and post whatever she wanted which she has.

The beer garden had been in use for  yearsThe fence goes around the beer garden Image: MyLondon BPM MediaByElizabeth Haigh:,  Mar Updated:,  Mar |commentsA former pub landlord has allegedly built a giant fence around the beer garden after he was asked to leave by the brewery. Tony OaposNeill had leased The Plough in East Sheen, Richmond, for  years but brewery Fulleraposs wanted the pub back in their hands since last November. At the time they said the handover was far from quick and smooth. My London previously reported that Mr OaposNeill had stripped the pubaposs kitchen, as well as removing all furniture and fittings as he left.He also took his team with him to take on a new pub and Fulleraposs has been renovating The Plough ever since. However, it has since emerged that while the former landlord has vacated The Plough building itself, he has now erected a fence around the beer garden. Richmond Council say that he is obstructing a public footpath, which Mr OaposNeill contests. He declined to comment on the situation, but confirmed that boarding had been erected and that Fulleraposs had no access to it.  When askedhe had put up the fence, Mr OaposNeill refused to comment further.Fulleraposs reportedly cannot obtain a fire certicate for the premises as only one entrance exit remains available to would-be customers and staff.A source close to the pub and the former landlord, who did not wish to be named, told MyLondon the area outside of the pub that has been used as a beer garden for  years has now been boarded up. The erection of the fence, made up of wooden boarding, came as a shock to local residents who told MyLondon they did not know anything about it.A spokeswoman forRichmond Council confirmed Mr OaposNeil does not own the land adjacent to the pub.She said: Mr OaposNeill has been in dispute with Fullers Brewery, which is the freehold owner of The Plough. The freehold does not own the triangle of land immediately adjacent to the public house – there is no registered owner and this area of land is considered part of the public highway.  The erection of the hoardings by Mr OaposNeill is in breach of planning control and obstructs the public highway. The Council has issued a planning Enforcement Notice for Mr OaposNeill to remove the hoardings by April . If the hoardings are not removed by April , the Council will likely remove them in default. The council added Mr OaposNeill disputes the fact that the boarding obstructs the public footpath. It said: It is not lawful to obstruct the public highway, whether or not it blocks access to property. Government guidance states: Where the land was previously open ground, fencing is strong evidence of factual possession, but it is neither indispensable nor conclusive. This means a wall such as the one outside The Plough could show a squatter has occupied the land, but it also does not prove it beyond doubt - and as it is new, this could harm OaposNeillaposs claim. It is understood the council are planning on forcibly removing the fence next month as a legal battle continues.  Tony OaposNeill lives just  yards from the pub and is fighting for the land on the grounds the pub was a part of the community, our source told us. Fulleraposs brewery confirmed the land was being contested, but that it was a council issue that should be resolved by April . A spokesman said: To that end, we have started work on the pub today [Monday, March ] and we canapost wait to get the pub open and welcome back in the local community.

However senior royal aides are understood to have accepted that the frailties that come with living a long le are finally catching up with her.A source told the Mail. : The Queen is still as alert, able and interested as ever but, physically, she isnapost as strong as she once was, which is entirely understandable for a woman of her age. While the royal family will attend the annual Commonwealth Day service, the Queen will miss the event for the first time in almost a decade.  The Monarch, who has recently recovered from a bout of Covid, had hoped to attend the important event in the royal calendar alongside the Prince of Wales, Duchess of Cornwall and Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: After discussing the arrangements with the royal household, the Queen has asked the Prince of Wales to represent Her Majesty at the Commonwealth service at Westminster Abbey on Monday. The Queen will continue with other planned engagements, including in-person audiences, in the week ahead.  She last missed the service nine years ago, in , while recovering from a nasty bout of gastroenteritis. Before that, the Queen had not been absent from a Commonwealth Day observance service for  years, the last time being when she had flu in . Highlights of the service at Westminster Abbey will include an address by former archbishop Lord Sentamu, a reflection by young Tongan leader Elizabeth Kite and special musical performances from Emeli Sande and Mica Paris. Her decision not to attend is likely to be interpreted as a precautionary measure by royal commentators, and a practical move, rather than a new health issue. With the Queen due to celebrate her th birthday on April , maintaining her comfort is a consideration and it is understood she has been pacing herself, although she was keen to do what work she could during her bout of Covid.

An error on Camelotaposs app meant around , people were told their winning tickets had actually lost after scanning their QR codes. The issue happened in the period between November  and September , according to the Gambling Commission. Camelot, a National Lottery operator, has been fined £.million as two problems in the app ending up impacting thousands of players. Another mistake saw , players buy single tickets - but they were charged for and received two tickets. Everyone either received a refund for the ticket they didnapost want or paid for their wins.  A final blunder saw marketing messages sent out to customers that had self-excluded on Gamstop, which is a free service enabling users to limit their online gambling, as well as players who had been identied by Camelot as having a gambling addiction. This message was sent although none of the , players could buy a National Lottery ticket through the app. Andrew Rhodes, Gambling Commission Chief Executive, said: We are reassured that Camelot has taken steps to make sure that their National Lottery app is fit for purpose.

Joan Blass died in March , sparking the beginning of a nightmare for her family. Her son and daughter became worried when a man  years younger became friends with her and moved in with her five months before her death. Daughter Daphne Franks, of Skipton, North Yorkshire was concerned because her mum was not aware he lived in her home and did not no know his name or where he was from.She told LeedsLive : Mum never seemed to know he lived there.She was asking, aposwhat is his name  Where did he come from apos At this stage, Joan could barely recall her own name, let alone that of her new toyboy.  When she died, the family discovered that Mr Folan had married her and the dementia sufferer was still wearing the wedding ring from her late husband Ron. Ron died in  after  years of the couple being together. Her new marriage meant her two children Daphne,  ,and Michael, , lost out on their £, inheritance because the registry office ceremony annulled her will. Daphne discovered three days after her motheraposs death that she had been married in a civil ceremony at Leeds Town Hall. Speaking to Predatory Marriage UK, Daphne said: We had contacted my motheraposs GP on so many occasions, the police, the social services, and had also taken legal advice and had been told that she could not make another will or marry again because of her severe dementia. Taking the toyboy to court The marriage meant the will Mrs Blass had drawn up, naming her two children as beneficiaries, was void and she died intestate, meaning her new husband automatically inherited her assets. Daphne decided to take legal action after Folan, now , took over the funeral arrangements. The hearing lasted four days but sadly for the family, siding with Mr Folan. Mrs Franks and her relatives were left with a £, legal bill. On top of that, none of Joanaposs relatives were invited to her funeral and she was buried in an unmarked grave.  Pushing for change Since the nightmare the family have been pushing for action to stop predatory marriages. Predatory Marriage UK aims to reform marriage laws and procedures to protect people with dementia. In  Fabian Hamilton, MP for Leeds North East, called on the PM to stop elderly and vulnerable people being preyed upon by tricksters leading to families losing their inheritance. Mr Hamilton first began campaigning on the matter a few years ago after hearing a story he could “hardly believe was possible in modern Britain”. He said: “It’s not good enough for a registrar simply to say that because one of the participants in the marriage ceremony was smiling at the time, that meant consent was happily given. The family have been working with Hourglass charity to welcome round-the-clock help. Mrs Franks said a   helpline would make an absolute dference. The Frank family have recently been working with Hourglass charity to get round-the-clock help for those affected by elder abuse. Ms Franks said a   helpline would make an absolute dference. She added thatshe had known about a helpline before she would have definitely rung it. The Hourglass charity said it was moving Its helpline to a   operation because more than a quarter of the calls it received went unanswered during out of hours. It said Home Office funding meant it was now able to extend its service to make sure calls were being answered day and night. Richard Robinson, Hourglass CEO, said: Thankfully we are increasingly aware of other forms of abuse like child abuse and domestic violence, but the abuse of older people remains in the shadows even though it affects millions. So many people are suffering and donapost know where to turn for help.

The figures then rocketed again a week later by %. Downing Street was warned it was taking a major risk in introducing its Living with Covid plan last month.  It means those who test positive are no longer required to self-isolate, but are advised to stay at home and avoid contact with others for at least five days. Masks are also no longer legally required in public. As of April , lateral flow tests will no longer be free, except for over-s and over-s with weakened immune systems.  This time last year on Tuesday, February ,  the UK recorded just , new cases. However, England was just emerging from its latest lockdown - with the Prime Minister unveiling his roadmap for lockdown easing the day before on February . At that time in , schools in England had reopened, recreation in outdoor public spaces was allowed between two people - but the stay at home order remained in effect.  Following a Christmas  easing of rules, despite the highly transmissible B iant - first identied in Kent - running rampant, the Government had been forced to throw the country back into full lockdown for months.

And considering the UK had been in lockdown since the start of the previous month, it shows how far the country has come in breaking the link between infection and death.

Hybrid versions of the coronavirus that combine genes from the Delta and Omicron iants - dubbed “Deltacron” - have been identied in patients across Europe and the United States, researchers have said.It has been officially confirmed as a new iant. According to analysis of Deltacron’s genetic code, its “backbone” is derived from the Delta iant while its spike – the part of the virus that attaches itself to human cells – is from Omicron.  In fact, Professor Adrian Esterman, an epidemiologist and biostatistican, said the iant could be one of the most infectious diseases the world has ever seen.He said it is up to six times more transmissible than the original strain of Covid - hence the up surge in new cases.

Bare-knuckle boxer Big Willy Collins, dubbed the King of Sheffieldby the travelling community he came from, was aged just  when he died during a family holiday to Majorca in July . The huge grave stone - which is said to be made of  tonnes of fine Italian marble - has been branded an eyesore and monstrosity by some visitors to the cemetery in Sheffield whoaposve taken issue with its extravagance, Yorkshire Live reports.Council bosses revealed that the headstone had been erected without permission, meaning it may have to be demolished in the future. And now Sheffield City Council has announced they are considering the next steps to address the memorial. The local authority rules that memorials must be under three inches thick and no taller than .ft. Applicants also need to noty the council about materials and proposed inscriptions before permission is granted.  Councillor Alison Teal, executive member for sustainable neighbourhoods, wellbeing, parks and leisure, said: We are aware of a large memorial which has been erected in Shiregreen Cemetery. This memorial was built without permission and we are currently considering our next steps. Cemeteries are a place where people can come, pay their respects and visit loved ones who are no longer with us. We understand memorials are deeply personal, however we must have rules in place to ensure fairness. The stone - which is emblazoned with the word King in large gold letters - has been shared on TikTok since his family unveiled it last Thursday.  But some visitors have no problem with the gravestone at all.Mandy Stratford, who was visiting a loved oneaposs grave at the cemetery, told the BBC : I think itaposs beautul. It doesnapost offend me at all and I think itaposd be a shamethey did take it down.I donapost think itaposs offending anybody in the position itaposs in. If it was in the middle near everyoneaposs loved ones I could understand it. The stone features imposing biblical carvings, a working jukebox playing Willyaposs favourite tunes, and -hour surveillance which acts as a walkie-talkie for his family to converse with him whenever they need. However, many other visitors have branded the stone an eyesore and a monstrosity.  Kelly Greaves said: My husbandaposs cousin has had no end of problems with red tape for her -year-old sonaposs grave. Can’t put this on or that. Yet it’s nothing like this. I’m not saying this is wrong! I’m sayingthis is right then it should be right for everyone and should be equal. Lesley Smith said: How was that monstrosity allowed  Countless times, bereaved parents of young children have had to move teddy bears etc from graves in other cemeteries. Lights and a jukebox in a cemetery whatever next.Willyaposs family spared no expense for his send-off, which featured a procession of Rolls Royce cars and a horse and carriage. The funeral was a massive affair, with hundreds of well-wishers lining the streets to pay their respects, to a man that was very well known in the Darnall area of Sheffield. Meanwhile, Tara Dawn Ellen said that the structure looks hideous and Gill Camidge agreed, commenting: OBSCENE should not be allowed. Let them build their monstrosity on their own land!! And Lorraine Larkings said: How or why are allowed such a big area  If you go over your grave area you soon get a letter to remove it. Peter Bradford said that it is embarrassing that this has been allowed to happen, while Carol Bodham said: What a monstrosity absolutely hideous. And Leslie Wand said that she has been tending to her own daughteraposs grave in Shiregreen Cemetery and has had to put up with the loud music.

Lucky sunbathers on the beach basked in C heat and it will be a similar story on Wednesday while in comparison in Marbella, on the Costa del Sol, it is set to be rainy day with highs of just C. The warm weather is the result of a high pressure system that has moved in from the east and is now settled on the country for the next few days.There is plenty of sunshine ahead and going into the weekend but then there is likely to be an abrupt halt with BBC weather predicting ato “wintry weather”. Maps from WXCharts show temperatures nose-ing next week and could even get as low as -C in Scotland on Friday, April . Snow could also fall across Scotland and northern England on the first weekend of April. But for this week there are glorious temperatures albeit with cold starts to the day. BBC weather forecaster Ben Rich said: “High pressure still close by on Wednesday, it stays mostly dry and with those clear skies overhead quite a chilly start to the day with temperatures down to around freezing and below freezing in a few places. One or two early fog patches around too, they should tend to lt and clear by the early part of the morning and then it is another beautul spring day with y spells of sunshine and the vast majority will stay dry. There is just a small chance of one or two showers popping up in north east Scotland and maybe in the eastern counties of England. Not as breezy as it was on Tuesday across western areas but every bit as warm with top temperatures C to C or even C.” Temperatures are then expected to drop again on Wednesday night to around freezing and fog patches for Thursday. It is not expected to be quite as hot for Thursday and Friday but top temperatures will still be C and then it is also expected to be fine for the weekend. Mr Rich said: High pressure continues to hold firm so despite that extra cloud and the chance of a bit of fog it is going to stay fine and dry with some spells of sunshine. Into next week though we will develop a northerly wind, it will start to feel quite a lot colder and there could even be some wintry showers. UK forecast for the next  days Mostly dry and sunny. Feeling warm. Today: A chilly start but after any early morning fog clears it will be dry for the vast majority with long sunny spells and becoming warm again. Perhaps an isolated shower developing in the east and north later in the afternoon. Tonight: Dry with clear spells, although becoming cloudier in the northwest later. Cold under the clear skies with rural grass frost, and a few fog patches, more especially in eastern England. Thursday: Again mostly dry and warm with sunny spells for many although cloudier than of late in the northwest. A few well scattered showers possible, most likely northeastern England and Scotland. Outlook for Friday to Sunday: Mostly settled with warm sunny spells each day, but cooler near coasts and overnight. Far north cloudier with light rain at times. Some fog patches for north and east coasts.

The plane had to be erted after she became aposdisruptiveapos and reportedly slapped other passengers. One female passenger on board has told The Mirror how her young daughter was left traumatised by the womanaposs foul behaviour and fighting. The Jet flight to Antalya left Manchester at around .am on Monday and was due to arrive in Turkey around four and a half hours later.It was erted to Vienna and landed there around .am, reports the Manchester Evening News . In the video, the irate passenger is seen screaming in the face of a unormed staff member at the front of the plane.  As other flight staff gather around her to aid their colleague, it looks as though she lashes out with her hands against someone seated in the first row. A member of staff can be seen telling her to aposstand backapos, to which she replies: I am back. Sort your head out you. The airline worker says: You are not doing yourself any favours. She replies: Yourapose not doing yourself any favours either. So what have I done  Donapost touch me, donapost ****ing touch me. She adds: What have I done  What have I done wrong on this flight, eh  See, you havenapost got an answer.  Another passenger, who asked only to be named by her first name, Emma, told The Mirror it was about  minutes into the flight when the disruption started. She said: The flight attendant was trying to calm her down. She was being really loud and arguing with the passenger in front of her. That went on for about  minutes. They gave her notice that any more trouble and further action would be taken and were telling her aposweaposre not here to be horrible to anybodyapos. She was not having any of it. She was aggressive and swearing, it was not a nice experience. You didnapost dare look at her. At one point I walked down the aisle to go to the toilet with my little girl and she said aposwhat the f*** are you looking at  Go on, have a f***ing look all of you.apos  Emma said the ‘disruptive’ passenger was “ranting and raving”. She said people made her her aware there were children on board when she was “shouting and swearing” but she “retaliated” and swore more.“She lunged forward and slapped a woman around the face,” Emma added.“A guy got up and calmed her down, who I think had just qualied as a police officer. “It was announced on the tannoy we were making an emergency landing. We landed in Vienna and stayed for about  minutes. “The flight was a nightmare from start to finish. “I was frightened. My daughter was panicking.“Nobody wanted to intervene because they didn’t want to get in trouble”. A witness on the flight said: This was a truly horrible flight for myself and my  children. My little girl was traumatised at the ladyaposs foul behaviour fighting and shouting and swearing. Sheaposs now refusing to fly home due to this it scared her so much. A man can be seen shaking his head at the womanaposs behaviour. Another video clip appears to show the moment armed police officers escorted the woman from the plane. One passenger can be heard to shout: Wait til you get the bill love. Others are shouting bye bye as the woman is led away by armed officers.  A text sent by Jet to passengers onboard the flight shortly before pm said: Hello, we are sorry that due to the disruptive behaviour of a fellow passenger, your flight has been erted to Vienna. We are working on a situation to get you on your way as soon as possible. The flight arrived at its original destination, Antalya, just after pm - one hour and  minutes later than scheduled. A Jet spokesperson said: “We can confirm that flight LS from Manchester to Antalya erted to Vienna yesterday so that a disruptive passenger could be offloaded.

The -year-old, from Tampa, Florida, was admitted to Tampa General hospital in January this year and her condition started to deteriorate rapidly over a two week period due to organ failure.Claire, who was born with a congenital heart condition, was also diagnosed with myocarditis, rhabdomyolysis, mild pneumonia, cyanosis and acidosis, Yahoo News reports.She was given a TandemHeart – which helps to send a steady supply of oxygenated blood to organs – and hours after that was placed on continuous dialysis because of her failing kidneys. As the complications worsened, so did the condition in her leg so doctors performed a fasciotomy to relieve the swelling and pressure. Despite trying to save her legs, the damage was too severe and irreversible, her dad Wayne Bridges revealed. In February Ms Bridges, who is vaccinated, had both legs cut off above the knee. She wasnapost getting circulation to her legs and, because of that, there was a lot of muscle damage, her best friend Heather Valdes told WTVT, Newsweek reported. Doctors also discovered she was bleeding internally resulting in an emergency blood transfusion.They found a very rare lesion in the first part of the small intestines that had ruptured, her dad revealed on Facebook. Luckily they were able to fix it and stop the bleeding. Despite the le-changing event, Ms Bridges remained positive according to family and friends who described her as an amazing young woman and a warrior. Her dad Wayne has detailed his daughteraposs journey on Facebook and revealed on March  that she was finally able to sit up herself for the first time since January. Two months to the day this all started and Claire, for the first time sat up by herself, he wrote on Facebook. It may not seem like a lot, but for this Warrior itaposs a major victory! And for this victory, it looks like our Warrior girl is coming home to her momaposs house today for the rehab phase of her journey. This week, Claire was released from hospital in time for her st birthday. She is very happy to be home around family and friends, Mr Bridges told Newsweek. Itaposs been mentally, emotionally taxing but weaposre hopeful now. She is still facing more challenges but we are focused on having her home. Mr Bridges said his daughter will require ongoing rehab with physical and occupational therapy. She will also need to prepare for prosthetic legs. Mr Bridges set up a GoFundMe page for his daughter with hopes to raise £, which will go towards Claireaposs medical and ongoing recovery expenses. I am so proud of you and inspired by you. You have overcome more in two months than any of us could imagine in a letime, Mr Bridges wrote in a touching tribute on Facebook. You will be climbing again before you know it.

The -year-old from Florida, has been told by his family to pray for Godaposs help. The body modication enthusiast - also known as Neon Demon - said his jawline and ribs were most painful tattoos to sit through, the Daily Star reports.He now has more than  tattoos. He said: “When I first started, I hated the pain and it was more of an obstacle to get past in order to earn the design that I wanted. “Iaposve always been very inspired by art and creative expression from across the world. Once I got started I just kept going and I didnapost want to stop.  “More recently though after getting much bigger work and enduring much longer sessions I discovered that I was starting to enjoy the process and feeling and Iaposm developing the ability to focus my mind into a somewhat trance-like state. “It’s been an interesting process that Iaposm still continuing to explore. “But to answer the question, each body part is dferent in terms of pain levels. My stomach, being my first tattoo ever, felt like the worst pain I had ever endured. “It was asthe needle was penetrating into my abdomen.” And he added: “My jawline and ribs were similar in a dferent way.  But despite feeling more like himself now he’s heavily inked, his family remain perplexed by it. He explained: “My entire extended family hates my tattoos and makes no effort to ever talk to me or reach out ever since I first got the face done. “My parents love me and support me but have told me numerous times that I need to pray for Godaposs help and that they will never understand me. “I am the oldest out of  siblings though and I love all my brothers and sisters more than anything.” “Iaposm open to covering almost the entire surface area of my body with the exception of my genitals - but Iaposm also not in a rush at the moment, he added.  Although he may look intimidating to some, Neon Demon said his favourite tattoo was a “little kitty cat” on his arm because of his love of felines. The body modication fan also compared the process of getting tattooed to a ritual. “Sacred rituals have been around since the beginning of time and they take many forms but for me what makes it so special is the partnership you can form with pain. “Also using pain to achieve something greater and through submitting yourself to it you gain a sense of freedom and strength. “Tattooing to me is an important act of creative expression that allows me to feel like myself and through the years has also helped me learn to better love myself for who I am.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Tattoos\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The Duchess of Cambridge was given a ceremonial welcome yesterday at Kingstonaposs Norman Manley International Airport and eagle-eyed royal fans say claim they saw Kate get shunned by Lisa Hanna, a former Miss World turned politician with the Peopleaposs National Party. Ms Hannaaposs party, led by Mark Golding, is in favour of removing the Queen as head of state as well as lobbying Britain for reparations. The Duchess, , and Ms Hanna chatted during the ceremony, but fans online say they saw a moment that appeared to be frosty where the royal looked like she was trying to speak to the politician only for her to turn away.  Ms Hanna did not smile as Kate quickly dropped her smile and faced forward, they said as a video of the alleged encounter went viral.The clip of this moment was shared widely on Twitter as many said they had second-hand embarrassment.Another tweeted: Yikes!!! The embarrassment! A third added: Oh damn I just felt a huge second-hand embarrassment.Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up . During other parts of the ceremony, the pair were seen chatting and smiling with each other. It could be that Ms Hanna didnapost hear Kate speak to her at that moment.Ms Hanna, who met Prince Harry on his visit to Jamaica in , shared on Instagram they had a pleasant conversation.She wrote: Today I welcomed Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge Kate to Jamaica on behalf of the Leader of the Opposition in celebration of the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee. We had a very interactive and pleasant conversation throughout the proceedings as we talked about family, our cultures and our people. There’s no doubt at this time that we all seek our true independence and want to develop systems  strategies where we become free from the monarchy. But until then we will always remain a courteous and respectful country. I am a firm believer in reparations and as such when I was Minister of Youth and Culture I led the reparations committee which made strides in developing submissions to Britain which examined the economic cost of slavery to our country.  I welcome them wholeheartedly with our warm hospitality, and look forward to us having productive discussions about our future. Prince William and Kate arrived in Jamaica last night as campaigners and leading politicians on the Caribbean island said their visit was “ill-timed and ill-conceived”. The island nation is odds on to be the next British realm to dump the Queen as head of state, following on from Barbados which last year officially became a republic. Prince Charles formally acknowledged the appalling atrocity of slavery in the Caribbean, saying it forever stains our history at the ceremony in Barbados to mark the country’s new beginning.Around  protesters gathered outside the British High Commission in Jamaica yesterday calling for slavery reparations.

He entered the car she was using for the morning school run in Brisbane, Australia, before telling Ms Clarke: I wanted to see my children and telling her to get out.Despite suffering burns to % of her body, brave Hannah managed to summon the energy to tell paramedics and police what happened.An inquest heard how Hannah told first paramedic on the scene, Stephanie Ring: My babies are in the car, my children are in the car. Why didnapost I just stay in the car with them  Baxter, , then took his own le after burning the mum and three children to death.  He had previously rejected an offer to share custody of his three children with Hannah before launching the horric attack. Baxter allegedly kidnapped his six-year-old daughter on Boxing Day last year, which allowed Ms Clarke to get a domestic violence orderagainst him. On the opening day of the inquest, a neighbour described Hannah as amazingly strong, as she tried to stop Baxteraposs attack and save her children. The neighbour told how she heard her screaming: Call the police, heaposs trying to kill me, heaposs put petrol on me. CCTV footage also showed Baxter at a DIY shop buying the jerry can used in the attack, reports NEWS.

The inquest is also set to call witnesses including counsellors and police, who helped Hannah during the breakdown of her marriage - as well as a support worker who took a call from Baxter  hours before he killed his family in . Hannahaposs parents Lloyd and Sue Clarke have since dedicated their lives to preventing domestic abuse and raising awareness.  Mr Clarke told Daily Mail Australia: Rowan must have been lurking somewhere close, either hidden around the side of the house or in the neighbouraposs driveway. His car was found down the street, this was definitely premeditated. Speaking of their grandchildren, they said: They were young, vibrant… beautul people... she loved her children.

From Knapdale, they headed up the west coast, sailing to Lewis and Harris before arriving at their final destination, Iona.Covering almost , miles in the series, they visit places of worship, from pagan stones to an early Christian cave and a contemporary mosque and Sikh temple. The journey tests the pilgrims not just spiritually, but physically too.TV celeb and comedian Scarlett Moffatt, , said: #At school, I spent a lot of time just reading books and on my own and so that’s how I got into faith really. It just felt calming. There’s almost a stigma attached to sort of being religious.#Whenever I would tell my friends, they’d laugh and I’d be like, #why is that funny # I believe in God, there has to be something that started all this.#I would describe myself as Christian, but not a strict Christian. I don’t go to church, but I definitely believe and religion to me is security.#She added: #In my head somebody on a pilgrimage is in a loin cloth and they have really long hair#and they look a bit dehydrated like they need a good moisturiser mask.#I’m doing the pilgrimage as I want to know what my religion is. I want to be able to answer that question with confidence.#TV personality and interior designer Laurence Lewellyn-Bowen describes himself as a #non-conforming pagan#. The -year-old explained: #I think pilgrimage is about clearing out your mental closet by physical exertion and by spiritual conversation with yourself or,you believe it, then conversation with your God.#I know I come across as all sort of flouncy and floppy and rather cavalier, but I am capable of existing in the real world.#However, I don’t think I’ve walked so far not wearing Cuban heels.#Pilgrimage: The Road to the Scottish Isles will be screened on BBC Two and iPlayer in the spring with three one-hour-long episodes, and is a CTVC production."},{"url":null,"title":"shinty round up saturday march 5 2","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowThe new shinty season got up and running with goals galore across the country on Saturday March .Fort William  Kyles Athletic Kyles Athletic came from two goals down to earn a - draw with Fort William in their pm throw-up at An Aird.Kyles travelled with just  players following Robbie Macleod’s late call-off as former Lochcarron player Liam Arnott made his competitive debut for the Cowal outfit.Both keepers # Paul MacKay for Fort William and Kyles Athletic’s John Whyte # made good saves before the hosts took the lead on the stroke of half-time through Cam Stephen.Victor Smith made it - a couple of minutes after the re-start.Kyles got a goal a couple of minutes later through Arnott, his bouncing shot deceiving Paul MacKay.The goal lted Kyles and Conor Kennedy made it - with  minutes remaining, punishing the Fort defenders for not clearing their lines.Kyles laid siege on the Fort goal as they went all out to get the winning goal but to no avail.The sides were also playing for Drew Ferguson Memorial Trophy, won by Fort William after a penalty shoot-out.Inveraray  Glenurquhart Inveraray, relegated from the Premiership at the end of the  season, drew - with promotion hopefuls Glenurquhart at the Winterton.Both goals came in the first half, with Glenurquhart’s Conor Golabek netting on  minutes and Campbell Watt drawing Inveraray level on  minutes.Col Glen P Bute PThe meeting between Col Glen and Bute was called off on Saturday morning when the pitch at Glendaruel failed an inspection.Kilmory  Inveraray After winning the league in , Kilmory welcomed the Inveraray second team to MacRae Park.Joe Anderson got the Lochgilphead side off to a great start with a goal after  minutes, but Euan McMurdo’s th minute strike saw the score level at the break.Ewan Donnan scored what proved to be the winner on the hour for Inveraray.Strachur-Dunoon P Uddingston PThe match at Strachurmore between Strachur-Dunoon and Uddingston was postponed due to lack of pitch preparation time after recent wet weather."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week march 11 2022","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Who am I  What am I  Where am I  How am I  – questions of identity and some of the questions I was left asking when I left a recent meeting.That meeting was part of a world-wide movement – a movement that calls the peoples of the world to pray.Similar questions of identity were raised when I was asked to write ‘a piece’ for this newspaper.

They work well in a sunny or partially shaded area in fertile well-drained soil.Climbing jasmine can be highly scented, with ieties that flower in summer and winter. All produce pretty flowers and are fairly easy to grow against walls or up trellis.There are some fun options for kids to plant such as sunflowers, snapdragons and the four o#clock flower.If you look at a sunflower, you can’t help but smile. Not only does it remind us of the sun, but its head will track the sun through the sky.Snapdragons are great because they come in a iety of colours and sizes, and you can pinch the blossoms so they open and shut just like a dragon’s mouth.Snapdragon flowers are specically designed for bumblebees, which are just the right weight to trip the opening mechanism of the lower lip of the flower to gain access to the nectar.The four o#clock flower, also known as the marvel of Peru, is a bushy plant with trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, yellow or white.The fragrant flowers don’t open until late afternoon, around four o’clock # so they are good for telling the time.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to start sowing tomatoes, so you can enjoy them throughout the summer.You will need rich, fertile soil or peat-free potting compost, and a good sunny, sheltered spot. Water regularly and feed regularly once the plants start to flower.Tomatoes are split into two main growing types # bush and cordon. Bush types are usually planted in containers and their stems trail around the edge. Cordon types are trained to grow tall, supported by a cane or stake and will require pinching out.Growing tomatoes from seed is best done under cover, into seed trays, then when the seedlings get to -cm tall transplant to small cm pots. Keep potting on as they grow in size.They can be planted outside with cane supports once the last frosts have gone, so around May time.For best results, choose trusted ieties like Gardener#s Delight, Money Maker or Sweet Olive.As usual, April really kick-starts the gardening season.According to the Royal Horticultural Society, spring is finally in evidence as daffodils and flowering trees start to bloom. Expect the inevitable April showers but with sunny days too, when you can turn your attention to the lawn.It#s an exciting month, with indoor-sown seeds well into growth, and it#s also time to start sowing outdoors. Just watch out for frosts.Top three jobs this month:"},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll boosts oban ahead of slockavullin final","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowA group of five young Mid Argyll rugby players were in action last weekend as part of Oban Lorne under-s in the semi final of the West Youth Shield.The result of the match on Sunday March  didn#t go their way, as opponents East Kilbride ran out  #  winners, but it was a good contest and close game until Oban players sustained a few injuries and East Kilbride scored a couple of breakaway tries.Oban Lorne and the Mid Argyll contingent # Rhys Coffield, Murray MacDonald, Vinnie Buckley, James Campbell and Sorley Self # have had a great season, winning their West under- development league, so there is plenty for the lads to be proud of.If anyone would like to enjoy some rugby this weekend, Mid Argyll under- boys will be playing on Saturday March  in the final of the West Youth Chairman#s Trophy against Kilmarnock RFC at Slockavullin.

This trio has four movements, each depicting the small town of Craftsbury, Vermont.Up Country Toccata, The Lark in the Morning, You Can Buy It at the General Store, to the final movement Craftsbury Common depicting the green with a white picket fence.The movements are as descriptive as their titles and show many dferent skills on all instruments # fluttering sounds, jazz harmonies, numerous glissandos, syncopation, decorations and finishing with gentle rhythmic tapping.There is even a hint of Rhapsody in Blue in the third movement. If you only listen to one piece again this is the one and should be seen live,possible, and not just listened to.Rachmaninov’s Prelude in B minor for solo piano was Claire’s choice for the programme.This prelude, The Bell was Rachmaninov’s own favourite and was the one that he would often perform. The audience was delighted to be introduced to it by Claire.Brahms composed four chamber works which featured the clarinet later in le after a period when he wasn’t writing anything at all.This was the third trio of the evening and was again very dferent in style allowing Jenner , Harrietand Claireto demonstrate their considerable skills as a trio to a very appreciative audience.An arrangement of Consolation No. by Liszt for Trio Ecossaise was their encore.This was the second visit by Trio, and it is only a matter of time before they are welcomed back.There are two MAAA concerts planned for April # The Willow Trioand the Ugly Bug Ragtime Three.

to access cash as a result of this trend, and encourage banks to think twice about the impact closing branches is having on our communities”MSP Rachael Hamilton added: “The news about the Bank of Scotland closure in Selkirk is concerning.“Decisions to close banks affect local communities badly and I am disappointed at this decision, given it has a pronounced effect on elderly people”.“When a bank leaves a town or village, it does take a leline away for many people.“It has a knock on impact on local businesses and the high street too.“There will be one-on-one meetings with those who use the bank regularly to help them make alternative arrangements, however this never takes away from the inconvenience for customers.“This is disappointing news for Selkirk and local residents, who rely

For a time the ships could only see each other on the radar screen.Coxswain Duncan Newlands, who knows this dreaded part of the estuary like the back of his hand, edged his leboat in astern of the coaster and proceeded to begin operations, but at .am came this dramatic message over the leboat’s radio: ‘Arrived alongside casualty at .hours got rope aboard and commenced towing at . hours.‘Rope now parted. Returning alongside St Kentigern for further instructions.’There was a lull in the activities while the leboat resumed its operations. They tried again- without success.Then came the news at . hours – ‘St Kentigern Refloated.’The leboat has succeeded in its third attempt, against odds.The St Kentigern then proceeded to Campbeltown under her own power, while the leboat escorted her, but first it took in tow the coaster’s own leboat, which it had earlier lowered over the port side in case of an emergency.The Ardchattern also accompanied the Saint Kentigern to Campbeltown.Meantime, the two remaining ships, Lairdsdale and Brora, seeing their attendance was no longer required, sent a parting signal of good-luck to the coaster and continued on their respective passages to towards the Irish Coast."},{"url":null,"title":"information is key in kintyre","story":"Campbeltown-based Keeping it local CICis introducing the screens up and down the peninsula, including Tarbert and on the Isle of Gigha.A spokesperson for the community interest company said: #With the support of fantastic businesses all over we are able to provide up-to-date information on events, news, travel and destination areas to visit all around the area at the touch of a button.#The work we do is also supported by advertising on our screens while promoting your own business offerings.#The boards should be up and running by April, all being well.The aim of Keeping it local CIC is to support businesses, trades, services and events by collating information and bringing all that Kintyre has to offer under one roof # a one-stop-shop for the consumer and businesses.The Tarbert information boards are due to be located at One Fyne Deli and at The Gather restaurant."},{"url":null,"title":"island residents and friends have a happy 20th gigha day","story":"Celebrations were in full swing this week as residents on the Isle of Gigha marked  years of community ownership.After extensive community fundraising alongside securing grants and loans from Highlands and Islands Enterprise and the National Lottery, Gigha was purchased by the community for the sum of £m on March  .On this day the island was handed over to the Isle of Gigha Heritage Trusta day that is marked on the island every year as #Gigha Day#.To commemorate this -year milestone all Gigha residents and key island stakeholders were invited to watch Gigha’s eldest female resident Ina McNeill raise the island flag on Tuesday.This was followed by a display from the pupils of Gigha Primary School and a performance by the Kintyre Schools Pipe Band, who made the journey over from Campbeltown to attend.The Isle of Gigha Hotel then welcomed the guests for refreshments and to view a display of island memorabilia and photographs from the past  years.Since the buyout the permanent population of the island has grown from around  up to  residents.This has been achieved through housing renovations and new affordable housing, coupled with increased economic development.Gigha has several businesses which support employment on the island and IGHT now employs  people across its office, maintenance team, Achamore Gardens, new campsite, marketing, and ranger service.This includes two apprentices who are contributing to the restoration of Achamore Gardens.The trust is managed by a board of voluntary directors who are elected by the membership to develop the assets of the island and take forward plans and projects for the community.IGHT  retains ownership of the majority of the built and land assets of the island, worth over £m.Since the buy-out in  IGHT has renovated  houses as part of an ongoing investment programme, sold  plots for private self-build development, developed four wind turbines which help fund development, installed moorings and pontoon facilities, successfully marketed Gigha’s tourism assets as well as working to protect and conserve Gigha’s heritage and environment.One of the trust’s biggest challenges has been managing its financial position.The trust’s debt levels increased to £.m in  after taking out loans to deliver housing renovations.This debt burden is now reduced to £,, which has been achieved through asset sales and income from its renewable and trading companies.The trust has a number of projects underway including a new campsite, km of new and upgraded path networks, on-site and online heritage interpretation, five new housing units, and a -year restoration plan for Achamore Gardens.The trust is actively trying to reduce the island#s carbon footprint through  e-bikes for hire from the activity centre and is also soon to install the island#s first electric vehicle charging point."},{"url":null,"title":"leader march 11 2022 2","story":"So the Scottish Government remains adamant in its decision to ban creelers from the Clyde for the next two months or so.We#re not talking North Sea trawlers here that can go where in the interim.

Baby young cod are not caught in prawn creels. The scientists at the Rural Affairs Committee meeting on March  said that there was zero evidence for creels to be included in the ban, and that the previous evidence cited on the Scottish Government website had now been removed.Our MSP represented to the creel fishermen in Campbeltown that she would:.    Seek a relaxation of the ban to enable the creel fishermen to continue to work as per the scientic evidence advice..    Seek compensation for the creel fishermen for almost three months loss of income.However, in the event she VOTED.    To keep the ban in place.    Against compensation.This is absolutely duplicitous. Duplicity#s original meaning in English has to do with a kind of deception in which true feelings or intentions are hidden behind  words or actions.I wouldn’t blame the children of South Sudanthey just gave up.One third are suffering chronic malnutrition.

That all has planning approval and work will proceed on site before the summer. However, a group of concerned parents were at the same time looking for a site to locate a skate park and pump track in Dunbar they did a presentation to the community council on their ideas. I have for the last several months been working with these parents and iniduals.We are aware that skateboarding and BMX bikes are now Olympic sports and the idea of linking these facilities with the fantastic sporting facilities we have at Hallhill developed into the idea of locating it on the land we have available at Lochend. We have been developing this idea and, along with the changing rooms, we feel that a community cafe would be fantastic for our young people when they use this area. It would provide some supervision for the area and provide toilets and refreshments for the people using the facility.We are all aware of the anti-social behaviour that has been taking place within our community. Our young people are currently using Lochend Woods at nights and over the weekends to meet up but have no supervision and are getting involved in anti-social behaviour. We see lots of complaints about our young people on social media and now all young people have been banned from using McDonald’s in the evenings. The situation will not improve and will become dangerous unless we do something to support them. We need to provide these young people somewhere they can meet up in a safe area along with some supervision.The outdoor activity can be used by anyone despite their age, sex or ability. I would expect to see adults and children using this facility at the same time along with some quality coaching in all activities. We are fortunate in Dunbar that many of our young people use skateboards, scooters, roller skates and bikes they will all benefit from using this facility. My hope is all our young people can feel this is a place they can come and feel safe and be involved, or just sit in the cafe with friends for a chat.As for the woodland, I am fully committed to doing everything I can to protect it and the wildle within it. We need to find a way of engaging with our young people to respect it and support the work we need to do protect it and its wildle. I hope the new centre will make young people think they are part of the community woodland and will want to be involved.I am committed to delivering this project on the ground quickly, as I did with the Hallhill Sports Complex that was £ million.

Today they are front page news, displacing the latest bulletins from a nation fighting for its le against a new, frightful version of fascism.What kind of mindset can that be – navel-gazing about a timeline while the rest of the world focuses on Russia, Ukraine and how to prevent more human suffering, and aworld war Don’t we have enough international disgrace already, from a UK Government compromised by decades of corrupt Russian money-laundering through the City of London, from its “hostile environment” policies towards refugees, from its cynical Brexit lies  That same verbally incontinent Prime Minister has just horrically compared Ukraine’s fight for its le to his Brexit, so that on this day, having aroused international revulsion, he has caused the UK to be excluded from a European summit on Ukraine.Of course I believe the timing of a referendum on Scottish independence takes second place for most people in Scotland just now, while we try to counteract the shameful behaviour of Westminster towards Ukraine and all refugees.The ghastly motivation of that “poll” however – and the rotten aftermath – has just confirmed how desperately Scotland needs her own voice Europe and the rest of the world would surely be very glad of it too.Frances McKie, Evanton.* DR Jonathan Eyal thinks sidelining democracy in Scotland will displease and deter Vladimir Putin from his machinations: this after President Putin was “recruited” by David Cameron in .I doubt Scotland looms large in Mr Putin’s calculations, when he has already, inexplicably, elected to make Russia a pariah state. Independence for Scotland will hardly render the “rump UK” much weaker, given there would certainly be a negotiated short-term accommodation for Trident.The Union has been a disaster, Scotland having been stripped of its commercial industrial assets its population and economy stagnant for a century. Other than Trident, Scotland retains no military presence of any strategic value.Dr Eyal should yoke his enviable intellectual powers to the task of guessing what Mr Putin’s next play, or endgame is. One thing is certain – it has zero relevance to Scotland’s democratic future.GR Weir, Ochiltree.CURRENCY NOT A PROBLEM FOR SCOTLANDJILL Stephensonis in a time warp over currency in an independent Scotland.Several European countries have created and launched a new currency quickly and effectively, under far more dficult circumstances than would be the case with Scotland leaving the UK. Establishing a central bank, to manage the new currency, is a task that many other countries have managed successfully and sometimes even before they are fully independent.Every country in the world uses its own currency, or one tied to a fully-convertible counter, and finds no trouble in doing so. In an independent Scotland our citizens would use whatever currency was accepted in shops, bars, online shopping, investments and tax payments. Like some other countries, Scotland could even run multiple currencies, as the technology is there to handle multicurrency transactions. Banks are perfectly capable of issuing multicurrency accounts.As one of the wealthiest countries on the planet, Scotland will choose the currency option best suited to our needs, but in a situation like the Covid- pandemic, having one’s own independent currency would have allowed Scotland to borrow and continue with widescale testing while supporting the economy without having to beg the UK to borrow on our behalf.Mary Thomas, Edinburgh.OUR NATION IS TOTALLY DIVIDEDAS we approach  years of SNP rule in Scotland and with local elections in May, it is worth considering what has happened in Scotland over these years. Unfortunately it is a reflection that is deeply troubling for our nation.We are governed by a political party with a single mission and focus to the detriment of all , as demonstrated by a list too long to describe in full. Some of these failures are hugely impactful on the everyday lives of voters – in education, health, transport and the economy. Year after year we are promised that things will get better but we have higher taxes, quangos everywhere and a Government bereft of ideas save that independence will cure all our ills.However, the most disappointing and, yes, hurtful result of this last  years of SNP rule is how, as a once proud and indeed global nation, we have become completely ided, insular and look to blame all our ills on someone . A grievance culture is alive and well in our nation. We now have ided families, friends and colleagues to a degree that one questions whether that ision can ever be healed regardless of whether another independence referendum is held.The conceit and arrogance demonstrated on a daily basis by this utterly incompetent Government must stop. The only way to show our contempt is to give the SNP a very bloody nose in the May local elections.Richard Allison, Edinburgh.NATO SHOULD MAKE PUTIN THINKNATO’s stance of ruling out any intervention in Ukraine makes Vladimir Putin believe he can get off with anythinghe doesn’t attack Nato members. This could lead to him continuing to flatten Ukrainian cities and annexing the whole of Ukraine into the Russian Federation. He might then move against Georgia and Moldova, both outside Nato and already containing Russian-backed separatist enclaves and troops. These conquests might let Russia build up its economy and military to a level where it and China could challenge Nato.Sanctions aren’t guaranteed to work. North Korea has been under draconian sanctions intended to stop its nuclear weapons programme for decades. Yet it’s built an estimated  to  warheads, with capability to make seven more annually.Nato should change its publicly-stated position to considering its options in Ukraine. And make it clear the reasons include war crimes like indiscriminate rocket fire and targeting of civilians Russian forces not allowing civilians to escape to EU countries, and not allowing aid, food and water into cities they are besieging plus the lack of a negotiated peace deal between Russia and Ukraine after a month of war.This could put enough doubt in President Putin’s mind to make him agree a negotiated peace that he could sell as victory to the Russian public by getting Donetsk, Luhansk, Crimea, and a neutral Ukraine, but leaving it an independent country with an elected government.Nato should also warn any use of tactical nuclear weapons would have military consequences.But Volodymyr Zelenskyy should also offer to lt the suspension of Ukrainian parties which back joining a trade bloc with Russia rather than the EU as part of any peace deal. If President Putin thinks no government can be elected backing this policy in Ukraine, a peace deal is less likely.Duncan McFarlane, Carluke.* I THOUGHT everyone was entitled to a fair trial under our ever so fair democratic values.So how would Vladimir Putin fare under a Special War Crimes Court, such as proposed by Gordon Brown and others Joe Biden, the President of the United States, no less, and Boris Johnson, the Prime Minister of the UK, and many other leaders under the influence of the US, of course, have already declared that Vladimir Putin is a war criminal. No need for a trial, then.Liz Truss, to her credit, refused to call President Putin a “war criminal”.

Orkney Islands Council has announced that it will be installing card payment machines in its car parks, thanks to a boost from the Scottish Government.New ticket machines being installed in the coming weeks will offer contactless and chip and pin card payments.Work to install the machines – which will also accept coins – starts from Monday  March.The new machines are fully funded by the Scottish Government Place Based Investment Programme Capital Fund.All new machines are expected to be in place by the end of March.OIC’s roads support manager, Kenny Roy, said: “The existing machines require more and more maintenance now and are due to be replaced.“The option to pay by card has been a growing request over the past few years from our community and visitors, so we’re pleased to have secured funding from the Scottish Government to help us invest in that option.”Once works start, there will be periods during the installation of new power supplies and of the new machines, when parking in the car parks affected will be free of charge due to temporary unavailability of the machines.All other conditions of the car park order will continue to apply and be enforced, such as maximum stays and parking within marked bays.Drivers are being asked by the council to continue to use the bays in the short stay “pay and display” car parks for a maximum of three hours to ensure a turnover of available spaces. You should always check whether the machine is working and not assume free parking is available.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The day is open to all ages and sexes, so please bring your kids along also.”Previously, Orkney enjoyed success in the North of Scotland Cricket Association.Mr Rae continues: “If we can get back to that level, it’d be a huge bonus. At this stage it’s just baby steps, andthe interest is enough, we’d like to resurrect the indoor winter league, which hasn’t been played since  .“If there is enough interest over in Caithness, we’d like to get the inter-county going too. The tours we used to do in August were also very popular, playing a game at Balmoral Castle in Aberdeenshire while the royal family was in residence.”Communication through their Facebook page has been encouraging, boosting Mr Rae and others that there is renewed interest in raising the profile of the sport once more.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

After Easter — from April  — we will stop recommending that people who don’t have symptoms, should test for COVID.“This change will apply across the population — including in most workplaces and in early years centres, schools, universities and colleges.“Then, at the end of April, routine testing will end — even for people who have symptoms.“At that time, physical test sites will close — although some mobile testing units and capacity will be retained for possible future use. Contact tracing will also end.“Free testing will not generally be available to the wider population. Instead, our advice will be thatyou have symptoms of COVID — or indeed symptoms of the flu, or any other infectious illness — you should stay at home in order to aid your recovery.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

More pay cuts will increase the already serious teacher recruitment and retention problems that are clearly impacting negatively on children and young people’s education. The Government’s plan to inflict more real terms pay cuts is a damaging and dogmatic political choice.”She also said that Mr Sunak’s decision not to increase education funding to account for inflation signals “ato the austerity of the s”.The Department for Education said in its submission to the School Teacher Review Bodythat it wants statutory starting pay to increase by .% this year and .% next year.But the proposed increases for more experienced teachers are lower at % in  and % in , equating to an average rise of just under % across all teachers, the Institute for Fiscal Studiescalculated earlier in March.The IFS said that given rising levels of inflation, the proposals for teacher pay would see a real terms cut of % for more experienced staff between  and .Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said he was “disappointed” that financial pressures facing schools had not been addressed amid rising inflation rates.“We are disappointed that the Chancellor failed to address the financial pressures facing the education system amidst soaring inflation, and the fact that many experienced teachers and leaders will see the real value of their pay fall under the Government’s current pay proposals,” he said.“Schools are reporting huge increases in their energy bills and the Government expects them to fund pay awards out of these stretched budgets too.”He said he is “gravely concerned” that schools are facing a fresh funding crisis “compounded by the inadequacy of the proposed pay award for many staff which comes after a pay freeze and is likely to worsen retention rates”."},{"url":null,"title":"clarkes-captaincy-contenders-meet-lethal-lewandowski---scotland-talking-points  \n","story":"Data ed from the Piano meterActive meterExpired callback event.As a subscriber, you are shown % less display advertising when reading our articles.Those ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local services.

In a period when they had fixtures in three consecutive months between September and November at the end of last year, Steve Clarke’s team won six games in a row as they motored into the World Cup play-off spot. With more than four months having elapsed since their last game – a rousing - win at home to Denmark – the manager will be hoping his team can somehow pick up where they left off.The absence of Scotland captain Andy Robertson for Thursday’s game as he recovers from Covid has served to highlight just how many natural leaders Clarke has in his squad. Asked who would skipper the team against Poland, the manager said on Wednesday afternoon he had not yet made that call as he had too many contenders to choose from. While it is likely Clarke has already made his decision privately, a genuine case could be made for at least half a dozen other players in the group to wear the armband. Premier League trio Scott McTominay, Kieran Tierney and John McGinn are all bedrocks of the squad with natural leadership skills, while Craig Gordon, Callum McGregor and Grant Hanley are all long-serving internationals who captain their respective clubs. vw,vw,px, px\"Ukraine were at Hampden in the Euros last summer The poignant aspect of this fixture will not be lost on anyone involved. Scotland should have been playing a high-stakes World Cup play-off semi-final against Ukraine at Hampden on Thursday, with Poland due to play their play-off semi in Russia the following night. The Russian invasion of Ukraine led to both of those matches being called off, with Russia kicked out of the World Cup and Ukraine’s trip to Glasgow postponed until June. Thursday’s friendly between Scotland and Poland was hastily arranged as a result, and £ from each ticket sold will be donated to UNICEF UK’s emergency appeal for Ukraine.  for further information.\" srcset\"https:image.assets.pressassociation.io v image production fcaeebeeecdaYudGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQMDINjMw ..jpg w w, https:image.assets.pressassociation.io v image production fcaeebeeecdaYudGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQMDINjMw ..jpg w w, https:image.assets.pressassociation.io v image production fcaeebeeecdaYudGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQMDINjMw ..jpg w w\" sizes\" vw,vw,px, px\"Robert Lewandowski scored twice on his last visit to Hampden Scotland’s defenders will be tested to the extreme against arguably the most dangerous striker in world football. Robert Lewandowski may be  but he is currently in the form of his le, operating on an extraordinary level. The prolic Pole’s double for Bayern Munich against Union Berlin last weekend took his tally for the season to  goals at club level, while it also means he has now scored at least  goals for club and country in each of his last three seasons. Lewandowski scored a double on his only previous visit to Hampden – a - draw in a Euro  qualier in October  – and will fancy his chances of rippling the net against the Scots once more.It will be interesting to see how Billy Gilmour fares in the Scotland midfield having endured a chastening season on loan at Norwich. Despite a relative lack of first-team action, the -year-old Cha player has made a stunning start to his international career since his debut last summer. The hope for everyone concerned was that regular game time at club level this season would see the midfielder kick on to new heights. However, his loan move to Norwich has not gone to plan. Starting  games in total for a team struggling at the foot of the Premier League, Gilmour has been the subject of criticism from sections of the Canaries support for his underwhelming performances and has slipped to the periphery of the team over the past month. Scotland fans will be hoping his tough times at Carrow Road have not diminished his ability to influence matches on the international stage."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-new-borders-cases-shown-latest-government-data   \n","story":"Data ed from the Piano meterActive meterExpired callback event.As a subscriber, you are shown % less display advertising when reading our articles.Those ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local services.

Chan School of Public Health and Massachusetts General Hospital in the US looked at data for , pre-, peri- and post-menopausal women, who underwent a raft of tests and health checks.They found that, among women of the same age, those who were post-menopausal experienced a bigger increase in blood sugar levels after eating a carbohydrate-rich meal – pushing up their risk of heart disease and type  diabetes.Post-menopausal women were also found to have more weight around their stomachs, have higher levels of inflammation, higher cholesterol and higher blood pressure than pre-menopausal women.Published as a pre-print in The Lancet medical journal, the study further found that post-menopausal women consumed more sugar and reported poorer sleep compared with pre-menopausal women, thereby increasing their risk of type  and type  diabetes, obesity and heart disease.Dr Sarah Berry, senior author of the study, lead nutritional scientist at ZOE and associate professor in nutritional sciences at King’s College London, said: “Our research shows that menopause is a time of major metabolic upheaval, which can have signicant impact on long-term health.”She told the PA news agency that, based on the research, “modying our diet could have a favourable impact on many of these unfavourable changes”.She added: “What our research shows is, that even in an aged-matched group,you are post-menopausal, you have an unfavourable increase in blood sugar after consuming a carbohydrate-rich meal. It’s an effect due to menopause.“Therefore, women may wish to be more mindful about the type of carbohydrates they are consuming.“This could mean moving away from highly-refined carbohydrates and processed foods that contain them – so thinking carefully about bakery, some confectionery goods, and some staples such as bread, pasta and rice.“We’re not saying people shouldn’t consume these but, for example,you consume them with a fat like olive oil, or a protein, that will help reduce the glycaemic response.“So, you could eat these foods with protein or fat, or make swaps to wholegrain ieties. One change might be choosing rye bread, for example, rather than white or wholemeal.“Or ask yourselfyou’d be happy having pulses instead of rice  If not, then you could choose wholegrain rice.“We can also promote a healthy microbiome through eating a iety of plant-based foods in the diet that are unprocessed.“For example, you could include berries, leafy greens, nuts and pulses. Also, fermented foods such as Greek yoghurt, particularly the full fat and unsweetened iety.“What this study shows is that we’re not a prisoner of the menopause – we can do something about it.”The menopause is defined as the point in time when a woman has not had a period in  months. It usually occurs naturally and most often after the age of .The gut microbiome is made up of trillions of micro-organisms including bacteria and fungi and is known to affect aspects of health such as the immune system and digestion."},{"url":null,"title":"colin-graves-vows-back-yorkshire-reforms-egm-says-club-must-move-on  \n","story":"Data ed from the Piano meterActive meterExpired callback event.As a subscriber, you are shown % less display advertising when reading our articles.Those ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local services.

They’ve lost their jobs and there is anger and shock and I completely understand.“We needed fundamental change to make us viable. This was an incredibly dficult decision that we wrestled with but once we knew it was the only way to save the business, we had to act.“All other routes led to the closure of PO Ferries. I wish there was another way and I’m sorry.”Peter Hebblethwaite will appear before a joint hearing of the Transport and Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy committees on Thursday.Protests were held in Dover and Liverpool on Wednesday against the sackings, which have been widely condemned by union leaders and politicians.Other witnesses being questioned on Thursday will include Professor Alan Bogg, Professor of Labour Law at University of Bristol, Mark Dickinson, General Secretary of Nautilus International, Dean Beale, Chief Executive of the Insolvency Service, Brian Johnson, Chief Executive of the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, Katy Ware, Director of UK Maritime Services, transport minister Robert Courts and business minister Paul Scully.Huw Merriman and Darren Jones, who chair the committees, said: “This session will aim to understand the detail of the options available to the  workers who were roundly dismissed by PO Ferries last week.“The cruel nature of their dismissal put employment practices and UK plc under the microscope.“From PO Ferries, our members want to know why this action has been taken and how it can be justied.“From the Government and its agencies, we want confirmation that our laws are not being broken and safety is not being compromised on our ships.“This shocking story has raised questions about UK employment law, safety practices, the support of this business through a pandemic and the redress available. We intend to hear from the key players about what they are going to do that means these workers are not left high and dry.”Rail, Maritime and Transport union general secretary Mick Lynch said: “Under pressure from Keir Starmer, the Prime Minister said that PO Ferries had broken the law by falling to give the government adequate notice of the redundancies – he has in effect called PO Ferries liars as the company said earlier today they have not broken the law.“But while the PM said they are taking PO to court in the same breath he refused Keir Starmer’s demand of economic sanctions against PO owners, DP world, to enforce the reinstatement of PO workers.“It is DP world that have given the instructions to makes the mass sackings and break the law, so it is appalling that the government is scared to take action against DP World.“Of course PO need to be taken to court but that by itself won’t get our members’ jobs back. We need emergency action and legislationnecessary to enforce the reinstatement of our members.”Mr Lynch described the PO statement as a “half hearted apology” and again urged the company to reverse the sackings and reinstate the workers.Nautilus said in a statement: “Our members deserve decent employment with decent employers and our work, which has been ongoing for over  years, will continue to this end.“However, PO Ferries have sunk themselves legally and reputationally. They broke the law, and no end of legal tautology will change that.“Nautilus International now expects the Government to take all possible action against these law breakers, who think they can buy silence and bully seafarers into unemployment or accepting lower wages and detrimental and unsafe terms and conditions of employment.”"},{"url":null,"title":"julian-assange-marrying-stella-moris-hmp-belmarsh   \n","story":"Data ed from the Piano meterActive meterExpired callback event.As a subscriber, you are shown % less display advertising when reading our articles.Those ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local services.

Restricted numbers were permitted at the wake and funeral.Laurence was  years old, but fit and strong for his age.His daughter Cathy believes “ he hadn’t got Covid, he’d be doing well – he had a good few years ahead of him”.It was bittersweet for her family when Tyrone won the All-Ireland title last September.James, who said he had considered “not going back to football” when Laurence passed, was persuaded to go to the final that day with a friend, but it was an emotional event for all.Laurence’s other son, Conleth, has a poignant memory of his dad being at Tyrone’s winning All-Ireland final in .“After the game was over, he gave me a hug but there was a couple in front of us from Kerry with a young lad of about eight years old, and he was balling and crying.“My father leaned over and he said, ‘Listen, you will win many more.

She has been nominated twice for the Royal Television Society award for presenter of the year.More recently, she made cameo appearances reading news bulletins in the hit Channel  comedy Derry Girls.Announcing her departure on Twitter, she said: “It is with deep sadness that, after almost  years, I am leaving the job that I love and resigning from BBC Northern Ireland with immediate effect.“Because this is the subject of ongoing tribunal and other legal proceedings, I am not able to respond to any questions or comments about my reason for leaving the organisation.”It is thought the journalist would no longer be the first-choice presenter for the flagship Newsline programme and would also have been required to work on Radio Ulster shows. Read MoreDonna Traynor back on the BBC – but as a character in comedy Give My Head PeaceDonna Traynor taking ‘age bias case’ against BBC, corporation insider claimsMost ReadCharles and Camilla greeted by schoolchildren on first visit to Co Tyrone townBBC bids to keep Donna Traynor talks out of public domainCost of living crisis: Young Belfast mum in tears over using food banks to feed familyEveryone will want a peek at £.m Co Down manor at mountainBelfast roads closed due to collapse of sewersTop VideosPlayExample of Javelin anti-tank missiles being sent to Ukraine\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming be .ece AUTOCROP wh bt_KS_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming be .ece AUTOCROP wh bt_KS_.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayCharles and Camilla visit CS Lewis Square in east Belfast PlayCharles and Camilla greeted by schoolchildren on first visit to Cookstown Latest Northern IrelandEamonn Holmes praises vigilant cops after being pulled over on way to workBrother of Bloody Sunday victim hopes Solider F ruling is ‘step closer to justice’Mapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averageRoyal visit: Curtain call for Prince Charles at Belfast’s Grand Opera HouseSurplus PPE being sent from NI to help with Ukrainian crisisLatestDurham students target open days in protest over Rod Liddle speechDeltacron and Stealth Omicron dferences explained as Covid infections in UK surge againWhich weapons have been sent to Ukraine by the UK Colin Graves vows to back Yorkshire reforms at EGM and says club must ‘move on’Wales star George North not ‘too far away’ from comeback despite setbacks,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

According to the Commission, all MLAs were surveyed to assess the demand for the service and it agreed during a meeting last month “that the responses to the survey indicated that there was sufficient demand for the provision of simultaneous interpretation of Assembly business, as directed by the Assembly”.“Work on the practical arrangements, to put in place the simultaneous interpretation system has been, and is under way. The arrangements fall under two main categories, namely the equipment and infrastructure, and the personnel needed to provide the interpretation service,” a Commission spokesperson said.“With regard to the equipment and infrastructure, some of the equipment has already been delivered, installed and tested, with the balance of the equipment due in early April.“The required building and facilitation works, will be completed in a timely way, so that the simultaneous interpretation service can be operational at the start of the new mandate.”Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Installing the translation system in the Assembly chamber is estimated to cost around £,, while the annual running cost of the service will be around £,.The Commission said: “In relation to the personnel needed to deliver the interpretation service, three members of staff are required for each of the two languages, in order to provide and develop a consistent and secure service, meaning six in total.“Draft job descriptions have been prepared and the next stage will be to issue those to recruitment agencies.“The interpreters will initially be engaged on a temporary basis, with the level of service provision subsequently reviewed in line with the Assembly’s direction.”TUV leader Jim Allister has branded the plans “needless” and “farcical”, while the SDLP’s Patsy McGlone, on the other hand, “wholeheartedly” welcomed the news the service will be available from the beginning of the next mandate, although he was disappointed it has taken so long.“This will be a meaningful step for Irish language and Ulster Scots speakers across the North, not least the MLAs who will be looking to take advantage of these services. We have a growing number of Irish language speakers in the Assembly and will no doubt have more in future who will be able to make good use of it,” he said.“As a fluent Irish language speaker myself I know how much this will mean to our Irish language community who have been treated as second best for far too long. I hope this will be an important step to the introduction of full language rights for both our Irish and Ulster Scots communities, as agreed in NDNA.”People Before Profit MLA Gerry Carroll added: “Whilst it’s regrettable that this has taken such a long time to deliver and implement this, I fully support the provision of simultaneous translation services.“It’s important that English isn’t the only language heard in the Assembly chamber and other languages are spoken and catered for.”Related topicsNorthern Ireland AssemblyPatsy McGloneGerry CarrollJim AllisterMore On Northern Ireland AssemblyStormont watchdog ‘disappointed’ majority of recommendations by RHI Inquiry still not implemented PremiumMalachi O#DohertyOpinionSinn Fein’s mix of strategy and self-delusion is a recipe for confusion PremiumSome Northern Ireland firms feeling effects of sanctions on Russia PremiumClaire McNeillyOpinionDUP now a party that appears to be making it up as it goes along PremiumCall for unionist parties to stand aside in west Belfast for community candidate in Assembly electionMost ReadCharles and Camilla greeted by schoolchildren on first visit to Co Tyrone townEveryone will want a peek at £.m Co Down manor at mountainBelfast roads closed due to collapse of sewersCost of living crisis: Young Belfast mum in tears over using food banks to feed familyBarry’s confirms Easter reopening as Portrush amusements set toas Curry’s Fun ParkTop VideosPlayExample of Javelin anti-tank missiles being sent to Ukraine\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming be .ece AUTOCROP wh bt_KS_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming be .ece AUTOCROP wh bt_KS_.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayCharles and Camilla visit CS Lewis Square in east Belfast PlayCharles and Camilla greeted by schoolchildren on first visit to Cookstown Latest Northern IrelandEamonn Holmes praises vigilant cops after being pulled over on way to workBrother of Bloody Sunday victim hopes Solider F ruling is ‘step closer to justice’Mapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averageRoyal visit: Curtain call for Prince Charles at Belfast’s Grand Opera HouseSurplus PPE being sent from NI to help with Ukrainian crisisLatestSimple food swaps ‘could help women through the menopause’Clarke’s captaincy contenders meet lethal Lewandowski – Scotland talking pointsJulian Assange marrying Stella Moris at HMP BelmarshVoice recorder found in wreckage of China Eastern planeHealth board: Covid crisis ‘as serious as it gets’ with record hospital cases,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Photo: Justin FarrellyChristopher LeebodyTwitterEmailMarch   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailThe Secretary of State Brandon Lewis has rejected criticism that plans to introduce a US-style visa waiver document for journeys across the border into Northern Ireland will impact on free movement on the island.Responding to Irish Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney, Mr Lewis said there would be “no controls on the border” and reiterated that “UK and Irish citizens will continue to be able to travel freely”.It comes as Sinn Fein’s President Mary Lou McDonald said the Taoiseach Micheal Martin should “pick up the phone to Boris Johnson today” over the matter.Ms McDonald said the plan “undermines the Good Friday Agreement and the Common Travel Area, and creates signicant restrictions on freedom of movement on our island.”“Are we really suggesting that Polish people who live and work in Lford now need papers to travel to Strabane, or from Emyvale to Aughnacloy  she added.“It will be devastating for the tourism sector, particularly for counties like Donegal and along the border region. This could cost tens of thousands of jobs in a sector just barely getting back on its feet after Covid-.“Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney has contacted the British government, but we need to do far more.”Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseNI Secretary of State Brandon Lewis FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueNI Secretary of State Brandon LewisEarlier, the issue sparked a war of words on social media between Mr Lewis and Mr Coveney, after MPs on Tuesday voted  to , majority , to reject a Lords amendment to the Nationalities and Borders Bill.Four MPs from the DUP also voted against the amendment, while Alliance Party MP Stephen Farry and SDLP MPs Colum Eastwood and Claire Hanna voted for it.Ms Hanna branded it a “terrible piece of legislation” and added it would be “unthinkable that people who call this place home would be forced to apply for a visa to travel to work or for leisure”.The amendment sought to ditch the requirement for foreigners to need an Electronic Travel Authorisationpass when making a local journey to Northern Ireland from the Republic.Read MoreImmigration reforms risk criminalising Ukrainians arriving in UK, ministers toldIt means EU citizens who are not Irish will have to apply online for pre-travel clearance to cross the border.It will also apply to citizens of the European Economic Area countries - Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland - resident in the Republic.There will be no controls on the border.

Our commitment to the Common Travel Area is absolute, as seen throughout the pandemic. https:t.co ZiFcbPl— Brandon LewisMarch , In a tweet, Mr Coveney had branded the vote “regrettable” and said it was “contrary to the approach that U.K. and Irish Governments have supported for many years to protect free movement on the Island of Ireland for everyone. “He added: “Our concern on this has been communicated clearly but has been ignored.”Read MoreConcerns that cross border travel rules could hit tourism hardResponding, Mr Lewis argued the new ETA requirement was about “protecting the Common Travel Area from abuse”.“Our commitment to the Common Travel Area is absolute, as seen throughout the pandemic,” Mr Lewis continued.The move is part of efforts to overhaul immigration laws in the post-Brexit era.Alliance Party MP Stephen Farry had previously warned the change could damage tourism in Northern Ireland.In response to Mr Lewis’ tweet, Mr Farry said the Secretary’s “reassurances aren#t actually related to the concerns I and others have expressed.”Mr Farry suggested there could even be “potential legal jeopardy” as a result of the plans.These reassurances aren#t actually related to the concerns I and others have expressed.

plans for a major walking trail which passes through Down District have received a pound, boost.A key component of the planned Columban Way is to develop ldquopilgrimage walking such as that found at Spainrsquos Camino de Santiago and at many other trails across Europe, with the trail highlighting Northern Irelandrsquos ancient heritage, including major Neolithic and early Christian sites along the way.It has been confirmed that a pound, grant has made available by the David Cross Foundation to produce a business case with costings to identy and develop the Columban Way from Dundrum to the Saint Patrickrsquos Centre in Downpatrick and from there to Comber by repurposing and upgrading sections of the former Ulster Way which was abandoned in the s.St Columbanus was one of the best-known of hundreds of Irish monks following in the footsteps of Saint Patrick in bringing Christianity, literacy and learning to Central and Northern Europe in the sixth century.Downpatrick councillor Cadogan Enright mdash who is an enthusiastic supporter of the new trail mdash said ii took St Columbanus  years to complete the journey from Bangor to Bobbio in Italy and he travelled more than , miles, mostly on foot.He is leading the local aspect of the project alongside Charlie Reid from Bangor, with both writing extensively on walks around Ireland and are committee members of Friends of Columbanus. They are supported by Duane Fitzsimons, from Ardglass, who is a walking trails expert.ldquoThe Columban Way forms part of the wider European lsquoVia Columbanirsquo heritage trail supported and promoted by the Council of Europe. It traces the route from Mount Leinster to Bangor through eight European countries to Bobbio in Italy, explained Cllr Enright.ldquoIt is instructive to see how rapidly other countries have rolled out sections of the trail since  and the th anniversary of Columbanus. Switzerland, Italy, France, Germany and the Low Countries have demonstrated the ability to deliver that we can learn from locally.Cllr Enright praised the support of Ards and North Down Council which has already delivered  miles of walk as far south as Comber.ldquoThis -mile section of trail is designed to encourage more people to learn about the history of North Down and Ards, including the impact the area had in a European context through the links with Columbanus, he explained.ldquoOur big challenge will be to engage with Newry Mourne and Down Council to deal with their huge gaps in the Saint Patrickrsquos and Ulster Ways.

But that could be about to change.Last year, the estimated repair bill for the clock, whose interior mechanism was removed over three decades ago and placed in storage, was in the region of pound,.Many are concerned to see the historic landmark falling into continued disrepair, but hopeful that it can be restored to be enjoyed for generations to come, reinforcing its connection with the villagersquos industrial past.Shrigley was founded by the Martin family, who came from Pott Shrigley in Cheshire in  and who owned the spinning factory in the village.The factory was powered by water supplied from the nearby Clea Lough and while the mill mdash which is reported to have employed  people at one time mdash has long gone, the clock tower erected by the people of Shrigley in  in honour of the Martin family remains.Now there is fresh hope that it can be restored to its former glory.Strangford MLAs Michelle McIlveen and Harry Harvey, who have been campaigning for the clockrsquos restoration, are also hopeful that progress can be made.Welcoming the recent developments, they hope plans to acquire the clock and restore it to its former glory will prove successful.The MLAs said Housing Executive chief executive Grainia Long made it clear last year that the huge cost of repairing the historic clock was something the organisation was not willing to meet at the time.The housing chief said at a time when it was experiencing a signicant funding shortfall for investment in tenantsrsquo homes, it was not be appropriate to use income derived from rents to fund the considerable costs that would be required to undertake a full restoration of the Shrigley clock.Ms McIlveen and Mr Harvey then raised the issue with Stormont communities minister Deirdre Hargey, who has overall responsibility for the Historical Environment Division.They detailed the clockrsquos history and its local signicance, explaining that it is one of the last remaining pieces of Victorian architecture in Shrigley.The MLAs said it was ldquounacceptable that an old clock of such important signicance and splendour should be allowed to fall into such a sad state of disrepair.ldquoWe urged the communities minister to take the necessary steps to prevent this important listed monument from further deterioration and urged her to consider a partnership approach with ious interested bodies, explained Ms McIlveen.ldquoI am pleased that the Housing Executive is now in discussions with an interested local party regarding a proposed feasibility study to consider options and prepare design concepts for the area that would involve the acquisition and restoration of the historic monument.Ms McIlveen said discussions are ongoing and that she and Mr Harvey have made clear to the government department and Housing Executive their desire that these discussions should be centred on the interests of the Shirley community, with the outcome safeguarding the future of the cherished

controversial decision to restructure the districtrsquos museum services is to be reviewed.Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos decision to appoint a joint curator to oversee museum services in Downpatrick and Newry mdash which was taken without consulting local councillors mdash is to be reviewed by the local authorityrsquos Audit Committee.The newly appointed curator will be based in Newry, a move which has angered a number of councillors and highly respected organisations, including the Friends of the Down County Museum.Council officials have been accused of downgrading the status of the Downpatrick museum with stinging criticism continuing of the decision to have one curator in charge of the local authorityrsquos two museums.Council officials insist they are ldquofully committed to the continuous improvement and development of both museums and that updated staffing structures for both ldquoprovides an unparalleled opportunity to build in this work.The restructuring process has been referred to the Audit Committee by Downpatrick councillor Gareth Sharvin, who is disappointed that despite signicant opposition to the move, the new joint curator is already in post.He wants the process which led to the councilrsquos decision to be reviewed, with the referral coming on the back of an update on the new staffing structure recently provided in secret to members of the local authorityrsquos Strategy, Policy and Resources Committee.Cllr Sharvin said while the press and public were prevented from hearing the update, he understands that the new curator will be based in Newry and shared across both museum sites.He continued: ldquoThe new staff structure is seen as an activity under the so-called scheme of delegation that enables the councilrsquos senior management team to conduct the change without the need to consult or inform any stakeholders in the process.ldquoThe new staff structure is currently being implemented and cannot be subject to change, as the roles have been offered out. We are told this is an operational matter that councillors are not involved in.Cllr Sharvin says he is disappointed to have to confirm that the new staff structure will be implemented at Down County Museum, which means it will have no permanent curator in the building.ldquoGiven the lack of information around the new roles and how the existing complement of skills are being integrated into the new museum structure, it can only raise concern as no one outside the senior management team have the information and understanding of how the fantastic services provided in Downpatrick will continue to be offered and delivered, he continued.ldquoThe campaign by the Friends of the Museum and the many groups associated with the Down County Museum was very much focused on the skills needed to run the museum and offer the excellent experience many hundreds of thousands of people have enjoyed over the years.Cllr Sharvin insists that a strategic review should have been undertaken first to understand the vision for the museum services in the district, design a plan around that vision and identy the staffing structure needed to support it.ldquoWhat has happened in this case, is that the staff structure is being implemented and a strategic review being held afterwards. The strategic review could easily identy that a dferent staffing structure is needed as opposed to the one being implemented now, he continued.ldquoI want to see the Down County Museum grow in size, reputation and service offerings. When you research the top  museums in Northern Ireland on Which Museum, the Downpatrick museum is placed th compared to Newry which is st.ldquoSimilarly on TripAdvisor, the Downpatrick museum is listed th, with Newry in th place. This shows a clear dference in status for each museum and where the councilrsquos main museum asset is.Councillor Sharvin explained he has referred the museum process and procedure to the councilrsquos Audit Committee for a number of reasons, even though he accepts the review will have no signicance in relation to the staffing structure as that will continue.However, he said the move will ensure that ldquolessons are learnt for any future changes and the Downpatrick museum is protected and respected.Cllr Sharvin explained the role of the audit committee is to review internal procedures and that is what he has asked to be examined.ldquoThere is no clear one approach when it comes to restructuring in council and the review of the procedures undertaken in this case will help the organisation identy were gaps are, what risks have been identied and the improvements that need to be implemented, he said.Cllr Sharvin said he has asked for a timeline of the start and completion of the strategic review being implemented and how key stakeholders such as the Friends of the Museum will be consulted as part of the process.He added: ldquoThe strategic review is now the focus of the campaign to ensure that the Down County Museum is not downgraded in any way. I will be approaching the strategic review with the sense of growth in visitor numbers, educational outreach, advertising campaigns, collection and exhibition offerings and the wider service offerings..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Dawn launches debut novel  ","story":"THE debut novel by a local childrenrsquos writer is already one of the top selling books in its age category on Amazon.Felicity Flipflops is the work of Dawn Gelston, a teacher living in Dubai but who has strong links with Drumaness and Teconnaught.She is the daughter of Paul and Maura Gelston and sister to Shona, Aisling, Janine and Paul.Aimed at children aged  to  years old, the book tells the story of mental well-being, adventure, and friendship by a young girl named Felicity.Dawn explained: ldquoAs teachers, we encourage children to believe in themselves and to work hard and dream big.

","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council has been urged to do all it can to quickly deliver Newcastlersquos new multi-million pound leisure complex.The appeal was issued by the local authorityrsquos chairwoman, Cathy Mason, following a recent meeting she had with senior council directors who provided her with a progress report.A detailed report on building the eagerly-awaited pound leisure centre is expected to be completed shortly, with senior council officials working with consultants to develop an outline business case which is designed to pave the way for construction work to start.The rear of the existing Newcastle Centre and the outdoor Tropicana swimming pool are to be bulldozed to make way for the new town centre leisure complex which will feature an indoor leisure pool which includes three  metre swimming lanes and a dedicated heated play pool for children.The new leisure facility will also feature an ultra-modern gymnasium and once demolition work has been completed, the new complex will be bolted on to the side of the existing centre.Redeveloping the existing Newcastle Centre has been ruled out due to the scale of the costs involved and itrsquos understood that the planned new-build will be larger than the current centre which is a listed building, posing major problems for the council in transforming it into an energy efficient facility which meets current building regulations and standards.Cllr Mason described confirmation of plans for new leisure facilities in Newcastle as ldquowelcome news and is delighted that the development plans are in the final stages of development.ldquoThese new local amenities will be of great benefit to local residents, their families and tourists alike, she said, confirming that the proposes new complex will feature a new leisure pool and state of the art gym facilities.ldquoFor too long, people of Newcastle have had to put up with these substandard facilities, the chairwoman continued. ldquoThe plans highlighted safety concerns with the old part of the building which is to be demolished as it simply isnrsquot fit for purpose.Cllr Mason said she hopes to see the finalised plans and formal site approval in the coming months so that contractors can start working on the project as soon as possible.ldquoIt is essential that the council moves in a timely manner to ensure this project comes to fruition so that Newcastle residents can access these new facilities as soon as possible, said the chairwoman.ldquoSinn Feacutein will continue to do all it can to ensure these much-needed leisure facilities are delivered and I will continue to stand up for rural families across South Down to deliver these essential services right in the heart of communities.Last week, formal planning approval to bulldoze the

club has been formed in Downpatrick.Known as Quoile Angling Club, the organisation is holding its inaugural meeting this Friday night at Murphyrsquos Bar in the town at pm, with an open invitation extended to anyone who would like to attend.The club was formed in response to the growing interest in course angling at the river and with coronavirus restrictions largely gone, anglers have joined forces to form the new club and aim to encourage greater involvement in angling, particularly for coarse fish in the lower reaches of the River Quoile.The picturesque river is home to rudd, roach, hybrids, bream, pike, and eels.The new club is hoping to run a few competitions and, in the future, provide coaching courses for young anglers.A key concern for the new club is addressing the current state of the fishery which runs from the below the Belfast Road bridge to the Steamboat quay.The aim is to engage with a raft of statutory agencies to raise the profile of the river and its angling potential, alongside improved access for anglers and visitors.While there has been signicant investment over recent years and additional upgrades in the pipeline, the anglers will hope this paves the way for greater emphasis on the Quoile area as a recreational and tourism asset.Anglers say the Quoile basin is a designated nature reserve and, as such, there are ious regulations which govern its usage, with those who fish along its banks keen to maintain the waterwayrsquos biological ersity and general appearance, ensuring it is an asset everyone can enjoy.At the clubrsquos inaugural meeting this Friday evening, members will adopt a constitution and select a new management committee.

He was inch-perfect through the morningrsquos slippery conditions, quickly building up a sizeable advantage and catching his rivals on the hop.This continued his fine form after the local driver also won the opening stages.In the space of two stages, he had amassed a lead of more than  seconds ndash a huge margin on the single venue event.From there, he managed his lead and with the sun shining, Greer powered home in his Citroen C to eventually win by . seconds and claim another maximum points haul in his bid for this yearrsquos championship spoils.ldquoIt was a brilliant day, said Greer.ldquoThe car was faultless and was really well suited to the event. We kept it clean and everything went to plan.In the battle for second overall, Derek McGarrity and Graham Henderson held an early second in their Skoda until a stage two overshoot cost them around ten seconds.Aaron McLaughlin and Darren Curran also hit trouble with a puncture and a broken rim, while Darren Gass and Sam Hutchinson were already out of contention after they spun and stalled on stage one.That left McGarrity and McLaughlin battling for the runner-up spot. McLaughlin quickly recovered from his puncture and moved into second after stage three. McGarrity tried hard to fight back but in the drying conditions, McLaughlin had the edge in his Fiesta WRC.He was really enjoying himself and an attempt to secure the fastest time on the final stage saw him come to within one-tenth of a second of rally winner Greer.ldquoHersquos a machine, said McLaughlin.ldquoI was really hoping for a fastest stage time. I just wish we had started the day as good as we finished it.Derek McGarrity and Graham Henderson had to be content with third overall in their Skoda. Their stage two overshoot potentially cost them a position but they still secured an armful of points for their McGrady Insurance NI Championship campaign.ldquoIt was a silly mistake on the second stage, said McGarrity.ldquoThen we had a small misfire on the last stage but it is what it is.Joe McGonigle and Ciaran Geaney clipped a bale and damaged the front wing of their Fiesta on stage two but they survived to tell the tale.Seventh after the test, they climbed back up the order to secure fourth overall ahead of Joe and Ashleen Hegarty, who were lucky to escape a high-speed spin on stage four.ldquoWe were using new tyres and the car broke away from me at high speed, explained Hegarty.ldquoWe went over a few trackside tyres and ended up on the grass.Darren Gass and Sam Hutchinson would have been in the mix too but they took a wrong route on stage five and were handed a stage maximum. Instead, Michael McGarrity and Damien Garvey were overjoyed to claim sixth overall in their Fiesta.They lost time when a boost pipe came adrt and also struggled with some brakingissues during the closing miles but were full of smiles at the finish.Also in a Fiesta, David Kelly and Dean OrsquoSullivan finished seventh ahead of Mark Massey and Alistair Wyllie.Massey was lucky to escape with some superficial bodywork damage after a stage five altercation with some trackside stage furniture so a top eight finish was a good result for the crew.Emma McKinstry and Kenny Hull lost time with some intercom issues but finished ninth while Robert Erwin and Andrew Wilson completed the top ten and secured the two-wheel-drive honours in the process.In the two-wheel-drive category, a titanic battle developed between a number of crews. James and Heather Kennedy were quickest out of the blocks, closely followed by Andrew White and Paul Hughes.Then White lost ground with an overshoot, leaving Kennedy to fend off a challenge from Robert Erwin and Andrew Wilson.As the track conditions improved, Erwin started to pile the pressure on the Kennedys who were suffering with a down-on-power engine.The chasing Toyota MR crew moved in front after the fth test and another strong run over the final stage sealed the category win as well as tenth overall.James and Heather Kennedy had to settle for second on this occasion as well as th overall, with Matthew McGaffin and Ryan Lowry coming home third in class.The McGrady Insurance NI Rally Championship now has a two-month break before the Maiden City Stages on May .In the interim period, a rally social night is being held at the Millbrook Lodge Hotel on Friday, March .

In  it was decided to move both date and venue to have the best chance of fitting in with Covid- restrictions.While the event at Bishopscourt Racing Circuit last June was well received, many were glad to see the race brought back to its origins as a road race taking in the iconic sites of East Downrsquos home town.Months of planning go into a race and this year was no exception. The EDAC race committee had an A and B routes on file in case of flooding on the Quoile towpath.They had worked with and through Covid- restrictions, secured road licences and Athletics NI permits, and employed professionals for timing, first aid and traffic management among others.The club rallied members and friends of the club to marshal the roads, man the water station and prepare the post race food tables.The race committee were out at am on Sunday to finalise the cones and signage when news broke that a fallen tree had brought down a power line directly impacting the planned route.East Down AC volunteers were straight into action. They were at the scene in minutes and had even a tree surgeon on speed dial, but they could not gain access.They were determined not to cancel and set about re-routing the race. This is not as simple as it may seem. With a traffic management plan to take into account and new sections to measure as well as the clock ticking, there was a lot of pressure.The wind and rain didnrsquot help and mindful of the wellbeing of runners, a delayed start was not even considered.With some sharp thinking and speedy manoeuvres a new route was hurriedly drawn up.Having advised the athletes that it was no longer a measured K, the start team herded them on to the start line in Ballydugan Estate and the hooter went only a minute or two behind schedule.With a huge sigh of relief Mags Mathieson, the official starter, waved the  strong crowd on their way. Thankfully everything  went to plan and post race comments have been nothing but positive from those who took part.There was high praise for the volunteers along the route, who cheered, clapped and gave out water. It was not the race that East Down AC had planned but with  fresh in our memories, most were simply glad that they got the chance to run.With all that had gone on pre-race there was barely time to consider who the winner might be, but there was a wave of excitement when Neil McCartan of East Down appeared in the home straight and crossed the line  seconds ahead of Owen Carleton of Annadale Striders.This was a bucket list moment for Neil as he is a longtime club member and he ran well to achieve it.It tops off a great season so far and leaves him primed for the track season which is his first love. When Aaron McGrady, also EDAC, was third, the stress of the morning was washed away in the joy of having two members on the podium.Mal McGrady of M.B. McGrady and Co Chartered Accountants presented Neil with the Jimmy Murray Memorial Shield at the finish line and the top three received cash prizes.The ladiesrsquo race was almost pre-determined when Emma Mitchell ndash the current , metre track championndash decided to throw her hat in the ring.However, given that she has been targeting half marathon timesand that the pandemic has played havoc with both racing and training, it is hard to gauge where iniduals are form wise.In the end she had a clear win finishing in . with Sinead Murtagh of Newcastle and District AC taking second place in ..Eimear McCracken of City of Lisburn came third in . to complete the podium.Emma was presented with the Joe Quinn Perpetual Trophy for first female and she took the time to say that she was delighted to support the magnicent Jimmyrsquos Ten and that the hospitality from the host club was first class.From an athlete who has raced at top level all over the world, it was praise indeed.Two shields are presented for club teams in the K and this year Newcastle and District took the honours in the menrsquos race and East Down AC retained the ladiesrsquo title.It is based on the top four men and the top three women home. There is also a relay event where two people split the K with one runner starting on the line and then passing over a wristband at the changeover point.Their team-mate then heads home to record a joint time. Ollie Robinson and Jacob Crawfordwere the quickest all male team.Holly Scott and Willow Farrington of Scrabo took the all female prize and the mixed title went to mother and son duo Maureen Kelly and James Wright .With the podiums decided the spectators turned their attention to looking for friends and family.The race is a highlight for local runners, many of whom do not belong to a club. This does not mean that they are not well able and plenty of fast times were recorded as the runners flooded in.Some were running to test their pace, some to seethey could run the distance with no speed in mind, others were raising funds or dedicating their run to causes.In short, there were all sorts of reasons and all sorts of runners but they were united in their efforts and the thrill of crossing a line to cheers.The fact that they were then brought to tables laden with food was a big surprise as for so long hospitality has been withdrawn, but with restrictions eased and a bit of careful planning the hosts were able to entertain their guests outside.Even the weather played ball by that stage as the rain had stopped and there were shreds of sunlight to lt the atmosphere.Jimmyrsquos Ten is always a memorable event but the  event will definitely be lodged in peoplersquos minds as the race that went ahead against all odds.EDAC would like to pay tribute to their full list of sponsors McMahon People Solutions, PCG Fitness, MC Dental Laboratories, Duffyrsquos Killough, JS Flooring, Murdock Brothers , P. Gardiner Carpets, Bells Supervalu Crossgar, McDonalds Downpatrick, Gordons Chemists, Plusprint, Wrap and Roll, McVeigh Traffic Management, Soaring Productions and main sponsor M.B. McGrady and Co Chartered Accountants. The financial backing is what makes this race an event.Thanks are also due to the members and even more so to those who are simply friends of the club, who give up their time to make the race happen. The hard graft that they put in cannot be underestimated.Finally, last but not least, there is heartfelt gratitude towards every single runner who signed up.Without runners there is no race. The smiles of the finishers and the kind words of support post race make all the hard work worthwhile. Well done and see you all next year..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Kilmore overrun Grove in league  ","story":"KILMORE Rec kept their promotion hopes on track with an impressive one-sided victory over a physical Grove United outfit at Robert Adams Park on Saturday.An early penalty kick converted by Anton McGrattan and two further second half goals from Eoin McGrattan and Joe McKinney was enough to see The Blues home and dry in bitterly cold yet sunny conditions.The Blues came firing out of the traps from the first whistle with Kilmore striker Joe McKinney the first to try his luck within the opening minutes, although his effort trickled harmlessly into the gloves of Grove number one Michael Davidson.However, it wouldnrsquot be long until the home side opened their account and after six minutes they were awarded the opportunity to do just that.Following a long ball over the top, Kilmore midfielder Eoin McGrattan spun his marker before he was clumsily clattered from behind inside the danger area.The referee had no hesitation in awarding the penalty kick, which Anton McGrattan dispatched confidently by drilling his effort low and hard to the bottom left corner beyond the reach of Davidson.The Bluesrsquo good start continued as they relentlessly pressed the opposition and didnrsquot allow Grove out of their own half.McKinney danced his way past three opposing defenders before his opportunity at goal was thwarted by a wonderfully timed last ditch tackle from Grove defender David McCallen.This wouldnrsquot deter the ever-dangerous Kilmore marksman, who continued to be a thorn in the side of his United counterparts when he battled to win back the ball before laying off team-mate Patrick Grant for a shot at goal.Grantrsquos effort did swing wide of the post but it was an encouraging sign for the Kilmore team, who clearly had their tails up.Man of the match, Barry Walsh, was enjoying the freedom of the middle of the park, as the Kilmore newcomer flung himself into every tackle necessary in order to gain possession for The Blues.Grove were very much stuck in first gear and were being overran in essentially every area of the park. Kilmore were dealt a blow when Grant came off second best in a crunching tackle with Grove defender Adam McKnight, leading to The Bluesrsquo defender to be substituted on  minutes.However, the silver lining for the hosts came in the form of substitute Joshua Smyth, who made an immediate impact when he entered the fray.Smyth quickly gained possession and whipped in a fast-paced cross to the head of incoming team-mate John McCarthy, whose effort was stunningly saved from point blank range by the reaction of Davidson in the Grove goals.This garnered applause from the sizeable home crowd, who had turned out to support their local side.With half an hour played, Kilmore looked to inflict further damage and almost did so following an eye-catching move which was unfortunate not to double the deficit.Smyth was yet again involved as he played a delicate one-two with the back heel of McKinney before his pass inside to the chest of Eoin McGrattan allowed the midfielder to find team-mate Michael Carvill unmarked at the edge of the box.Carvill unleashed an effort towards goal but it was smartly stopped yet again by Grove custodian Davidson, who was quickly becoming his sidersquos top performer.Any hint of a counterattack from the visitors was quickly dealt with by the confident backline of Christopher Magee, Gary Kennedy and captain Jack Larkin, with Magee in particular winning his inidual battle with Grove striker Jake Long time after time.With less than ten minutes to the interval, Carvill played a short free-kick to McCarthy, who swtly passed to Kennedy  yards from goal.After examining his options, the Kilmore defender decided to take a touch forward before firing a long ranged effort with conviction which ultimately crashed onto the post before falling to the feet of skipper Larkin.The Kilmore captain turned his rebound over the bar although his blushes were saved by the offside flag.Despite Grove proving they were a physically strong side ndash as they never shied away from a tackle ndash they failed to garner any substantial chance throughout the opening  minutes.The half ended with Grove midfielder David Johnston picking up a yellow card for a late challenge on Anton McGrattan.The first real opportunity of the second half fell to Kilmorersquos Walsh, who after a pinball of passes, saw his effort from the edge of the box saved.However, just two minutes later and The Blues would double their scoring tally after marksman McKinney latched on to a long ball before squaring his pass to team-mate Eoin McGrattan for an easy tap in.To their credit, Grove were certainly showing more of a presence in the opposing final third, although they were lacking the end product required to trouble the hosts.Kilmore continued to cause problems and goal-scorer Eoin McGrattan almost added another when he once again showed his marker a clean pair of heels and barrelled down on goal.This time his effort struck the side netting as Grove momentarily escaped conceding a third.The home side refused to settle for just two goals and were almost granted a third when McKinneyrsquos whizzing pass across the box marginally escaped the boot of the onrushing McCarthy.Grove managed to manufacture a seldom chance when captain Michael McNerlin struck a first time volley from  yards which required Kilmore lsquokeeper Christopher Turley to spring into action and tip the ball over the crossbar.However, this seemed to ignite the Kilmore flame further and with  minutes to go they registered their third, courtesy of a surging Walsh run which ended in a pass to McKinney inside the box.The Kilmore striker kept his cool and confidently placed his right footed effort into the net to drown out any chance of a dramatic comeback.Eoin McGrattan made way for substitute John Patterson, who almost added to the scoreline when once again McKinney was allowed to play a pass across goal.However, the substitute fluffed his lines and sent his effort over the bar in what was an escape for the now weathered looking Grove outfit.The visitors were gted a consolation goal in the th minute, after substitute David Long was adjudged to be fouled in the area by Kilmore captain Larkin.Grove midfielder Johnston confidently tucked his effort into the top right corner but seconds later the final whistle sounded.Following the match Kilmore goal-scorer, Anton McGrattan, gave his thoughts on his sidersquos performance.ldquoI thought we controlled the game, he said.ldquoWe could have gotten two or three goals before half-time but we didnrsquot panic.ldquoWe will just take it one game at a time now, we had a setback against Dromara Village a couple of weeks ago but we have now won two on the bounce.He added: ldquoThere is a massive week ahead, we travel to Rosario for a big three points.Kilmore Rec: C Turley, C Magee, P Grant, J Larkin , G Kennedy, B Walsh, J McCarthy, A McGrattan, J McKinney, M Carvill, E McGrattan.Subs: J Patterson, J Smyth, C

The practice has recognised both the need for change, and the opportunity that new ways of working provides to improve the quality of care which it can offer to its patients.ldquoShe is an outstanding example of the dedication and professionalism of our GP services.The minister also thanked all of the practice staff or their ldquotireless and ongoing treatment, care and support that they provide to patients, particularly over the past two years.He added: ldquoI know it has not been easy. This has been an incredibly stressful and anxious time for so many of our population and no less so for our GP workforce and their teams who have been in the vanguard of our response to Covid.South Down UUP councillors Jill Macauley and Alan Lewis also paid tribute to Dr Smith.ldquoAlison has served the community of Clough and Dundrum with such attention and dedication over the years, and we have no doubt that her presence will be missed in the local surgeries, their statement said.ldquoWe thank our party colleague and Health Minister Robin Swann MLA for taking the time to call with Alison and all the staff at Clough Health Centre to acknowledge her retirement, as well as seeing around their impressive state of the art facilities.Dr Smith and her husband moved to the Newcastle area in  when he got a job at the YMCA.Originally from Edinburgh and having qualied at Edinburgh University, Dr Smith spent a short time working on the surgical ward of Downe Hospital with Mr Crawford Bell, consultant surgeon.She then worked part-time with Dr Edith Cunningham in Killyleagh and Dr John Kyle in Newcastle before joining the Dundrum and Clough Family Practice as a partner with Dr Kieran Walshe and Dr Alex Greer in .

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityMark Drakeford is scheduled to announce the results of the latest review on Friday, while health minister Eluned Morgan will give a press conference at lunch time today, Tuesday, on the latest situation regarding Covid-.A spokesman for the Welsh Government said the future of policies like mask-wearing will be announced on Friday.Earlier this month, the first minister said he hoped the nations remaining rules could be scrapped at the end of this month, given the improving situation.But a recent rise in infection rates may yet cause a few bumps in the road out of the pandemic. In Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon decided to keep mask rules in place there for another month, despite ending the rest of the nations Covid rules on Monday.It means people in Scotland must continue to wear face coverings on public transport and in shops - the same rules that we currently have in Wales - throughout April.England, however, has operated without any coronavirus rules for nearly one month, after Boris Johnson introduced his Living With Covid plan at the end of February.Public Health Wales confirmed , new cases on Monday , and nearly one in seven patients currently in Welsh hospitals has coronavirus. But infection rates remain well below the levels seen during the height of the Omicron wave in December and January. :Given the current Covid situation, the Argus asked the Welsh Governmentit was confident the nations remaining Covid restrictions would be lted when ministers reviewed the rules this week.We also askedthe Welsh Government believed it was currently safe to lt those restrictions.A spokesman for the government did not respond directly to those questions, but said: \"Throughout the pandemic we have kept regulations under regular review, with our approach being informed by the latest available scientic and medical advice. The outcome of the current -day review of regulations will be confirmed on March .\".removeEvenWales abandons its Covid rules on Friday, it is highly unlikely Mr Drakeford will follow the \"clf-edge\" approach seen in England. The first minister has criticised Mr Johnson for the abrupt end to restrictions over the border, and reinforced his own beliefs in the \"step by step\" strategy preferred in Wales.That strategy will involve a gradual winding down of most of the public-service response to coronavirus in Wales.Testing will continue here for the next three months, but lateral flow tests will be used instead of more expensive PCR tests during that time.Likewise, self-isolation policies will continue until the end of June, but they will become a matter of advice - not a legal requirement - from the end of March.We will bring you all the updates from Eluned Morgans Welsh Government coronavirus press conference at midday today, Tuesday. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityWith England having removed all of its covid restrictions, it comes as little surprise that the Welsh Government is fielding calls to follow in Boris Johnson’s footsteps.Following this, it was announced that a decision will be made on the future of restrictions in Wales on Thursday, March , ahead of first minister Mark Drakeford’s three week review the following day - Friday, March .If the public health situation allows for it, an announcement lting restrictions in Wales will follow, the Welsh Government said.But, the BA. strain of covid has recently emerged, and it is growing – having overtaken omicron as the most prevalent iant in Wales.As a result, the situation is finely poised, with restrictions disappearing, additional measures being put in place, or continuing in an uneasy middle ground all on the table.Speaking at a briefing earlier today - Tuesday, March  - health minister Eluned Morgan summed it up, saying: “It is going to be a very finely balanced judgement in terms of whether we continue with our planned approach to releasing those final restrictions which we still have in place here.”Below, you can find out more about all of the moving parts in place, before the decision can be made.Why restrictions should be ltedNeighbouring England has lted all of its restrictions, and with many commuting across the border from Newport and Gwent - and vice-versa - there is a logical argument to bring the two nations in line.From a data point of view, Wales is actually in the best place of any of the home nations to lt restrictions.Wales currently has the lowest case rate in the UK - lower than England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland.Health minister Eluned Morgan and The Grange hospital, one of the frontline hospitals in the fight against the virus What’s more, the omicron covid wave appears to be under control.Ms Morgan said: “Since the end of January, we have seen a steady decline in cases of coronavirus as the winter omicron wave receded”..removeSo, based on the above, all restrictions should be lted  Unfortunately, there are a number of other factors at play.Why restrictions should remainWhile omicron might be on the decline, there is a new menace in town – the BA. covid strain.In the last three weeks, the number of covid cases per , people in Wales has more than doubled, well above  per , people.BA. has also overtaken omicron as the most prevalent strain.BA. has now overtaken omicron But perhaps the biggest reason to keep restrictions in place is the pressure that the NHS once again finds itself under.There are more than , people in hospital with the virus, and, while most of these are not in intensive care, it is the highest hospitalisation rate since March .Simply put, the NHS is creaking once again.So, what decision can we expect It might sound like a bit of a cliché, but the decision as to whether restrictions will be lted could come down to the wire.The Welsh Government is set to make a decision on Thursday, before announcing it on Friday.Ms Morgan said: “It is going to be a very finely balanced judgement in terms of whether we continue with our planned approach to releasing those final restrictions which we still have in place here.\"There are no foregone conclusions. Were analysing the data, were giving ourselves as much time as we can. We will act in the best interest of the NHS and the public health in Wales.\"We have got to consider the pressures on the NHS at the minute. Our hospitals are full already. Any additional new pressure is going to lead to more dficulties in terms of access to accident and emergencies, dficulties with getting ambulances to people. All of those things will be considered as well.\"These are dficult judgements. Weve always tried to follow the science, but this is going to be a finely balanced judgement.\"It may be that well be keeping some restrictions, but there are no decisions that have been made so far.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

More pay cuts will increase the already serious teacher recruitment and retention problems that are clearly impacting negatively on children and young people’s education. The Government’s plan to inflict more real terms pay cuts is a damaging and dogmatic political choice.”She also said that Mr Sunak’s decision not to increase education funding to account for inflation signals “ato the austerity of the s”.The Department for Education said in its submission to the School Teacher Review Bodythat it wants statutory starting pay to increase by .% this year and .% next year.But the proposed increases for more experienced teachers are lower at % in  and % in , equating to an average rise of just under % across all teachers, the Institute for Fiscal Studiescalculated earlier in March.The IFS said that given rising levels of inflation, the proposals for teacher pay would see a real terms cut of % for more experienced staff between  and ..removeGeoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said he was “disappointed” that financial pressures facing schools had not been addressed amid rising inflation rates.“We are disappointed that the Chancellor failed to address the financial pressures facing the education system amidst soaring inflation, and the fact that many experienced teachers and leaders will see the real value of their pay fall under the Government’s current pay proposals,” he said.“Schools are reporting huge increases in their energy bills and the Government expects them to fund pay awards out of these stretched budgets too.”He said he is “gravely concerned” that schools are facing a fresh funding crisis “compounded by the inadequacy of the proposed pay award for many staff which comes after a pay freeze and is likely to worsen retention rates”..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: School heads  udisappointed u at lack of action on teacher pay in spring statement article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityHere, the PA news agency takes a look at some of the key talking points as Steve Clarke’s team bid to start the year on a positive note.Chance to rebuild momentum vw,vw,px, px\"Scotland finished  on a high against Denmark The nature of international football, with y gaps between fixtures, means it is often more dficult to generate consistency and rhythm than at club level. In a period when they had fixtures in three consecutive months between September and November at the end of last year, Steve Clarke’s team won six games in a row as they motored into the World Cup play-off spot. With more than four months having elapsed since their last game – a rousing - win at home to Denmark – the manager will be hoping his team can somehow pick up where they left off.Captaincy contenders vw,vw,px, px\"Scotland defender Grant Hanley captains Norwich The absence of Scotland captain Andy Robertson for Thursday’s game as he recovers from Covid has served to highlight just how many natural leaders Clarke has in his squad. Asked who would skipper the team against Poland, the manager said on Wednesday afternoon he had not yet made that call as he had too many contenders to choose from. While it is likely Clarke has already made his decision privately, a genuine case could be made for at least half a dozen other players in the group to wear the armband. Premier League trio Scott McTominay, Kieran Tierney and John McGinn are all bedrocks of the squad with natural leadership skills, while Craig Gordon, Callum McGregor and Grant Hanley are all long-serving internationals who captain their respective clubs.Ukraine factor vw,vw,px, px\"Ukraine were at Hampden in the Euros last summer The poignant aspect of this fixture will not be lost on anyone involved. Scotland should have been playing a high-stakes World Cup play-off semi-final against Ukraine at Hampden on Thursday, with Poland due to play their play-off semi in Russia the following night. The Russian invasion of Ukraine led to both of those matches being called off, with Russia kicked out of the World Cup and Ukraine’s trip to Glasgow postponed until June. Thursday’s friendly between Scotland and Poland was hastily arranged as a result, and £ from each ticket sold will be donated to UNICEF UK’s emergency appeal for Ukraine..removeLethal Lewandowski  for further information.\" srcset\"https:image.assets.pressassociation.io v image production fcaeebeeecdaYudGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQMDINjMw ..jpg w w, https:image.assets.pressassociation.io v image production fcaeebeeecdaYudGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQMDINjMw ..jpg w w, https:image.assets.pressassociation.io v image production fcaeebeeecdaYudGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQMDINjMw ..jpg w w\" sizes\" vw,vw,px, px\"Robert Lewandowski scored twice on his last visit to Hampden Scotland’s defenders will be tested to the extreme against arguably the most dangerous striker in world football. Robert Lewandowski may be  but he is currently in the form of his le, operating on an extraordinary level. The prolic Pole’s double for Bayern Munich against Union Berlin last weekend took his tally for the season to  goals at club level, while it also means he has now scored at least  goals for club and country in each of his last three seasons. Lewandowski scored a double on his only previous visit to Hampden – a - draw in a Euro  qualier in October  – and will fancy his chances of rippling the net against the Scots once more.Gilmour watch vw,vw,px, px\"Billy Gilmour has had a tough season at Norwich It will be interesting to see how Billy Gilmour fares in the Scotland midfield having endured a chastening season on loan at Norwich. Despite a relative lack of first-team action, the -year-old Cha player has made a stunning start to his international career since his debut last summer. The hope for everyone concerned was that regular game time at club level this season would see the midfielder kick on to new heights. However, his loan move to Norwich has not gone to plan. Starting  games in total for a team struggling at the foot of the Premier League, Gilmour has been the subject of criticism from sections of the Canaries support for his underwhelming performances and has slipped to the periphery of the team over the past month. Scotland fans will be hoping his tough times at Carrow Road have not diminished his ability to influence matches on the international stage..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Clarke us captaincy contenders meet lethal Lewandowski  u Scotland talking points article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityDitching white bread, pasta and rice – or simply eating them with fat or protein – could help lessen the blood sugar spike women experience after eating carbohydrate-rich meals.Natural yoghurt, nuts, pulses, berries and leafy greens are also good choices for helping keep the gut microbiome healthy, the study suggests.Experts from the nutrition company ZOE together with scientists from King’s College London, the Hard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and Massachusetts General Hospital in the US looked at data for , pre-, peri- and post-menopausal women, who underwent a raft of tests and health checks.They found that, among women of the same age, those who were post-menopausal experienced a bigger increase in blood sugar levels after eating a carbohydrate-rich meal – pushing up their risk of heart disease and type  diabetes.Post-menopausal women were also found to have more weight around their stomachs, have higher levels of inflammation, higher cholesterol and higher blood pressure than pre-menopausal women.Published as a pre-print in The Lancet medical journal, the study further found that post-menopausal women consumed more sugar and reported poorer sleep compared with pre-menopausal women, thereby increasing their risk of type  and type  diabetes, obesity and heart disease.Dr Sarah Berry, senior author of the study, lead nutritional scientist at ZOE and associate professor in nutritional sciences at King’s College London, said: “Our research shows that menopause is a time of major metabolic upheaval, which can have signicant impact on long-term health.”She told the PA news agency that, based on the research, “modying our diet could have a favourable impact on many of these unfavourable changes”.She added: “What our research shows is, that even in an aged-matched group,you are post-menopausal, you have an unfavourable increase in blood sugar after consuming a carbohydrate-rich meal. It’s an effect due to menopause..remove“Therefore, women may wish to be more mindful about the type of carbohydrates they are consuming.“This could mean moving away from highly-refined carbohydrates and processed foods that contain them – so thinking carefully about bakery, some confectionery goods, and some staples such as bread, pasta and rice.“We’re not saying people shouldn’t consume these but, for example,you consume them with a fat like olive oil, or a protein, that will help reduce the glycaemic response.“So, you could eat these foods with protein or fat, or make swaps to wholegrain ieties. One change might be choosing rye bread, for example, rather than white or wholemeal.“Or ask yourselfyou’d be happy having pulses instead of rice  If not, then you could choose wholegrain rice.“We can also promote a healthy microbiome through eating a iety of plant-based foods in the diet that are unprocessed.“For example, you could include berries, leafy greens, nuts and pulses. Also, fermented foods such as Greek yoghurt, particularly the full fat and unsweetened iety.“What this study shows is that we’re not a prisoner of the menopause – we can do something about it.”The menopause is defined as the point in time when a woman has not had a period in  months. It usually occurs naturally and most often after the age of .The gut microbiome is made up of trillions of micro-organisms including bacteria and fungi and is known to affect aspects of health such as the immune system and digestion..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Simple food swaps  ucould help women through the menopause u article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityHe told the Commons that the Government will be “taking action”, and encouraged workers to do the same.His statement came as the company’s chief executive issued an apology for the impact of the decision to sack the staff without notice.Peter Hebblethwaite said he understood the “anger and shock” about the loss of jobs.His statement came amid continued protests by unions and workers and followed confirmation that he will appear before MPs on Thursday to be questioned about the dismissals.He said: “I want to say sorry to the people affected and their families for the impact it’s had on them, and also to the , people who still work for PO and will have been asked a lot of dficult questions about this.“Over the last week, I’ve been speaking face-to-face to seafarers and their partners. They’ve lost their jobs and there is anger and shock and I completely understand.“We needed fundamental change to make us viable. This was an incredibly dficult decision that we wrestled with but once we knew it was the only way to save the business, we had to act.“All other routes led to the closure of PO Ferries. I wish there was another way and I’m sorry.”Peter Hebblethwaite will appear before a joint hearing of the Transport and Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy committees on Thursday.Protests were held in Dover and Liverpool on Wednesday against the sackings, which have been widely condemned by union leaders and politicians.Other witnesses being questioned on Thursday will include Professor Alan Bogg, Professor of Labour Law at University of Bristol, Mark Dickinson, General Secretary of Nautilus International, Dean Beale, Chief Executive of the Insolvency Service, Brian Johnson, Chief Executive of the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, Katy Ware, Director of UK Maritime Services, transport minister Robert Courts and business minister Paul Scully..removeHuw Merriman and Darren Jones, who chair the committees, said: “This session will aim to understand the detail of the options available to the  workers who were roundly dismissed by PO Ferries last week.“The cruel nature of their dismissal put employment practices and UK plc under the microscope.“From PO Ferries, our members want to know why this action has been taken and how it can be justied.“From the Government and its agencies, we want confirmation that our laws are not being broken and safety is not being compromised on our ships.“This shocking story has raised questions about UK employment law, safety practices, the support of this business through a pandemic and the redress available. We intend to hear from the key players about what they are going to do that means these workers are not left high and dry.”Rail, Maritime and Transport union general secretary Mick Lynch said: “Under pressure from Keir Starmer, the Prime Minister said that PO Ferries had broken the law by falling to give the government adequate notice of the redundancies – he has in effect called PO Ferries liars as the company said earlier today they have not broken the law.“But while the PM said they are taking PO to court in the same breath he refused Keir Starmer’s demand of economic sanctions against PO owners, DP world, to enforce the reinstatement of PO workers.“It is DP world that have given the instructions to makes the mass sackings and break the law, so it is appalling that the government is scared to take action against DP World.“Of course PO need to be taken to court but that by itself won’t get our members’ jobs back. We need emergency action and legislationnecessary to enforce the reinstatement of our members.”Mr Lynch described the PO statement as a “half hearted apology” and again urged the company to reverse the sackings and reinstate the workers.Nautilus said in a statement: “Our members deserve decent employment with decent employers and our work, which has been ongoing for over  years, will continue to this end.“However, PO Ferries have sunk themselves legally and reputationally. They broke the law, and no end of legal tautology will change that.“Nautilus International now expects the Government to take all possible action against these law breakers, who think they can buy silence and bully seafarers into unemployment or accepting lower wages and detrimental and unsafe terms and conditions of employment.”.push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Prime Minister says it appears PO  ubroke the law u over sackings article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

It’s good that they’ve been able to get married and show their love to the world.“But the horror of what is happening,he is extradited to America, would be absolutely terrible.”Assange’s wedding comes just weeks before the third anniversary of his dramatic arrest when he was dragged out of the Ecuadorian embassy in the capital.The WikiLeaks founder has been held in the high-security jail ever since as he fights extradition to the United States, where he is wanted over an alleged conspiracy to obtain and disclose national defence information following WikiLeaks’ publication of hundreds of thousands of leaked documents relating to the Afghanistan and Iraq wars.Assange has always denied wrongdoing and has won support for his case from human rights organisations and journalist groups across the world.In a statement referring to former US soldier and defence analyst Cha Manning, who leaked material to WikiLeaks, Dame Vivienne said: “Julian published the collateral murder video released to him by Cha Manning.“The greatest threat the US faced to its credibility.“We are a global war economy and the authorities have held and trapped Julian by laws which have avoided all due process.“To me, Julian is a pure soul and a freedom fighter.”.push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Julian Assange marrying Stella Moris at HMP Belmarsh article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.Stephen McNally of Cycul said: “We’re all aware of Craigavon’s infamous roundabouts – between Lurgan and Portadown – but have you noticed that there are no footpaths alongside these roads, no pedestrians, no traffic lights or zebra crossings  That’s because there is a totally separate network for walkers and cyclists, running under and over the road network.”One of the many maps on the new website showing the route of the Black Paths weaving from Lurgan, through Craigavon to Portadown and Lough Neagh on a new website https:blackpaths.org bpIn the early s, when Craigavon’s planners were designing the traffic system, they were already aware of the effect increasing traffic was having on communities. They recognised that the young and the old no longer found it safe to travel on foot or bicycle. Therefore, they designed a very sophisticated, separate transport system for Craigavon, using over  underpasses and six large bridges, so that walkers and cyclists would never come into contact with cars.”Cycul have spent the winter months researching and mapping the cycle network – known locally as the Black Paths – and have produced a web resource with an active travel map, suggested routes to explore, Google map, news section and a history of the network.“We hope it helps people appreciate what’s possible above and beneath the busy roads in Craigavon, and persuades them to explore the Black Paths to get to school, go to the shops, the leisure centre, the local industrial estates and train stations at Portadown and Lurgan.“With the climate crisis, fuel edging toward £ a litre, and everyone spending more time stuck in traffic – Craigavon is the only place in Northern Irelandwith its own alternative travel system. If the future of transport is active travel, Craigavon arrived there over  years ago.”Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon joins Stephen McNally, Director of Cycul, who has helped set up the website to map the Black Paths in between Lurgan, Craigavon and Portadown. The Department helped finance the project.You can explore the Black Paths by visiting https:blackpaths.org--Facts and infoThere are  large concrete bridges in the Craigavon area, spanning the dual carriageways. None of them are for cars.

The comments were made as the UFU launched its annual schools’ competition. Open to all playgroups, nursery, primary, and special schools, this year’s theme relates to the UFU’s food and farming education resource “Dig in!”, which encourages pupils to learn more about food, farming, and the countryside. UFU deputy president, David Brown said, “This year’s schools competition theme ‘Dig in! to food, farming and the environment’ provides an opportunity for teachers to start the discussion in the classroom about the importance of food and farming in NI, allowing pupils to learn more about how farmers work hard to produce the delicious, high-quality produce on our tables, and their contribution to shaping our landscape in NI, which everyone enjoys. “Climate change has been the front runner in NI this year and our farmers play an essential role in combating the global issue, as they are a key part of the solution. The schools competition helps pupils to enhance their understanding of how farmers create dferent environments in NI which support our economy, rural communities, tourism and recreation.” Mr Brown says every year the competition judges are impressed by the number, standard and creativity of entries for the schools’ competition. “We would encourage all nursery, playgroups, primary and special schools to participate in what is a very worthwhile competition. It’s a great opportunity to express their creativity while learning about one of the most important sectors in NI as they will discover the importance of local food production,” he said. The UFU is pleased to have competition sponsor Asda on board for another year with a range of prizes available for the lucky winners. Joe McDonald, Asda NI corporate affairs manager said, “Asda is a proud sponsor of the school’s competition. It is great to see competition entries grow year upon year, especially with the introduction of a dferentiating foundation category last year - the standard is superb. It is vital to create an awareness of where our produce comes from, and this competition is a great opportunity to do so - educating children on the ‘farm to fork’ story.” Now in its eleventh year, BOIOFW is the perfect partner for the schools’ competition. As part of the prize, the winner of each category receives free transport for their class to the nearest participating BOIOFW farm, and all competition entries will be on display throughout the weekend. Mr Brown says schools don’t need to be competition winners in order to visit real, working farms. “This free event showcases NI’s world-class ‘farm to fork’ journey and reconnects consumers with our farmers, the primary food producers.The weekend underlines the importance of supporting local producers to benefit the rural community and wider economy in NI. BOIOFW is taking place on Saturday  and Sunday  June, and I would certainly encourage all schools to consider organising a trip to a local participating farm on the schools’ day, Friday  June,” said the UFU deputy president. Entry forms have been sent electronically to all playgroups, nursery, primary and special schools. Schools’ competition templates are available by visitingwww.ufuni.org.The closing date for entries is Friday  April .

Minister Nichola Mallon said: “Minister Ryan and I have a shared ambition for rail and are committed to improving our network for citizens across the island through our All Island Strategic Rail Review. The public consultation phase was a vital step in delivering this important piece of work and I am delighted to have delivered this key stage. Today we met with the consultants at ARUP, along with Minister Ryan to hear the out-workings of the consultation, to understand the views of the public and stakeholders and to ensure that their priorities are a focal point of the Review as it moves forward. “With over , responses received, this highlights that this work is long overdue and has captured the imagination of the public across the whole island. In that regard, the consultation has clearly demonstrated that our citizens view decarbonisation and enhancing connectivity as key components of this Review and these factors will play a strong role as we move forward to the next stage. “Minister Ryan and I have ensured now that working in partnership the next steps will move at pace.

Junior Minister Gary Middleton said: “Our high streets have experienced constant and increasing change, particularly in recent years. “We want to empower people and communities to reshape and repurpose their local villages, towns and cities, to create a more erse high street - high streets that are clean, green, family friendly destinations that are welcoming for everyone. “I want to thank the High Street Task Force for bringing forward this report which has been developed to prioritise those actions that can drive delivery and build momentum. “A joined-up and collaborative approach must continue over the coming years to deliver high streets, village, town and city centres that are fit for the st century and this report provides the next steps for the new Ministers in the next mandate to take forward work to revitalise our village, town and city centres.” Junior Minister Declan Kearney said: “We want to see our cities, towns and villages regain and retain their vibrancy, purpose and sense of place. High streets of the future should be safe and attractive gathering points for whole communities, where people can live, work, shop, learn, do business, use public services and enjoy their leisure time. “The High Street Task Force report provides a long-term focus on addressing the transformation of our high streets and recognises that there will be a requirement for a number of short, medium and longer-term interventions. “I want to thank Task Force for their hard work and commitment to date and commend the joint-working and co-design roles played by departments, retail and other business organisations, trade unions, local councils and the community and voluntary sectors. “I believe this report and its recommendations can play a vital role in revitalising our high streets.” Glyn Roberts, Retail NI Chief Executive and Chair of the High Street Task Force – Influencing Policy and Strategy sub-group, said: “This report sets out proposals for a five year reconstruction plan for our high streets, reform of our business rates and the need to improve our retail planning policy. “We hope that an incoming Executive after the election will hit the ground running with this plan and begin the long road of recovery for our high streets.” Seamus McAleavey, Chief Executive of NICVA and member of the High Street Task Force – Developing Capacity sub-group, said: “It is obvious change is happening. We are in the Fourth Industrial Revolution, it has speeded up during the Covid pandemic by necessity. Online commerce is the norm and communities need to re-invent there town centres. “Only a new vision will work as the past is the past. Communities are the heart of the city, town and villages centres. We can build vibrant high streets places people want to work in, shop in and enjoy themselves in. It is achievable.” Cathy Reynolds, Director of City Regeneration and Development, Place and Economy Department, Belfast City Council, and representing SOLACE , said: “Our high streets have experienced signicant change and challenges over recent years and it is critical that there is a focused effort to address these challenges and build on opportunities to ensure the future sustainability of our towns and cities. “A long term sustained approach is required to ensure high streets are supported to thrive and most importantly survive.” The High Street Task Force report and its recommendations will be subject to consideration by the next Executive who will determine how it can be aligned with the future Programme for Government.  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_bdbaaafaedcbbeb   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_cebbfecd   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
