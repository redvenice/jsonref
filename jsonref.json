Negotiations with Brussels had failed. It appeared that Britain’s last days in the European Union had turned into a fiasco, and the Prime Minister’s heroic three-year quest to deliver Brexit was doomed\u0027This last-minute dash meant only one thing. The Prime Minister smelt a deal in the offing. One that could help her muster enough support in the House of Commons.But is she right?Has Mrs May extracted enough from Brussels to satisfy the 118 Tory Brexiteers who voted down her deal in January – in the process inflicting the largest defeat on a sitting prime minister in living memory?We won’t know the answer to that question till later today, but the problem is simple to explain. Mrs May cannot hope to get the support of Tory rebels if her withdrawal arrangement leaves Britain stuck forever in the Irish backstop – meaning that Northern Ireland must stay in the customs union, subject to European rules but with no decision making capacity.Brexiteers say that such an arrangement turns Britain into a ‘vassal state’. Not in a million years will they vote for it.However, if Mrs May has persuaded the president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, and chief negotiator Michel Barnier to provide an escape route from the backstop, then her deal has a chance of getting through the House of Commons.Last night the Government and Brussels agreed a plan that could enable Attorney General Geoffrey Cox to alter his legal advice on the backstop.The package includes a new legally-binding document that should allow the UK to seek an exit from the backstop if the EU tries to make it permanent, along with legal status for a separate package of assurances offered by Brussels in January.The MPs’ vote today is one of the most fateful parliamentary votes in British history.The mere fact that Mrs May went to Strasbourg yesterday evening for a meeting with Mr Juncker sends a strong signal that the Prime Minister is confident that she’s got a deal.          \u0027If Mrs May has persuaded the president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker (pictured), and chief negotiator Michel Barnier to provide an escape route from the backstop, then her deal has a chance of getting through the House of CommonsMay returns to Downing Street after winning \u0027legally binding...Trouble for Jeremy Corbyn? Almost 100 Labour MPs and peers...Share this articleShe hardly want to risk a humiliating failure.But remember this. The Prime Minister is not the ultimate arbiter. She will have to defer to her Attorney General. In uncanny ways Mr Cox finds himself in the same situation as his predecessor Lord (Peter) Goldsmith found himself in ahead of the Iraq war in 2003.Tony Blair was desperate to invade. But he could not give the order to send troops to Iraq until he received a formal undertaking from Goldsmith that the war was legal. And we now know that Blair twisted Lord Goldsmith’s arm to ensure that he came to the ‘right’ decision.Geoffrey Cox is thought to be made of sterner stuff. Unlike the hapless Goldsmith, MPs believe he is his own man.Last January he struck a body blow to the Prime Minister when he warned there was a risk that the backstop ‘would endure indefinitely’.That is why Mrs May needs Mr Cox to confirm that the Irish backstop problem has been solved. A Cox veto – and she and her deal are both finished.Crucially, Mr Cox did not fly to Strasbourg with Mrs May. He stayed at Westminster, keeping his distance.          \u0027Last January Geoffrey Cox (pictured) struck a body blow to the Prime Minister when he warned there was a risk that the backstop ‘would endure indefinitely’Very wise. More than anyone else, Mr Cox has the future of Mrs May in his hands. And – far more importantly – Britain’s future in the EU.Brexiteers insist, nevertheless, that even he does not have the final say. Members of the European Research Group of hardline rebels have employed a team of eight lawyers to make their own judgment. Who can say what advice they will give?Nevertheless, matters were looking much more hopeful last night. There was a spring in the Prime Minister’s step.We will know later today whether she achieved enough to convince the Tory rebels.If she hasn’t, Britain is on course to crash out of the European Union without a deal on March 29.Matters will no longer be in Mrs May’s hands. With time running out, Parliament could move to delay the implementation of Article 50 and rule out No Deal. In which case, political and economic upheaval looms. The stakes could not be higher. "},{"url":null,"title":"Pressure mounts Boeing countries airlines ground Max 737 8 fleets","story":"    Pressure is mounting on Boeing after more airlines and countries grounded their fleets of 737 Max 8 jets in the wake of the Ethiopian Airlines disaster.

She has also banned crisps and fruit juice A headteacher has banned children from bringing sweets in on their birthday but insists she is \u0027not the fun police\u0027. Chasey Crawford-Usher has also prohibited crisps and fruit juice from her school, Wateringbury Primary School in Kent.The American-born teacher says she imposed the ban after being shocked by how much sugar British children were consuming.The self-confessed health fanatic insists the move is in the best interests of pupils.She said: \u0027First of all, I\u0027m not the headteacher of all evil and saying no.\u0027I\u0027ve banned birthday sweets because they were becoming a huge problem in the school and meant the children were consuming processed sugar almost every day.\u0027Mrs Crawford-Usher, from New England, America, admits she wasn\u0027t allowed sweets growing up and claims her mother was a \u0027wholefoods mum before it was trendy.\u0027She added: \u0027The most important reason for banning the practice was my growing awareness of the amount of sugar being consumed and the number of children in our school that were undergoing tooth extraction and also just had really serious tooth decay.\u0027My view is that things have changed today and the amount of sugar children consume is out of all proportion to what they should be eating - and therefore the tradition is no longer acceptable.\u0027Ms Crawford-Usher said the practice is unfair to mums and dads who do not want their children tucking into unhealthy snacks which \u0027sets up conflict at every level.\u0027          Parents of children who attend Wateringbury Primary School were angry with the change and one mother said Ms Crawford-Usher was \u0027Britain\u0027s most miserable headteacher\u0027 She said: \u0027A few parents came to me and explained the amount of pressure they were under to comply with this tradition even though they disagreed with it.\u0027It sets up conflict at every level - the whole thing is just a nightmare for schools, and a nightmare for parents.\u0027The playground was often covered in litter from children leaving school and dropping their sweet wrappers on this floor.When the birthday tradition was first banned, Ms Crawford-Usher faced a backlash from parents who thought they were being \u0027cruel and unsympathetic\u0027 to children.But the headteacher said she has since seen a real difference at the school where the playground is now litter free.She said: \u0027Immediately a number of parents thought I was being cruel and unsympathetic and I tried to explain that I had to make a policy that was going to put everybody on an equal playing field.\u0027The children quickly accept rules that have a strong reason for them.\u0027I\u0027m all for children questioning rules and discussing them because they\u0027ve got a point of view, and if I can explain a clear reason they accept it.\u0027It\u0027s really important that parents understand that we\u0027ve got the children\u0027s well being at heart - it\u0027s not because I don\u0027t like sweets.\u0027But parents reacted angrily to the rule.One Kent mother said: \u0027She\u0027s the most miserable headteacher in Britain.\u0027  Ms Crawford-Usher noted that children are provided with healthy and wholesome school dinners such as spaghetti bolognese, shepherd\u0027s pie and roast dinners - all made with fresh ingredients.The strict head also said desserts were on the table but they too were natural and unprocessed.           The ban comes after recent figures revealed 13,000 children under five needed tooth extractions last yearShe said: \u0027Children can eat and drink whatever they want when they get home, I just want to provide them with healthier choices at school.\u0027The dental problems among schoolchildren now are awful and I want to do what I can to prevent it.\u0027It\u0027s a terribly traumatic ordeal for a child to have their tooth extracted and it\u0027s something I want to avoid.\u0027It comes after recent figures revealed 13,000 children under five needed tooth extractions last year.Public Health England estimated that youngsters were eating around eight more cubes of sugar per day than the recommended guidelines.Mrs Crawford-Usher\u0027s decision has come under fire on social media from Olympic race walker Tom Bosworth.He said: \u0027Again, common sense needs to be used here. Really what is happening to society to ban kids from having sweets on their birthday. \u0027Ban them every other day if you like, but let a child be a child on their birthday though.\u0027The head hit back and said the Olympian had perhaps missed the point.She said: \u0027Yes, I think pupils should be able to eat sweets on their birthday but if each and every child brings them in to celebrate, the children would be eating them nearly every day.\u0027Also it puts an unfair pressure on parents to bring in sweets when perhaps they don\u0027t agree with them.\u0027Wateringbury CE Primary School is based near Maidstone, Kent.Its mission statement reads: \u0027Our vision...to be an excellent primary school at the heart of the community where we inspire, excite and enable children to achieve.\u0027It was rated \u0027good\u0027 in a 2017 Ofsted report and Mrs Crawford-Usher said the obesity levels among pupils falls slightly below the national average.She has been headteacher of the school for eight years. "},{"url":null,"title":"Tallest outdoor observation deck Western Hemisphere open New York City year","story":"    The soon-to-open Hudson Yards observation deck, the Edge, will stand at more than 1,100 feet above the street level  Edge will be the tallest outdoor observation deck in the Western Hemisphere and the fifth highest in the world          The Hudson Yards project costing $28 billion will include more than 100 retail shops and restaurants, a cultural and performing arts venue and a public square and gardens\u0027Go out of the building and walk 65 feet straight out into the sky on the highest public balcony in New York,\u0027 the website for the new venue touts. Further up the structure, on the 101st floor, also will be a 10,000-square-foot bar, restaurant and event space.When open, Edge will be taller than the open-air observation decks at the Empire State Building, (at 1,050 feet above street level) and Top of the Rock at the Rockefeller Center (850 feet) in New York City.\u0027Edge invites visitors to walk out into the sky and embrace unobstructed, panoramic views of New York City like never before,\u0027 according to Jason Horkin, executive director of Hudson Yards Experiences.Forgotten Ireland: Historical photographs taken at the turn...Share this article    A clear glass floor on the balcony will also give visitors a view straight down to the New York City streets          The open air observation balcony will be taller than the ones at the Empire State Building and 30 Rockefeller CenterWhile a firm opening date has not been established, group reservations are being taken for the first quarter 2020. The One World Trade Center observatory is listed at 1,368 feet above the street level, but is fully enclosed within the building.The Hudson Yards is the largest privately built real estate project ever in the US, constructed over 28 acres of a working rail yard on the west side of Manhattan. The finished complex costing $28 billion will include more than 100 retail shops and restaurants, a cultural and performing arts venue and a public square and gardens.           The Edge deck will be taller than the observation decks at the Empire State Building, (1,050 feet above street level) and Top of the Rock at Rockefeller Center (850 feet)           The Hudson Yards is the largest privately built real estate project ever in the USNew York\u0027s Edge will be tallest outdoor observation deck in Western Hemisphere | CNN Travel"},{"url":null,"title":"Saudi woman fled oppressive family celebrates birthday free woman","story":"Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun, 18, spent three days at Bangkok airport after being denied entry by Thai immigration officialsToday she took to Twitter to celebrate her birthday, saying: \u0027she was born again in this life\u0027 and that it was her \u0027first birthday being free\u0027. In response, people  posted messages of support to the Saudi teenager.Danielle T said: \u0027Happy Birthday and more to importantly you independence.

Was this not spag bol I saw before me? And, if not, what would my children eat for tea?As the meat turned from dark crimson to light tan, I sought advice. ‘Um, kids, any idea as to the contents of this pan?’ Both looked up, sighed theatrically and returned to wrestling with the dog.‘It’s spaghetti bolognese. Obviously,’ muttered my daughter, 11, while my son, just nine, rolled his eyes and nodded.Yup, thought so. I boiled away the red wine, threw in a great splodge of tomato puree, turned the heat to a simmer and retired to the sofa in triumph. The nation’s ‘Official Favourite Dish’ (according to a 2018 survey) does exist.Now, I get Mayor Virginio Merola’s point. Ragu alla Bolognese is a classic dish from northern Italy, in which a slow-cooked meat sauce called ragu (made with either beef or a mix of beef and pork) meets fresh tagliatelle pasta.          The mayor called the popular pasta dish \u0027fake news\u0027 and has nothing to do with his home town of Bologna There are strict rules as to what goes in, although — this being Italy — no one agrees what they are.Spag bol, on the other hand, is basically mince with onions and tomato. Plus everything from ketchup to garlic, basil, carrots, thyme, Marmite, chocolate, coffee granules, Worcestershire sauce and chilli. It’s served with dried spaghetti.No wonder the Mayor called the British dish ‘fake news’. We’ve been here before: a couple of years ago, the late, great chef Antonio Carluccio claimed that Brits had ruined ragu by adding herbs. And Mary Berry ran into trouble by using white wine (which I have seen in ‘authentic’ recipes from Bologna) and double cream for her version.But I get the feeling that the Mayor’s outburst last weekend was cynically calculated to stir up controversy. It’s a reliable trick: when no one’s paying you much attention as Mayor of Bologna, drag out the old spag bol spat and let battle recommence. Mayor of Bologna says he\u0027s sick of tourists ordering...Which posh nosh IS worth the dosh? Ocado\u0027s dumping of...Share this article I admit spaghetti bolognese, as we know it in this country, is about as authentically Bolognese as I am. Some say Italian emigrants invented it in America, others that those same immigrants created it in Soho, London, in the Fifties.But, more than a cross-cultural hybrid, spag bol soothes and delights, a taste of childhood that resonates deep into adult life.Just as T.S. Eliot’s J. Alfred Prufrock measures out his life in coffee spoons, so I chart my ever-advancing years (I’m 44) in tales of spaghetti bolognese. I’ve probably eaten it more than any other dish: even more than burgers and hot dogs (both immigrant dishes, too).It was a staple of my youth, made from good butcher’s mince by my mother, with little else other than a chopped onion and squeeze of Sainsbury’s tomato puree. Inauthentically, there was always more sauce than pasta. (In Italy, pasta is daintily anointed, not drowned.)Worse, it was finished with lashings of that dusty, foul-smelling cheese-powder that came in a cardboard cylinder and would probably have emerged unscathed from a nuclear war.          Camilla Parker Bowles served her own take on spaghetti bolognese - mince with a chopped onion and Sainsbury\u0027s tomato pureeNot that that bothered us two ravenous children, faced with the tea to beat them all.Simple, but by God we loved it. Just as we adored the stuff on holiday in southern Italy. Not for us the zuppa di cozze (mussel soup) and oozingly lactic burrata cheese, nor spaghetti con vongole (clams) or the baked pasta dish, Sformato Ferdinando. Nope, for my sister, me and my cousins, it was spaghetti bolognese. With chips. Every lunch and dinner. For two weeks.Back in London, and lunch with my grandmother in old-fashioned trattorias like Mimmo D’Ischia on Elizabeth Street and La Fontana on the Pimlico Road (both now gone the way of all flesh).We might have tried an occasional grilled veal paillard. But, really, the waiters never needed to ask. Spaghetti bolognese, per favore. And molto, molto parmesan.They knew Brits liked it with mince rather than a slow-cooked hunk of beef. And that was fine. For most Italians, regional authenticity is important — but so, too, are generosity and good manners. Give the children what they want.At prep school, I found out how deranged this dish could be —onions, hideously burnt while still somehow raw, mixed with ketchup and mince that was grey, gristled and greasy. That wasn’t food: it was the definition of dyspeptic disgust.Forced through the grinder of British institutional eating in the Seventies and Eighties, it had no chance. But it’s a dish I continued to cook throughout my life. Student stand-by, saviour of the dreary dinner party, a crucial Cupid’s arrow in the search for true love.As I grew older, the ingredients got better, but if you could chop an onion and turn on a gas ring, you were halfway there. It was slow-cooked succour, seasoned with nostalgia and greed. These days I add sliced pancetta and, whisper it, chicken livers, garlic and even double cream. Because this is my spag bol, and this is the way I make it.The recipe my children so adore may be nearer to a classic ragu alla Bolognese. But I still serve it with spaghetti, swamped in sauce, and covered in a blizzard of parmesan — albeit freshly grated.So no, Signore Mayor, this is not a Bolognan dish. It never has been — and you knew that all along. But it does exist here as a true domestic classic, homage and hybrid at once. A dish unbound by formal strictures, and all the better for it.Spag bol may have no place in Bologna. But in Britain, it’s a true taste of home.

In London, walking down Kentish Town High Road, going for my regular swims, you have to try hard to breathe — not quite the same as rambling round beautiful Crummock Water.A few years after we moved in I bought five fields, around 15 acres, which surround the house. I created an orchard, tree house and rebuilt the drystone walls.I loved our little town of Cockermouth, an architectural gem, where I swam three times a week, poked around the antique shops, met local friends, had lunch. I did get upset when anyone asked, ‘Enjoying your holidays?’ ‘Do you mind?’ I’d say. ‘We live here.’I liked to think I was part of the community all those years, entering for the Loweswater Show, taking part in events, getting to know everyone.

HUNTER DAVIES reveals the joys and...How do I work the dishwasher again? Writer Hunter Davies,...Share this articleSome months after Margaret died, I spent six weeks on my own in Loweswater to see if I could stand it, if I could survive being on my own in a fairly large and remote house.It was a strange feeling. In London I had grown used by now to the absence of Margaret. At first I’d think I could see her through the window, sitting reading on the downstairs couch when I came home through the back way, walking across the garden, but that soon faded. I was so busy in London, so active, so many social activities.In Loweswater, though, during those weeks on my own, I imagined she was there, in the house with me, all the time.Each day when I came back from my walk to the lake, or from Cockermouth, I opened the front door and I expected to find a note from her, written in her bold and impeccable handwriting.The notes normally contained one of three messages:Do not disturb. I am working. Answer your own bloody phone calls, it has gone non-stop.Have gone to the lake, down the Lonning, back the Scenic Way.If it was the latter, and she had put the time she left, I would immediately turn round and go and meet her.In Lakeland, it had always been just us, we two, at constant close quarters, in a remote rural situation. Little wonder I now sensed and saw her presence all the time.In London, we had our three children living near by, and grandchildren, friends and neighbours we had known for 50 years, visitors for work and pleasure popping in. In London there were always distractions. In Lakeland, I was alone with my thoughts and memories. So I decided to sell.          It was a strange feeling. In London I had grown used by now to the absence of Margaret. In Loweswater, though, during those weeks on my own, I imagined she was there, in the house with me, all the timeThe local estate agent I contacted to do the dirty deed — well, it seems dirty to me, awfully disloyal to Lakeland — boasted that they employed a drone and a fully qualified drone pilot. The idea was to hover in the air, about 400ft high, film and photograph our lovely house, and my lovely five fields, and show the three lovely lakes within walking distance. Isn’t modern technology grand?I had decided to show all prospective buyers round the house myself, to talk to them, find out where they were from, what they were really looking for.After all, I knew the house, knew the problems and pleasures — unlike the estate agents.It was such an intimate experience, showing strangers your bedroom, watching them lift up carpets you would rather they did not, avoiding sinks for fear of catching the plague, or entering a room and making a face at your wallpaper.In the end there were six who were seriously interested. Four were roughly local while two had come from farther afield. One was from London and the other from the West Country, both men who had left their wives at home. They each stayed overnight locally, returning the next morning for a second look.I was amazed they were investing so much time. Then I remembered that when we bought the house I had come from London on the train for the day, on my own. It could well have been a total waste of time.Blow me, next day both men made offers — at the asking price. I suppose I could have tried to get them higher, but I was so delighted by their enthusiasm for the area, which they already knew well, and their clear love for the house.I had cross-examined each about their finances when I had taken them round, subtly of course. I am known in our family for being subtle and discreet — har har. The one from the West Country would be getting a mortgage on his existing house while the Londoner appeared to have the cash already, having sold some internet company. It could have been a lie of course, but I believed him.He turned out to be a Tottenham Hotspur season-ticket holder, so clearly a man who was totally sensible and reliable. I don’t think I could have sold it to an Arsenal fan. So I accepted his offer.He then wanted a full survey done, which was a bit of a worry. When I bought the house at auction, I never had a survey. I decided I loved it so much that I would accept any faults. Just like falling in love with my dear wife.But the survey was OK and the Londoner hurried me into a quick sale, offering to exchange contracts and complete all on the same day. Usually there is a gap of about a month. It meant I had to clear up and empty the house much more quickly than I had planned.In a way, the speed made the agony less. I was too busy to mope and mourn or have any second thoughts — which I had been having, thinking, Oh God, what have I done? It was not just that Margaret had died. I now felt part of me was dying as well.I had to quickly get rid of all the furniture and my treasures — or what I call my treasures. The real rubbish I dumped, lesser rubbish went to charity shops, while some of the choicer items I gave away, such as an 1810 guidebook to Lakeland, written anonymously by Wordsworth, which I gave to his home, Dove Cottage.The ordinary domestic stuff went into Mitchells auction house in Cockermouth in their ordinary domestic weekly sales. That was agony, seeing items of furniture we so loved, comfy fireside easy chairs we had spent a fortune re-covering, going for piddling sums.I don’t know why people ever buy new stuff when you can get excellent second-hand furniture so reasonably.Yet the price fetched for one tatty item, a stuffed red squirrel in a wooden case which was falling to pieces, amazed me. I had kept it in the fireplace in my office and looked at it every day as I sat down to work, thinking I really should repair it or at least dust it. It must have been harbouring appalling germs. It went for £60.I didn’t go to any of the sales. I couldn’t bear to see any of my beloved objects being brutally dismissed, going for peanuts or, worst of all, ending up with that dreaded word beside them — unsold.I SPENT the final two nights in an empty house, lying on a mattress on the wooden floor in an empty bedroom. All the contents, the domestic junk as well as the treasures, had gone.Getting down on the floor was relatively easy — you just flop, collapse — but getting up, oh my God, that was agony. I had to roll over and somehow prop myself up with my elbow. I had not realised how low a floor is, and how high a normal bed is. Or how old I was. So I flopped back on the mattress again. I felt like a squatter in someone else’s neglected, forgotten home.I stared round at the bedroom walls. I could see the faded patches where our prized paintings had been. I stared out of the naked windows at Grasmoor, the looming fell after which our house is named.All 14 windows in the house have stunning views, back and front, of the fells and fields, lakes and landscape. The curtains had gone as well, after the man from Mitchells pointed out they were Sandersons, in William Morris design, and would fetch some money. Good job Margaret never told me how much she had spent on them. I would have moaned.Lying there, with my eyes closed, I could see the family and all the visitors to the house over the years. I could see John Prescott, whose autobiography I ghostwrote, and his lovely wife Pauline both sitting in our garden, with two heavies in a corner, keeping an eye on him, as he was deputy prime minister at the time.I could hear my fellow Cumbrian Melvyn Bragg admiring my conservatory, asking how I had got planning permission. I could see all our three children and grandchildren at my wife’s 70th birthday party eight years earlier.On my very last day in the house, our son Jake and his wife Rosa drove up to help me bring stuff back to London — the personal bits and pieces, photographs and mementos, nothing really valuable, just things I wanted to keep. We reminisced of course about their memories of the house and of Margaret in it, such as the time, on her 50th birthday, she had got up at five o’clock and climbed Red Pike.The night before, when asked what she really wanted on her birthday, she said her special treat would be to climb Red Pike first thing in the morning with me. I said great, I’ll come. Alas, I slept in and never heard her getting up.She brought me tea in bed at eight as usual and I remarked that her hair was wet.‘Oh, is it?’ she said. ‘Probably because I got up at five and climbed Red Pike and had a swim in Crummock. I nearly woke you, but you were sound asleep . . .’I love this story, even if it is at my expense. It has become a family legend — the image of her going off on her own, enjoying herself so much, then gently boasting about it.Jake now does not quite believe it. He recently got out the map and thinks she could not have got as far as the top of Red Pike and back in three hours from our house. But she had obviously been somewhere, I said. Her hair was wet. She must have had a swim. He still does not believe it.Margaret did tend to ‘improve’ stories, exaggerate, but then she was a proper novelist. I plan to believe that story for ever, that she did climb Red Pike and swim in the lake on her 50th birthday.And that was the house sold, 30 years of our life cleared away, packed up, gone for ever. Only the memories remain.AS you get older, many things mean less. Money for example. I can’t afford any more time or energy to think about making money. Time is too short.My only worry now, as I write and as I lie awake in the middle of the night, is that something awful will happen to my back, or my hernia will explode. So far, so good.I don’t really worry, or get depressed, or not for long — half an hour perhaps. It is usually to do with my stupid computer playing up, trying to buy or book something on the internet.But if I become housebound or bedridden, in constant pain and agony, I don’t know how I would cope. My cheerful-chappie character might prove a mirage.I would never willingly end my life, which Margaret always said she would, sending regular donations to Dignitas. In the end, she did not have the strength to leave the house and go to Switzerland.I am staying here in this house, whatever happens. I plan to finish myself off with an enormous amount of Beaujolais.I had a drink recently with an old friend and neighbour who used to be the chief economic advisor at the Treasury. He said that economic studies indicate people in their 70s underestimate how long they have to live — in other words, they fear they will pop off soon, so they start worrying about spending too much, saving hard in case they will be a burden and end up with a long and expensive and awful ailment.In fact, most of the 70-year-olds today do reach their 80s, and then they overestimate — thinking, Hurrah, got this far, got ages to live yet. And, of course, they have got this wrong.We folks entering our 80s have to realise we will be lucky to reach 84. In fact, only a quarter of people in their 80s end up suffering a long and expensive illness, which is why people who die in their 80s leave more than they intended to, luckily for the Treasury. I never really quite believe or understand these economic surveys, but I intend to take two morals from what I think my friend told me and intend to follow them from now on.Live, live, live. Spend, spend, spend.

Negotiations with Brussels had failed. It appeared that Britain’s last days in the European Union had turned into a fiasco, and the Prime Minister’s heroic three-year quest to deliver Brexit was doomed\u0027This last-minute dash meant only one thing. The Prime Minister smelt a deal in the offing. One that could help her muster enough support in the House of Commons.But is she right?Has Mrs May extracted enough from Brussels to satisfy the 118 Tory Brexiteers who voted down her deal in January – in the process inflicting the largest defeat on a sitting prime minister in living memory?We won’t know the answer to that question till later today, but the problem is simple to explain. Mrs May cannot hope to get the support of Tory rebels if her withdrawal arrangement leaves Britain stuck forever in the Irish backstop – meaning that Northern Ireland must stay in the customs union, subject to European rules but with no decision making capacity.Brexiteers say that such an arrangement turns Britain into a ‘vassal state’. Not in a million years will they vote for it.However, if Mrs May has persuaded the president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, and chief negotiator Michel Barnier to provide an escape route from the backstop, then her deal has a chance of getting through the House of Commons.Last night the Government and Brussels agreed a plan that could enable Attorney General Geoffrey Cox to alter his legal advice on the backstop.The package includes a new legally-binding document that should allow the UK to seek an exit from the backstop if the EU tries to make it permanent, along with legal status for a separate package of assurances offered by Brussels in January.The MPs’ vote today is one of the most fateful parliamentary votes in British history.The mere fact that Mrs May went to Strasbourg yesterday evening for a meeting with Mr Juncker sends a strong signal that the Prime Minister is confident that she’s got a deal.          \u0027If Mrs May has persuaded the president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker (pictured), and chief negotiator Michel Barnier to provide an escape route from the backstop, then her deal has a chance of getting through the House of CommonsMay returns to Downing Street after winning \u0027legally binding...Trouble for Jeremy Corbyn? Almost 100 Labour MPs and peers...Share this articleShe hardly want to risk a humiliating failure.But remember this. The Prime Minister is not the ultimate arbiter. She will have to defer to her Attorney General. In uncanny ways Mr Cox finds himself in the same situation as his predecessor Lord (Peter) Goldsmith found himself in ahead of the Iraq war in 2003.Tony Blair was desperate to invade. But he could not give the order to send troops to Iraq until he received a formal undertaking from Goldsmith that the war was legal. And we now know that Blair twisted Lord Goldsmith’s arm to ensure that he came to the ‘right’ decision.Geoffrey Cox is thought to be made of sterner stuff. Unlike the hapless Goldsmith, MPs believe he is his own man.Last January he struck a body blow to the Prime Minister when he warned there was a risk that the backstop ‘would endure indefinitely’.That is why Mrs May needs Mr Cox to confirm that the Irish backstop problem has been solved. A Cox veto – and she and her deal are both finished.Crucially, Mr Cox did not fly to Strasbourg with Mrs May. He stayed at Westminster, keeping his distance.          \u0027Last January Geoffrey Cox (pictured) struck a body blow to the Prime Minister when he warned there was a risk that the backstop ‘would endure indefinitely’Very wise. More than anyone else, Mr Cox has the future of Mrs May in his hands. And – far more importantly – Britain’s future in the EU.Brexiteers insist, nevertheless, that even he does not have the final say. Members of the European Research Group of hardline rebels have employed a team of eight lawyers to make their own judgment. Who can say what advice they will give?Nevertheless, matters were looking much more hopeful last night. There was a spring in the Prime Minister’s step.We will know later today whether she achieved enough to convince the Tory rebels.If she hasn’t, Britain is on course to crash out of the European Union without a deal on March 29.Matters will no longer be in Mrs May’s hands. With time running out, Parliament could move to delay the implementation of Article 50 and rule out No Deal. In which case, political and economic upheaval looms. The stakes could not be higher. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2019/03/12/01/079E6B7A000003E8-6797727-Indonesian_emergency_services_carry_a_body_bag_in_the_wake_of_th-a-123_1552353323240.jpg","title":"Holiday giant TUI refuses ground fleet Boeing 737 Max 8 planes","story":"    TUI\u0027s fleet of Boeing 737 MAX 8 planes (pictured) will continue to fly, the company said          US plane maker Boeing is facing questions over the safety of one of its key aircraft models           China - an important market for Boeing - became the first country to ground the 737 MAX 8 on Monday. Ethiopian Airlines did the same, saying the decision came as an \u0027extra safety precaution\u0027Tui ordered 32 Max aircraft as part of a major fleet overhaul and took delivery of its first Max 8 in December. It was the first UK-registered airline to receive one of the new Boeing aircraft and plans to roll out its orders over the next five years.A spokesman for the UK Civil Aviation Authority said there are currently five MAX 8s registered and operational in Britain with a sixth aircraft due to enter operation for Tui later this week.Transport minister Baroness Sugg said the Civil Aviation Authority was working closely with the European Aviation Safety Agency.          Former pilot and Labour peer Lord Tunnicliffe, urged the Government to ground the planesShe said: ‘The current position is more information is needed to warrant any grounding decision.’But Labour peer Lord Tunnicliffe, a former pilot, urged the Government to immediately ground the Boeing plane.He said: \u0027In my day we had a rule - If it can go wrong it will go wrong. The industry seems to have lost sight of this rule. I believe everybody involved will be shown to be in dereliction of their duty.\u0027Holidaymakers took to social media to voice their concerns. Lucy Barcoo asked TUI on Twitter: ‘Can you please tell me which type of aircraft my flight home from Ibiza will be on please? Very concerned about the Boeing 737 Max.’Michael Bibby wrote: ‘TUI need to ground the death plane until Boeing provide a proper fix!’Authorities in China, Indonesia, Ethiopia, Mongolia, Mexico, Brazil, and the Cayman Islands have acted swiftly and grounded the aircraft.The US Federal Aviation Administration said that while it still considered the jets to be ‘airworthy’, it wants Boeing to submit ‘design changes’ by next month.Boeing had been facing questions over the flight control systems that is suspected of causing the two accidents.All passengers and crew on board the Nairobi-bound plane, including nine Britons, died in the disaster - the second involving a 737 MAX 8 in just five months.Last October, the same model of plane, operated by Lion Air, crashed in Indonesia, killing 189 and experts have highlighted the \u0027similarities\u0027 between the two tragedies.Indonesia and China have grounded all Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft while U.S. officials said they would take \u0027immediate action\u0027 if they found safety flaws in the planes. Ethiopian Airlines and Cayman Airways have also taken the jets out of service.  As Ethiopia marked a day of mourning and the search for remains entered a second day, rescuers said they had recovered the aircraft\u0027s black box which is expected to shed light on the cause of the crash.Until they have done so, the Boeing 737 Max 8 are \u0027not safe to fly\u0027, according to CNN\u0027s aviation expert, Mary Schiavo, a former Inspector General of the U.S. Department of of Transportation.Ms Schiavo was asked point blank if she thought the planes were safe, to which she responded no, adding that the \u0027responsible thing to do\u0027 would be to ground all Boeing 737 Max 8 until the cause of the Ethiopia crash had been established.

She never really wanted to do anything else but work in animal welfare since she was a child.\u0027Somehow that work took her into the international sphere and for the last 15 years she has been working for international animal welfare organisations.\u0027That involves a lot of travelling around the world - although personally I never wanted her to be on a single one of those planes.\u0027I\u0027m an environmental campaigner myself, so partly it was because of the damage to the environment but also because it\u0027s a dangerous occupation to be flying. Up until now she had been lucky.             Members of the search and rescue mission look for dead bodies of passengers at the scene of the Ethiopian Airlines crash            Rescue workers collect bodies in bags at the crash site of Ethiopia Airlines near Bishoftu following Sunday\u0027s air disaster            Wreckage lies at the crash site after the Ethiopian Airlines jet came down within minutes of take-off on Sunday morning            Just two days before her death Joanna Toole sent her last tweet, celebrating international women\u0027s day and thanking colleagues\u0027Joanna was a very soft and loving person. Everybody was very proud of her and the work she did. We\u0027re still in a state of shock. \u0027Joanna was genuinely one of those people who you never heard a bad word about. She was one of those people who burned the candle at both ends.  \u0027She never had any doubt that she wanted to work in animal welfare and on the international scene, that meant a lot of travel. It\u0027s hard to imagine life without her.\u0027One of her UN colleagues, Manuel Barange, called her a \u0027wonderful human being who loved her work with a passion\u0027, saying he was \u0027so profoundly sad and lost for words\u0027 at the news of her death. According to her LinkedIn page she had worked for the UN since 2016, living in Rome where she recently set up home with her partner.  She previously worked at World Animal Protection and Animal Defenders International, after graduating from Anglia Ruskin University in 2004 with a degree in Animal Behaviour and Wildlife Biology. In a blog she wrote when she worked for WAP she described herself as a keen er, adding: \u0027I\u0027m committed to the protection of all animals, but the underwater world and the animals within it are my greatest passion.\u0027 Polar expert Sarah Auffret, who had French and British dual nationality, was also killed in the crash. Colleagues paid tribute to her as a \u0027true friend and beloved colleague\u0027.  \u0027Words cannot describe the sorrow and despair we feel,\u0027 her employers at the Norway-based Association of Arctic Expedition Cruise Operators said. Raised in Brittany, the environmental agent was leading AECO\u0027s efforts to cut back single-use plastics on Arctic expeditions and coordinating beach clean-ups. Another victim, 55-year-old Joseph Waithaka, lived in Hull for more than a decade before returning to his native Kenya in 2015. The BBC reported he had dual Kenyan and British citizenship. He had been visiting his wife and children, who still live in Hull, and was on his way back to Kenya via Ethiopia when he boarded the doomed flight aboard the Boeing 737 Max 8 jet.Mr Waithaka worked for the probation service during his time in Hull and his family said he had \u0027helped so many people\u0027 during his time in England.       The graphic shows how the plane\u0027s vertical speed fluctuated in the minute before it crashed near Addis Ababa airport His son, Ben Kuria, said: \u0027My dad was a private man but he also had a pastoral heart. He really championed people. He really helped people realise their potential. \u0027He would tell stories which would inspire the young people he was helping who were not at a great time in their lives.  \u0027As a father he was very protective and he really wanted us to do well. He supported us and ensured we got stuck into our education. He really rooted for his children.\u0027 The one Irish victim was named as engineer Michael Ryan, an employee of the UN\u0027s World Food Programme - which said seven of its staff members had died in the crash, including two Italians. The Rome-based aid worker and engineer, known as Mick, was from Lahinch in Co Clare in Ireland\u0027s west and was believed to be married with two children.  UK Prime Minister Theresa May said she was \u0027deeply saddened to hear of the devastating loss of life following the plane crash in Ethiopia\u0027. \u0027At this very difficult time my thoughts are with the families and friends of the British citizens on board and all those affected by this tragic incident,\u0027 she said.    Joanna Toole, pictured, was the first British victim to be named.

Instability at that point e.g. too slow - could destabilise the aircraft, potentially risking stalling and other hazardous consequences. It might indicate the pilots had difficulty controlling the climbascent.\u0027An experienced pilot told MailOnline the activity was highly unusual. He said: \u0027A positive number indicates the aircraft is going up. After takeoff you would expect all these numbers to be positive as the aircraft climbed away from the ground, or zero if they are flying level. \u0027The small amount of data released so far indicates that after only one minute or so of the flight this aircraft started a descent at a rate of up to 1920 feet per minute down. If the data is correct that is extremely unusual. \u0027The data then shows the aircraft going up and down until the data stops. That is why some people are referring to unstable vertical speed. \u0027You would not expect a descent unless you were immediately returning, and if that was the case you wouldn\u0027t then expect the aircraft to climb again. \u0027After takeoff aircraft either climb or fly level for a period then climb again.\u0027               The wreckage of the plane - showing the colours of the Ethiopian flag on the plane\u0027s livery - lies at the scene of the crash The families of those on the plane have been arriving at special information centres to find out their next steps      Family members of the victims involved in a plane crash react at Addis Ababa international airport Sunday, hours after their loves ones took off            Ethiopia Airlines group CEO, Mr Tewolde Gebremariam, who is pictured at the accident scene.

It took them until 11am to get there  Ethiopian Airlines air crash is the second involving brand new Boeing 737 in just three months after 189 were killed in Indonesia tragedyBy Joel Adams for MailOnlineThe tragic deaths of 157 passengers and crew yesterday, when an Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft crashed within minutes of take-off in Addis Ababa, are raising serious questions over the safety record of both aircraft and airline.It was on another brand new Boeing 737 Max 8, in Indonesia less than five months ago, that 189 people lost their lives in the Java Sea when Lion Air Flight 610 plummeted out of the skies minutes after taking off from Jakarta.And the incident brings the African carrier\u0027s death toll to 482 across 22 fatal incidents since its inception in 1965 - and almost 500 more people have been injured in EA crashes and incidents, according to information from the Flight Safety Foundation.For comparison, only one British Airways flight has only ever been involved in one fatal incident: the Zagreb runway crash of 1976 when all 176 people aboard two planes died when BA Flight 476 collided with another aircraft on takeoff due to an air traffic control error.              An Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 737 Max 8 went down within six minutes of take-off this morning (pictured: stock image)            Ethiopian Airlines Group CEO Tewolde GebreMariam inspects the newly-arrived Boeing 737 Max 8 months before the crashInitial reports yesterday showed considerable similarities between the Ethiopian and Indonesian disasters which involve the same plane.Yesterday\u0027s flight lost contact about six minutes after take-off, having requested and been given clearance to return to the airport in Abbis Ababa.Last year, Lion Air 610 also went down minutes after take-off having requested permission to return to base.Yesterday, telemetry shows the plane\u0027s vertical airspeed fluctuated rapidly in the minutes and second before its crash, including in the final moments when it seems to have been locked in a terrifyingly accelerating nosee,.Investigations thus far by the Indonesian and American aviation authorities have concluded the Lion Air plane also hit the sea after a violent nosee.The New York Times reports that investigators are considering whether that e might have been caused by updated Boeing software that was meant to prevent a stall - but that can send the plane into a fatal descent if the altitude and angle information being fed into the computer system is incorrect.The change in the flight control system, which can override manual motions in the Max model, was not explained to pilots, according to some pilots\u0027 unions.After that crash, Boeing said that it was continuing \u0027to evaluate the need for software or other changes as we learn more from the ongoing investigation.\u0027 It was unclear if the company had made any changes.In a statement on Sunday, Boeing said it was \u0027deeply saddened\u0027 to learn of the crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302.    Indonesian emergency services carry a body bag in the wake of the Lion Air disaster last year  \u0027A Boeing technical team is prepared to provide technical assistance at the request and under the direction of the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board,\u0027 the company said.The state-owned Ethiopian Airlines calls itself Africa\u0027s largest carrier and has ambitions of becoming the gateway to the continent.The airline does have a better safety rating and a newer fleet than some neighbouring operators - a number of African airlines are banned outright from EU airspace including the flag-carrier of neighbouring Eritrea.But in addition to 16 fatal incidents costing 102 lives in the 1960s, 70s, and 1980s the airline has now suffered six fatal incidents in the last thirty years, including other two huge tragedies.In 1996 after a hijacking and a failed water landing, 125 people died on Flight 961 in Moroni, the capital of the Union of the Comoros in the Indian Ocean.And in January 2010, 82 passengers and eight crew died when EA flight 409 from Beirut to Addis Ababa slammed into the Mediterranean shortly after take-off. Boeing\u0027s 737 is the world\u0027s most-sold passenger jet family and is considered one of the industry\u0027s most reliable. The MAX 8 is the latest version of the aircraft, which Boeing rolled out in 2017 as an update to the already redesigned 50-year-old 737.By the end of January, Boeing had delivered 350 MAX jets out of the total order tally of 5,011 aircraft.     "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2019/03/12/00/06BC37C6000003E8-0-image-a-1_1552350556241.jpg","title":"Stephen Hawkings life set celebrated 50p coin","story":"    The life of Stephen Hawking is being celebrated with a commemorative 50p coin (pictured) inspired by his work on black holes.

Photograph: Joe Kilroy Everywhere, precious species are in decline. Sometimes, however, there is good news, such as the rare example of the recovery of the long-threatened Irish red squirrel.For years, the red has faced insurmountable competition from its grey cousin, but the growth of the pine marten’s population has brought a curb to its dominance, says Dr Colin Lawton of NUI Galway.Zoology researchers at NUIG have now teamed up with Ulster Wildlife and the Vincent Wildlife Trust to track exactly how many reds and greys exist, along with the numbers of pine martens.The public are being asked to take part by recording any sightings they make this year. The results will then be compared with previous surveys conducted in 1997, 2007 and 2012, but the latest survey will be the most detailed yet.More aggressiveSince their introduction in 1911 (a one-off introduction in Co Longford) the American grey squirrel, which is more aggressive than its red cousin, has spread throughout much of the island.Long considered vermin, grey squirrels destroy native woodland, strip young saplings of their bark, dig up flowers and raid birds’ nests. However, they do not kill their red cousins.Instead, they carry the deadly squirrel parapox virus, which does no harm to greys, but, if picked up by a red squirrel, will cause the infected animal to suffer an excruciating death within weeks.Currently, the island of Ireland has approximately 140,000 reds, but there are concerns that the population in Northern Ireland could all be gone within a generation.Reverse the tideHowever, pine martens are helping to reverse the tide, since the greys are easier for the martens to catch, while the reds are smaller and more nimble and spend less time foraging for food on the ground.“It seems the grey squirrels are not able to cope with this predator, either because they are naïve to the dangers, or are becoming stressed when the pine marten is present,” Dr Lawton.“The native red squirrel, on the other hand, has lived alongside the pine marten for centuries, and although occasionally eaten, they can co-exist quite happily,” he said."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Job satisfaction matters, but so does salary.

market appears better placed to withstand a rise in European Central Bank (ECB) interest rates than it was at the height of the boom, although a small number of homeowners remain vulnerable to even a small rate increase, new research has suggested.The joint piece of research, published on Tuesday by the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) and the Department of Finance, has found that were ECB interest rates to rise by 0.25 per cent, then around 800 homeowners, or 0.1 per cent of the total mortgage market, would struggle to meet their repayments.The research also points out that households are still “in a better position to withstand interest rate increases given the stronger economic circumstances in Ireland since 2014”.It says an improved labour market, through lower unemployment and rising incomes, “is particularly important”, but stresses that an ECB rate rise would lead to payments rising faster than long-term income growth which “would likely cause repayment difficulties for some households”.The research explores which groups are most at risk, and finds that lower income households aged between 18 and 35 who are at an earlier stage in their mortgage contract “are more likely to be affected, as are households on tracker interest rates who have a contractual pass-through from the policy rate to the lending rate”.Someone with a €300,000 mortgage over 25 years would see repayments climb by around €33 per month in the event of a quarter of a point rate increase.Were the ECB rate to climb by 1 per cent than the additional costs for many mortgage holders would top €100 per month, and could see more than 3,000 more homeowners struggling to meet their repayments.Adverse shocksESRI researcher Conor O’Toole, who wrote the report, said the mortgage market here had “recovered considerably from the crisis, and households are better placed to deal with adverse shocks”.He said although the market was in a much better place “to withstand interest rate rises”, vulnerabilities for particular groups of households remain “if interest rates were to rise and inevitably new arrears cases would materialise”.Mortgage broker and commentator Karl Deeter played down the risks associated with any rate increase, and said the ECB was unlikely to make any moves for at least a year.He said many of the cohort with tracker mortgages would have paid off a substantial portion of their mortgages at this stage, and would have equity in their homes which would offer them a degree of protection against future shock.And he said most of the new mortgages being issued have their rates fixed, which would protect new buyers.“Not only that but all of the loans issued since 2009 have been stressed tested by banks, who have looked very closely at how borrowers would handle a mortgage rate increase of 2 per cent above variable rates, so if those tests are to mean anything then they would mean people are protected against substantial rate increase.”Mr Deeter pointed out that variable rates on offer in Ireland – which can be as high as 4.5 per cent – were “crucifying people, which is why everybody has been getting fixed rates”.He said banks were offering five-year fixed rate mortgages for significantly less than 3 per cent, while 10-year fixed rates were on the market for just over 3 per cent."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3822814.1552379437!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit deal does not undermine backstop says

He said the Taoiseach had told him he would support the deal, along with the rest of the European Council. Mrs May said MPs had made clear legal changes were needed. “What we have secured is that the backstop cannot be indefinite,” she said.Mr Juncker said that if MPs vote against the deal today, there would be no further negotiations on the withdrawal agreement or the backstop.A joint statement issued by the EU and the UK promised “a specific negotiating track” would be established as part of the negotiations. “This dedicated track will consider the use of all existing and emerging facilitative arrangements and technologies, with a view to assessing their potential to replace, in whole or in part, the backstop solutiMonon in the Protocol on Ireland Northern Ireland.

Photograph: Vincent KesslerReuters.British prime minister Theresa May says she has secured “legally binding changes” to the Brexit withdrawal agreement and the Northern Ireland backstop ahead of a crucial House of Commons vote on Tuesday.Speaking at a press conference with European Commission president Jean Claude Juncker in Strasbourg on Monday night, Mrs May said she had agreed “exactly” what parliament had asked her to, including a a means to exit the controversial backstop, which has angered many MPs.Mr Juncker said Taoiseach Leo Varadkar had informed him that he “would be prepared to accept this solution in the interest of securing an overall deal” but he warned there would not be a third round of negotiations on the withdrawal agreement.He appealed to MPs to support the deal, warning that there could be “no further chances” and that it is “this deal or Brexit might not happen at all”.The agreement involves a legal strengthening of the assurances given in January by the EU through a “joint legal instrument” on the impermanence of the backstop. Mrs May insisted this would have “the same status” as the withdrawal agreement.The text will also strengthen the ability of the UK to ask independent arbitrators in the event of deadlock caused by EU bad faith in negotiations to allow for the partial or total dismantlement of the backstop. Amendments to the political declaration on the future relationship will recommit both sides to immediate talks on a deal which will include “alternative arrangements” which can replace the backstop.‘Delivers’Mrs May said she still believes the withdrawal agreement “delivers on the decision taken by the British people” to leave the EU but that it was not previously made clear enough that the backstop is a temporary measures.Now, she said, there is a “joint instrument with comparable legal weight to the withdrawal agreement will guarantee that the EU cannot act with the intent of applying the backstop indefinitely”.“If they do, it can be challenged through arbitration and if they are found to be in breach the UK can suspend the backstop. The joint instrument also gives a legal commitment that whatever replaces the backstop does not need to replicate it,” the prime minister said.The latest version of the agreement will now be examined by the UK attorney general Geoffrey Cox, whose advice will be shared with MPs before Tuesday’s vote.In relation to the backstop, Mr Juncker said that “if either side were to act in bad faith, there is a legal way for the other party to exit”.“The instrument which sets out these details has legal force while fully respecting the guidelines of the European Council...It compliments the withdrawal agreement without reopening it.”DublinAn extra Cabinet meeting took place in Dublin on Monday evening in light of the developments on the continent and Ministers were due to resume their discussions after the agreement was announced.Ministers insisted there has been no change in the position that the UK cannot unilaterally exit the backstop.Mr Varadkar adjourned the Cabinet meeting to take a phone call from Mr Juncker before Ministers resumed their discussions. The Cabinet meeting was then adjourned a second time pending the outcome of the talks in Strasbourg.With less than three weeks to Brexit day on March 29th — when Britain is due to leave the EU — any delay would raise renewed questions as to whether there was any way Mrs May could get her deal through the Commons. It was resoundingly rejected by a 230-vote majority by MPs in January.The prime minister has said that if she loses the vote on Tuesday, there will be further votes on Wednesday on whether the UK should leave with no-deal and on Thursday on whether they should seek an extension to the article 50 withdrawal process.Many at Westminster believe that in that event MPs would vote to delay Britain’s departure — to the fury of Brexiteers.RejectLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn said that MPs must reject the latest proposal from Mrs May when it is put to a vote on Tuesday.“The prime minister’s negotiations have failed. This evening’s agreement with the European Commission does not contain anything approaching the changes Theresa May promised parliament,” he said in a statement. “That’s why Members of Parliament must reject this deal tomorrow.”Mr Juncker wrote to European Council late on Monday to say that the UK must leave the EU by the time of the European Parliament elections in late May.“The United Kingdom’s withdrawal should be complete before the European elections that will take place between May 23rd-26th this year,” he said.“If the United Kingdom has not left the European Union by then, it will be legally required to hold these elections.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Alex KrausBloombergJoint statement supplementing the Political Declaration setting out the framework for the future relationship between the EU and the UK1 The European Union, hereafter referred to as “the Union”, and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, hereafter referred to as “the United Kingdom”, have agreed a number of measures to enhance and expedite the process of negotiating and bringing into force their future relationship, supplementing those set out in the Political Declaration endorsed by the Union and the United Kingdom on November 25th, 2018.2\u0026nbspFirst, the Union and the United Kingdom wish to emphasise their shared and solemn regard for the vision for the future relationship detailed in the Political Declaration. In this context, and in line with Paragraph 1 of the Political Declaration, both the Union and the United Kingdom reiterate the clear and important link between the Withdrawal Agreement and the Political Declaration, which while being of a different nature are part of the same negotiated package. As stated in Article 184 of the Withdrawal Agreement and reflected also in Paragraph 138 of the Political Declaration, the Union and the United Kingdom have committed to use best endeavours, in good faith and in full respect of the respective legal orders, to take necessary steps to negotiate expeditiously the agreements governing their future relationship referred to in the Political Declaration. The Union underlined this relationship between them when it published the two texts side by side in its Official Journal on February 19th, and the Parliament of the United Kingdom must consider and approve both together.3\u0026nbspSecond, the Union and the United Kingdom have the shared ambition to have the future relationship in place by the end of the transition period. To this end, the Union and the United Kingdom have confirmed that immediately following the United Kingdom’s withdrawal, they will take the steps necessary to begin formal negotiations. The Union and the United Kingdom have agreed that negotiations on the various strands of the future relationship will then proceed in parallel. Should national ratifications be pending at the end of the transition period, the European Commission has already made clear that it is ready to propose applying on a provisional basis relevant aspects of the future relationship, in line with the applicable legal frameworks and existing practice and the United Kingdom welcomes this intent.4\u0026nbspThird, with a view to providing a sound foundation for the talks and building on the commitments already contained in the Political Declaration, the Union and the United Kingdom will expeditiously: a\u0026nbspidentify those areas which are likely to require the greatest consideration, and the associated technical and legal issues that will need to be addressed, in order that the necessary technical preparations can be made on both sides and b\u0026nbspdraw up a full schedule for the negotiations, taking into account various internal processes, including the European Parliament elections and the appointment of a new Commission.5\u0026nbspFourth, and in the context of open and fair competition, the Union notes the United Kingdom’s intention to ensure that its social and employment standards and its environmental standards do not regress from those in place at the end of the transition period, and to provide its Parliament the opportunity to consider future changes in Union law in these areas.6\u0026nbspFifth, given the Union’s and the United Kingdom’s firm commitment to work at speed on a subsequent agreement that establishes by December 31st, 2020 alternative arrangements such that the backstop solution in the Protocol on IrelandNorthern Ireland will not need to be applied, a specific negotiating track will be established at the outset and as part of the negotiations to lead the analysis and development of these alternative arrangements. This dedicated track will consider the use of all existing and emerging facilitative arrangements and technologies, with a view to assessing their potential to replace, in whole or in part, the backstop solution in the Protocol on IrelandNorthern Ireland.That assessment will include an evaluation of their practicability and deliverability in the unique circumstances of Northern Ireland. By virtue of being embedded in the overall negotiation structure, the negotiating track on alternative arrangements will be able to take account of progress made in the wider negotiations on the future relationship, in particular on goods regulations and customs.In addition, and in support of their work on alternative arrangements, both the Union and the United Kingdom will consult with private sector experts, businesses, trade unions, the institutions established under the Good Friday or Belfast Agreement, and appropriate involvement of parliaments. In the first instance, the progress concerning alternative arrangements will be assessed at the first high level conference envisaged by the Political Declaration. To ensure that the negotiations are concluded in good time, further progress will be reviewed at each subsequent high level conference.Declaration by Her Majesty’s Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland concerning the Northern Ireland ProtocolThe United Kingdom reiterates its wish to establish a future partnership that is as close and strong as possible, given the global challenges it shares with the European Union, and underlines its commitment to embark on preparations immediately after the signature of the Withdrawal Agreement to ensure that negotiations on the future relationship can start as soon as possible after withdrawal.In that light, the United Kingdom notes, subject to Article 1(4) of the Protocol on IrelandNorthern Ireland, that the objective of the Withdrawal Agreement is not to establish a permanent relationship between the Union and the United Kingdom, and that the provisions of the Protocol are therefore intended to apply only temporarily, taking into account the commitments of the Parties set out in Article 2(1). The preamble to the Protocol further recalls that the Withdrawal Agreement, which is based on Article 50 TEU, does not aim at establishing a permanent future relationship between the Union and the United Kingdom.The United Kingdom wishes to record its understanding of the effect of this provision if, contrary to the intentions of the parties, it is not possible for them to conclude an agreement which supersedes the Protocol in whole or in part due to a breach of Article 5 of the Withdrawal Agreement by the Union. The United Kingdom would not consider its application to be temporary in these circumstances, as in its view the Protocol would then constitute a permanent relationship between the Union and the United Kingdom. Article 1(4) makes clear this is not the Parties’ intention.

Two US senators called the fleet\u0027s immediate grounding and a rising number of airlines said they would voluntarily ground their fleets.The company confirmed it had for several months been developing a flight control software enhancement for the 737 MAX, designed to make an already safe aircraft even safer.Boeing did not reference Sunday\u0027s Ethiopian Airlines crash in connection to the software upgrade. The statement did express the company\u0027s condolences to the relatives of the 157 people who died, however.The FAA said the changes will provide reduced reliance on procedures associated with required pilot memory items.The FAA also said Boeing will update training requirements and flight crew manuals to go with the design change to an automated protection system called the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System or MCAS. The changes also include MCAS activation and angle of attack signal enhancements.The FAA said in the notice made public that external reports are drawing similarities between the crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia. However, this investigation has just begun and to date we have not been provided data to draw any conclusions or take any actions, according to the Continued Airworthiness Notification to the International Community for Boeing 737 MAX 8 operators.US Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao told reporters regulators would not hesitate to act if they find a safety issue.If the FAA identifies an issue that affects safety, the department will take immediate and appropriate action, Chao told reporters. I want people to be assured that we take these incidents, these accidents very seriously.Boeing\u0027s top executive told employees on Monday he was confident in the safety of the US manufacturer\u0027s top-selling 737 MAX aircraft. The company added that it was still early in the Ethiopian Airlines investigation.Reuters and other media outlets have reported that Boeing has for months planned design changes after the Lion Air crash in Indonesia but the FAA notice was the first public confirmation.Canada\u0027s transport minister also said he will not hesitate to act once the cause of the crash is known.Two Democratic Senators Dianne Feinstein and Richard Blumenthal called for the immediate grounding of the aircraft, as did Paul Hudson, the president of FlyersRights.org and a member of the FAA Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee.Blumenthal said the planes should be grounded until the FAA can assure American travelers that these planes are safe.Sara Nelson, the president of Association of Flight Attendants union, wrote the FAA on Monday asking it to conduct a comprehensive review and take steps immediately to address concerns and ensure the safety of the 737 MAX fleet.The National Transportation Safety Board and the FAA are both at the crash site in Ethiopia, Chao said.Boeing\u0027s shares fell as much as 10 percent on the prospect that two such crashes in such a short time could reveal flaws in its new plane. Boeing, whose shares closed down 5.3 percent at $400.01 in the heaviest trading trade since July 2013.The 737 line, which has flown for more than 50 years, is the world\u0027s best-selling modern passenger aircraft and viewed as one of the industry\u0027s most reliable.China ordered its airlines to ground the jet, a move followed by Indonesia, Singapore and Ethiopia. Other airlines, from North America to the Middle East, kept flying the 737 MAX 8 on Monday after Boeing said it was safe.Boeing’s 737 MAX is the newest version of a jet that has been a fixture of passenger travel for decades and the cash cow of the world’s largest aircraft maker, competing against Airbus SE’s A320neo family of single-aisle jetliners. The 737 family is considered one of the industry’s most reliable aircraft.The MAX has a bigger and more efficient engine compared with earlier 737 models.Boeing rolled out the fuel-efficient MAX 8 in 2017 as an update to the already redesigned 50-year-old 737, and had delivered 350 MAX jets out of the total order tally of 5,011 aircraft by the end of January.Brexit vote latest news: Michael Gove tells MPs: \u0026#39It is make your mind up time\u0026#39 as Brexiteers reactBritish aid worker latest victim of Ethiopian Airlines crash as British death toll rises to \u0026#39at least nine\u0026#39Why extending Article 50 could be inevitable - and the consequences of delaying Brexit\u0026#39Star chamber\u0026#39 of Brexiteers: the Eurosceptic legal group that holds the PM\u0026#39s fate in their handsBrexit backstop explained: what is it, and why is the Irish border so important to the deal?Brexit latest odds tracker: Best bets on how (and if) Brexit will happenWhat happens next after the March Brexit vote?

Spike Lee\u0027s Clockers saw one of the director\u0027s most disappointing performances at the box office, taking just $13m from a $25m budget.Peter Berg\u0027s real-life drama fell more than $30m short of its $156m budget, a shame considering it\u0027s one of the Friday Night Lights creator\u0027s best films to date.Donnie Darko grossed just over $7.5m worldwide on a budget of $4.5m, not helped by its marketing campaign featuring a plane crash weeks before 911.Upon release, this cult horror was a commercial and critical failure, grossing $26.7m on a $60m production budget.There was something of a controversy surrounding David Fincher\u0027s Fight Club, which aided in making a modest profit of just under $40m at the box office. It\u0027s opening run, though, was markedly underwhelming.While far from being a catastrophic flop, The Good Dinosaur struggled to reach the heights of other Pixar releases.

It\u0027s opening run, though, was markedly underwhelming.While far from being a catastrophic flop, The Good Dinosaur struggled to reach the heights of other Pixar releases.

Not long after he became children’s minister in January 2018, Mr\u0026nbspZahawi announced the appointment of a private company called Spectra First to\u0026nbspget more than 50 businesses to provide work-based opportunities to young people leaving the care system, including every government department.The competition to say the stupidest thing about Brexit has been wonDiary: Slick work brings in the cash for Tory MP Nadhim ZahawiNeigh way! MP Nadhim Zahawi apologises for stables expense claims“My diary secretary here is brilliant, I would hire her in a heartbeat,” Mr Zahawi says of one of his own hires. He has, since this interview took place, made her a permanent member of staff.\u0026nbsp“All they need is an opportunity in life. You just have to think about these kids in the round. You have to think about their life and their experiences slightly different to, dare I say it, our kids.”Mr Zahawi could not have had a more different start. He arrived in the UK at the age of nine,\u0026nbspthe child of Kurdish parents fleeing the war in Iraq. His first school was Holland Park, a comprehensive in west London. He later moved to Ibstock Place, a private school, and King’s College School, at the time an\u0026nbspindependent school for boys in Wimbledon.\u0026nbspHe won a place at University College London to study chemical engineering, but quickly showed an interest in businesses and started a property company after graduating. In business, he is best known for YouGov, the polling company he co-founded in a garden shed in 2000. He remained its chief executive until 2010, when he was elected to parliament.He gave up several additional business interests when he was\u0026nbspmade education minister in a cabinet reshuffle\u0026nbspin January 2018, including a £350,000-a-year, part-time job at Gulf Keystone, an oil company, and a 50 per cent stake in Zahawi and Zahawi, a firm he founded with his wife Lana in 2010.\u0026nbspBut Mr Zahawi\u0026nbspstill remembers how difficult it was to arrive in the country as a young boy, with no way to communicate.\u0026nbsp“You’re wrenched away from your friends and you come to a new country, you have to start all over again,” he says. “I sat at the back of the class, I didn’t want to get laughed at, trying to string the words together to make a sentence.”Language, he quickly understood, would be the key to moving ahead. “I worked out very quickly that if you communicate well, doors open for you,” he says.\u0026nbspI ask him whether he feels young people from Syria and Afghanistan trying to get to this country in search of a better life should be given the same opportunity. He explains that his family went through the weren’t asylum seekers, but\u0026nbspapplied for settled status through the immigration system to\u0026nbspset up a business in the UK. He believed that people who work hard should be allowed to come to the UK.\u0026nbsp“We’ve got a rigorous immigration system to do that,” he says. “We’ll be able to decide our own immigration policy post-Brexit. For genuine asylum seekers we should be welcoming.”Mr\u0026nbspZahawi backed leaving the European Union. “Brexit appeals to me for no other reason than I thought we could reform within the EU, but when that became undeliverable for David Cameron I reluctantly backed Brexit because I thought the direction of travel for the EU is not right for us.”He says he doesn’t believe the German people have bought into the so-called transfer union, in which wealth within the EU ends up supporting weaker southern economies. He also believes Britons\u0026nbspwould never back the idea of a European army, an idea loathed by Brexiteers, but also seen as highly unlikely: “We’re better off exiting and wishing them luck in their endeavours but securing a trade deal so that we have access to the single market.”He never set out to be a politician. But a chance encounter at university piqued his interest.\u0026nbsp“At the University College of London union, on the first week at university, there was a bloke handing out the Socialist Worker\u0026nbspoutside. It was thin and small and I politely declined his offer at which point he was so aggressive, I thought I would go and find out about what the other side thinks,” he remembers.He was elected Conservative councillor in Putney in 1994, where he remained until 2006. In the interim, he helped run Jeffrey Archer’s unsuccessful campaign for Mayor of London in 1998. He was selected by the local Conservative association for the safe Tory seat of Stratford-on-Avon in 2010 and was re-elected in 2015\u0026nbspand 2017.\u0026nbspAs a member of parliament, Mr Zahawi has voted for reducing the rate of corporation tax and against an amendment in parliament on homes under a certain rent limit being “fit for human habitation”, notable because he is reported to have spent £25m\u0026nbspbuying property around London for buy-to-let and commercial use.\u0026nbspHis success in property has come later in life. After university, Mr Zahawi started an estate agency, but the business suffered when the property market entered a downturn in the Eighties. Mr Zahawi and his business partners were forced to liquidate.“The lesson there was that you don’t know how hard it is to make money unless you lose money,” he says. “It’s well worth all of us remembering in politics that every morning, millions of people get up and start a business or work in a small business and we have to make sure we deliver for them. It really does matter\u0026nbspthat what we do here does not hurt them and their prospects.”Small businesses are expected to be hit hardest by the UK’s decision to leave the EU. Surveys show many businesses have already been affected. Business investment fell for four consecutive quarters in 2018 for the first time since the financial crisis, according to the ONS.\u0026nbspEighty per cent of businesses considered Brexit uncertainty to have already had a negative impact on their investment decisions, according to a survey conducted in October 2018 by the Confederation of British Industry. Falling numbers of migrants have created a squeeze among employers, with the manufacturing industry in particular facing the biggest worker shortage in 30 years, according to the British Chambers of Commerce.Are we heading for a softer Brexit next week?What exactly will be better for small businesses after Brexit? Mr Zahawi doesn’t pause for breath: “One, we’ll be able to trade with the rest of the world. Two, we should be able to trade healthily with Europe and continue to have that trade. And three we’ll have our own policies on immigration or any other issues delivered in the UK.”Despite the challenges of his work, Mr Zahawi says he pinches himself every morning to think that he has ended up where he has. “Look at me today, a boy born in Baghdad, now a member of parliament for Shakespeare and a minister in Her Majesty’s government,” he says. “This country is an amazing country, it really is.”We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write. That’s why, in an era of political lies and Brexit bias, more readers are turning to an independent source.

Most were friendly\u0026nbspand willing to have a chat, and several shared stories. One, though, stood out resolutely as always not wanting to know.\u0026nbspWhile I knew left-wing MPs and was able to share a cup of tea or a beer with them, Jeremy Corbyn remained aloof. Attempts to engage with him came to nought.\u0026nbspIt wasn’t personal. I checked with colleagues and journalists at other papers, and he would not talk to them either. His preferred contact was with the Morning Star. The rest of us, it seems, were puppets of the capitalist money-making machine.\u0026nbspReading Tom Bower’s insightful new biography,\u0026nbspDangerous Hero:\u0026nbspCorbyn’s Ruthless Plot for Power, I was reminded of his isolation and single-mindedness. What struck me back then was Corbyn’s determination. He never flinched, did not once drop his guard, would not throw his hands in the air and say, “pull up a chair”.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.The most ridiculous claims made about Jeremy Corbyn Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.111 He called Hezbollah and Hamas ‘friends’True.

After much speculation about Mr Corbyn’s republican views and willingness to bow to the monarch, his office confirmed that he did not attend the official induction to the privy council because of a prior engagement, but did not rule out joining the body.1011 Jeremy Corbyn refuses to sing the national anthem.Partly true.

The group lists its purpose as the following: “To increase awareness of issues surrounding the dairy industry and focus on economic issues affecting the dairy industry and producers.”It’s a memory that has stayed. Talk to business people and they cite their fear of John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor. Corbyn, they dismiss as lacking the intellect and robustness of his lieutenant. But that’s the point, as Bower makes clear –\u0026nbspCorbyn is the leader, the orchestrator, the politician who has travelled a long, singular road to the top. He may not have the academic qualifications, he may seem to lack gravitas and at times appear woolly. He is undoubtedly surrounded by people sharper and brighter than he is, like McDonnell. None of it matters. They answer to him.\u0026nbspThere is a fascinating section in Bower’s book that focuses on Corbyn’s economic beliefs. What makes it especially interesting is because it’s rare for Corbyn to expound on domestic policy –\u0026nbsphe’s much more at home discussing a conflict between socialist rebels and an incumbent administration in some far-flung territory.\u0026nbspCorbyn believes that the UK wealthy do not pay enough tax. Writes Bower, he would like a return to the James Callaghan era, when the country’s richest paid a top rate of 98 per cent tax on income. Bower tries to counter that with the correct assertion that the top 1 per cent of British taxpayers already contribute 27 per cent of the nation’s income tax take, and the top 10 per cent pay 59 per cent a higher proportion than the richest 10 per cent of Germany’s population pay.\u0026nbspSuch comparisons almost certainly count for little with Corbyn –\u0026nbspthe man who would rather sit on his own reading the Morning Star is not going to be easily persuaded, not least with a glance in the direction of what he must regard as the loathsomely financially corrupt and socially unjust Germany.\u0026nbspLikewise, when Corbyn proposed “people’s quantitative easing”, the printing by the Bank of England of new money sufficient to meet the government’s requirements he brushed aside the possibility that this would lead to hyperinflation, and repetition of what occurred in Weimar Germany in the 1920s, Zimbabwe after 2010, and more recently, Venezuela. He simply did not want to listen.\u0026nbspJeremy Corbyn should realise Labour’s heartlands want a Final SaySimilarly, he would like to recreate a new national investment bank pumping hundreds of millions of pounds into Britain’s motor industry. The route to prosperity “is a collective process between workers, public investment and services, and yes, often innovative and creative iniduals”. You can feel the hesitancy and reluctance accompanying the citation of that last grouping.\u0026nbspIt is true that in the 1970s, Britain did make cars. But the sector now is a shadow of its former self. Worse, Nissan will not be using Sunderland to manufacture its new X-Trail SUV, and Honda in Swindon has signalled its intention to shut completely.\u0026nbspIt’s as if Corbyn has failed to register the onset of globalisation, the closure of factories across the land caused by cheaper labour and greater productivity elsewhere, and the fact that a large measure of what success Britain has achieved economically in the last few decades is down to the growth of the City of London and financial services.\u0026nbspIn his eyes, the City was to blame for the crisis of 2008 and its aftermath. That may be so but he chooses to discount the explosion in jobs in finance and the success it enjoyed before and since. Indeed, without the City, the UK would be in far worse shape.\u0026nbspBut the rose-tinted spectacles of this class warrior only see romance in metal-bashing and the honest sweat and toil of the shop floor. Quite how he intends to deal with the advent of the likes of artificial intelligence, robots and 3D printing is not clear.Reading Bower, you’re left in no doubt that Corbyn wants to turn the clock back, that his solution to those problematic examples and awkward developments that upset his path is merely to ignore them. This makes him very dangerous indeed, hard to reason with, oblivious to criticism and\u0026nbspset in his ways. It’s a troubling account, one that should give every entrepreneur pause and anyone who works in business pause. I want to scream and tell Corbyn to follow current events in Venezuela, and examine the chaos and strife that have befallen that country. I would, I fear, be wasting my time.\u0026nbspChris Blackhurst is a former editor of The Independent, and director of C|T|F Partners, the campaigns, strategic, crisis and reputational, and communications advisory firmWe’ll tell you what’s true.

If you live in the UK you’re in danger of losing all your rights.\u0026nbspThe airline has warned in the past that it will, in effect, disenfranchise its UK shareholders if this country’s catastrophically stupid\u0026nbspgovernment tips us off the no-deal Brexit cliff edge.With the clock ticking down, its warning has gone from threat to reality, as with so much else in the quite astonishing political freak show.\u0026nbspRyanair passenger whose name autocorrected to Lukewarm faces £100 billRyanair’s Michael O’Leary wants a woman to replace him as CEORyanair boss calls May and Corbyn ‘idiots’ and demands end to BrexitThe airline this morning announced that its board on Friday passed resolutions meaning that from the date of a “hard” no-deal Brexit, ordinary shares held by Britons\u0026nbspwill be classed as “restricted”.\u0026nbspWhat that means is that their holders, regardless of whether they are institutions or iniduals, will not longer be eligible to vote on company resolutions. They will thus be\u0026nbspdenied\u0026nbspa say on the appointment of company directors, including the CEO and chair, on deals the company might enter into, on the annual report, boardroom pay, on anything of consequence in fact.\u0026nbspThey will no longer be able to speak at or even attend the company’s AGM for as long as the shares are treated as restricted. Britons will also be blocked from buying any new\u0026nbspshares in Ryanair.\u0026nbspAt this point you might very well be asking how on earth can the company can do this.Well, Ryanair’s an airline, and under the rather arcane rules that exist around the world concerning airline ownership, it needs to be majority owned and controlled by EU investors to be able to fly around the bloc, which is where its majority of the business comes from.\u0026nbspTo ensure this remains the case in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the company has taken the step courtesy of the powers granted to its board by its articles of association.\u0026nbspIt is possible someone may attempt to challenge the move. But if the no-deal cliff edge crumbles they, and everyone else, will likely have bigger issues to deal with. So I wouldn’t get your hopes up.\u0026nbspThere is an interesting wrinkle to this. According to Ryanair’s most recent annual report, EU citizens held 52.8 per cent of the company. UK institutions and iniduals make up a significant proportion of that.\u0026nbspMuch of the non-EU part is owned by Americans via American Depository Receipts (ADRs) which are a specific type of paper that non-US companies sell to US investors and that are tradable on US exchanges.\u0026nbspSo in theory, EU shareholders could be in the minority even if its UK shareholders are stripped of their rights. It will be interesting to see how the company works its way around that one.\u0026nbspBut this being Ryanair, you would presume the company had considered the issue and worked out a plan.\u0026nbspRyanair is popular in with US investors because it is very low cost, and not overly fond of unions. Its directors won’t want to upset what has been a largely supportive part of its investor base.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.High-end slipper retailer Mahabis has gone into administration. 2 Jan 2019Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

Indeed, a lot of people who wouldn’t normally be fans of its\u0026nbspbumptious boss Michael O’Leary will have found themselves nodding their heads in agreement over what he’s said on the subject, and that of the UK’s dismal political leadership. He memorably, and accurately, described both Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn as “idiots”.\u0026nbspRyanair makes clear in its statement that it would prefer “common sense” to prevail. But if that\u0026nbspdoesn’t happen, the airline’s\u0026nbspmove will relieve it\u0026nbspof some of its noisier critics. Every cloud, as they say...We’ll tell you what’s true.

said.“The stores review process is now nearing a conclusion but unfortunately we have been unable to reach a satisfactory agreement with the landlords of our stores in Crouch End, Mark Lane and

for Evans Cycles as we look to improve our performance and focus on new store openings - two sites in Shirebrook and Glasgow are due to open in the next two months.”The Shirebrook branch will be

The company continues its shift to towards online-only sales, but now says it won\u0027t close as many stores as originally thought.\u0026nbspThe $35,000 base Model 3 will still be available, but the company is raising prices by 3 per cent on all other models.\u0026nbspIn a Monday filing with government regulators, Tesla now says it closed 10 per cent of its stores, but a few of those will now remain open. Another 20 per cent are being evaluated and some could remain open.\u0026nbspThe company gave no numbers, but said it would close only about half the stores that it had intended to. It has 378 stores and service centres worldwide and about 100 stores in the US.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch. Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.“As a result of keeping significantly more stores open, Tesla will need to raise vehicle prices by about 3 percent on average worldwide,” a company\u0027s statement said. “We will only close about half as many stores, but the cost savings are therefore only about half.”\u0026nbspRemaining stores could have fewer workers, but will have vehicles available for test drives and a small inventory in case people want to buy immediately, the statement said.\u0026nbspThe company also announced on Monday that it has purchased car-hauling trucks and trailers from a California company in a stock deal worth about $14.2m. Tesla paid for the purchase with about 50,000 previously authorised shares. Tesla wants to increase its vehicle transportation capacity and cut delivery times.\u0026nbspThe reversal shows that Tesla had second thoughts about shuttering the stores and whether buyers would make such a large purchase without a test drive. The company says it still plans to offer buyers the ability to return purchased vehicles at no cost after a seven-day or 1,000 mile test drive.\u0026nbspGartner analyst Michael Ramsey called the move “startling” and said it undermines the credibility of Mr Musk and Tesla\u0027s management.\u0026nbsp“How else can you view it except to see it as a remarkable example of lack of foresight or planning?” Mr Ramsey asked. “It\u0027s almost as if the decision was announced and made without any analysis of what the outcome would be.”\u0026nbspMr Musk probably realised that he was locked into long-term leases on the stores that he would have to pay regardless of whether they were closed, Mr Ramsey said.\u0026nbspThe move made no sense to begin with because Tesla had spent millions fighting in courts and state legislatures trying to change laws that prevented companies from selling vehicles at their own stores, Ramsey said.\u0026nbspTesla starts taking orders for Model 3 electric carBut he also said the move to close 10 per cent of stores and evaluate others is the right thing to do, and said most retail companies do that all of the time.\u0026nbspMessages were left Monday seeking comment from a Tesla spokesman.\u0026nbspShares of Tesla edged up less than 1 per cent in trading early Monday.\u0026nbspIn announcing the move on 28 February, chief executive Elon Musk said it was necessary to cut costs in order to profitably sell the mass-market version of the Model 3 sedan for $35,000. That\u0027s a price point needed to reach more consumers and generate the sales that the company needs to survive, Mr Musk has said.\u0026nbspBefore the announcement, the cheapest Model 3 started at $42,900.\u0026nbsp“This is the only way to achieve the savings for this car and be financially sustainable,” Mr Musk told reporters during a conference call announcing the change. “It is excruciatingly difficult to make this car for $35,000 and be financially sustainable.”\u0026nbspElon Musk branded \u0027a liar\u0027 by investor as US regulators seeks to oust Tesla bossOn 28 February, the company said shifting totally to online sales would allow it to lower all vehicle prices by 6 per cent, on average, including its higher-end Model S and Model X.\u0026nbspAt the time, Mr Musk also walked back the company\u0027s guidance that it would be profitable in all future quarters, saying it would post a loss in the first quarter of this year.\u0026nbspAll other major car manufacturers rely on vast dealer networks, but Mr Musk co-founded Tesla in 2003 in an effort to shake up the industry, starting with a focus entirely on a fleet of cars powered by electricity instead of petrol.\u0026nbspWe’ll tell you what’s true.

Well, yer man’s wrong, as they might say. Derry Girls, returning for a triumphant and exuberant second run, proves that humour, dark or otherwise, can be quarried from even the most unlikely of locations.While there are plenty of well-turned one-liners, the deeper attraction of Fleabag is schadenfreude. The character is as old as Daisy Buchanan or Lydia Bennett or Scarlett O’Hara. The best compliment to Waller-Bridge and her cast is that they find fresh clothes in which to dress these ancient monsters.Home is a rather gentle, unobtrusive variation on the sitcom theme – but one that is built on a quite a bizarre premise. The twist is that a family who returns to Surrey from a holiday touring around France discover a Syrian refugee stuffed in the back of their SUV.

If you’re a creator of comic books featuring the adventures of super-powered, costumed heroes, that might be a difficult rule of thumb to apply. But perhaps not for Tom King. In Mister Miracle, from DC Comics, King and artist Mitch Gerads have created one of the most critically acclaimed graphic novels of the last year, and for the Washington-based writer, he drew on experiences that not a lot of other creators working in the field today have access to.King, 40, who was born in California, spent several years as a counter-terrorism officer for the CIA, working out in the field in Iraq and Afghanistan. It’s fascinating to think about what King saw and did, and how that later informed his writing. Obviously, I suggest, if he tells me too much about it he’ll have to kill me.\u0026nbspHe’s heard that one before, of course, probably more times than he can count. “No,” he says, with what feels like an oft-trodden out reply, “if I tell you too much about it, they’ll have to kill me.”Born to a film-writer mother in Southern California, King developed a love of storytelling and an understanding of narrative from an early age. During the 1990s he interned at the offices of the two big comics publishers, Marvel and DC. His ambition, though, was to become a lawyer\u0026nbspand he graduated from Columbia University in the year 2000, intending to follow this path. He started working for the Justice Department.And then came 11 September. Like everyone else in America, King was appalled and shocked and numbed. But he also knew he wanted to do something in response. So he went on to the CIA website and discovered that they were recruiting.“They were looking to bring in a new generation of operatives to serve in this new world,” he says. “They wanted people who were good at connecting the dots. I went in maybe hoping to get a job as an information guy, I took the psych tests, and ended up as an operations officer.”Created with Sketch.Mister Miracle: The critically acclaimed graphic novel in pictures Show all 7Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Photos by DC ComicsPhotos by DC ComicsKing worked out in the field in Afghanistan and Iraq for seven years, and the exact nature of his work out there is necessarily vague. When his wife fell pregnant with their first son (they have three children now) he knew he had a difficult decision to make.“The part of the job I loved was being overseas, out in the war zone, as bizarre as that might sound,” he says. “But I knew I didn’t want to do that and have a family. I didn’t want to be away from my wife and kid for a year at a time.”Returning to the US, King didn’t resume his plan to become a lawyer but instead turned to his first love, writing. But he wasn’t back in the world of comic books just yet… or at least, not quite. King wrote a prose novel, but about superheroes. A Once-Crowded Sky was published in 2012, to good notices. Writing about superheroes had regalvanised his love of comics\u0026nbspand opened the door for him to work at DC.His first gig was a series about Dick Grayson, the original Batman side-kick Robin who grew up and adopted a new persona, Nightwing. Co-written with Tim Seeley with art by Mikel Jannen, the series was the first time that King was able to draw on his CIA past, as the character quit the superhero business to become a spy.That led to more work, and to the series that first brought King to wider notice – and his first collaboration with Mitch Gerads, his Mister Miracle co-creator. Published in late 2015, The Sheriff of Babylon was a critically-acclaimed crime series about a San Diego cop who becomes a military consultant in Iraq\u0026nbspand has to solve the murder of a young local police trainee.More work followed, with King getting to write characters both classic and obscure, from Batman to the Omega Men for DC, and the Vision (the character played by Paul Bettany in The Avengers movies) for Marvel.Which led to King and Gerads working together again on what has become one of the most well-received comic books in recent years, earning plaudits from mainstream reviewers and publications especially… Mister Miracle.Mister Miracle is a character who was first introduced in 1971, created by the towering genius that was Jack Kirby for DC comics. Real name Scott Free (ouch. But it was the 1970s, and King and Gerads do a fine job of contextualising that), Mister Miracle is billed as a “super escape artist”, Houdini in a cape and mask and yellow, green and red livery. He’s always been one of those B-List characters, except to the most devoted fans, in terms of recognisability.But in an age where, thanks to the big comics companies mining their intellectual properties and breathing fresh life and mainstream appeal into characters formerly known only to the cognoscenti – s of the Galaxy, anyone? Ant-Man? Black Panther? Aquaman? Suicide Squad? – even the non-rabid comics fan seems more willing to accept stories featuring characters who aren’t Superman, Batman, Captain America or Spider-Man.DC cancels comic where Jesus learns from superhero after backlash Still, a super escape artist in a garish costume. Possibly limited scope there for anything beyond a series of set-piece daring feats, you might think. Which is possibly why Mister Miracle won so much praise by being one of the most literary and absorbing stories released by DC in some years.It opens with a shocking image… the titular character slumped on his bathroom floor, wrists cut and bleeding out over the tiles. Yes, it begins with a superhero attempting to commit suicide.“Scott Free can escape from anything,” says King. “So we thought… he’s going to keep pushing it, trying to escape from more and more difficult situations. And eventually he thinks, can I escape from death?”King and Gerads had wanted to work on another big series after the Sheriff of Babylon, and initially they pitched an idea for a Batman comic but focussing on two big villains, the Joker and the Riddler. However, the characters were already earmarked for a storyline in the main Batman comic, so it was vetoed. DC, however, threw them another option.Gerads says, “I got a call from Tom and he told me that we couldn’t do the Batman story. He said what would your second choice be, and straight away I said Mister Miracle.” Gerads pauses. “That’s absolutely true. And Tom said, well, that’s what they’ve offered us. And he sent me the pitch and the first line was, ‘Mister Miracle attempts suicide’.”Starting from that dark place, the story then expands out into an exploration of, really, the anxieties of living in the modern era. Scott Free is married to the unlikely-named Big Barda, and they are attempting to navigate the mores of family life in present-day Los Angeles. But Scott and Barda are also not of this Earth.Original Mister Miracle creator Jack Kirby dreamed up for DC comics in the 1970s a series of books that became known as the Fourth World, existing within the normal DC continuity of Batman and Wonder Woman, but also slightly apart from it. It focussed on two worlds, New Genesis, where the benevolent New Gods lived, and Apokolips, brutal realm of the tyrannical Darkseid. New Genesis and Apokolips are perpetually at war, and in a bid to broker peace, their rulers Darkseid and the Highfather agree to swap infant sons. Scott Free is the child of New Genesis, brought up in the hellish Apokolips, where he learns his craft and meets Barda, one of the fearsome Female Furies. Together they escape, and make a new life on Earth, but are called back into the war, which is where we find them in this story.Mister Miracle was originally released as a 12-issue monthly series, and has just now been collected into a single volume. But it was always meant to be read as a graphic novel. King says, “It’s like a Dickens novel, which were originally serialised. It’s meant to be read as one story.” He pauses. “Not that I’m comparing myself to Dickens, obviously.”The story is a mix of domestic life and the horrors of war. In one memorable scene, Scott and Barda fight their way over several pages through the terrors of Apokolips, holding a conversation as they do about redecorating their condo flat, building up to the tender moment – delivered as each character despatches bad guys in a sequence that looks like a platform video game – that Barda reveals she is pregnant.Mister Miracle is a very personal book for both King and Gerads. The sheer exhausting nature of war comes across in several scenes, obviously drawn from King’s experiences. And Gerads’ son was born right in the middle of him working on the series, adding extra dimension to the point where Barda gives birth.Gerads has also done artwork for Batman (DC Comics)It should be noted that comics are a very collaborative medium, and King and Gerads worked closely on the distinctive look of the story. The trend in comics these days is for big, break-out images, kaleidoscopic panels, imaginative layouts. With Mister Miracle, the team went for a nine-panel grid, most closely associated with the classic of the genre from 30 years ago, Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons’ Watchmen.That’s perhaps informed the mainstream success of Mister Miracle. It might be an odd thing to say, but reading comics is a learned skill, and not everybody gets on with the medium. A strict page design allows for easier digesting of the narrative. Gerads says, “Some people in comics think doing a grid like this must be very constricting for the artist, but that’s not the case. The magic with this is that you know exactly how the reader is going to read your page.”King likens it to “almost like three Charlie Brown cartoons on each page, three panels each, and everybody knows how to read those”.Aside from being a meditation on war and a domestic drama with dialogue that would satisfy any Netflix drama binge-watcher, there’s also a bigger storyline at play in Mister Miracle. To wit, is any of it actually happening? Is it all, in fact, the dream of a superhero who’s lying on his bathroom floor, his life slowly ebbing away?“Living life is full of ambiguities,” says King, perhaps a little ambiguously himself.Gerads is more forthcoming, and points out that Scott Free is in every single scene in the story. “We never leave Scott’s side in the entire book, we go on this ride with Scott through the story. Perhaps by the end Scott realises that it doesn’t matter if it’s real or not, because one way or another this is what he’s lived through.”It was announced last year that one of DC’s next big movie projects will be based on the New Gods world, with Ava DuVernay (A Wrinkle In Time) lined up to direct. Rumours emerged in the last few weeks that Scott Free and Big Barda will actually form the central focus of the movie. Whether it will end up as an adaptation of this story, neither King nor Gerads could say, but if it does it could end up DC’s most interesting movie yet.King and Gerads are hatching another collaboration for DC, which they aren’t at liberty to discuss (though King drops the hint that there’s a clue within Mister Miracle as to what that might be) and in the meantime, King is writing for the publisher Heroes in Crisis, which deals with the post-traumatic stress disorder that could actually affect superheroes given the ongoing violence and battles they deal with on a daily basis.Does he find writing about the things he’s seen and experience during his time with the CIA cathartic? Or is it painful? Perhaps a bit of both, he says.“I think me writing about war has been more necessary than anything else,” he says. “War and the damage that war does has formed the basis for a lot of my work. I write to give my kids a better life and the best thing for me has been to draw on what I’ve done. But I think I might be ready to talk about something else, now.”Mister Miracle by Tom King and Mitch Gerads is out now and\u0026nbsppublished by DC Comics.We’ll tell you what’s true.

It’s aiming for a morning splashdown in the Atlantic off Florida’s coast, the final hurdle of the six-day test flight. Saturday’s launch and Sunday’s docking were spot on.\u0026nbspNASA astronauts have been stuck riding Russian rockets since space shuttles retired eight years ago. NASA is counting on SpaceX and Boeing to start launching astronauts this year. SpaceX is aiming for summer.(For context, there\u0027s no way the US can do this at the moment: its hope was always the Space Shuttle programme, so when that was cancelled it was left without a way of travelling up and down. Now it has to rely on the Russian space agency, which it pays to take astronauts to the ISS.\u0026nbspIf this works, it could change all that, by completing a plan to let private US companies build the rockets and capsules that will allow them to fly to space again. So it\u0027s a big day for Nasa and space travel generally, as well as SpaceX.)We\u0027re not going to\u0026nbspsee\u0026nbspevery part of the mission because of a communications blackout.

The company continues its shift to towards online-only sales, but now says it won\u0027t close as many stores as originally thought.\u0026nbspThe $35,000 base Model 3 will still be available, but the company is raising prices by 3 per cent on all other models.\u0026nbspIn a Monday filing with government regulators, Tesla now says it closed 10 per cent of its stores, but a few of those will now remain open. Another 20 per cent are being evaluated and some could remain open.\u0026nbspThe company gave no numbers, but said it would close only about half the stores that it had intended to. It has 378 stores and service centres worldwide and about 100 stores in the US.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch. Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.“As a result of keeping significantly more stores open, Tesla will need to raise vehicle prices by about 3 percent on average worldwide,” a company\u0027s statement said. “We will only close about half as many stores, but the cost savings are therefore only about half.”\u0026nbspRemaining stores could have fewer workers, but will have vehicles available for test drives and a small inventory in case people want to buy immediately, the statement said.\u0026nbspThe company also announced on Monday that it has purchased car-hauling trucks and trailers from a California company in a stock deal worth about $14.2m. Tesla paid for the purchase with about 50,000 previously authorised shares. Tesla wants to increase its vehicle transportation capacity and cut delivery times.\u0026nbspThe reversal shows that Tesla had second thoughts about shuttering the stores and whether buyers would make such a large purchase without a test drive. The company says it still plans to offer buyers the ability to return purchased vehicles at no cost after a seven-day or 1,000 mile test drive.\u0026nbspGartner analyst Michael Ramsey called the move “startling” and said it undermines the credibility of Mr Musk and Tesla\u0027s management.\u0026nbsp“How else can you view it except to see it as a remarkable example of lack of foresight or planning?” Mr Ramsey asked. “It\u0027s almost as if the decision was announced and made without any analysis of what the outcome would be.”\u0026nbspMr Musk probably realised that he was locked into long-term leases on the stores that he would have to pay regardless of whether they were closed, Mr Ramsey said.\u0026nbspThe move made no sense to begin with because Tesla had spent millions fighting in courts and state legislatures trying to change laws that prevented companies from selling vehicles at their own stores, Ramsey said.\u0026nbspTesla starts taking orders for Model 3 electric carBut he also said the move to close 10 per cent of stores and evaluate others is the right thing to do, and said most retail companies do that all of the time.\u0026nbspMessages were left Monday seeking comment from a Tesla spokesman.\u0026nbspShares of Tesla edged up less than 1 per cent in trading early Monday.\u0026nbspIn announcing the move on 28 February, chief executive Elon Musk said it was necessary to cut costs in order to profitably sell the mass-market version of the Model 3 sedan for $35,000. That\u0027s a price point needed to reach more consumers and generate the sales that the company needs to survive, Mr Musk has said.\u0026nbspBefore the announcement, the cheapest Model 3 started at $42,900.\u0026nbsp“This is the only way to achieve the savings for this car and be financially sustainable,” Mr Musk told reporters during a conference call announcing the change. “It is excruciatingly difficult to make this car for $35,000 and be financially sustainable.”\u0026nbspElon Musk branded \u0027a liar\u0027 by investor as US regulators seeks to oust Tesla bossOn 28 February, the company said shifting totally to online sales would allow it to lower all vehicle prices by 6 per cent, on average, including its higher-end Model S and Model X.\u0026nbspAt the time, Mr Musk also walked back the company\u0027s guidance that it would be profitable in all future quarters, saying it would post a loss in the first quarter of this year.\u0026nbspAll other major car manufacturers rely on vast dealer networks, but Mr Musk co-founded Tesla in 2003 in an effort to shake up the industry, starting with a focus entirely on a fleet of cars powered by electricity instead of petrol.\u0026nbspWe’ll tell you what’s true.

This cannot be what was intended.”The committee said the cap should only apply to claimants who are either claiming jobseekers’ allowance or claiming universal credit and in the “all work-related” activity group.Veteran MP Frank Field, chairman of the committee, said: “It would be difficult to think of a more cruel cut.\u0026nbspBenefits are being cut with the aim of driving people into work, but four in five people bearing this cut aren’t expected to work.“What genius in government thought this one up?”The committee also called on the government to increase the cap levels in line with inflation and to do more to monitor the impact of it.The benefits cap was lowered in 2016 to a maximum of £23,000 for families and £15,410 for a single person living in London, and £20,000 for a family and £13,400 for a single person outside of London.The DWP said it would “carefully consider” the report’s findings and “respond in due course”.A spokesman added: “The benefit cap restores fairness so that it pays to work and still ensures there’s a safety net for the most vulnerable.\u0026nbspPeople receiving certain disability benefits are already exempt from the cap.”Work and pensions secretary Amber Rudd also announced yesterday\u0026nbspthat benefits claimants in Harrogate, North Yorkshire, had been chosen as the first people to be moved on to the government’s universal credit welfare reforms.Amber Rudd has set fire to her party’s own record.

This is, as has been widely stated, wrong, and her tweet has been deleted, but there is another side to the story which is more favourable to McVey.First, though, the actual facts. As things stand the UK and Denmark have an absolute exemption from the obligation to join the euro. This was the famous “opt-out” from the 1992 Maastricht Treaty, which set in train the long process towards adopting the euro across much (though even now not all) of\u0026nbspthe EU. All the other member states of the EU in 1992 have now adopted the single currency some members that joined after 1992 and after the first wave of euro nations abolished their currencies in 1999\u0026nbsphave also adopted the euro – Slovenia in 2007, followed by Cyprus and Malta in 2008, Slovakia in 2009, Estonia in 2011, Latvia in 2014 and Lithuania in 2015.Altogether 19 of the 28 member states are members of the euro, including all of the largest economies except the UK. It has made trade and cross-border movements of money much smoother and made international pricing of goods and services more transparent, reducing business costs and adding modestly to economic growth.\u0026nbspHowever, despite this, others countries have not joined the euro, despite this being a formal accession treaty obligation once certain criteria are met. For example, Sweden, which joined in 1995, still retains its krona and shows little inclination\u0026nbspto adopt the euro nor, it seems,\u0026nbspare the European Commission and European Central Bank pushing the point.Should we purchase euros for a trip to Italy in April?By contrast other, weaker economies that might wish to ditch their own currencies in favour of the euro are not yet qualified to do so. The experience of Greece, which was allowed to join the currency probably before its economy was strong enough, has been instructive.\u0026nbspAs well as the UK and Denmark, other EU members still outside include Poland, the Czech Republic, Croatia, Romania and Bulgaria.The problems with the single currency are well publicised, and have caused real economic harm and human misery among those countries that have\u0026nbspendured years of austerity to try and make themselves more competitive, andor pay for the banking rescues required after the financial crisis.\u0026nbspThat is why richer countries – which would be expected to bankroll the system – are wary of joining. The Greek example is why some weaker countries are also cautious about the disciplines imposed by the system, and why the richer countries are also disinclined to hurry them into the arrangement.\u0026nbspPresident Macron’s proposal for a “fiscal” union to complement the monetary union – effectively moving some macroeconomic decisions on overall levels of taxes, public spending and borrowing to the European level – have been rejected by Germany, which usually pays the bills (Finland and the Netherlands also chip in). So this inherently unstable system seems set to continue on its present basis.Whether the UK would be allowed its euro opt-out if it rejoined the EU in a few years’ time is impossible to predict,\u0026nbspbut it would not necessarily be granted.Where\u0026nbspMcVey and her cited journalist have a point is that the euro was originally regarded as essential to ensure a “level playing field” under the single market. Countries, in other words, cannot gain an “unfair” advantage by devaluing or “manipulating” their currency as a way out of their uncompetitiveness (usually stemming from poor productivity, high wages and too much debt).That logic applies as much today and in the 2020s as is it did in 1992. There may come a point when the political pressure on non-euro members to join the currency – whatever the legal formalities – would become so intense as to be unbearable. In that sense non-euro members states are always at long-term risk of being pushed towards the euro – but Denmark and the UK do have that strong international treaty protection in the final analysis.Equally, it is true that the euro might fragment long before such pressures on members to join\u0026nbspre-emerge. It seemed perfectly possible that it would collapse a few years ago. Today the precarious Italian public finances and banking system represent a mortal danger to the euro system, as the Italian economy is far bigger than Greece, and “too big to save”.\u0026nbspSo, in the end, Esther McVey and her critics might both be proved equally wrong.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

Today we have secured legal changes.“Now is the time to come together, to back this improved Brexit deal, and to deliver on the instruction of the British people.”The backstop is an arrangement in the existing withdrawal agreement that comes into play if the EU and UK fail to agree future trading arrangements by the end of 2020, thus keeping the Irish border open, but also locking the UK into a customs union with the EU on a potentially indefinite basis.Europe\u0026nbspCommission president Jean-Claude Juncker said the new additions to the agreement provided “meaningful clarifications and legal guarantees” on the backstop’s temporary nature.He went on: “In politics sometimes you get a second chance. It is what you do with this second chance that counts – because there will be no third chance.In politics sometimes you get a second chance. It is what you do with this second chance that counts – because there will be no third chance“There will be no further interpretation of the interpretations, and no further reassurances on the reassurances if the meaningful vote fails tomorrow.”In a commons statement Mr Lidington revealed that the UK had secured two new documents, a “joint legally binding instrument on the withdrawal agreement” and a “joint statement to supplement the political declaration” on future relations.There is also a third element – a unilateral declaration from the UK setting out what actions it would take if it felt the backstop is being abused by the EU.Mr Lidington said the new legal “instrument” confirmed that the EU could not try to trap the UK in the backstop indefinitely, because commitments they had made to not do so were now legally binding.The cabinet minister argued that this commitment from the EU could also now be used as the basis of a formal dispute through an independent arbitration, which could lead to the suspension of the backstop.Furthermore, he said the UK had won a commitment to find an alternative arrangement to the backstop by 2020, something set out in the “joint statement”.Labour MPs urged to disregard PM’s ‘half-hearted’ Brexit pledgeThere is still hope for a measured Brexit outcomeCritically the legal instrument looks like it will be enough to allow attorney general Geoffrey Cox to change his legal advice to parliament, which previously said the backstop could be indefinite.Mr Lidington said: “Tomorrow will be a fundamental choice. To vote for the improved deal or to plunge the country into a political crisis. If we vote for this improved deal, we will both end the current uncertainty and have delivered Brexit.“The house was clear on the need for legally binding changes to the backstop. Today we have secured those changes.”To win the vote on Tuesday, Ms May must convince not only backbenchers in the European Research Group, led by Jacob Rees-Mogg, but also Northern Irish MPs in the DUP who prop up her Commons majority.Coveney: Theresa May going to Strasbourg for further Brexit negotiationsBoth groups have previously called for the backstop to be removed or replaced altogether, saying anything less would be unacceptable, though this position has been softened in some DUP statements and in comments from iniduals in the ERG.But to underline the challenge Ms May faces, the ERG’s deputy-chair Steve Baker said he did not believe Ms May’s changes would go as far as he and many other Brexiteer colleagues had demanded.It had looked on Monday morning as if Ms May would enrage all sides of the Brexit debate by trying to either delay or downgrade the vote on Tuesday after failing to win concessions at the weekend.Downing Street was forced to deny claims that the EU had made an offer of sorts on Sunday only for it to be turned down in London, but they did reveal Ms May had called a string of EU leaders over the weekend including German chancellor Angela Merkel and French president Emmanuel Macron.There was also a further call with Mr Juncker, following one that had taken place over the weekend, a further sign of movement. \u0026nbspThen shortly after lunch Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney said he believed Ms May would travel across the channel for discussions, though Downing Street still refused to confirm it.Meanwhile, Ms May attended a ceremony to commemorate Commonwealth Day at Westminster Abbey in which she read out a bible passage from Corinthians which began “the body is not made up of one part but of many”, which some saw as a message to Tory rebels to get behind her.It was at about 5pm, as she headed to the airport, that Number 10 let it be known she was finally going to Strasbourg though they continued to play down suggestions that a deal had been struck.Things suddenly began to move more quickly, with the DUP’s leader Arlene Foster travelling to London for a meeting with her party’s MPs, while the Irish cabinet were also called in for a meeting, as a spokesman confirmed the Taoiseach had also spoken to Mr Juncker.Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament’s Brexit coordinator, confirmed he and the parliament’s president Antonio Tajani also met Ms May on Monday night.The face-to-face meetings took place in the Strasbourg parliament’s Winston Churchill building, while in London Ms May’s senior ministers were called into the cabinet office to be briefed by Mr Liddington ahead of his statement.Mr\u0026nbspCorbyn said: “The prime minister’s negotiations have failed. This evening’s agreement with the European Commission does not contain anything approaching the changes Theresa May promised parliament, and whipped her MPs to vote for.“Since her Brexit deal was so overwhelmingly rejected, the prime minister has recklessly run down the clock, failed to effectively negotiate with the EU and refused to find common ground for a deal parliament could support.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

The prime minister will now put the new-look deal to\u0026nbspMPs, who will vote on it during the second meaningful vote this evening. David Davis is currently on TalkRadio and appears to be putting his weight behind Ms May\u0027s deal.\u0026nbspThis is a way to deliver a proper Brexit - it’s a lot worse than what I would have hoped for - it’s significantly better than what was presented in December.Everyone is waiting for the reaction of the DUP - Sammy Wilson speaking on LBC has given an indication of what they might say later today. Speaking about May\u0027s new agreement\u0026nbsphe said:\u0026nbspIt seems to fall short of what she herself has promised. But we want to give due diligence to what has been said.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspScotland\u0027s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon responded to Mr Starmer\u0027s tweets, saying he\u0027s right, and called on MPs to vote against the deal.Though the bigger problem with the Withdrawal Agreement, in my view, is that it takes Scotland out of the EU against both our will and our interests - and with no clarity on what comes next. A bad, blindfold deal. The Commons should reject it.May\u0027s deal has not been well received by pro-European Tory Dominic Grieve.\u0026nbspHe said he will vote against the prime minister\u0026nbspbecause the deal bears no resemblance to what was debated in the 2016 referendum, and that the proper thing to do was back a second people\u0027s vote.To drag the country out of the EU on these terms seems to me a very unsatisfactory and undemocratic thing to do.If the public want to leave on these terms... so be it. But for us to leave on these terms, which I have to say take us into a second-rate relationship for the future and one which I think will do this country economic harm, I am unwilling to do without the public confirming their view.I\u0027m not prepared to see someone sign off something which in my view is going to be very damaging for our country\u0027s future.On what is set to be a momentous day in British politics, welcome to The Independent\u0027s live coverage.Please allow a moment for the liveblog to loadAt a joint press conference with European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, Ms May said three new documents had been agreed that provide\u0026nbspthe legal assurances critics of her stance had called for.Ms May said: “What we have secured is very clearly that the backstop cannot be indefinite. Cannot become permanent. It is only temporary. If it is the case that we were ever to get into the backstop.“The legal instrument that we have agreed is an addition to the Withdrawal Agreement. It has the same legal status as the Withdrawal Agreement. It is legally binding.“That is what Parliament asked us to secure and that is what we have secured.”The European Commission president insisted there would be no further negotiations on the issue.Mr\u0026nbspJuncker\u0026nbspsaid: “There will be no new negotiations. It is this.“In politics, sometimes you get a second chance. It is what we do with the second chance that counts. Because there will be no third chance.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

Ironically Brexit also sounds like a constipation relief medicine.After losing the vote in January, Ms May said she would head back to Brussels with the aim of reopening the withdrawal agreement, and securing legally binding changes to the Northern Irish backstop. So far, she has failed on both counts, with the EU 27 united in resistance to such efforts.\u0026nbspUnless the prime minister secures last-minute concessions this weekend, in an eleventh-hour dash to Brussels, many in Westminster expect the second “meaningful vote” to be resoundingly defeated too.\u0026nbspBritain does not want a long delay to Brexit saga, poll showsHowever, if parliament springs a surprise and her deal passes on Tuesday, Brexit will be secured – although\u0026nbspMs May would probably have to request a short extension to the Article 50 timeframe so that\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspcan\u0026nbspdebate and vote on key pieces of legislation that are required to be in place for exit day.\u0026nbspAssuming the prime minister does not win the day, the scale of defeat will be key.If it is similar\u0026nbspto January, it could be fatal for Ms May, who will undoubtedly face claims\u0026nbspthat she has wasted precious time in the last two months. Her deal will be considered dead.In this case, the prime minister would probably be out of options, and will be under considerable pressure to go down a softer Brexit route. This would risk\u0026nbspa potential\u0026nbspsplit in\u0026nbspher party while she seeks a majority for an alternative deal and effectively forms a parliamentary alliance\u0026nbspwith Jeremy Corbyn.Created with Sketch.

This would almost certainly require a short delay to the Brexit process.Mr Corbyn may also decide the time is opportune –\u0026nbspif Ms May loses badly –\u0026nbspto put down a second no-confidence motion in the government in an effort to force a general election, though\u0026nbspit still does not appear the Labour leader has the numbers in the Commons to win such a vote. \u0026nbspHe has also committed his party to backing an\u0026nbspamendment\u0026nbspon a second referendum, so this could also be the week in which MPs finally test whether there\u0026nbspis a majority for such a path. The consensus is that there is not, and it may be that proponents of a further public vote on Brexit do not test the Commons just yet.Votes on no-deal and Article 50 extensionCrucially, if the prime minister loses the “meaningful vote” on her deal, she has vowed to hold two further votes this week: one on a no-deal Brexit (due to take place on Wednesday), and a second an approving an extension to Article 50 and delaying Britain’s exit from the EU (Thursday). This is where there might be fireworks.EU accused of ‘playing games’ in last-ditch Brexit negotiationsBanks ‘broke agreement to suspend Brexit campaigning’ after Cox murderCorbyn tells May second defeat for her deal is ‘the end of the road’EU says Britain can leave backstop but Northern Ireland must stayPound falls after May warns of ‘moment of crisis’ over BrexitIt has been clear for some\u0026nbsptime that there is no majority in the House of Commons for a disorderly (or “cliff-edge”)\u0026nbspbreak from the bloc. As such, it is likely that MPs will vote to take a no-deal departure off the table.The following day there will be a vote on extending Article 50, and it is anticipated\u0026nbspthere will be a majority for this course of action.Ultimately, it is up to the EU 27 whether to grant any extension: if they agree,\u0026nbspterms and conditions might easily be attached. They could, for example, demand a lengthy extension rather than the\u0026nbsptwo-month period preferred at Westminster.Ms May will have to decide whether or not to give her own MPs\u0026nbspa free vote on the contentious issue of the no-deal scenario. It is an incredibly isive topic among Conservatives, and throughout the negotiations,\u0026nbspthe prime minister has deployed the threat of a no-deal outcome. \u0026nbspIf the prime minister decides not\u0026nbspto give Tory\u0026nbspMPs a free\u0026nbspvote, and whips them\u0026nbspto keep no deal on the table, it could easily lead to a significant number of ministerial resignations from the Remain-leaning figures at the top of government who would probably rebel.\u0026nbspAs the prime minister herself said, reject the deal and “no-one knows what will happen”\u0026nbspbut what we do know is that\u0026nbspMs May is about to enter one of the most dangerous weeks of her time in office.\u0026nbspGot an unanswered question about Brexit?

We are not a party within a party.”We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

There are no first-class citizens, and there are no second-class voters. We are all equal in the voting booth. We are all represented at the Knesset.”Mr Netanyahu’s\u0026nbspoutburst comes as he is fighting to wrench back support of the right from Benny Gantz, the country’s popular ex-chief of staff who has formed powerful alliance with two former army chiefs and Yair Lapid, a leading centrist opposition figure.The premier had hoped to secure a fourth consecutive term in office making him the longest-serving prime minister in Israeli history.Netanyahu has shattered the illusion that Israel is a democracyNetanyahu says Israel ‘belongs to Jewish people alone’Antisemitism accusations aimed at Ilhan Omar intensifies Israel debateWill Trump’s immoral bribes serve to destroy Palestinian statehood?What did Ilhan Omar say and why has it shaken Washington?But support for his ruling Likud Party has plunged in polls after the country’s prosecutor-general said last month he planned to indict Mr Netanyahu in three corruption cases.The premier is due to face a pre-trial hearing in the coming months, after which the top prosecutor will issue a final decision on whether to send him to trial on a slew of charges including bribery.Mr Netanyahu, who is under pressure to rally the right,\u0026nbsphas come under fire for his comments targeting Israel’s Arab minority, who make up nearly 20 per cent of the population or 1.8 million people.On Monday he wrote on Instagram: “Israel is not a state of all its citizens”“According to the basic nationality law we passed, Israel is the nation-state of the Jewish people – and only it,” he concluded.The post was addressed to Israeli model and television actress Rotem Sela who had herself taken to social media to express disgust at anti-Arab comments made by Netanyahu’s firebrand culture minister Miri Regev.Ms Sela had written: “Even the Arabs – believe it or not – are human beings”.Israel is the nation-state of the Jewish people – and only itThe Israeli president was not the only prominent figure to criticise the prime minister.Hollywood actor Gal Gadot, best known for her role as Wonder Woman, posted in support of Ms Sela saying late Sunday: “Love your neighbour as yourself.”“This isn’t a matter of right or left. Jew or Arab. Secular or religious,” the Israeli-born actress wrote on Instagram.“It’s a matter of dialogue, of dialogue for peace and security and of our tolerance of one towards the other,” she added.Last month Mr Netanyahu sparked fury in Israel and among powerful pro-Israel lobby groups abroad, when he facilitated a controversial merger between key coalition partner Jewish Home, a nationalist religious party, and the extremist Jewish Power, an offshoot of the banned Kach movement.He also faced backlash for saying Arab parties “not only do not recognise Israel, they are working to eliminate Israel”.We’ll tell you what’s true.

And he has consistently pointed out that the original dream that gave rise to it is under threat.It is exactly 30 years since Sir Tim submitted a paper to his colleagues at CERN, suggesting a way of sharing data across networks,\u0026nbspunder the title “Information Management: A Proposal”. The humble title belies the importance of what was contained inside, which included a complete sketch for the networked information system that would on to become the internet\u0026nbspwe know today.That would take some time, however. It would take a year-and-a-half for the name “WorldWideWeb” to be proposed, and it would take many months before the public could actually access a public version of the web even then, it didn’t look anything like the rudimentary graphical pages we associate with the early internet, let alone the huge and complex system you and your computer have navigated to get to this article.That modern web has brought with it a series of technologies that would have seemed impossible and unimaginable at the time the web was first being proposed:\u0026nbspinstant streaming of just about any film you would like to watch and\u0026nbspinternet connections inside of fridges. But it has also brought with it threats, some of which could undermine the very fabric of the web itself.In 2017, when the web turned 28, Sir Tim laid out what he saw as the three challenges that threatened it. All of them are at least as pressing then as they were two years ago, and some were eerily prescient about the ways the web would develop.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 42Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.5G wireless internet is expected to launch in 2019, with the potential to reach speeds of 50mbsUber has halted testing of driverless vehicles after a woman was killed by one of their cars in Tempe, Arizona.

At this biennial event, the participating companies exhibit their latest service robotic technologies and componentsThe robot developed by Seed Solutions sings and dances to music during the Japan Robot Week 2016 at Tokyo Big SightThe first warning was that “we’ve lost control of our personal data”. He noted that many websites run on a business model that lets users have free content in exchange for their personal data, which allows them to harvest vast amounts of personal information, which in turn can make the internet a dangerous place to retain any kind of privacy or to discuss important but sensitive topics.Inventor of World Wide Web calls for crackdown on fake newsSince Sir Tim wrote that message, the world was rocked by the Cambridge Analytica scandal and a whole host of other revelations about the amount of data being collected on private people and how it is being used.The second challenge he noted was that it is “too easy for misinformation to spread on the web”. Noting that “most people find news and information on the web through just a handful of social media sites and search engines”, he described how websites spreading hoaxes, and false stories can do so relatively easily, and that the system can be gamed to spread that even more quickly.Third, he said that online political advertising “needs transparency and understanding”. Such advertising is become incredibly sophisticated, he noted, and when combined with the vast amount of data companies like Facebook are tracking can make it very easy to manipulate those people who see it.The scandal over political advertising in events such as the 2016 election and the Brexit vote is still continuing, and campaigners still criticise the relatively limited transparency that has been introduced on platforms that claim to be looking to limit it.A year later, in 2018, he shared another set of challenges, which largely related to the fact that the world has crossed over the point where more people use the web than don’t. That brings a whole host of questions of access and openness, he suggested.The threats that are posed to the web still very much exist, he noted. “But I remain committed to making sure the web is a free, open, creative space — for everyone,” he wrote last year.By closing the digital ide and helping people get online, stopping the control of the web lying with a small number of very big companies, and by making the discussion around the future of the web more erse, he claimed those threats could be avoided.Sir Tim has been consistent in arguing that the web is really a communal endeavour – and calling on that community to help save it from the threats it is facing.“I may have invented the web, but all of you have helped to create what it is today,” he wrote in 2017. “All the blogs, posts, tweets, photos, videos, applications, web pages and more represent the contributions of millions of you around the world building our online community.”That was a vision that was present in the original proposals for the world wide web, begun 30 years ago today. There, Sir Tim described a vision of CERN staff on the web\u0026nbspas “several thousand people, many of them very creative, all working toward common goals”.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Lets build bridges not walls.The Muslim Welfare House in London released a statement after the incident, saying it the attacker had shouted and hurled verbal abuse to the utter shock and disgust of all present.Toufik Kacimi, CEO of the organisation, said: We condemn in the strongest terms this outrageous act which has left everyone shocked.This disgraceful act by this inidual is a sign of the hatred and Islamophobia that sadly abound in our community.We will not let this deter us from cooperating with all groups in building a more cohesive society.Other Labour figures who have been also hit with an egg include ex-Labour boss Ed Miliband, as well as John Prescott, who went on to punch the protester.Last week Mr Corbyn confirmed that his party would get behind a second Brexit referendum, much to the fury of his pro-Brexit voters.But MPs in Leave backing seats warned it could cost the party their seats - and the next election."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Sands-United-FC-team-photo-2018.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"sands united football team grieving dads","story":"But behind their proud smiles, these men all share a secret - every player is a father who has lost a child - and the group play to support each other through their grief, both on and off the pitch.Sadly, the death of a baby is not a rare event and every  minutes in the UK – theof a football match - a baby dies shortly before, during or soon after birth.This is why each player has the name of his lost angel emblazoned on his shirt.It makes me feel like Im doing something for them. Im more motivated to score. We do it for our angels, player Kieran says.The team – which has over  players - was set up by Rob Allen, , after his baby daughter Niamh died in October  at  weeks and  days.While he and his we Charlotte, , had been told at weeks into the pregnancy that she was breach, they had no inkling anything was wrong.Then, days before she was due, a doctor told them there was no heartbeat - and they didnt know why. About one in three stillbirths are unexplained.Our walls just folded in, the carpenter and roofer recalls. It was a horrible, heartbreaking situation to be told that the child you had been planning to welcome home for so long, was not coming.To help him deal with what had happened, Rob started attending his local Sands - stillbirth and neonatal death charity-support group.Then the manager of an old league team he used to play for, Alan, suggested holding a football match to raise money for the charity.They recruited  players who had either lost babies, and raised £,.We saw that it had given those men an opportunity to talk about their experiences, Rob explains. And because everyone had got a huge amount out of it we decided to put the wires out and set up a permanent team.Because were playing in memory of our lost children, theres an extra drive - it gives us that little bit extra in the last  minutes of a game and makes us more of a unit than other Sunday teams who treat it as more of a jokey kickabout, dont mindthey win or lose and might turn up a bit drunk, he adds.Those who have signed up arent just men who have lost their own children, but include a player whose twin was lost at birth, and another whose sister lost a baby. They have very much felt the impact, explains Rob.Then theres those who have suffered from PTSD after nearly losing their partners as well as their baby during childbirth, and have experienced flashbacks and nightmares as a result. One had to seek further help because he was having suicidal thoughts, and his mind was telling him to join his baby.Were now in a time when there is more of a focus on male mental health, and encouraging men to talk and not bottle it up, says Rob. Thats where football comes in - it can feel accessible whereas sitting in a room and being asked whats your name  Whats your story  can feel daunting.The success of the club shows how much this service is needed. Theres already  people interested in starting their own Sands football teams around the UK, and theres been interest in the club in the UK, France, Belgium and Russia.Of Niamhs legacy, Rob - who has a five-year-old son Alfie and has also welcomed newborn daughter Iris - adds: Shes inspired me to do something that has helped local people, and is now touching those across the country and across the world.For Ross Coniam, , from Watford, who joined the team last year, the camaraderie amongst his teammates who have all experienced the loss of a child has been overwhelming.“Some men in the group lost children  years, others in the last one or two years but there’s nothing like being able to talk to someone who knows exactly what you’re feeling when you’re down and having a crap day,” says Ross, who lost his daughter Norah last May just hours after she was born. “It’s still such a taboo subject and some of my friends have never talked to me about it because they don’t know how - but talking about it does help.After a smooth pregnancy, Ross and his we Naomi were excited for the birth of their first baby and had no idea anything was wrong.“But as soon as she was delivered, there was panic,” recalls Ross. “Someone pushed the alarm bell and  to  people doctors piled into the room and started working on her because she wasn’t breathing. It took  minutes to resuscitate her and we knew it wasn’t good.”The baby was taken to the special care unit and hooked up to machines to help her breathe - but the doctors told Ross and Naomi there was no brain activity and there was nothing they could do.“It was so hard to take in,” says Ross. “She weighed lbs and looked absolutely perfect, with a gorgeous smattering of dark hair. After family and friends came to see her, we were taken to a side room so we could hold her for the first and last time.The doctors didn’t think she’d breathe more than a few seconds off the machines, but she lasted half an hour – it was a miracle.They named her Norah Faith, the middle name chosen there and then at the hospital when she was first taken away and there was still some hope. It is the name under the badge on Ross’s team shirt, over his heart, and the name at the forefront of his mind when he meets the team.“Not many people have been through what we’ve been through and it’s such a comfort having them there,” says Ross. “I go to Norah’s grave every week and read her stories like The Hungry Caterpillar, like I would have doneshe had been alive, and it can feel so painful and sad. Naomi is pregnant again now –  weeks – and it’s wonderful but I think I’ll be nervous until we’re out the other side.”Kieran Wright, , a warehouse worker from Northampton, understands all too well what it feels to be nervous about a pregnancy, after his fiancé suffered two miscarriages in two years.“She was eight weeks pregnant when she started to have severe stomach pains,” recalls Kieran. “We got to hospital and after a few tests they told us we’d had a miscarriage. It was so hard. All that good news and excitement about the pregnancy and it had all gone in the blink of an eye.For a while afterwards, I struggled to go to work and didn’t want to leave my fiancé. You can’t even say everything’s going to be alright, because it just isn’t.”The second miscarriage happened a year later in similar circumstances. “This time I could barely eat, didn’t talk. I was just in my own little world. I suppose I’d hit rock bottom, he tells us. We named them Casey and Dot.”He heard about a charity match Sands Utd were playing locally and spoke to Rob the founder and decided to sign up. “The first time I met some of the lads I preferred to listen to their stories than talk, but over time I did open up and let all my emotions out and I’ve never felt so supported, he says.After games we go to the clubhouse and we will talk through how were feeling - other times we will go round each others houses.They’ve since had a rainbow baby – Archie – who is now six months old. “If I feel down, he’ll just smile at me and I cheer up,” says Kieran.When a baby dies the feelings of loneliness and isolation can be overwhelming and having other bereaved parents to talk to is vital, and dads, especially, can sometimes be overlooked.This is why Sands is now working with Rob and the team to develop Sands United FC into a model that can be rolled out across the UK, so that more bereaved families can set up teams to channel their grief and help break the silence around baby loss.Already four new teams have been set up in Kent, Warwickshire, Leicester and Rutland and Grimsby and Cleethorpes and Sands United has a firm social media following, numbering almost  followers on Facebook and almost the same amount on Twitter and Instagram.To find out more about Sands Utd, visit sandsutdfc.

The EU thinks, with justication, that MPs won’t allow No Deal so it feels under no pressure to make signicant concessions.Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, is telling the UK thatit doesn’t like the backstop, it can have a Northern Ireland-only version of it — which the UK has already rejected. One minister fully briefed on the negotiations tells me: “We’re at ‘what the hell do we do ’ time.”But without a change to the backstop, Theresa May’s deal is going down to another heavy defeat on Tuesday.That won’t be the end of the matter, though. For the very next day Parliament will vote against leaving on March  with No Deal. Parliament will then almost certainly vote to request an extension to Article , the two-year process for leaving the EU.At this moment, the UK would be in the EU’s hands. As one weary No source admits: “They’d be in a position of being able to dictate terms.”It would be up to the EU to decide whether to grant an extension, how long it would be for and what conditions would be attached to it. How humiliating: This country’s future would be being determined in Brussels, not Westminster.The EU would almost certainly grant an extension. But what terms it would come with remains to be seen.What should worry those MPs who are voting against Mrs May’s deal because it is not a clean enough Brexit, is what Parliament would do with this extension. I understand that unless the Government indicates that it will allow the Commons to vote on ious Brexit options, an amendment will be tacked on to the extension vote to ensure that “indicative votes” are held.These votes would be on March  and the Commons would move to bind the Government to negotiate what it wants it to.Ministers would have to report back regularly to the Commons on the progress they are making. Mrs May might be in office, but she would not be in power. It is inevitable that the Brexit the Commons would mandate would be softer than Mrs May’s deal.So why, then, are so many Brexiteers not voting for her deal  Well, the problem is that many of them regard it as so flawed that they have no desire to rescue it. They would, in the words of one Cabinet minister: “Rather their hands be clean of all this.”But this isn’t PRACTICAL POLITICS. If Brexiteers won’t back Mrs May’s deal, then Brexit is ONLY GOING TO GET SOFTER.Is there any hope of avoiding this crisis  Today, it looks unlikely. But the DUP does want a deal.While they won’t accept the backstop as it currently is and were, in the words of one source, “not entirely happy” with the proposal Geoffrey Cox took to Brussels, they are eager for an agreement.If progress on the backstop was combined with a commitment from Mrs May that she would step down before phase two of the negotiations, then the deal might pass.I understand that a leading Brexiteer backbencher conveyed this message to influential figures in the Government this week. One normally loyal minister tells me: “If there’s nothing , that is the thing that has to work.”One outcome next week would avoid a crisis: Some progress on the backstop, Mrs May’s deal passing and a new PM coming in to do the next phase of the negotiations. All other roads lead to crisis.But right now, that is where we are headed.LABOUR will, officially, back a second referendum next week.But with as many as  Labour MPs opposed to the idea, it isn’t going to pass the Commons.Jeremy Corbyn has never been enthusiastic about a second referendum – he only backed one to prevent more defections to The Independent Group of MPs.Once he has gone through the motions of supporting one, he will feel free to pivot to other options.This was demonstrated by the fact he had a meeting with the Norway Plus group of MPs this week, who want the UK to stay in the EU single market.A soft Brexit has an obvious appeal for Corbyn. It would offer a solution to the issue while splitting the Tory Party.IT is now looking increasingly likely that the UK won’t be able to get anything on the backstop.“The EU are just not budging,” one of those intimately involved in the negotiations tells me.Bringing back a pretty much unchanged deal for a vote on Tuesday would lead to a heavy defeat for the Government, and probably by a three-figure margin.But there is another option being discussed in government. Gavin Barwell, the Prime Minister’s chief of staff, told ministers this week that one option was to bring to the Commons the proposal that the UK has taken to Brussels. The idea would then be to try to win a vote on that, to prove to the EU that such a change would get the deal through.Right now, one Downing Street source says, there is a “chicken and egg problem” as the EU doesn’t think that what the UK is proposing would get the deal through the Commons, and so doesn’t see the point in engaging with it.Some in government think that doing this would offer a way out of the votes on No Deal and an extension that threaten to create the bitterest Tory split yet over Europe.This strategy is not without risks. It isn’t certain that the Government would win this vote. There is also a danger that holding a vote on a proposal that has been rejected by the EU would end up looking absurd.But walking into a vote knowing that you are going to lose heavily is rarely a sensible governing strategy.ON Wednesday, Alan Duncan urged the Prime Minister’s chief of staff, Gavin Barwell, to have the Government whip against No DealMrs May’s deal is defeated next week.Duncan warned of an eruption from the “moderate” wing of the partythis didn’t happen. Barwell pointed out that Leave ministers have accepted a lot of compromises over the past few years.The exchange demonstrated how dficult the next week will be for the Tories. The votes that would follow Mrs May’s deal failing would make every previous Tory argument over Europe look like small beer.I understand the Government is looking to contain the row through a motion that would say the UK would not leave on March  without a deal, but would try to make clear that it was still an option after that.AS Mrs May was saying there was “no direct correlation between certain crimes and police numbers”, a leaflet from the Tories’ mayoral candidate Shaun Bailey was dropping on London doormats declaring thatthe party took City Hall they would hire , more police “Helping to bring an end to rising crime”.This pledge shows the position the Government has got itself into is politically preposterous.What is needed is more police to deal with the current crisis, then action to stop children from being drawn into these gangs.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We are almost there.”And he’s right.In the sneering words of ex-Whitehall panjandrum John Kerr, who devised the Hotel Calornia-style check-out-but-never-leave rules for Brexit, Britain has “come to heel”.Whatever emerges from the ashes of this week’s Commons votes, nothing can conceal the humiliation this country has suffered under Theresa May’s lock-jawed leadership.The PM has tarnished one of the jewels in the British crown — respect for this once-great nation in the eyes of the world.Thanks to her, a clutch of faceless EU bureaucrats and their feckless Tory allies have shredded the UK’s reputation for statesmanship and cool diplomacy. Great Britain — the world’s fth-largest economy, nuclear power and permanent member of the UN Security Council — has been reduced to an object of international pity.Allies across the Commonwealth, America and even our erstwhile EU partnersare embarrassed to watch a great democracy grovelling before the unelected Burghers of Brussels.EvenAttorney General Geoffrey Cox s today with his famous cod-piece bulging, it’s lose-lose for Brexit.He might persuade enough Tory MPs to vote Mrs May’s botched and rebadged Chequers Deal through Parliament. But it will be at enormous cost.Barring an unlikely last- minute face-saver, Remainers have won this battle and the .million people who voted for Brexit have been comprehensively whipped.We can blame conspirators such as Tony Blair and ex-Chancellor George Osborne. We can point the finger at the BBC, Whitehall and a clutch of Cabinet plotters.We can blame the Brexiteers themselves for tripping over while stabbing each other in the back.And we can certainly blame Phil Hammond for blocking preparations for No Deal — our sole trump card in Brexit negotiations.But in the end, responsibility for this carnage lies with Mrs May. Indeed, thanks to her, Spreadsheet Phil can now bribe MPs with the £billion he saved by selling us down the river.If his chicanery succeeds, there is a remote chance Parliament will support Chequers and sign up to Brino — Brexit In Name Only. It will be a sour “victory”.History might be kind to Mrs May’s decency and her sense of public duty. But it will not ignore the catastrophic blunders which risk condemning this country to permanent vassal status.Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt correctly warns Europe has just as much to lose. “This is a moment of change in our relationship between the UK and the EU and history will judge both sides very badlywe get this wrong,” he says.“We want to remain the best of friends. That means getting this agreement through in a way that doesn’t poison our relations for many years to come.”Stubborn as she is, Mrs May must know her days as PM are numbered.Losing three babies in quick succession is an unimaginable tragedy in any circumstances.In Shamima Begum’s case it underlines the recklessness of bringing children into the world of terrorist anarchy. Nothing Home Secretary Sajid Javid could have done in the few weeks since she emerged in public is likely to have saved her innocent child.The responsibility lies entirely with Shamima and her jihadi husband, Dutchman Yago Riedijk.There is no chance of her surviving what threatens to be disastrous spring council elections.Certainly there is no question of leading the Government into the next round of EU negotiations, still less risk another general election meltdown.Countless Tory supporters will risk letting Jeremy Corbyn in rather than vote for another May-led government.There is a deal to be had with pro-Brexit MPs who are threatening to inflict a final defeat on Chequers tomorrow.The consequences are unpredictable.If she promises to go by mid-summer, they will vote for her deal.

My view is that things have changed today and the amount of sugar children consume is out of all proportion to what they should be eating, and therefore the tradition is no longer acceptable.However, Tom Bosworth, Olympic race walker from Kent, criticised the head, saying: What is happening to society to ban kids from having sweets on their birthday.Ban them every other dayyou like, but let a child be a child on their birthday.Since announcing the birthday ban she has been called cruel and unsympathetic by furious parents.With around  children per class, sweets and chocolate were being handed out most weeks, something Ms Crawford-Usher said was out of control.Some parents are on board with the decision, while she explained that she had mums and dads telling her that they felt under pressure to comply with the tradition of bringing sweets for the class even though they didnt agree with it.Nearly , children under the age of five needed to have teeth removed last year because of their sugar intake.Ms Crawford-Usher who has insisted that shes not the fun police added: Children can eat and drink whatever they want when they get home, I just want to provide them with healthier choices at school.Children can eat and drink whatever they want when they get home, I just want to provide them with healthier choices at school.Ms Crawford-Usher said: It sets conflict at every level - the whole thing is just a nightmare for schools, and a nightmare for parents.Almost nine in ten hospital tooth extractions among young children are for rotten teeth and more are being removed now than  years ago - despite better dental care and knowledge."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000475215950.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"parents ban vaping home cars e cigarettes kids","story":"They say theres a frightening trend where people think its acceptable to use e-cigarettes at home or in the car.One scientist warned the complacency is similar to how society viewed smoking  years ago.It marks one of the first scientic studies to gauge parents rules about e-cigarette use at home.Researchers at MassGeneral Hospital in the US found parents who vape are much more likely to allow e-cigarettes to be used at home or in their cars, compared with parents who smoke.Dr Jeremy Drehmer, who was one of the leads on the study, said: Our results suggest parents may perceive that it is safe to use e-cigarettes and are not taking the same precautions they do to protect their children from exposure to traditional cigarettes.This study shows that parents who are dual users of e-cigarettes and traditional cigarettes are much less likely to prohibit vaping inside their homes than to prohibit smoking.His team quizzed  parents across ten paediatric clinics across America, including vapers and smokers.They found just  per cent of e-cigarette users and  per cent of dual users had banned vaping at home and in the car.And  per cent of both e-cig users and dual users admitted people used the devices in their cars when kids were present too.Dr Drehmer said this was an alarming trend, and added: We are concerned that parents have been misled by the marketing of vaping products and now believe that the aerosol produced by these products is harmless to children.Paediatric health care providers need to help set the record straight and inform parents that e-cigarette vapour is not safe for children.Meanwhile, Dr Jonathan Winickoff, who led the study with Dr Drehmer, warned these attitudes are similar to those society had towards smoking decades ago - before the true dangers of tobacco were realised.He said: Frankly, its frightening. Its where we were with the exposure of children to combusted tobacco  years ago.Big tobacco markets e-cigarettes as healthy products without any consideration or warnings about the harms to infants and children.The truth is that all vape products create an invisible plume of nicotine and ultrafine toxic particles that spreads into the air and coats surfaces.Do people really want to wait another  years to see how this corporate experiment ends E-cigarettes are recommended by the NHS as a means of helping smokers quit their habit.The health service states the devices do not produce tar or carbon monoxide, two of the main toxins in conventional cigarette smoke.But studies have found the vapour does contain other harmful chemicals, though at lower levels than cigarette smoke, the NHS states.It adds on its website: E-cigarettes are still fairly new and we will not have a full picture on their safety until they have been in use for many years.But according to current evidence... they carry a fraction of the risk of cigarettes.Last week another expert admitted he has banned his family from using e-cigarettes after his team found they increase the risk of heart attacks and depression.Other studies have shown flavoured e-liquids destroy lungand trigger deadly diseases.While other links have been found between vaping and the risk of stroke.So while they may be safer for smokers looking to quit, theres mounting evidence the devices are not harm-free.The new findings are published in the journal Pediatrics.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Others fooled Ed with fake sob stories.The presenter, , said: “I met some fascinating people with extraordinarily touching and heartbreaking stories.“However, some turned out to not be true and some of the untruths became worse the more they unravelled. It was quite an emotional rollercoaster.”One of the characters he encounters is -year-old Geoff, who claims to have been evicted from his home after spending months in hospital following a suicide attempt.Ed, a married dad of one, is drawn to his determination sweeping the streets around hotels and restaurants in Manchester while politely approaching people for change “for a bed for the night”.Geoff tells him: “I’m homeless but I’m not a tramp. I’m not a junkie.”Ed believes his new friend has “fallen through the cracks” and forms a bond with the young man, believing the pair could have been friends in another le.Geoff says: “I’d love to pay taxes. I’d love to have a house. That’s just not how it is for me.”But when his persistent “grafting” results in more than £ in just half an hour, plus another tenner shortly afterwards, Ed learns the money is not going towards a hostel — but hard drugs.Later preparing a potentially lethal “snowball” mixture of heroin and crack cocaine, Geoff justies his choice by claiming he buys drugs only once or twice a month.Having first tried heroin at , he adds: “I can’t afford to go to the pub and spend £, £ on beers, things that normal people do.“I can afford this. Whatever it is that I need to do to make my le bearable, then that’s what I’m going to do.”Unable to hide his disappointment, Ed concedes he has been “naive” to fall for Geoff’s self-pitying fabrication.At the start of the Channel  three-parter — called  Days On The Streets — Ed scavenges in bins for food and ends up chewing someone’s ’s old gum, found in a discarded salad box.He assumes le on the streets will leave him a bag of bones but is very much mistaken.In Glasgow he meets one homeless man who moans about getting TOO MUCH food.Ed said: “I witnessed  volunteers handing out food one night, and there were only two rough sleepers there. I even met one man who complained the public ‘overfeed’ him.”Ed gained lbs sleeping rough, thanks to the burgers and sandwiches given to him by the public.A blood test later showed he was at risk of heart diseasehe continued on such a high-fat diet.He said: “I was shocked by the amount of food available. I thought I was going to lose loads of weight and it was going to be harder to physically survive but there was an abundance of people wanting to help in all three cities.”Filming on his own phone and trailed by an unobtrusive camera crew, Ed met beggars earning hundreds of pounds in an evening, far outdoing taxpayers on minimum-wage jobs.A man called Mark tells him: “If I don’t make £ tonight, I’ll be gutted. I’m good at my f***ing job.”Looking back, the presenter said: “Begging seemed to be more lucrative than I ever imagined. It was common in London for people to make £ or £ in an evening, which is more than the average person earns in work.”Ed said he assumed “no one would want to be on the streetsthey had a choice” but found some of them would rather beg as it is easier than “navigating the benefits system”.For all the Geoffs and Marks sleeping rough on our streets, the plight and torment of others Ed meets is real.Dina, a mum of six, invites the presenter to spend a night in her temporary shelter in Piccadilly Gardens, Manchester, where she sleeps on two layers of cardboard, a sleeping bag and duvet.She tells of her previous le as a model for MS and Debenhams, and how she worked as an extra on Coronation Street.At , she was given a choice of whether to live with her strict dad, who was moving to Bristol, or with her drug-addicted mum. She chose the latter.Having spent two years on the street, she knows le could have turned out dferently for her.Dina, whose kids live with their father, says: “If I was pushed in the way a child should be pushed, in the right direction, I wouldn’t be sat here today. I would have made something of my le.”She sees her children but, crying, adds: “I can’t bring my kids here. If I was an asylum seeker, I’d have a house. This is my country, I was born here.”Dina is seen in the documentary acting in a motherly, protective way towards another female rough sleeper and tells a homeless man who asks her about drugs: “I don’t smoke it, you know I don’t.”The heartbroken mum chose the spot near a -hour Burger King because of its relative safety — but Ed flees when a bloody fight between some men breaks out nearby.When he s later, to find no trace of Dina’s shelter, he is told it was removed by waste collectors.Dina was not there to tell them it was her bed.During his relatively brief taste of sleeping rough, he kips in a doorway that is more like a public toilet and hears stories of homeless people being urinated on as they sleep.Some have had their sleeping bags slashed or set alight.Despite waking one morning to find his own bag had been soaked by a street cleaner, and being forced to wash himself with water from a toilet after a week without showering, Ed conceded even he could see how people were drawn into a le without rules.He said: “Sitting up against a wall, observing people, not having to follow any rules, it’s kind of what I do now. People talk about getting slightly addicted to the freedom, to the outdoor living on the streets.“You can do whatever you like when you like. You have got the fresh air, the social interaction with other homeless people. You get used to it.”Ed said the two months he spent on the streets were “surprising and shocking on almost every level” and added: “Some things were easier than I expected, such as finding food.“It turns out that there’s plenty of food on the streets for rough sleepers, especially in London.”Despite there being “a real sense of community” among some of the homeless people he met, Ed came away feeling “quite cynical” — although emphasised that behind each rough sleeper is a tragedy.He said: “I wouldn’t give directly to homeless people any more, sadly. I think there is plenty of food available for them, and so a lot of any cash they get is spent on drugs and alcohol.“I don’t believe the solution is cash handouts but I do believe they need a great deal more support and help than they are currently getting, to escape their situation.“I worry that the public enables their lestyle to some degree, with all their generosity.” Days On The Streets is on C on Thursday at pm.A Salvation Army spokesman said: “We applaud the generosity of the public in wanting to help people directly, but we recognise that providing cash can trap people in the endless cycle of homelessness and rough sleeping.  Many homelessness charities, including ours, focus on looking at the root causes of homelessness. Donating can help us with our work.”Cemal Ezel, CEO of Change Please, an organisation that trains homeless people as coffee baristas, said: “There needs to be a balance. If it’s a freezing cold night and by donating a few pounds that person can get into a hostel, it may save their le. However, on the whole not every night is freezing so some people use cash donations as an enabler. We try to help people through giving them a job and working their way out of the problem. We found  per cent of homeless people can work and want to.”Paul Noblet, head of public affairs for youth homelessness charity Centrepoint, said: “The decision as to whether to give homeless people money, food or other items should be a matter of personal choice.  If a young person is sleeping rough, the priority must be to get them into safe accommodation.”Stephen Robertson, CEO of The Big Issue Foundation, said: “Rough sleeping and begging are separate issues.  It’s reasonable to recognise that there seems to be, from anecdotal data, a growth in beggars and that leads to a moral and humanitarian question.  Ultimately, the answer lies with the inidual.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

MPs will hold their meaningful vote at pm on the -page pact she reached with the EU. Two months after her deal fell by a record defeat, and just  days before were supposed to leave, Mrs May will give Parliament a chance to have the final say. Last night she made a frenzied final dash to Strasbourg where she came up with a final offer.But she still faces defeat after several Tories and Labour rejected it. That would lead to a vote on No Deal Brexit tomorrow night followed by a vote on delaying Brexit on Thursday.The Commons chamber was packed past pm last night as MPs traded angry recriminations over the last-minute deal. Here are the five quick things you need to know as you wake up and go to work.  Theresa May last night claimed she had won legally binding changes to her plans after MPs demanded a change to the Irish border backstop.The backstop is an insurance clause that would keep the UK in EU customs rules from ,there is no agreement to keep the Irish border open. MPs feared the EU could use the clause to trap the UK in the backstop, holding the country to ransom in trade talks. So the UK and EU agreed a “joint interpretative instrument” to -page deal that, Mrs May claims, would provide a mechanism for the UK to quit the backstopthe EU is showing bad faith. It will give a key role to an arbitration  - who will hear appealsthe UK feels the EU is trying to keep it in the Northern Irish backstop against its will. Separately the new deal commits the parties to coming up with alternative arrangements by December .  In January Theresa May vowed to win “not a further exchange of letters, but a signicant and legally binding change to the withdrawal agreement.” She hasnt done that. The documents she has published are in addition to the -page agreement. They dont change its contents. Theresa May also promised to seek either a time limit, a unilateral exit mechanism, or alternative arrangements to the backstop. She hasnt done that. There is no time limit, and alternative arrangements are a future hope rather than being in place now. As for a unilateral exit mechanism... she may claim she has got it, but MPs will say dferent. It only worksthe UK can prove the EU is trying to trap us in the backstop against our will. And thats very subjective. Even Mrs Mays own statement to Parliament today admits her new deal “reduces the risk of being held in the backstop. It doesnt eliminate it. Labours Keir Starmer says its basically the same deal. . MPs look like theyll still vote against  While Remainers branded it a fig leaf, some Tories wafted over to back the Prime Ministers deal overnight. But thats nowhere near the  people she needs to change their votes from no to yes to pass it. And the DUP, whose votes are crucial, said they would judge the PM by her promises in January - which she hasnt kept . Labours Keir Starmer said it was a pile of broken promises. Remain-backing former attorney general Dominic Grieve told the BBC: “It doesn’t allow the UK the right to terminate the backstop at a time of its own choosing. Ultimately I dont think this document thats been produced makes any signicant dference. Brexiteer Tory ringleader Steve Baker said: I think this falls very far short of what the government whipped us to vote for. And his right-wing comrade Jacob Rees-Mogg said it was “unquestionably a step in the right direction,” but would not commit his vote. Even Iain Duncan Smith, one of the more hopeful-sounding Brexiteers, urged the PM not to rush things through and said she should delay the vote by  hours.  Before .am today, Attorney General Geoffrey Cox will publish his legal advice on the Brexit deal. MPs will scan his text keenly to seeit agrees the deal meets with promises by the Prime Minister. If he does, it will give many Tories political cover to back the deal. But even then, it may not be enough for Theresa May to win. Hard Brexiteers fume that Mr Cox was also involved in negotiating the deal - so hes marking his own homework. Labour are demanding he make a separate House of Commons statement at .pm, before the main debate on the Brexit deal kicks off this afternoon.. Oh, meanwhile, the City is planning a Brexit war room The Financial Conduct Authority has plans in place for a financial war room to take action in the event of a no-deal Brexit. It will oversee the necessary IT changes to keep Britains banking sector operationwe crash out without a deal. An FCA spokesman said: As part of our planning for all scenarios we have put in place contingency measures in the event of a hard Brexit. We will have teams in place throughout the weekend of exit to monitor the situation and respond as needed, working closely with the Treasury and the Bank of England.

The former Director of Public Prosecutions swept into full lawyer mode as he held aloft hundreds of pages of documents in a furious attack. He spoke after Theresa May jetted to Strasbourg for a last-ditch deal with the EU to persuade MPs to vote for her Brexit deal tomorrow night. Her deputy, David Lidington, told MPs the government had secured legally-binding changes that strengthen and improve the -page Brexit deal. He said a new joint instrument will prevent the EU trapping the UK in the Northern Ireland backstop - a clause that would extend EU customs rules over the UK - indefinitely.   And there will be a joint statement supplementing the future political declaration on trade setting out a negotiating track for changes to the Irish backstop. But Mr Lidington prompted shouts of uproar when he said MPs must now back the deal... to avoid a crisis. Jeremy Corbyn insisted that her negotiations had failed and called on MPs to reject the deal. And Sir Keir shot down Mr Lidingtons argument by saying Theresa May had promised to change the Brexit deal itself - and achieved no such thing.  Waving a fat wad of legal papers, Labours Shadow Brexit Secretary asked: Is a single word of the Withdrawal Agreement dferent now to the document that was agreed on November   He added: It sounds again asnothing has changed. Andthat is right, the Prime minister is left with a pile of broken promises. Its as much a matter of trust as substance. Sir Keir branded the situation absurd and made a cruel joke at the Cabinet Office ministers expense.  I don’t complain for not having advance notice of his statement, he told MPs. I’m not sure HES got advance notice. Sir Keir said MPs will be disappointed but not surprised. He said Labour would examine the plans, but boasting of signicant change when just repeating a January statement is not going to take anyone very far. Theresa May, speaking in Strasbourg, said the deal would honour the referendum result and is good for both the UK and the EU. She said she had secured legally binding changes to the Irish backstop.  But Labour MPs lined up to savage the new arrangement. Wes Streeting tweeted: Sat in the Chamber genuinely stunned by the futility and incompetence of the Government’s statement. We’re days away from exit. This is just smoke and mirrors. Labour MP Tracy Brabin added: Late night statement and still no wiser. He’s saying words but none seem to make sense. The new letter agreement isn’t part of the withdrawal agreement we will be voting on tomorrow.

Shell be hoping that shes convinced the EU to enough changes to the Northern Irish backstop that will allow her Eurosceptic MPs to back it. The new version will be put to a meaningful vote in the House of Commons tomorrow. But will it be enough to swing her party - and the rest of Parliament - behind her deal  Heres what it all means and what happens next. Whats the big sticking point   The biggest sticking point is the Northern Ireland backstop. Eurosceptics fear that the insurance policy against a hard border in Ireland, as written, could keep the UK trapped in a partial union with Europe permanently. Crucially, Attorney General Geoffrey Coxs legal advice on the last version of the deal said it would not allow the UK to leave the backstop unilaterally. Theresa May tried to get either a time limit, a unilateral exit mechanism, or alternative arrangements to replace the backstop. Shes definitely not got the first thing she might claim she has the last thing, but its not available yet. She may claim shes secured the middle one but it all still looks a little fuzzy.  Three things:A legally-binding joint instrument which reflects a commitment to replace the backstop with alternative arrangements by December . Lidington says this would prevent the EU trying to trap the UK in the backstop deliberately. A joint statement to go alongside the political declaration, which Lidington says seeks to enhance and expedite the process of bringing the future relationship into force. A unilateral declaration on the temporary nature of the backstop, which will sit alongside the Withdrawal Agreement. This says that it is the UKs understanding thatthe EU doesnt keep up its end of the bargain in the future relationship negotiations, Britain can pull out of the backstop on its own. Its unclearthis will be enough to satisfy Geoffrey Cox that the UK can leave unilaterally. Not technically, no. The Withdrawal Agreement will go ahead exactly as it was before. These three things are new documents which will go alongside the existing agreements. In a tweet, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said: Our agreement provides meaningful clarications and legal guarantees to the Withdrawal Agreement and backstop. And hes again warned that this is the EUs best and final offer: The choice is clear, he wrote. It is this deal, or Brexit may not happen at all. Lets bring the UKs withdrawal to an orderly end. We owe it to history.   Is Brussels up for an extension  It seems so - but the detail of this could be super important. Jean-Claude Juncker has said in very clear terms thatthe UK is going to leave, it has to do so before the European Elections, which take place on - May. If the United Kingdom has not left the European Union by then,he wrote, it will be legally required to hold these elections, in line with the rights and obligations of all Member states as set out in the treaties. So up for an extension, but only a short one. Will it be enough to get the deal through   It’s too early to know for sure, but the Prime Minister’s prospects of completely undoing last time’s -vote defeat look bleak. While Labour MPs blasted the statement as “smoke and mirrors”, some Tories sounded a lot more hopeful, giving good odds we won’t see the record defeat we did in January. But the real people to convince were the DUP - since where their  Northern Irish Unionist MPs go, many Tory Brexiteers will follow. And tonight the DUP issued a statement to Sky News that could be the final nail in the deal for the PM. The DUP didn’t rule out backing the deal. But crucially, the party said it would measure the new plan against “the commitments made by the Prime Minister on  January.”  Those commitments included to win “not a further exchange of letters, but a signicant and legally binding change to the withdrawal agreement.” It is pretty obvious the Prime Minister has not achieved that. Two key elements will decide the Prime Minister’s fate - the full legal text, which was published very late on Monday, and legal advice by the Attorney General Geoffrey Cox. If Mr Cox’s own legal advice is pessimistic about the deal, he cannot hope to persuade enough Tories to back it.

FOI expert Matt Burgess said: “Its outrageous, the law is meant to be applicant and motive blind. “This seems like a cover-up where the government is trying to hide information from journalists because they want an easier ride.”   He added: “Everyone should get the same responses to FOI requests, no matter who they are.” Shameless Mr Johnson travelled to Kabul on an last-minute visit on the same day he would have been forced to vote in favour of Heathrow expansion to keep his job. Mr Johnson once claimed he would lie down in front of the bulldozers to stop the poundbn plan for a third runway. Details of the trip were quietly disclosed to a member of the public in response to an FOI request. But they were not revealed to the Mirror and at least one other publication until a complaint was lodged, days later. The Foreign Office last night denied that it had deliberately held back the information from the media, or treated members of the press dferently to members of the public. But in emails dealing with the request, one official told colleagues: “I’m happy to clear these but can you provide a list of who they are from ”   Another email confirmed an official had “provided details of any known journalists.” The Information Commissioner’s guidance bans public bodies from dferentiating journalists from members of the public when dealing with FOI requests. It’s understood the Foreign Office did suffer an IT problem on the day the data was originally disclosed. But officials have been unable to explain why it affected some applicants and not others. And the department refused to make details of the IT problem public, saying it would be a threat to national security. A further request, for details of how the case had been managed by the Foreign Office, was delayed six time beyond its  working day time limit. Eventually the department revealed some of the information a full  working days late, without providing any explanation.

Neil Couling, UC Director General, told MPs roughly half of those joining the six-in-one system are existing benefit claimants whose circumstances have changed. As of January this year, .million people were on UC. Existing benefit claimants who are moved to UC will have a transition fund to ensure their income doesnt drop, in a trial that starts in Harrogate this July and only rolls out fully in . But these protections do not apply to people whose circumstances change.   MPs have heard this so-called natural migration is triggered by changes in circumstances as small as a relationship breakup or a childs fth birthday. Labour MP Neil Coyle said the move was having a terrible impact on many peoples lives. Work and Pensions Committee chairman Frank Field said: People moving over are stranded. They dont have enough money.  In a hearing of the committee today, Mr Coyle asked what message the new trial sent to those who have already moved. He told Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd: What are we, five years in  And youre beginning a new pilot to see how Universal Credit works  Independent Group MP Heidi Allen added: Its pushing people under the water.  Ms Rudd replied to the MPs: It has always been the case thatyou change your circumstances and need to apply for new benefit, you may find that the situation of the benefits that are being proposed have changed. But Ms Allen said it was a problem hitting people whod moved two yards down the road. Asked how many people had had a change of circumstances, Mr Couling told the Commons Work and Pensions Committee: “It is hard to give a precise estimate. Because obviously it depends on the number of changes of circumstances that occur in a period, and that itself could be determined by economic and other factors. “But roughly it’s about half and half of caseload growth is through a change in circumstance - and half is through a pure new claim to benefit. Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary Margaret Greenwood said: “The government has always claimed that nobody will be worse off under Universal Credit, but we now know that half of all households who claim it are at risk of losing out as a result. “Universal Credit is being used as a vehicle for cuts and people who are being forced to move across from other benefits because of a change of circumstance receive no protection against loss of income. “Labour will stop the roll out of Universal Credit and deliver a social security system that supports any of us when we need it.”  Policy in Practice warned % of UC claimants who move through natural migration lose out by an average of pound a week compared to the old system. Meanwhile % are expected to gain by pound a week, the think tank told the Commons Work and Pensions Committee. Asked to respond to the suggestion , people had moved through natural migration, a DWP spokesperson said: “Only new claimants or people who have undergone a change in circumstances are currently being asked to apply for Universal Credit . Where someone’s circumstances change it’s right that we reassess their entitlement to ensure they’re receiving the right level of support.” Ms Rudd admitted the initial rollout of UC, and the wait for payments, did I believe contribute to the growth of food banks” but insisted reasons are “ied”, and since the period she was talking about there’s been “vast improvement”. Meanwhile, Amber Rudd told MPs the four-year freeze on most working-age benefits will stay until March , but she expected it will end after that. I have private conversations with the Chancellor, she said. And she revealed the DWP have drawn up plans to hire extra staff in a No Deal Brexit . The Work and Pensions Secretary told a committee of MPs: “We have been making preparations for no deal planning. “We are making sure thatthere is an economic downturn, we are prepared to hire additional people should there be fewer jobs available as a result of a no deal exit.” She also confirmed reports the government overall has been looking at the possibility of a “hardship fund”there is no deal.

The public will rightly be concerned that British airlines are refusing to take them out of service, after Sunday’s accident in Ethiopia and an earlier one off the coast of Indonesia. Safety should be paramount in the aviation industry, which is why international air accident investigators are anxious to discoverthe two crashes were a grim coincidence or evidence of a more widespread problem. We are not prejudging the inquiry’s outcome.   But when Ethiopia, Indonesia and China are among the nations grounding the jets, surely erring on the side of caution is the right choice. US manufacturer Boeing will have to co-operate fully and allow its performance records to be examined. It is better to be safe than sorry when it comes to people’s lives. Brexit caution Last throws of the dice are rarely as theatrical as Theresa May’s dash to Strasbourg for Brexit talks last night. She’s desperately searching for a solution that forces hardline Tories to start backing her bad deal. But our country will pay the price. The truth is that May’s poundbillion EU orce would be an expensive, avoidable disaster. MPs should hold their nerve, refuse to be panicked, reject her poor offering and vote for extra time to find an answer that is best for Britain.  A growing chorus of Tories are demanding that she quit, but May is prioritising her own position over the national interest. And that isn’t leadership – that’s putting herself first.

Chloe Wilkinson, , and Patraic Walsh-Kavanagh, , were travelling back to the UK to tell their parents about the surprise pregnancy. But Chloe went into labour during a stopover in Singapore and gave birth to their son Lorcan, who weighed just .lbs. He is currently in intensive care and will have to stay in hospital for at least the next three months.    Chloe and Patraic took out travel insurance ahead of their once-in-a-letime trip, which began in December . But the policy didnt cover the unexpected pregnancy. Teaching assistant Chloe said: Lorcan’s been fighting with all his might and we are bursting with pride at the strength he is showing so far. “However, we are on our own, a  hour flight away from our family and friends, and it has been a very dficult start to parenthood whilst Lorcan remains in hospital.    Its still such a huge shock to us both that hes here but were doing everything we possibly can to ensure we all get back to the UK. Patraic added: We were in a complete state of shock and fear completely took over as we were faced with a severely premature baby with potentially multiple health issues whilst being stuck in a country with no support. “On top of this I was handed an estimated bill of poundk [, SGD] assuming there will be no further complications with Chloe or the baby. Teaching assistant Chloe and Patraic left the UK in December  to go travelling around Asia.    They then found work together in Australia before discovering Chloe was pregnant last November. The couple, who wanted to tell their parents the news in person, began flying home last month. But during a two-day stopover in Singapore Chloe was rushed to hospital after experiencing bleeding and cramps. Doctors told her she had started dilating at just  weeks - meaning flying home was no longer an option. Patraic, from Nottingham, East Mids, said: All the doctors and nurses seemed very concerned.   After numerous tests it was found that she had an infection so she was started on antibiotics and medication to reduce contractions and prolong labour to give baby the best chance of survival. However, Chloe, from Lincoln, fell more seriously ill and medics decided they had to deliver Lorcan immediately. She said: I was absolutely terried because I knew it was too early. When my water broke the room was quickly filled with doctors, midwives and paediatricians As soon as he was delivered he went straight into an incubator where the paediatricians started to help him breathe and stabilise him before whisking him off to intensive care. Hes fighting and doing his best but we feel so helpless.    Lorcan is currently in intensive care while his parents are living in a shared flat near the hospital. Their lack of working visas means they are unable to seek employment to support themselves. So the couple are trying to raise as close to pound, on GoFundMe to help pay for Lorcans hospital bills. By Monday afternoon they had raised more than pound,. Chloe added: Were professional people who work hard but its obviously a huge sum and anything anyone can offer to help would be greatly appreciated. We would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone at home and across the world for their continued love and support.

The self-confessed health fanatic insists the move is in the best interests of pupils.   She said: First of all, Im not the head teacher of all evil and saying no. Ive banned birthday sweets because they were becoming a huge problem in the school and mean the children were consuming processed sugar almost every day. Mrs Crawford-Usher, from New England, America, admits she wasnt allowed sweets growing up and claims her mother was a Whole Foods mum before it was trendy. She noted that children are provided with healthy and wholesome school dinners such as spaghetti bolognese, shepherds pie and roast dinners - all made with fresh ingredients.The strict head of Wateringbury Primary School also said desserts were on the table but they too were natural and unprocessed.  Despite the drastic measures, Mrs Crawford-Usher claimed students and parents have seldom complained. She said: People are angry about it for about a week and then it just becomes normal. I really havent had much of a backlash. Children can eat and drink whatever they want when they get home, I just want to provide them with healthier choices at school. The dental problems among schoolchildren now are awful and I want to do what I can to prevent it.   Its a terribly traumatic ordeal for a child to have their tooth extracted and its something I want to avoid. It comes after recent figures revealed ,  under-s needed tooth extractions last year. Public Health England estimated that youngsters were eating around eight more cubes of sugar per day than the recommended guidelines.However, Mrs Crawford-Ushers decision has come under fire on social media from Olympic race walker Tom Bosworth.He said: Again, common sense needs to be used here. Really what is happening to society to ban kids from having sweets on their birthday. - ban them every other dayyou like, but let a child be a child on their birthday though. The head hit back and said the Olympian had perhaps missed the point. She said: Yes, I think pupils should be able to eat sweets on their birthday buteach and every child brings them in to celebrate, the children would be eating them nearly every day. Also it puts an unfair pressure on parents to bring in sweets when perhaps they dont agree with them. Wateringbury CE Primary School is based near Maidstone, Kent.   Its mission statement reads: Our vision...to be an excellent primary school at the heart of the community where we inspire, excite and enable children to achieve. It was rated good in a  Ofsted report and Mrs Crawford-Usher said the obesity levels among pupils falls slightly below the national average. She has been head teacher of the school for eight years. And its not the first time the head teacher has cracked down on junk food.Last January Mrs Crawford-Usher banned the schools kids from eating crisps four days a week.  The school had previously banned sugary drinks like fizzy sodas and fruit juices too. Teachers are also encouraged to take pupils out of the classroom three times a week for a ten-minute run.Her drastic moves came after figures showed nearly one-in-five Year  pupils locally were classed as obese, with some areas of Kent leading the tables for older overweight primary school children."},{"url":null,"title":"heres whats trending uk shopping","story":"NewsHeres whats trending in UK shopping baskets - from smart speakers to popcornThe goods making it into Britains official inflation basket have been announced - with fruit teas and electric toothbrushes replacing items that have fallen out of fashionShareCommentsByRuki SayidConsumer Editor:,  MAR NewsHealthier snacks such as popcorn are in the basket used as a barometer for the Consumer Price Index \"Get the biggest money stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailSmart speakers, popcorn and baking tins are being used to measure the cost of living for the first time.Amazon’s personal assistant, Alexa, and the Google Home speaker, are now in the official inflation basket compiled by the Office for National Statistics.And the rise of Bluetooth devices has seen the traditional hi-fi knocked off the list.

The family would later claim they saw him carrying a girl, wearing pink and white pyjamas, down a quiet street around m from the beach. And US criminal profiler Pat Brown believes the sighting is the key in Madeleines case, which has yet to be solved more than a decade on. This is the number one issue about the whole case, and Ive stuck by this for years, and I stand by it today, she told  News in a podcast. Madeleine was just three when she vanished from an apartment in Praia da Luz, where she had been sleeping with her twin siblings.   At the time, her parents Kate and Gerry were dining with pals nearby.The reported sighting by the Smiths was at around pm on May , . The same night, a friend of Kate and Gerry also reportedly saw a dark-haired man carrying a child away from the direction of the apartment.But this sighting, by Jane Tanner, was reported to be  minutes before the Smiths one and was in a dferent location, the news site reports. Jane claimed she had gone for a walk when she saw, in the darkness and from some distance, a man carrying a child across the road ahead.“What makes the Smith sighting very interesting is that Jane Tanner is a friend, and the Smith sighting is a bunch of people that have no clue who the McCanns are, Pat, from Washington DC, says in the Maddie podcast.   These are not their friends. She adds: I believe the Smith sighting occurred. I believe they saw a man carrying a little girl down that road, which is towards the beach. E-fits of a suspect, based on evidence from holidaymaker Martin Smith and his family, were unveiled years after Madeleines disappearance.Meanwhile, an artist drew an impression of the so-called Tannerman - the man spotted by Jane, who was considered a suspect for years. Pats comments are made in the third episode of the podcast, which looks into the high-profile case and the two sightings that night.According to  News, the criminal profiler has studied the case in exhaustive detail, even flying out to visit Praia da Luz itself. Madeleine would now be , turning  in May this year.In November , Operation Grange, the Met Police investigation into her disappearance, was given a further pound, from the Home Office. This provided funding up to March  this year. The podcast is hosted by Australian journalist Mark Saunokonoko. A Netflix documentary about the case is set to be broadcast next month. Kate and Gerry earlier released a statement about the Netflix show. They said: We are aware that Netflix are planning to screen a documentary in March  about Madeleine’s disappearance.  The production company told us that they were making the documentary and asked us to participate.We did not see and still do not see how this programme will help the search for Madeleine and, particularly given there is an active police investigation, could potentially hinder it.

Kate and William werent far behind them and the two royal women had a sweet reunion when they met inside the beautul abbey. They kissed each other on both cheeks, and both women did the same to their brother-in-law, just as Prince Charles and Camilla arrived.

Kate opted for a bright red knee- button down coat, beige heels and a Gina Foster hat.  The Queen looked lovely in purple with a stunning silver jeweled broach. She praised how the Commonwealth inspires its member states to find ways of protecting the planet and it citizens. In a written message, the monarch said: In April last year, I welcomed the leaders of our  nations to Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, and we all witnessed how the Commonwealth vision offers hope, and inspires us to find ways of protecting our planet, and our people.  We are able to look to the future with greater confidence and optimism as a result of the links that we share, and thanks to the networks of co-operation and mutual support to which we contribute, and on which we draw.

Alison Whateley, , can now be named as the vile nursery boss who was caught holding a video conference meeting with other child abusers on her mobile phone. The offender was spared jail last week after a y National Crime Agencyinvestigation. A judge today ruled it was in the public interest for the woman to be identied. He told Guildford Crown Court she worked at Bushy Tails Day Nursery and Pre-school in Teddington, south-west London, but none of her offences involved kids from that nursery. The establishment today said it was saddened to hear of Whateleys sick acts. Whateley told other online child porn users that babies were f****** sexy as she showed the depth of her depravity in recordings and live stream chatroom sessions. She shared her fantasies of abuse of young children online with online lovers with whom she watched graphic images of child abuse online.  Whateley, of Farnham, Surrey, used her iPhone to access online chatroom Zoom in , where anonymous hosts had played videos of children as young as three years old being raped. She admitted initiating, encouraging or assisting the commission of an offence, namely the distribution of indecent images of children, but was allowed to walk free from court on Thursday. Sentencing, Judge Peter Moss said: A psychiatrist found that you gave a less than compelling reason for why you were viewing this material, to be seeking to entrap paedophiles as some sort of paedophile hunter. You have accepted that is not correct because of your inactivity in doing something about it. The court had heard an undercover officer for the NCA was deployed in the video conference call Whateley held in . Steven Talbot-Hadley, prosecuting, said: At the relevant time this defendant worked as a manager at a nursery.  An undercover investigation was underway by the National Crime Agency focused on the online conferencing  Zoom, which is otherwise legitimate but known to be used by paedophiles for sharing images of child abuse online. An undercover officer was deployed in the meeting. It was in this way that this defendant was discovered. What the court is concerned with is the involvement in a Zoom meeting on August , . On that occasions the defendant was present for just under an hour under the username XXX. The court heard that during this time  participants viewed  videos showing children as young as three to five being sexually abused and raped. During this time, Whateley actively participated when she typed into the live chat that she liked masturbating over boys and girls, the younger the better, and she particularly liked babies, saying they were so f****** sexy. And she asked the other users: Anybody interested in very tiny children  Caroline Moonan, defending, read out a statement by Whateley, which said: I struggle to explain my actions. One day I accidentally found a chatroom with paedophilic material. I didnt really have a plan, I did not really know what I was trying to do. Ms Moonan said: When she looks back at her actions now she is disgusted with herself. She simply cant understand why she behaved in the way she did. She will never work with children again. She was so good at looking after children and so good at protecting children.  Her job became very stressful and she couldnt sleep. She started using the internet more and more.She saw a chatroom about children and she thought it was something like MumsNet.When she saw went in, she found it was paedophiles talking about abusing children. She couldnt believe that such a site was allowed to exist. She felt compelled to explore the chatrooms to try to explore why people do this. She cannot really explain to this day what she was intending to do. A spokesman for the Bushy Tails nursery said: We recognise the signicant impact that events such as this can have on iniduals and families.We are saddened by the events and welcome the conclusion of the National Crime Agencys investigation.We will always be supportive of outcomes which protect and ensure the safety, wellbeing and happiness of all children. Since the charge does not relate to our nurseries or the children we care for here, we feel it would be inappropriate to comment further.

Geoffrey Crossland today admitted to storing prohibited firearms in an underground bunker at his home in Harrogate, North Yorkshire. When officers raided the sprawling Padside Green Farm property, they found guns hidden underneath it, along with ammunition. Police had been investigating the -year-old after he was found to have amassed more than . million indecent images. The horric pictures were described by the Crown Prosecution Service as one of the biggest known collections in England and Wales.  North Yorkshire Police said their seizure was the biggest in the county, and included , images in the most extreme category A. Appearing at York Crown Court earlier today, Crossland admitted  charges in relation to the possession of firearms and ammunition. He had previously pleaded guilty to three counts of making indecent images between January  and October . And this afternoon, the defendant was sentenced to  years and eight months behind bars by His Honour Judge Andrew Stubbs. Sentencing Crossland, the judge said: A search on your home led to the discovery of an enormous amount of indecent images of children.  In a locked box, devices and hard drives there was also a discovery of carefully stored images of many years dating back to . These were systematic searches, some of which found children between - being raped and others of young girls receiving a signicant amount of sexual abuse. Crosslands home was raided while he was holidaying abroad last year.He was arrested on histo Heathrow Airport in an operation conducted by police and the National Crime Agency . Stephen Wood, prosecuting, told the court: It [the bunker] was fitted with electrics and from there they recovered USBs, sim cards, external hard drives, laptops, computers, tablets, floppy disks and DVDs. Among the evidence there was a worrying document which had been created with login details so he [Crossland] couldnt forget which websites to access.  There was also websites on the documents listed with where he could access the best websites for indecent images of children and where he could share the information without being suspected. He even categorised the websites by the content and who had made them. Susannah Proctor, defending, said: The bunker at his home was made in  from storage containers which he applied for permission. He worked from his home at that time for his business creating manufactured electrical components. He possessed the firearms because he was an enthusiast and had been since he was  years old. This was also a hobby he shared with his father. Former businessman Crossland was jailed for five years for the possession of indecent images,  months for possessing moving images of a young girl, and six years for the illegal possession of firearms.  He was also issued with a ten-year Sexual Harm Prevention Order and placed on the sex offenders register for ten years. Detective Chief Inspector Graeme Wright, of North Yorkshire Police, was the senior investigating officer in the case. He said: This is without doubt the largest ever seizure of indecent images of children in the history of North Yorkshire Police. The investigation as a whole has been on a scale never seen before in our area regarding this type of offending. More than  digital devices were seized from an office area above the underground bunker complex on Crosslands premises. Each device had to undergo painstaking examination by North Yorkshire Polices Digital Forensic Unit supported by a team of specialist officers from the National Crime Agency.  There was also the recovery of the prohibited firearms and ammunition. We knew that Crossland had, legitimately, been an active member of shooting clubs over the years and he had acquired a large collection of firearms-related items and ammunition which he stored in the bunker. Nevertheless, everything had to be seized and carefully assessed to determine what was and what wasnt legally held. Marc Horsfall, of the National Crime Agency, said: A team of specially trained NCA officers spent several months working through Crosslands horric catalogue of abuse images to grade them in order of severity. Crossland and men like him are fuelling the actual contact abuse of children and the sickening distribution of those images. The NCA works with partners at home and abroad to catch child sex offenders and bring them to justice.

Four-star guest house The Lighthouse, in Frome, is said to hosting a group called Universal Medicine. A civil court in Australia found Universal Medicine makes  claims about healing in a defamation case last December, according to the Sydney Morning Herald.

The ,-mile wide weather bomb has triggered severe weather warnings from the Met Office with gales up to mph and heavy rain expected for more than  hours once the storm makes landfall.A yellow warning for strong winds covers Northern Ireland, Wales, most of England and western parts of Scotland, while a rain warning has been issued for the North West of England, where more than two inches could fall. Storm Gareth brings a risk of damage to buildings, flying debris, large waves and flooding in addition to power cuts and travel chaos, forecasters said. Showers could be wintry over hills while northern and central parts could be hit by thunderstorms and hail as the country is battered by the massive and powerful storm.   The intense storm, caused by a deep area of low pressure, has been given a name to bring greater urgency and awareness to the Met Offices warnings. Forecasters have urged people to take precautions so they arent caught out by severe weather. The Met Office has issued three separate weather warnings for wind or rain before the worst of Storm Gareth hits. The first covers the North West of England, where more than two inchesof rain could fall over higher ground in Cumbria by pm on Tuesday, increasing the risk of flooding on already wet ground.  About .insis expected quite widely. The second warning, for wind, covers Northern Ireland from pm Tuesday to pm Wednesday. The Met Office said: A spell of strong northwesterly winds are expected across Northern Ireland for the evening travel period, continuing overnight and Wednesday morning. Gusts of up to mph are likely inland with a small chance of reaching mph for a time in squally showers.  Gusts of -mph are likely along northern coasts, perhaps up to mph for a time. Winds will steadily ease through Wednesday morning. Those strong winds will later extend into Wales, England and Scotland, where a yellow warning will be in place from pm on Tuesday until pm on Wednesday. The Met Office warned: A spell of strong northwesterly winds is expected to develop across southwest Scotland late on Tuesday evening then extend across much of England and Wales through Wednesday.  Gusts of up to -mph are likely inland and mph along western coasts. Winds will gradually ease during Wednesday afternoon. Almost two dozen flood alerts have been issued across northern England. In Wales, four have been issued around Snowdonia National Park and two in Brecon Beacons National Park. Scotland has issued six flood warnings and two flood alerts.  On Tuesday morning, winds were already gusting to mph at Mumbles Head in South Wales, and mph at both St Marys on the Isles of Scilly and the South Ulst Range in northwest Scotland. By .am almost two inchesof rain had fallen at Capel Curig in North Wales over the previous  hours, while Shap in Cumbria had recorded a similar amount . A yellow weather warning for rain is also in place in parts of northern England on Thursday and Friday. Drivers have been told to expect longer journey times, while air, rail and bus passengers could face delays or cancellations.  Temperatures will hit about C in some places, but it wont feel pleasant due to the wind and or rain. Gareth is slamming in the UK just days after severe winds, snow and rain caused disruption on Sunday. Why Storm Gareth  The Met Office and Met Eireann, the Irish weather service, produce a list of storm names just before the beginning of autumn every year. Its believed that people pay closer attention to severe weather warningsit is a named storm. Gareth was named by Met Eireann and is the third named storm this year after Erik in February and Freya earlier this month. Gareth has been dubbed a ,-mile wide weather bomb, or explosive cyclogenesis, when air pressure drops rapidly in a single day.  The rotation of a storm is increased, creating destructive weather conditions. Storms Ali and Bronagh hit in September last year, Callum in October and Deirdre in December. The next named storms will be Hannah, Idris and Jane. Met Office five-day weather forecastTuesdayHeavy rain across Wales and northern England, spreading southeastwards, with gusty winds. Brighter skies following from the north and later west, with heavy, blustery showers, wintry over northern hills. Turning very windy later, with severe gales in the northwest. Tuesday nightVery windy with severe gales in the north. Heavy and squally showers across northern and central parts with risk of hail of thunder. Drier in the south with clear spells.WednesdayCold and very windy with sunshine and showers, heavy in places with snow over northern hills. Showers will steadily ease but rain will reach the west later.Thursday to SaturdayUnsettled throughout with bouts of wind and rain, heaviest in the west. Some drier and brighter interludes are likely. Rather cold in the north, milder at times in the south. Snow on the way The Met Offices extended forecast is predicting further spells of rain and snow as spring nears. The forecast, for Saturday  March to Monday  March, says: Cloud and rain are expected to affect the south, and perhaps central parts, of the UK early on Saturday, and will clear with bright and showery weather extending countrywide by the days end. Showers may be heavy in the north and fall as a mixture of sleet or snow, especially on high ground.Any strong winds will ease through the day too. Lighter winds and cooler on Sunday. Then there are signals for an Atlantic-driven and unsettled theme through the following week. We are likely to see further spells of wind and rain, followed by drier, more showery periods. The wettest, windiest weather always most likely in the northwest. Towards the end of the outlook there may be a tendency for more settled conditions to affect southern areas. The first day of spring is Wednesday  March.

As part of this planning, Theresa, who lives in Dublin, knows the event will take place at a castle venue and Christina Perris A Thousand Years is going to be the song she and her husband have their first dance to - as shes been waiting for what feels like a thousand years to find the one.She also knows what food will be served on the day , what kind of shoes shes going to wearand that she wants to spend the honeymoon in Disneyland.And while some may think its odd to have so much planned without even being engaged, the mum disagrees, arguing that its sensible as there will be very little left to worry about when the time comes.  Her idea to plan the wedding was sparked when she and her partner broke up after six years of dating and having two kids together.The pair had discussed marriage, but sadly the relationship just didnt work out the way shed thought it would.Following the split, she decided she wouldnt let her lack of a prince charming stop her from getting on with her le and achieving her dream of getting married, so she started working out what she wanted.

Susana Almenara, lead author of the report, has urged anyone with known drug allergies to be aware of the potential risk and ensure they use condoms.  We think that as clinicians it is important to be aware of this phenomenon so was to inform and prevent potentially serious reactions in sensitised patients.

In a statement issued earlier today, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus claimed the threat of pandemic influenza was “ever present”, warning the public not to underestimate the risks. He said: “We must be vigilant and prepared - the cost of a major influenza outbreak will far outweigh the price of prevention.” The last flu pandemic to strike was caused by the HN virus - also known as influenza A - that spread across the world during  and .   According to studies of that pandemic, at least one in five people worldwide were infected during the first year, and is estimated to have caused between , and , deaths globally in the same time. Global health experts and the WHO warn there is a risk that a more deadly flu virus will one day jump from animals to people, mutate and infect many hundreds of thousands of people. Flu viruses are multiple and ever-changing, and they infect around a billion people every year around the world in seasonal outbreaks.  Of those infections, around  to  million are severe cases, leading to between , and , seasonal flu-related respiratory deaths. Vaccines can help prevent some cases, and the WHO recommends annual vaccination - especially for people working in health care and for vulnerable people such as the old, the very young and people with underlying illness. The World Health Organisation’s plan - described as the most comprehensive to date - includes measures to protect the public as much as possible from annual outbreaks of seasonal flu as well as preparing for a pandemic. The plan’s two main goals are to to improve worldwide capacities for surveillance and response - by urging all governments to develop a national flu plan, and to develop better tools to prevent, detect, control and treat flu, such as more effective vaccines and antiviral drugs. During a pandemic, there is little or no pre-existing immunity towards the virus in the human population.  Three influenza pandemics occurred at intervals of several decades during the th century, the most severe of which was the so-called Spanish Flu”.

Catherine Shaws body was discovered on Monday, a week after she was last seen leaving a hostel carrying a stray puppy. It is believed the -year-old, from Witney, Oxfordshire, had hiked from Eco Hotel Mayachik to the Nariz del Indio summit, overlooking Lake Atitlan, to watch the sunrise on March . After the search came to a tragic end, a preliminary police report claimed the Brit was found naked and had visible blows to her body and lacerations on her left leg. Her father had reportedly flown to the Central American country to join the search.   Miss Shaws jacket and trousers, and the puppy were found shortly before her body was discovered near the village of San Juan La Laguna. Community leader Juan Mendoza said the trousers had been found at the Nariz del Indio summit. Mr Mendoza described the -year-old’s death as a crime and called on authorities to find those responsible. Police sources told local press they believed she had been murdered, although officially Guatemala’s PNC force said only it had launched a “criminal investigation” into the “deplorable incident.”  Miss Shaw was found naked near a popular mountain beauty spot called Nariz del Indio - Indian Nose in English - which is a two-hour hike from the hotel she was staying at and is regularly visited by backpackers who travel to the spot nearly ,ft above sea level to watch the sun come up.The peak of the mountain, where a lookout shack with wooden benches has been built which visitors can climb on top of to enjoy a panoramic view of Lake Atitlan, is the tip of the Indian nose and was considered a sacred site by the Mayans who would pray and conduct religious services. Mr Mendoza, revealing volunteers had found Miss Shaw’s body and another search team had found a pair of trousers believed to be the backpacker’s, said: “It’s terrible this type of thing happens in our area and we urge the authorities to investigate because these crimes stain the good name of our municipality.”  A preliminary police report, leaked to local press, said Miss Shaw was found “totally naked, face down and at first sight has visible blows to her body and lacerations on her left leg. A spokesman for Guatemala’s PNC police confirmed she had “several blows” but said the state of decomposition of her body meant it was not possible to confirm how the injuries had been caused at the scene of the find, and forensic experts would have to determine the cause of death. Guatemala’s Interior Ministry said in a statement after Miss Shaw’s body was found: “After several days of intense searching by police authorities, other institutions and volunteers for the missing British national, participating teams are being coordinated at the scene where her body has been found.  “After  hours of an exhaustive search, the result is very regrettable and the Interior Ministry and police chiefs have immediately designated a team which will carry out the criminal investigation. “This is to determine what has happened and who could be involved in this deplorable incident. Miss Shaw disappeared in the early hours of March  after leaving Eco Hotel Mayachik clutching a puppy and leaving her mobile phone and passport behind in her room. The stray dog - shivering but alive - was found at the highest lookout of Indian Nose, near to the spot where her body was found, between am and am on Friday morning. Her distinctive woollen pink and cream jacket has also been found and handed to police.  Miss Shaw had been travelling in Guatemala for two weeks, having previously been in Mexico and Calornia, before she disappeared. She was travelling with a friend, who woke up on the morning of March  to find that she was missing. The Lucie Blackman Trust, which is supporting Ms Shaws family, said on Monday evening that a body had been found which is believed to be Ms Shaws. In a statement it added: The Lucie Blackman Trust is saddened to announce that a body has been found in the search for Catherine Shaw. Formal identication has not taken place but the body is believed to be Catherine. Catherines family have been informed. Please respect their privacy at this dficult time.  The charity said Ms Shaw had left the hotel in Mayachik, near San Pedro and San Juan, on March  at .am, but then ed at .am. She then left again for the last time at .am, heading in the direction of the lake. The trust said that at this point she had a puppy with her but no other possessions. A hand drum, known as a hang, previously reported to be in Ms Shaws possession, was left behind and has been located, and she did not have a guitar with her when she left, the trust added. The search encountered many challenges including communication issues due to lack of power in the area. Friends had set up a Facebook page to help to coordinate the search efforts and raise funds to pay for a helicopter to join the hunt for her.

The first-ever footage of the Filin P- in use was broadcast on the Russian Defense Ministry’s channel Zvezda. It was filmed as the defence technology was tested in St Petersburg and shows the light flashing on and off continuously. One of the Filin P-s was said to be on board the Russias missile frigate Admiral Gorshkov which was spotted off the UK coastline last week.The Royal Navy scrambled a warship, HMS Defender, to follow the Russian naval task group, including the missile frigate Admiral Gorshkov.  HMS Defender intercepted the Russian vessels in waters north east of Scotland and escorted them as they passed the UK coastline and sailed through the English Channel. The Admiral Gorshkov, which is on its maiden mission, is alleged to have been fitted with the Filin P- visual optical interference weapon which can blind enemies and cause nausea, leaving them with feelings of disorientation and hallucinations. It is said the non-lethal weapon fires strobe-like beams to disrupt the enemys vision and prevent an attack, and is part of an arsenal that includes guided Kalibr missiles. Russias Ministry of Defence said the Admiral Gorshkov - named after Soviet Navy Admiral Sergey Gorshkov - is sailing with the supply ship Elbrus, the rescue tug Nikolay Chiker and the tanker Kama.   The Admiral Gorshkov entered service last year and is expected to join Russias fleet of ships in the Mediterranean. HMS Defender, a Type  destroyer equipped with a Sea Viper missile system, was scrambled over the weekend to keep watch on the Admiral Gorshkov and three auxiliary ships. The British warship left Newcastle on Saturday to head northeast of Scotland to meet the Russian task group in time for the ships to pass the UK coastline on Tuesday. A Navy spokesman said: Portsmouth-based Defender is monitoring the Russian task group and keeping track of their activity in areas of national interest.   Armed forces minister Mark Lancaster said: The Royal Navy is always standing ready to defend the UK. We will continue to work with our allies to shadow Russian ships passing through international waters close to our shores, to ensure the Russian navy follows the correct protocol on its journey. The Filin P- has also been installed on Russias Admiral Kasatonov frigate.

It took  days for doctors to be satisfied that the twins were strong enough to be reunited, and the emotionally-charged moment was made all the more poignant when Zoe reached out to hug her older sister. The decision to deliver the girls early was made after doctors were concerned that one of them was in distress.Mum Ann Les pregnancy had been a high-risk one, with her precious girls sharing an amniotic sac.Known as monochorionic monoamniotc twins, this sort of multiple pregnancy means there is only  per cent chance the twins will survive past  weeks.   Throughout her pregnancy from  week mark, Ann, from Melbourne, Australia, had had to have fortnightly ultrasound scans to monitor the girls development.On the day of their delivery, Olivia came first - with a loud cry, Ann tells Daily Mail Australia .Zoe came next but was breech, so after a bit of pulling, the doctor managed to get her out. She didnt cry or move which made us really concerned.  Both girls were quickly taken by the midwives to the paediatric team for assessment. Fast forward a month and Ann was finally able to have a much anticipated twin cuddle. We waited  days exactly for our first twin cuddle and it was so much more than we could have expected, she adds. Olivia was placed on me first, then when it was Zoes turn she reached out her left arm and hugged her sister. My tears were flowing, its a moment Ill never forget. The proud mum shared the beautul moment on Instagram .Now Ann is hopeful that she can take her girls home with her by mid-April. It has been emotionally draining for my husband and I, but now that they have passed the one month mark, their chances of survival are now greater than  per cent, she said.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks. Why have we in Argyll after nine years, four dferent Transport Ministers and £m spent and still have no guaranteed safe passage   on The Rest and Be Thankful Follow the Argyll Advertiser#s campaign #Invest in the Rest#. Transport Minister Michael Matheson, Transport Scotland and our Government must abandon their obsession with mitigation measures and fund a permanent solution. We demand no less.Sir,Calls for assurances that the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A will be improved to resist future landslides were made during a session of Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity questions in the Scottish Parliament.I quizzed transport secretary Michael Matheson, about what was discussed at the last meeting of the A Taskforce in November , and asked what assurances the Cabinet Secretary could give to local residents and businesses who rely on the A being open at all times.The Rest and Be Thankful was closed off for nine days in October  following the largest landslide in a decade, forcing road users to either take a major ersion, or to use the Old Military Road during certain hours of the day.A number of petitions were created during the period of the incident, including one by myself, calling for a permanent solution to the Rest and Be Thankful.The transport secretary said that the meeting was #full and frank#, and that there would be a #review of the potential for additional landslide mitigation measures at the Rest and Be Thankful#, and that this would be discussed at the next A Taskforce meeting in March .There was also a commitment that Argyll and Bute would be #prioritised# in the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.I welcome the assurances by the transport secretary that there will be a review of any additional measures for the Rest and Be Thankful, and that Argyll and Bute will receive priority at the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.Donald Cameron, MSPReserve forcesSir,Last issue#sletter raising concerns about the UK government’s proposed use of the army’s reserve force in the event of a no-deal Brexit is timely.In case anyone out there still thinks a no-deal Brexit is a good idea it’s worth noting that the legal authorityof Reserve Forces Act  allowing the Secretary of State to take this step requires him to establish that it is necessary #for the alleviation of distress or the preservation of le or property in time of disaster or apprehended disaster#.Enough said.Frances Roberts, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"honours even for red star in argyll derby","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Ropework played host to this keenly contested local derby which was watched by a healthy crowd on Saturday February .And for the second time this season, Red Star and Campbeltown Pupils shared the points in a match both sides will feel they could have won.Both sides were struggling for fluency in the opening stages but Red Star settled first and grabbed the opening goal after  minutes. A long ball to the right hand side was met by Ryan Caskie who cut the ball back to Stuart McLean. The youngster took a touch before slotting past the Pupils# goalkeeper to give Star a - lead.Star continued to press and doubled their lead when Coll McCallum robbed the Pupils# defender on the edge of the box before cutting the ball across goal. The unfortunate Pupils# defender could only ert the ball into the empty net, with McLean waiting on a tap in. The game continued at a frantic pace, however, there was no further scoring in the first half and Star went in with a - advantage.Pupils came out with purpose in the second half as they looked to force themselves back into the game, however, it was a howler from Red Star which allowed them back into the match.A square ball across the back resulted in a mix-up between Star keeper Luke Kalache and defender Ben Forbes which allowed Donald McCallum to prod the ball home from just inside the box and Pupils were back in the game at - with eight second half minutes gone.The home side didn’t recover from this and you could sense a nervousness that gave the visitors plenty encouragement. The equaliser arrived with  minutes remaining when good play from Pupils down the right by Soudan saw him get a low cross in which was met by the on-rushing run of Ryan Deans and he finished well to level the score at -.This set up a frantic finish and both sides could have nicked it towards the end. Pupils went close with a headed effort which was clawed to safety while at the other end there was a goalmouth scramble which Star couldn’t convert and both sides had to settle for a draw in the end as referee Jimmy Litster blew for full time.Red Star were dealt a blow as it emerged that captain Aaron Moore suffered a dislocated shoulder. Hopefully this will not keep him out for too long.On Saturday February , Star have another important home game as they look to move off the bottom of the table when they take on Claremont AFC.

Documents such as rent records, estate census papers, military papers, letters, maps and legal documents can offer a glimpse into the lives of people who lived across Argyll.The two-year Written in the Landscape project is set to wind up in July this year and has entailed cataloguing and digitising the Argyll Estate and other records to make them more accessible to the public.As Hannah and Jen travel round Argyll on their tour, the intention is to offer a local flavour from the archives aimed at each venue.For the Lochgilphead workshop on February , Jen and Hannah presented such erse items as #registers of the poor# and burgh court rolls from Lochgilphead, th century wage books from Kilmory Estate alongside military commission documents from the th century and a  map of the proposed Crinan Canal, surveyed by John Rennie.Each record offers a dferent insight among a treasure trove of detail.The Lochgilphead presentation followed a similar event in Campbeltown in January. Workshops will be held in March on Mull, Helensburgh in April before travelling to Strachur, Dunoon, Inveraray and Tiree in May.Further information on the Argyll Paper records can be obtained by emailing archives@inveraray-castle.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":null,"title":"bob sheilds make new recycling","story":"NewsBob Shields: Make new recycling system in South Ayrshire work for usNew leaflets needed to inform the publicShareByAyrshire Post:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR News\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAfter a first glance at last week’s report on noisy bin men – I had to check out my calendar to make sure I wasn’t getting a month ahead of myself. Let’s face it, stories about a Mr Paine and some broken glass usually appear on April . But no – it really was only March ! Mr Paine’s issue is the emptying of his street’s bottle bins at am. On the morning of his first collection, he mistook the noise of breaking glass for a robber breaking into his house. “I was terried,” he said. And then added, “This is noise pollution and most of the street must have been up.” Well, I too have suffered Mr Paine’s ‘noise pollution’ - perhaps an even noisier version. Chez Shields is no stranger to a well chilled Petit Chablis washing down the foie gras before Eastenders. In fact, I’ve been known to pop a second cork just to recover from Eastenders! Based on Mr Paine’s video recording, the noise made by the emptying of my bottle bin is right up there - somewhere between a small public house and a decent sized restaurant. Andit wakes up my neighbours – I couldn’t give a Chateau Le Clos! On my street’s first collection, I didn’t wake up thinking I was being burgled. House-breakers don’t usually make enough noise to get “most of the street up”. I seem to remember thinking, “That’ll be the bin men . . .” and going back to sleep. And on the  days a year that the glass bins are emptied in “quiet, residential Masonhill”, I respectfully suggest Mr Paine does the same. After all, we’re talking about saving the world here . . . not saving an hour’s kip! Greenhouse gas emissions are asphyxiating the planet. Plastic bags are strangling dolphins and milk bottle caps are choking sea birds. Our little Earth is throttling itself. To be honest, I’d rather be concentrating on ten decades of industrial pollution than Mr Paine’s ten minutes of noise pollution. And meanwhile, still in bin land, South Ayrshire Council is blaming the public for the latest waste collection problems. I can see the point they’re making – but the word “contamination” is a bit strong for Mrs McGuffie putting Tiddle’s empty Whiskas can in the paper and cardboard bin. And the new recycling system is a little too new for the “red tag” bin police to be targeting offenders. By refusing to lt certain bins – South Ayrshire Council is tempting fate. I’ve heard reports of some people using a neighbour’s bin when their own bin is full and red tagged. I’m also told there are increasing incidences of household waste being stuffed in the street bins reserved for pedestrian litter. And stuck in the middle are the bin men themselves. One told me “If we red tag a bin – we get **** from the householder. If we take back a contaminated bin, we get **** from our supervisors. Basically, were in the **** no matter what we do!” My dear old mum used to use a lovely phrase – “There’s a place for everything . . . .and everything in its place”. That’s exactly how SAC’s new recycling system meant to work. But it’s going to take a little time and a little patience – on both sides. The info leaflets sent out to explain the new system were largely ignored or discarded - most people didn’t understand them. But with the new bins now rolled out – a back-up leaflet might help. “You’ve got your new bins – now here’s how to use them”. Rubbishing the new rubbish system isn’t going to make it go away. It’s here – let’s get on with making it work for ourselves, our neighbours and our community.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrSouth Ayrshire CouncilEnvironment"},{"url":null,"title":"churches facing end era parish","story":"NewsChurches facing end of era as parish minister calls it a dayCrisis in Kirk conregationsShareByAyrshire Post:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR News\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email There’s no parish ministers round here, writes Edwin LawrenceThat’s the crisis facing Kirk congregations in Girvan and South Carrick. And it becomes reality with the imminent departure of Rev Richard Moffat from Girvan North Parish Church. The area – in the short term at least – will be dependent on the services of elderly retired ministers and lay readers. Mr Moffat has been a popular parish minister at Girvan North for five years. And he was due to become Moderator of the Presbytery of Ayr in April. But he is set to move to a new charge in Morayshire, to be closer to his daughter and her family. He will conduct his last Sunday service in Girvan North on March . Mr Moffat’s departure is the latest factor concentrating minds in the Church of Scotland. For Girvan South, linked with Barr and Dailly is currently without its minister. Popular Rev Ian McLachlan has been on sick leave for several months. And colleagues say he is unlikely toto full-time duties. Rev Stephen Ogston was parish minister at Ballantrae Colmonell from  until August, . But he moved on to Luce Valley Church, and no replacement has been found. The linked charge of Ballantrae St Colmon also takes in services at Barrhill and Glenapp. So communities right across Girvan and South Carrick no longer have a parish minister in their midst. And there is uncertaintly at how things will be resolved. One solution might be a union of the two Girvan churches. And that could leave Girvan North - with its -foot spire – as the last kirk in town. It would presumably also be used as a hub to minister to village churches. The Post understands there can be as few as six worshippers in Barr Parish Church on Sundays. This isn’t helped by Barr being last in the pecking order for services, after Girvan South and Dailly. So it’s virtually lunchtime before a Sunday service gets under way. A Presbytery of Ayr meeting was due in the Carrick Centre in Maybole on Tuesday this week.And the Post understands this will see Rev Ian Stirling Fisherton Kirkoswald appointed interim moderator at Girvan North. Locum minister will be retired minister Rev Edgar Ogston – father of Stephen – who livesin Girvan.The Post has spoken to kirk elders in Girvan who say they’re uncertain about the future. And a retired church minister suspects that the two Girvan churches will be required to amalgamate. He said: “Things are changing. We’ve been a clergy-centred church for  years. “But one positive thing we’re seeing is the rise of worship groups which are prompting people to think about their faith, without necessarily being preached at.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnChurch of ScotlandAyrMoffatGirvan"},{"url":null,"title":"college staging wine fuelled feast","story":"NewsCollege staging wine-fuelled feast as job cuts loomLeaked emails tell of lavish bash at cash-strapped Ayrshire CollegeShareByStephen Houston:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR News\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailCollege bosses have defended holding a celebration to honour their success amid a climate of drastic job cuts and cash problems. Ayrshire College supremos and invited senior staff will stage a sit-down feast later this month to mark five years since its formation. The dinner for  will also include free wine after a sponsored deal by college chairman Willie Mackie. Leaked emails state the claim the college is “now regarded as one of the most successful colleges in Scotland.” But our inside source said: “It adds insult to injury that this celebration is being held less than one week before the final jobs structure is issued to staff. “It is in extremely poor taste given the circumstances of potential job losses due to lack of funds.” Evening classes are having to be cancelled so the event can be staged at the Kilmarnock campus on March . Retiring principal Heather Dunk is also to be honoured during the evening. Chairman Willie Mackie said: “She has made a signicant contribution to Ayrshire for over  years.” Ms Dunk retired on February , leaving an impending restructure which will cost jobs. A consultation ends tomorrowand it has emerged the Private Finance Initiative which built the Kilwinning campus is a huge drain on funds. An email which Ms Dunk sent to staff in January read: “We need to make signicant savings to be financially sustainable due to the costs associated with the PFI, unfunded national bargaining costs and the increasing costs of pensions, utilities and other services. I am very disappointed that an organisational review is necessary, it is not what I want to be focused on in my last weeks as principal. “However, we must manage within the financial allocation we receive in this very dficult fiscal climate.” Under the consultation, one of the four vice-principals would be axed, three directors culled, heads of learning cut from  to nine, and three marketing coms staff would go. Also at risk of the chop are two posts within estates as well as a shake-up of duties among departments. The board of management will approve the final structure and staff impacted will get a severance package. Ayrshire College acknowledged finance was a major challenge for all Scottish colleges but said the dinner costs were met by sponsorship. A spokeswoman said: “Our main financial challenge for the year ahead is to meet the costs associated with the Kilwinning PFI Campus, national bargaining costs and the increasing costs of pensions, utilities and services. “While the Scottish Funding Council has agreed to provide further strategic funds to help manage these rising costs, the college still requires to make signicant savings to secure its financial sustainability and jobs for the future. “We are, therefore, considering proposals for an organisational review. “All staff are aware of the challenges the college faces, and have contributed to a consultation regarding potential efficiencies and opportunities for income generation. “We have just passed our five-year anniversary as Ayrshire College, and have planned an event, ‘Celebrating Five Years of Success. It is important to recognise this milestone and celebrate success – for learners, staff, the college and the region. “We are mindful of the costs of holding such an event and so have secured full sponsorship.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnUniversities and CollegesAyr NewsAyrEducationKilmarnockSchoolsKilwinning"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"first minister must act over","story":"NewsFirst Minister must act over Tarbolton landfill, says MSPThe South of Scotland Tory MSP says he is hearing growing concerns from villagers about the condition of the site.ShareByAyrshire Post:,  MAR NewsBrian Whittle MSP challenges the First Minister in the Scottish Parliament \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMore than eight months after Tarbolton Landfill’s owners entered liquidation, MSP Brian Whittle has challenged the First Minister to act, writes Edwin Lawrence.

In response, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said:   “I am not able to give that information to Brian Whittle right now. “I undertake to raise the issue with the environment secretary and to come back to Brian Whittle as quickly as possible about our understanding of the lines of accountability and the action that the Scottish Government can take to try to reach a resolution of what certainly seems to be a deeply unsatisfactory situation. “I can understand that people in the local area will be very concerned about any prospect of contamination and it is absolutely necessary that all relevant agencies and organisations respond as quickly as possible.” Speaking afterwards, Brian Whittle MSP said: “The situation with the Tarbolton Landfill has been allowed to drag on for too long already. “Aside from the obvious concerns local residents have, it’s troubling that there doesn’t appear to be a clearly defined process for when the operator of a site like this is no longer able to carry out their duties to protect the surrounding environment. “I hope the First Minister will be able to provide some much needed clarity on this issue.” "},{"url":null,"title":"giant bins placed right outside","story":"NewsGiant bins placed right outside a restaurant and pub in scenic townAnger in Troon as bin squad set up town corral without asking anyone for permissionShareByStephen Houston:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR News \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA council works gang put up a new big bin enclosure – right outside a restaurant and pub in the scenic centre of town. Now a row has broken out after it emerged one council department had not even bothered to speak to another. The unsightly corral cluster for five bins was secured in place near The Cross in Troon without any consultation. Troon Councillors have now become aware after a multitude of complaints. The cleansing department is claiming they contacted the planning department about the placing of the bins. But planners are denying any knowledge of a consultation. Troon SNP Councillor Craig Mackay is now leading the charge to find somewhere  for the bins to be situated, rather than outside the Jade Garden Chinese and Macintyre’s bar. He is asking for officials to meet councillors at the spot in Templehill to try and find a resolution. Councillor Mackay said: “We are trying to develop a coherent vision for our town centre. “I’m not convinced this is the best we can manage for such a high profile location. Cleansing regrettably installed these enclosures without any prior consultation. While it is arguably an operational matter that doesn’t require any such input,they had asked any of the councillors or the community council for comment then I am certain we would not have found ourselves in this situation. “The council’s Planning service disappointingly also appear not to have been consulted on the siting or design of this bin store within the conservation area. I don’t wish to play departments off against each other, but would seek to find a community consensus about what is appropriate for our public realm. “This will almost certainly involve an alternative solution for the bins.” A council spokesman confirmed they are investigating, saying: ““We introduced communal bins to keep the litter secure and away from gulls. The early indications are that this system is working well, however we are currently reviewing the location of the bins.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnScottish National PartyTroonAyrAyr News"},{"url":null,"title":"look out sooty sweep heading","story":"NewsLook out, Sooty and Sweep are heading to AyrStage show insists laughs will come thick and fast at Ayr GaietyShareByStephen Houston:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR News \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailSooty is set to SWEEP into Ayr next month. The wee silent man will be on stage with his squeeky pal Sweep and chatterbox Soo. TheirRichard Cadell will lead events at The Gaiety in Ayr on April . It’s being billed as a brand new Laugh Out Loud Magic Show. Sooty takes to the air in a flying car, Soo has a singing unicorn and Sweep has something altogether dferent. He has a levitating sausage, which certainly creates a vision. Special guests circus star Michael Jordan and the ultraviolet specialties of Fantasie de la Nuit promise a thrilling -minute show. Tickets are between pound and pound and there are two shows – am and .pm. Sooty has celebrated his th birthday and Richard says he’s still as young as ever. Richard revealed: “This show is Sooty doing what he does best – magic. “So the Gaiety audience can expect to be saying ‘Izzy whizzy let’s get busy’ a great deal. “Sooty will be performing some amazing tricks including sawing a lady in half, floating a child from the audience and making it snow. “Sweep will be getting in the way with his own disastrous magic tricks most of which revolve around sausages.” He added: “Performing live is what we love most. Of course, making the television show is a lot of fun but Sooty has always been at his best in front of a live audience where he can make not only the children laugh, but all the adults too. Plus after each performance there is a chance for everybody to meet Sooty and it’s always such a pleasure to meet fans old and new.” Sooty and Sweep performed for Prince Charles for his th birthday. Richard added: “I think it was possibly the highlight of Sooty’s career. It was just an amazing experience to be there at the London Palladium at the request of Prince Charles. “It turns out that Sooty and Sweep have always been personal favourites of the Prince. We also received a lovely personal letter saying how much he had enjoyed Sooty and Sweep’s performance. You have to remember that the royals were also children once and Sooty brought magic to their childhood too.” Book for the show at the Gaiety Box Office  .Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr NewsTheatre"},{"url":null,"title":"jim-clark-rally-could-return-this-spring","story":"ORGANISERS of the Jim Clark Rally are confident the race willto the roads of the Borders this spring.And they have pencilled in the weekend of May  and .The rally has not taken place since the tragic deaths of three people in .Elizabeth Allan, , Iain Provan, , and Len Stern, , were all killed as a car left the road near Coldstream.Major reviews have since taken place into safety surrounding closed road rally events as well as a fatal accident enquiry.The Scottish Government is now looking at afor both the Jim Clark Rally and the Isle of Mull Rally by bringing legislation into line with the other parts of the UK.A spokesman for the Jim Clark Rally told us: \"We have been maintaining contact and continued working with Scottish Borders Council and Police Scotland in hopeful anticipation that rallying couldsooner rather than later.\"Arrangements and plans are already in place to facilitate a quick resumption of the sport on completion of the parliamentary process.\"Potential rally competitors, officials, volunteers and fans right across the UK are therefore advised to pencil in two important dates, May  and  , and plan their routes to the eastern Scottish Borders.\"With a bit of luck and goodwill, it should soon be possible to allow all those interested to confirm their diary date in ink.\"The recently concluded Public Consultation by the government on the new proposals proved there was an overwhelming desire for awith  percent of all replies being positive."},{"url":null,"title":"extending-borders-railway-among-21-options-to-improve-transport","story":"EXTENDING the Borders Railway line and putting on extra buses to the BGH are two of the options being considered to help shape the future of transport in the region.In a report published today, The Borders Transport Corridors Study outlined  options that could bring benefits to the area.And they include proposals for better bus links to health centres and neighbouring cities as well as the partial dualling of the A and A roads.Cabinet secretary for transport, infrastructure and connectivity Michael Matheson said: \"The Borders Transport Corridors Study fulfils our commitment to consider the future transport needs of the area.\"We have already committed to rail stations at East Linton and Reston and these will be delivered as part of work to improve capacity to Edinburgh.

This was his first goal for the Pupils and just reward for his perseverance.It was good to see two teenagers making their mark for the club, with Ross Brown joining his academy teammate MacBrayne in a fine first half performance on opposite flanks of midfield.Nevertheless, the home side ‘stole’ into the lead in the st minute, a comic-cut situation that saw Ellis Robertson unbelievably penalised for stumbling over his own heels.The resultant free kick was delivered with venom and a headed deflection thundered into the net to restore the home side’s lead.The setback was short-lived as almost immediately the in-form Donald McCallum cut inside past two defenders to drive the ball high into the roof of the net for a superb equaliser.This heralded the Pupils# best spell of the match, with Ross Brown ending a great move with a volley that left the keeper rooted to the spot.But the goal, arguably the best of the match, was ruled out for offside.Ryan McConnachie was next to try his luck with an audacious overhead kick that just cleared the bar.Lady luck deserted the cause when the referee awarded a soft penalty kick to home club.The visitors were a goal behind despite dominating most of the second half.With  minutes remaining the league leaders looked to have sealed the points when a tactical long throw was forced home to give ‘the Port’ a two goal advantage.However, in an exciting end to another close fought match, Lee Allen scored a towering header from a Donald McCallum corner to make the score -.Despite a great effort in the closing minutes, the Pupils couldn’t score to get their just reward.Having played well and given everything, the visitors ed home with nothing to show for their efforts.TomorrowCampbeltown Pupilsto home action with another dficult match against third-placed Hillington at Kintyre Park with a pm kick off.  See social media and posters for confirmation of venue.Fraser MacBrayne in action earlier this season at Kintyre Park. _cpupils"},{"url":null,"title":"letter 1949 play about europe","story":"Courier readers may be as amused as I was to discover at the commemorative exhibition in Aqualibrium that the winner of the first Kintyre Drama Festival, back in , was Highland Church Drama Club.The club won with a play entitled #Sad about Europe#.

After his first two space launch attempts ended in failure, it is no surprise that Elon Musk#s SpaceX recently took a dummy to the International Space Station.Solo ocean crossings in a sailing boat are another example of a sport that seems too risky to many.Free Solo tells of Honnold#s perfectionism but ultimately he relies on  practice, friction, magnesium carbonate chalk for his sweaty palms and his wits.Throughout the ascent, and the preamble which leads to it, including romance and his girlfriend#s struggle #to understand#, Honnold is filmed by his friends, some of whom cannot bear to watch the final solo.Extreme solo feats have existed as long as humans. The marathon developed in Ancient Greece as a solo running challenge and people still die in the st century emulating those barefoot warriors.Climbing and mountaineering has a long history of solo risk taking and many of its protagonists live relatively short lives.Some though, such as legendary Italian Walter Bonatti, were hard wired for solitary ascents. He shot to fame in the s with a solo ascent of a climb on the Dru, renamed the Bonatti Pillar, in the French alps.Bonatti finished his hard climbing career in  with a solo in winter of the north face of the Matterhorn for the centenary of that mountain#s first attempt. He passed away, aged , in bed.Up till Free Solo, many films about climbing have only been of real interest to climbers and have not made it into mainstream cinema.Using the latest techniques including drones, remote cameras, huge telephoto lenses on digital cameras from the valley floor and cameras wielded by dangling climbers has created a National Geographic movie which has transfixed audiences.Even climbers emerge after an-hour-and-a-half with sweaty palms after the glimpse into Honnold#s seemingly nihilistic world.A still of Alex Honnold during his climb.

That needs to change.In my profession, on the set of a Hollywood movie,actors don’t listen to each other, the scene doesn’t work.The same applies in real le – it’s about taking the time to understand dferent points of view and showing respect.Good listening is vital at both home and at work.

Less generous pension schemes have to stretch further as people are living for longer post-retirement.ldquoAuto-enrolment is welcome, but will not solve the basic problem of low levels of pension saving.ldquoWe would urge everyone to seek free, impartial and confidential advice from their local Citizens Advice Bureau, so they can make informed choices and plan effectively for their retirement.Mr Holmyard added that CAS is also becoming more aware of people dipping into their pension pots while working as a result of falling into debt.ldquoOur advisers are also increasingly hearing from people who are considering accessing their pension funds to solve debt problems, at the expense of their retirement income, which of course brings the risk of long-term financial problems, he said.Age Scotland argued that Scots should be offered a ldquocareer MOT at age  to allow them to ldquomake informed choices about training, pensions provision and future career options.Brian Sloan, chief executive of the charity, said: ldquoRight now more than half of older people age  and over have not retired because they arenrsquot ready to stop working.ldquoHowever, itrsquos worrying to hear that more than six out of  Scots donrsquot think their state pension will financially support them through retirement and that more than half do not have any plans to

workers is increasing faster in Scotland than the rest of the UK and called for employers to do more to support them.ldquoIt makes sense to invest in older workers, who bring a wealth of experience and skills and can provide valuable mentoring to younger generations, he said.The new full state pension is currently pound. per week, however the actual amount you get depends on your national insurance record.Under current UK Government plans, the state pension age will eventually extend to  for both men and women.However, the Censuswide survey showed that  per cent of Scots believe it will continue to increase beyond this.The data also revealed that more than a quarter of Scots do not have a private pension, with this breaking down into  per cent of men, compared to  per cent of women.Of those Scots who do have plans in place to support themselves financially in retirement, the majority plan to use savings to fund their lestyle, while others plan to sell their homes or other assets.Jordan Ferguson, of Censuswide Scotland, said: ldquoOur research indicates that Scots, of all ages, have growing number of concerns about their retirement.ldquoThe younger respondents polled

is completely contrary to the Scotland that people want to build and we should reject those tests. We need to fund our NHS, our schools, our local authorities, build infrastructure and homes. We need to build the Scotland we want and we should not give that vision up.The Commissionrsquos six tests would assess whether Scotlandrsquos economic record was credible and sustainable whether markets had faith in a new Scottish Central Bank and its ability to issue debt whether the public and business wanted it whether Scotland had adequate reserves whether it would improve trade and whether Scotlandrsquos economic cycle was ldquosignicantly out of phase with that of the rest of the UK to make it ldquofeasible and desirable.Andrew Wilson, the former SNP MSP who authored the Commission, said explaining these tests to voters before a second referendum was an ldquoabsolute necessity.But Mr Kerevan said: ldquoThe views of international markets and corporations should always fall behind that of the people.

The reason for keeping everyone on their pins soon became clear.First, Ms S explained the rules. There was a pot containing  coloured balls. If one team picked a ball belonging to another team and answered a question correctly, the ball was taken out of play. Last ball remaining would win the jackpot of pound.

It is therefore unsurprising that barn owls in the north of Scotland have a hard time during the winter months, with peak mortality rates being between December and March due to starvation.As temperatures start to drop in winter, small mammals become less active, meaning a lot less food is available for barn owls, and they need to work extra-hard to find it. This often results in the owls being forced to feed during daylight, even though they are naturally nocturnal hunters.This lack of food is particularly dangerous for barn owls as they are poorly insulated and need more food in winter to provide them with enough energy to stay warm.The Barn Owl Trust estimates that between  and  barn owls are killed each year on UK roads.RSPB Scotland site manager Dave Jones recently sent a deceased barn owl to the Scottish Agricultural College in Thurso for autopsy, when some concerned neighbours reported it after finding it at the roadside.The results of the autopsy showed that the bird was fit and healthy, \"in good shape and hunting successfully\", and that the death followed trauma to its wing and abdomen ndash suggesting that the bird died as a result of being hit by a vehicle.Dave said: \"It is extremely sad to discover that a fit and healthy birds le ended in this way.

Its not all doom and gloom, though.

If you see a road casualty and it is safe to do so, please stop and report the find to your local wildle officer and to the Barn Owl Trust.

And in the event of closure the permanent collection would revert to the Highland Council.\"Councillor Mackie says the local authority should explore alternative operating models and wants \"a cast iron commitment to ensure our countys heritage stays in Caithness for future generations.\"Ian Leith, chairman of the Wick Society, which runs Wick Heritage Museum in the townrsquos Bank Row, described the closure of Caithness Horizons as \"a great loss\".\"From a heritage point of view it is certainly important, particularly its collection which should not be broken up and dispersed,\" he said.Mr Leith emphasised that the heritage groups in Caithness are not in competition \"but telling parts of the same story\". He said: Caithness Horizons had its part to play. Now its gone it is a great loss, but hopefully it can be retrieved.\"He said the Thurso museum and gallery had \"very dedicated and very experienced staff\".Mr Leith added: \"It is too important to lose, particularly its heritage collection which has a national signicance. If it was broken up it would dilute the story. Whatever the future holds, the collection must be retained.\"Tuesday  Mar  : AM"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04119000/04119838.jpg","title":"Slow progress on old church","story":"A COUPLE who want to transform a derelict church in Castletown into their home say their plans are \"progressing slowly\".Angus Cowap and Dr Heather Davis purchased the th century church near the village primary school from Highland Council a year ago and have been \"clearing a lot of rubbish\" from the site but are now preparing for the next stage of the project.Mr Cowap said numerous consultations, studies and negotiations have been carried out and the proposals are beginning to take shape.The couple, who moved to the village three years ago, plan to replace the ruined roof and put some solar  on the south face of the building, re-glaze the windows and construct a double garage and a conservatory sun room.\"Internally, we will strip out the ruined fabric and make a simple open-plan living space,\" Mr Cowap said, stressing it will be a long-term project.He and Dr Davis moved north when she joined a medical practice in Thurso.They have spent some time clearing trees which were in danger of undermining the structure and have been shting rubbish, including rusty old cars and vehicle parts, from around the site.The church is believed to date back to  and was used by the RAF as a mess hall in World War II.

It is shameful that it has taken a fiasco like this for the Scottish Government to sit up and take notice.\"Thankfully, the mother and both babies are healthy and we must thank the local NHS staff for their excellent work.\"However, this is a situation that neither the mother nor the staff should have been put in and we desperately need action from the Scottish Government.\"Geography and distance should not be something expectant mothers have to deal with and the government must accept that no-one should lack access to health services simply because of where they live.\"He spoke out after the womans ordeal was made public. She went to Caithness General Hospital in Wick in November after her waters broke when she was  weeks pregnant.It was decided she should go by ambulance to Raigmore in Inverness, over  miles away, to have her babies.But as she was near Golspie, her contractions became stronger and she was taken to the local community hospital, the Lawson Memorial, where she gave birth to a boy.A helicopter was then to take the woman to the Highland capital but was unable to land due to frost on its propellers so she made the rest of the journey by ambulance and gave birth to the second twin.Labours Rhoda Grant raised the case in parliament and claimed the air ambulance should have been called when the woman went into labour.She asked: \"It begs the question why was the air ambulance or emergency retrieval team not tasked initially to airlt the mum from Caithness \"Will the First Minister investigate this and will she make sure that the air ambulance treats situations like this as a priority \"Nicola Sturgeon promised to investigate and asked Scotlands health secretary, Jeane Freeman, to look into it.Bill Fernie, the chairman of Chat, said the case highlighted the groups concerns about mothers having to travel to Inverness to give birth.\"Fortunately, we have not had a tragedy yet and hopefully we never will ndash but this underlines the fears we have had since the changes were made to the local maternity unit. There has been no risk assessment for the people who have to travel to Raigmore to have their babies.\"There has never been a problem with care at Caithness General or Raigmore, but mothers here should get the same kind of access to treatment as they get in the cities and we used to have here.

We have been sharing information to help the sector prepare for that scenario.#However, Mr Carmichael is standing by his claims, saying behind the scenes analysis is a totally dferent level of depth than the full impact assessment expected to be done on such a massive change.He has branded conservative ministers #woefully irresponsible# for #failing to safeguard the sector from the impact of Brexit.#Speaking while making his claims, earlier in the week, prior to the response from DEFRA, Mr Carmichael said: #When Conservatives think of farmers, they think of the big landowners and the estates This [FOI] response shows that they have no interest in, or concern for, the hill farmers and crofters whose businesses are the backbone of so many of our remote rural communities.#To run their business, farmers need certainty. They need to know what funding is available, what standards must be met and what tarfs need to be paid.#It is therefore appalling that Conservative ministers have failed to conduct an impact assessment on the impact of Brexit on sheep farming. These ministers are woefully irresponsible. Farmers deserve better.#“Behind the scenes analysis falls well short of the in-depth impact assessment that farmers and crofters deserve. It is like not doing your homework, but trying to cover the fact by saying that you put together a mind map. Simply unacceptable. By the government’s own admission, they have done nothing, and know of no work to do an impact assessment on the industry.“They have let the industry, and our farming and crofting communities down.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He questioned Minister for Public Finance, Kate Forbes MSP, in the Scottish Parliament earlier this afternoon, Wednesday, asking how this shortfall squares with the government’s commitment to the principle of fair funding for our leline internal ferry services.According to the Orkney MSP, the minister responded by saying that the government recognise the challenges in running these ferry services and that they have been clear in their budget that adequate funding is to be delivered.Commenting after the exchange, Mr McArthur said: “We now know that the Scottish Government has cut funding for Orkney’s internal ferry services by £, compared to last year.  This has left a £.m shortfall in the Council’s budget for delivering these leline services.#It is baffling how Ministers think this approach is consistent with their commitment to the principle of fair ferry funding.  It certainly flies in the face of the will of parliament, which voted for the government to deliver on its earlier promises.“Meantime, the island communities that rely on these leline services are left picking up the tab, including a three per cent increase in fares this year.  Ministers may ‘recognise’ the challenges of running these services, but they also must recognise their obligations genuinely to provide adequate funding.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It’s interesting because, no matter where I go, these are the three predominant issues, and they are all related.”There are around  EIS members in Orkney.On Monday, EIS members voted to reject a new pay offer.According to Mr Ramsey, the next step will be to hold a ballot on industrial action, although the union remains open to further negotiation.“Assuming that our members decide to vote for a strike, there will be two or three weeks before that goes through,” the vice-president explained.“We intend to continue to negotiate. We realise that teachers don’t want to strike — they do not do this lightly. We have even made a decision not to strike during the SQA exams.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

FACT: Scotland has a mandate to pursue independence.” Ignoring the obvious hood that the SNP is not Scotland and cannot speak for it, it is important to establishthe Scottish people – whom the SNP says are sovereign – have authorised a second referendum in pursuit of independence. It will, after all, be upon the back of any such mandate that denial of the legal process of a Section  order from Westminster will be turned into the mother of all grievances.The chronology for the SNP claim starts six years ago when, in January , David Cameron promised a referendum on EU membershiphe were to command a majority following the  general election. As the Conservatives were in coalition with the Liberal Democrats, the party published in June  a private member’s Bill to emphasise its intentions. It passed its first and second readings in the Commons but was stopped in the House of Lords.When the  Scottish independence referendum came along the following year, there could be no doubt in anyone’s mind that a referendum to leave the EU could take place and that it would be possible for the UK to vote to leave. Nor could there be any doubt that it would be an issue for the UK to decide as the member state – and so Scottish voters might take a dferent view from the rest of the UK electorate.Indeed, so likely was this scenario to become reality that during the independence referendum the Scottish Government warned Scottish voters that remaining in the UK could mean Scotland would leave the EU against their will. It was also clear during that referendum that, were Scots to choose independence, Scotland would leave the EU the same day that it left the UK – which was being suggested by the SNP would take place before the next general election. By the SNP’s own words, it is beyond challenge that the “circumstances” of the  referendum were that the SNP was willing to take Scotland out of the EU as a price for achieving independence, and that, were Scotland to remain in the UK, it might still leave the EU later, irrespective of how Scots voted. Scots voted to stay with the UK.Once the Conservatives’  general election victory arrived, it was announced that the promised referendum would take place in June  and would be a UK-wide decision.Nicola Sturgeon, by then First Minister, had the opportunity to put at the centre of her May  Holyrood election campaign a promise to hold a second independence referendum. Instead she relegated the idea as a priority, burying it on page  with the caveat there would need to be “a signicant and material change in the circumstances that prevailed in , such as Scotland being taken out of the EU against our will”.The Scottish public was by then getting fed-up with Sturgeon’s fixation with holding a second referendum and in May  she lost the SNP’s overall majority. The unionist parties won . per cent of the constituency vote. Together this meanteven her caveat was rejected – she had no moral or legal claim and no public mandate to hold a referendum.The next month the UK voted to leave the EU, but a majority of Scots preferred that the UK should stay. This has been claimed ever since as a “material change” of circumstances that justies the SNP Government demanding the authority to call a second independence referendum. Only it is no such thing.As I have explained above, the possibility of the UK leaving the EU with the majority of Scots opposed was already well known and foreseen the fact that it materialised was not therefore a change – the circumstance had always been there. Furthermore, the SNP had advocated the very same outcome as the price of Scottish independence two years before . The following June, we then had the  general election, by which time Sturgeon had gone on, and on, and on about a second referendum. The result was her party lost . per cent of votes and  MPs. There could be no doubt that with some . per cent of votes going to unionist parties the Scottish public was in no mood for another referendum – be it about Scotland in the UK or the UK in the EU. It is said there is a mandate because the Scottish Parliament passed a motion in favour of being able to hold a referendum, but MSPs voting for their own policies does not make it a mandate from the Scottish people.There is a way round the claims and counter-claims about the existence of a mandate for a second independence referendum. All Sturgeon has to do is go to the country. She can call time on her minority administration and hold fresh parliamentary elections to show once and for all that the Scottish people will not put up with being “dragged” out of the EU. Every party will need to state, for the avoidance of doubt,they will subsequently vote in Holyrood to call a referendum.If Sturgeon is then able to form a new administration, with or without the support of the Greens, she will have an unimpeachable claim that a Section  order to hold a legal referendum should be granted. Westminster would find it dficult to deny one in such circumstances. If Sturgeon is defeated then a new administration could be formed – but without the prospect of a referendum dominating every issue to the detriment of Scotland’s governance.So, what’s it to be, First Minister  Will you put your faith in your fellow Scots to back you ©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"brexit theresa may secures legally binding eu deal","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Prime Minister Theresa May insists she has secured #legally binding# changes to the Brexit deal which ensure the Irish backstop cannot be permanent.Following last-ditch talks in Strasbourg ahead of a crunch Commons vote on Tuesday, Mrs May said she has now delivered what Parliament asked her to do.The PM said she “passionately believed” her Brexit deal addressed concerns raised by MPs who feared the backstop would keep the UK in a customs arrangement with the EU indefinitely.: Downing Street says Brexit vote will go ahead despite uncertaintyAt a joint press conference with European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, Mrs May said the three new documents agreed provided the legal assurances critics of her stance had called for.: Poll: Scottish independence more popular than Theresa May’s Brexit dealThe PM said: “What we have secured is very clearly that the backstop cannot be indefinite. Cannot become permanent. It is only temporary. If it is the case that we were ever to get into the backstop.“The legal instrument that we have agreed is an addition to the Withdrawal Agreement. It has the same legal status as the Withdrawal Agreement. It is legally binding.“That is what Parliament asked us to secure and that is what we have secured.”Mrs May added: “MPs were clear that legal changes were needed to the backstop. Today we have secured legal changes.“Now is the time to come together to back this improved Brexit deal and to deliver on the instruction of the British people.”The legal view of the changes taken by Attorney General Geoffrey Cox will be an important factor in the lead-up to the Commons vote.Mrs May said: “The Attorney General is independent. He will come to his decision. He will publish his legal opinion.”The European Commission president insisted there would be no further negotiations on the issue.Mr Juncker said: “There will be no new negotiations. It is this.“In politics, sometimes you get a second chance. It is what we do with the second chance that counts. Because there will be no third chance.“There will be no further interpretation of the interpretations and no further assurances on the reassurances.“Let us be crystal clear about the choice - it is this deal or Brexit might not happen at all.”Mrs May believes the three new documents agreed with Mr Juncker will give MPs the legally-binding reassurances they require to approve her Withdrawal Agreement and Political Declaration on the future EU UK relationship.The Commons motion the PM wants MPs to back describes the first new document as “the legally binding joint instrument” relating to the Withdrawal Agreement.The Government states that the document “reduces the risk that the UK could be deliberately held in the Northern Ireland backstop indefinitely and commits the UK and EU to work to replace the backstop with alternative arrangements by December ”.The second new document is branded a “unilateral declaration by the UK” which sets out “the sovereign action the UK would take to provide assurance that the backstop would only be applied temporarily”.The final document is a supplement to the Political Declaration “setting out commitments by the UK and the EU to expedite the negotiation and bringing into force of their future relationship”.If the package passes the Commons, leaders of the  remaining EU states will be asked to endorse the new documents at a scheduled European Council summit in Brussels on March -, before the final step of ratication by the European Parliament.Mr Juncker said he had spoken to Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, who he said had indicated he was “prepared to back this approach in the interests of an overall deal”.Mrs May’s dash to Strasbourg came amid predictions the Prime Minister was headed for a second humiliating defeat on her Withdrawal Agreement and it remains to be seenthe concessions will be enough to see it pass through Parliament.The DUP has pledged to carefully analyse the Brexit deal add-ons, remaining non-committal on whether it would now back the Withdrawal Agreement.Deputy leader Nigel Dodds told the Commons “all of this will need to be taken together and analysed very carefully”.The DUP position could be crucial in Tuesday’s Westminster debate, and not only because of the votes of its  MPs.The party’s position on the border backstop could also influence how some Tory Brexiteers approach the issue.Jacob Rees-Mogg, chairman of the European Research Group, told the BBC: “It’s too early to tell definitively, but it’s clearly a step in the right direction.“It’s important to see the details, but the DUP’s support would be a very important and signicant factor.”The Prime Minister’s de facto deputy David Lidington said that the new documents gave “confirmation that the EU cannot try to trap the UK in the backstop indefinitely and that doing so would be an explicit breach of the legally-binding commitments that both sides have agreed”.But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn dismissed the move and called on MPs to reject the deal.He said: “The Prime Minister’s negotiations have failed.“This evening’s agreement with the European Commission does not contain anything approaching the changes Theresa May promised Parliament, and whipped her MPs to vote for.“Since her Brexit deal was so overwhelmingly rejected, the Prime Minister has recklessly run down the clock, failed to effectively negotiate with the EU and refused to find common ground for a deal Parliament could support.”The -strong Independent Group of MPs has tabled an amendment to force the PM to seek an extension of Article  to hold a so-called People’s Vote before the end of September.In a letter to EU Council president Donald Tusk, Mr Juncker left the option of an extension to Article , but only by a could of months.He said: “I would like to stress that the United Kingdom’s withdrawal should be complete before the European elections that will take place between -

a hike of almost  per cent from the forecast four years ago, of eight billion barrels.The figures were greeted by the SNP as “great news”, which “confirmed the major economic potential that North Sea oil reserves have to offer” and raised a new demand for a Scottish oil fund.But the Scottish Conservatives said that it was the tax policies of the UK government which had encouraged investment in the North Sea, and that there was no appetite for independence in Scotland.: Scottish schoolboy stabbed at lunchtime near to secondary schoolOil revenues formed a large part of the Yes case for independence during the  referendum, with former First Minister Alex Salmond claiming that there were up to  billion barrels of oil still to be extracted and Scotland would experience a “second oil boom”.However, after the No vote a slump in the global oil price reduced tax revenues to virtually zero - prompting the Scottish Government to scrap its own Oil and Gas Bulletin, which had been the official report on the health of the industry.According to the OGA, its revised figures were driven by lower production costs, technical advances and  new oil fields coming on stream. Head of performance, planning and reporting at the OGA, Loraine Pace, said: “The . billion barrels identied is great news with  being a productive year. New discoveries such as Glendronach and Glengorm highlight the future potential of the basin which could be boosted further with new investment, exploration successes and resource progression.”The regulator, reporting to the Treasury ahead of the chancellor’s spring statement, said oil output last year was up . per cent last year, the highest UK oil production rate since .Maureen Watt, Aberdeen South SNP MSP, said: “This is great news for our oil and gas industry. However, we must not be complacent and allow for Scotland’s revenues to be used to cover the costs of Tory tax cuts for rich.“A portion of oil revenues should be invested in a fund for future generations, as most other oil-producing countries have done – something which will ensure there is a positive economic and social legacy from our oil wealth.“Of course with a host of industries booming across Scotland, like our food and tourism sectors, Scotland is a hugely wealthy country even without oil and gas. But the only way to ensure that Scotland’s valuable natural resources are invested here in Scotland, and not squandered by Westminster, is through independence.”However Colin Clark, Scottish Conservative MP for Gordon, said the SNP had “learned nothing from recent history”.“Whenever there is a boost in production, we are all expected to believe independence is nigh. Yet when there is a downturn, it is the UK Government that must absorb the drop in revenue. - Tribunal rules that councillor’s views on Scottish independence are ‘philosophical belief’“The Scottish people rejected independence when oil was  a barrel – they are unlikely to change that view at .“The fact is that the policies of this Conservative government have kept taxes stable and encouraged investment in the North Sea. We are seeing the results of that in these very welcome production figures today.”Scottish Labour’s energy spokesperson, Lewis Macdonald said: “This uptick in forecasts is welcome and both the Tory and the SNP governments must do the upmost to protect jobs in the North Sea. Almost , jobs were lost due to the collapse in oil prices since  and the response from both governments was nowhere near good enough.“Instead of going back to the fantasies of the referendum campaign, the SNP should focus on supporting the jobs and prospects we actually have in this vital sector of the economy.”While UK oil production rose last year, gas production fell by three per cent. The total is expected to fall from this year onwards, but at a slower rate than previously forecast.Capital expenditure also fell for the fourth successive year, although this trend is expected to be reversed in .©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"royal mile treasure trove of mary queen of scots documents found","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...A treasure trove of documents signed by Mary Queen of Scots and revealing the #everyday reality of ruling the country# in the th century has been unearthed in a council storage facility on the Royal Mile.A haul of handwritten papers is said to show the doomed monarch “carefully managing the busy commercial le of Edinburgh”, as well as authorising the building of new defences for the city in Leith.The documents, which are set to be the centrepiece of a new exhibition in Edinburgh on Mary’s short-lived rule, have already been conserved and digitised to allow them to be viewed publicly on the council’s online archive.

But we hope to have them assessed by a conservator and for further research to be done on them by experts on Mary, after which we hope to exhibit them, which will be hugely exciting.”Museums and galleries manager Frank Little said: “We’re constantly reviewing, caring for and researching our collections, and look forward to sharing more of the city’s rich heritage with residents and visitors through our programme of exhibitions and online activities.” Council culture convener Donald Wilson said: “Our museums and galleries hold thousands of historic treasures, many of which are on display in our venues.

They provide assurances a companys owners have the wherewithal to honour bills.\"Yet, just two months after the directors of Cairngorm Mountain Ltd signed it off as a going concern for another year, it went into administration owing money to at least  businesses, many of the them local.\"Its time that the four directors of CML were investigated and that the ultimate owner of the company, David Michael Gorton, who provided the assurances to the auditor was held to account.\"He continued: \"This follows four years during which they have been only too happy to see money taken out of Cairngorm Mountain through the large management fees paid to Natural Retreats ndash their main money spinner ndash out of which the CML directors paid themselves most generously.\"This was to the tune of pound, in the last accounts of the UK Travel Company to  shared between three directors.\"Latest papers filed with Companies House last week have revealed there were no requests for a creditors meeting.It will now be for the administrators Campbell Dallas to distribute the proceeds from the pound, sale of the business to Highlands and Islands Enterprise and other assets that were owned by CML.Just over pound, of that will be in fees to the administrators meaning it is highly likely not all of the creditors will be repaid in full.A signicant proportion of the debts ndash some pound, is owed to Natural Retreats-related companies ndash but the rest will have implications for the local economy.Amongst local firms still owed money according to the documents are the Spey Valley Hire Centre, David Ritchie  Sons Ltd, BSW Sawmills, Colin Baxter Photography Ltd and McGowan Ltd.Starbucks, EDF Energy and Screwfix Direct are also amongst the creditors while chartered surveyors Graham and Sibbald are still owed pound,.Rural Economy Secretary and Strathspey MSP Fergus Ewing said everyone is working hard to \"address and mitigate the adverse impact on the local economy\". He said: \"We are sure the administrators will do all they can to try and ensure that creditors, particularly small local companies, are promptly paid.\"Badenoch MSP Kate Forbessaid: \"This shows once again how critically important Cairngorm Mountain is to the wider strath. Thats also why its such a relief the resort has a future with operators that appreciate the local impact.\"I can fully understand why there will be concerns amongst local businesses as they await the outcome of this process. I regularly ask HIE for updates to ensure the local community and economy are front and centre of all decisions they make.\"Regional MSP Edward Mountainsaid: \"I am hugely disappointed that businesses in the Highlands have been left out of pocket and this matter should be investigated fully.\"I strongly believe that the management structure of Cairngorm Mountain that has been used in recent years is not fit for purpose.\"A spokesman for Campbell Dallas, said investigating the conduct of directors is a statutory requirement in every insolvency. He commented: \"The content of the conductsubmitted to the Insolvency Service must remain confidential. As such, the joint administrators are unable to comment any further.\"The Strathy tried to contact Natural Retreats but got no response. The creditor balances were obtained by the administrators from CML records and can dfer from actual claims.Tuesday  Mar  : AM"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Portree-resort-main.jpg","title":"name chosen for skye resort following cash prize","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe hotel will be situated on the site of the former golf course on the Struan Road in Portree.After receiving close to  entries, Mr Charles Garton Jones # a London-based property developer who also owns the Cow Shed, a boutique bunkhouse in Uig # picked the winning name # #The Bracken Hide#, which was submitted by Skeabost resident Ian Williams.“In all, we had nearly  suggestions,” said Mr Garton Jones. “It was great fun going through them and narrowing them down, but there was one that stood out from the crowd. #The Bracken Hide#, we thought, conveyed a lovely feeling of exploring the wilderness.”Mr Williams, who received a cheque for £ for his winning suggestion, said the idea was prompted by a photo of the resort which sparked a memory from his childhood.

Over the last few weeks KPL staff have been busy ferrying equipment, supplies and crews out to it as part of the first such contract secured by the yard. During a visit, I expected to find a hive of activity the roar and clang of big machines.But on Thursday of last week I found the whole site surprisingly quiet. This, I am told, is because most of the activity is now taking place onboard what KPL directors refer to as the OGW.“The rig is crawling with insurance people and regulators right now,” says one of the directors, Simon Russell, as he shows me round. “They are all signing off their bits and pieces before the rig gets the final piece of paper that says it’s good to go.”Every weld is being stress tested. Every item of equipment is being put through its paces.Before the rig can face the punishing swells of the north Atlantic, such attention to detail is a matter of le and death.There are also inquisitive guests onboard, doing a little window shopping. They’ve been helicoptered straight on to the rig, the property of US firm Diamond Offshore. These VIPs are potential customers from major players such as Tarka Oil, here to see what the buzz is all about. While doing so, they may also be mightily impressed with Kishorn Port Ltd. That is the hope, anyway.As you are reading this, there is a good chance the Ocean GreatWhite, with a crew of  aboard, will be making its way back up the Minch. If the weather is favourable it may even be doing so under its own steam, without the need for a fleet of tugs to tow it to the Blackrock prospect, some  miles north west of Shetland.So advanced is the OGW that each corner-leg contains two enormous thrusters, powered by engines capable of generating , brake horse power of thrust. For non-petrol-heads that’s  Ferraris per engine. A top speed of eight knots is the result. Not bad for a structure that isn’t exactly designed to cut through the water. Stability is the name of game: even in the roughest seas the thrusters are meant to ensure that the rig doesn’t deviate by more than a metre from the drill point. West of Shetland, it may need every Newton of force those thrusters can provide. Once safely in place, the Ocean GreatWhite will be used by Siccar Point Energy and Shell UK to test for oil in an unexplored area of the seabed.“This is really cutting edge stuff,” enthuses Alasdair Ferguson, the other director in this   venture involving his own firm, Ferguson Transport and Shipping, and Simon’s LeithsLtd. “The rig can operate in , feet of water and drill a hole , feet deep.”In other words, that’s six miles into the earth’s crust. This is how far down we now have to go to get the black stuff. As the ‘Age of Oil’ wanes, rigs like the OGW could become the workhorses of the near future.However, the days of building giant concrete caissons to support them are long gone. Whatever finished products emerge from Kishorn in the next few years, another Ninian Central will not be among them. Deep water is where the action is – and that means floating oil rigs like the Ocean GreatWhite, a sixth-generation model designed specically to harvest the hard-to-reach hydrocarbons that now makes up much of what the UK still produces. Thankfully for Kishorn, that means west of Shetland.  According to Simon, this trend involves the “centre of gravity” shting away from Aberdeen and towards the west coast.KPL is ready and waiting for that trend to continue.“The same thing is happening with offshore wind,” says Simon. “If you look at the next round of Crown licenses you’ll see that most of them are here on the west coast.”“We want to create a multi-use facility,” adds Alasdair. “We want to build resilience into this facility so that it is not reliant on any one industry.”Offshore wind turbines need concrete caissons, albeit smaller than the Ninian Central’s. That’s another box ticked in favour of Kishorn.From about  metres away, the Ocean GreatWhite does indeed look like a floating hotel, to use Simon’s description. Unfortunately, this is as close as we are allowed to get. Obtaining insurance cover for non-crew is a minefield Diamond Offshore also doesn’t want any photographs taken of their cutting-edge equipment. So circling the rig aboard the ‘Infinity’ will have to do for us.Aside from ferrying crew to and from the Ocean GreatWhite, the ‘Infinity’ usually takes tourists out to St Kilda from the Stein jetty in Waternish. But that happens mostly in the summer.“We have been flat out doing this since the rig arrived,” says skipper Kenny Mackinnon.Regular work over the winter is good for those who don’t usually have it.In fact, the arrival of the OGW has been a boon for the area. Twelve locals have been taken on in ious positions. This is the direct benefit. There is a harder to quanty knock-on effect for local businesses in what Alasdair refers to as the “downstream supply chain”. Everything from additional bed nights to sandwiches bought in the nearest shops are covered by this concept. And there have been quite a few of those over the last six weeks.Food and lodgings for visiting crews and subcontracted workers might sound like small beer, however. But the temporary largesse created by the presence of the OGW could be the start of something much bigger.Nothing like the crazy days of the s and s, though, when a town of , people sprung up in accommodation blocks behind the dry dock. That kind of development, said Simon, will not happen again, partly because of the strain it would place on local infrastructure.  Instead, he envisions - people employed directly at the site.The prefabs of Kishorn’s heyday are long gone but the dry dock is still here, its original concrete floor as good as new, so I’m told. The faint imprint of the Ninian Central , once the biggest manmade object ever moved across the face of the Earth, is still visible a spectral impression of the past.KPL have more modest ambitions than trying to resurrect what was.Simon and Alasdair are building in small steps. They’re making progress, just at a slower pace than many would like to see.Further investment is required to speed things up. That, however, is based partly on more rigs using the yard. KPL have a few irons in the fire on that front, but nothing definite yet.“The revenue this will generate will enable us to extend one of the piers, out into the deeper water, so we can load and unload directly rather than having to ferry equipment and people back and forth,” says Alasdair.Just sixty metres from the shore Loch Kishorn reaches a depth of around  metres, easily enough to accommodate oil rigs which, it should be remembered, need taken apart when they’ve reached the end of their working lives. Decommissioning s is on the KPL menu too.If , jobs were a flash in the pan,  jobs might be the sustainable optimum. By definition, the slow build lasts longer than the quick buck.In this place of big numbers,  might be big enough."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1447107.jpg--.jpg?1550046202000\n","title":"2 800 donation for braid valley community first responders","story":"THE new Braid Valley Community First Responders Scheme enjoyed a great response to their Open Day with more than  people attending.This was an ideal opportunity for potential volunteers at NIAS Northern HQ, Ballee to find out more information and they showed a lot of interest in joining the scheme.

As Moy Park celebrates  years in business, Aaron reflects on changes in the sector and milestones along the way. He said: “I first joined Moy Park in  when I was still at school, working part time at the weekends as a factory operative. “As a student, it was a great insight into the world of work and business. It taught me the value of hard work, money earned, and motivated me to want to do more of both! “After gaining a degree in Health and Leisure from Queen’s University Belfast, I was keen to move into a business environment and decided to apply to Moy Park’s Graduate Management Programme, to find out more about a career in one of our fastest growing industries, agri-food. “The two-year programme was the ideal way to find out more about ious strands of a business, from operations to finance, HR and marketing, and what might suit my skillset best. “From my time as a sht worker on the factory floor, I had a healthy respect and interest in the processing side of Moy Park, and the opportunities and challenges therein. “Once I completed the Graduate Management Programme - which we still use as a recruitment tool today - I took up a position as a sht manager, capitalising on my people management skills and interest in operations. “Since then, I have worked my way up across a number of Moy Park’s sites – moving from factory manager to area manager and have now been General Manager at Ballymena for two years. “Ballymena is a great place to work. From a business point of view, it’s strategically located with fantastic transport links and from a social standpoint, you’ll never find yourself wanting for something to do – from shopping to socialising over a drink or a bite to eat. It’s also quickly becoming the spa capital of Northern Ireland! “While Ballymena has faced a number of economic challenges, it’s an area with a rich history and heritage of business success. This spirit is still very much evidenced by the people, businesses and organisations in the town today. “Mid and East Antrim Council has an ambitious integrated economic development strategy for the area to help encourage business growth across the borough, and it’s one we are keen to help support. “It’s a strategy important not just to Moy Park as a business, but to me personally. “I sit on Mid and East Antrim Council’s Manufacturing Task Force Team, a working group committed to supporting and fostering growth. I was delighted to attend Westminster with a delegation from the Task Force recently when Northern Ireland representatives presented their plans for a Belfast City Deal. “Hearing these plans certainly gave us food for thought when it comes to nurturing growth locally. “As Ballymena’s General Manager, I’m responsible for all business s at the site – from technical to HR and finance. “With over , members of staff, it’s a erse and busy job but that’s what makes it worth doing. In the last  years, business management has evolved signicantly. “While there might be more paperwork, regulations, travel and late nights, there is also an incredible amount of collaboration - with customers, industry, educational bodies and government and our local communications. “Managers today cannot afford to work in silos, you need to adopt an attitude of knowledge sharing and foster an environment of innovation to truly succeed. “My key piece of advice to anyone viewing management as a career is to do your research and bolster your skillsyou need to. Being a good manager isn’t a static position, you constantly need to challenge yourself, and a good employer is one who lets you not only challenge yourself but equips you with the skills to overcome these challenges. “One of my own personal highlights over the last  years was been being named ‘Young Processor of the Year’ at the Meat and Poultry Processing Awards in . “Given my background working on the factory floor, it was great to win an industry award. At a business level, I’ve been very proud to see Ballymena evolve to become a Centre of Excellence, focused on driving innovation in food manufacturing. “As General Manager, it’s my ambition to see our facilities continue to grow.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1460409.jpg--.jpg?1550570234000\n","title":"children from gran canaria welcomed to ballymena","story":"A group of children from Gran Canaria have been visiting Ballymena to take part in the annual local music festival.The group of  children are pupils of the British School of Gran Canaria, and are taught by local woman Claire McDonald.Claire, who is the head of the music department at the English speaking school has accompanied her pupils to Northern Ireland to take part in the festival, sightsee, improve their English skills and experience the culture of Northern Ireland.The young people, who are all aged between  and  years old are keen musicians, with some playing the piano, drums, violins while others are singers.They have experienced success at the festival, with some winning first and second prizes and others were highly commended.The group have been travelling around NI, visiting the Giant’s Causeway, Hillsborough Castle and the Titanic museum and performed in a local concert with Kellswater Flute Band.This has been their first taste of Northern Ireland, and it did not disappoint!One of the students, Miguel said: “I’ve really enjoyed my trip. “I play the drums and the musical festival has been great.“We learn English at school so it’s good to speak it here.”Fellow student Alicia, said: “Northern Ireland is great and the festival has been a wonderful experience.“I was really excited to play with the band but my favourite part was the Giant’s Causeway and the music festival.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1460481.jpg--.jpg?1550570359000\n","title":"rodney quigley announces independent candidacy","story":"Ballymena man Rodney Quigley has announced he plans to stand in this year’s Council elections.Announcing his candidacy on Facebook this week, the well known community activist posted: “I intend to stand as an Independent candidate in the Mid and East Antrim council elections on nd May.“As someone who has worked tirelessly as a community worker for over  years, and as a member of the policing and community safety partnership for  years, I feel that I have something to offer at local council level.“I have dealt with many community issues in the past and will continue to put the community first on any issues that are brought to my attention. “Ive also worked with many councillors on many issues in the past and would continue to work along side them for the good of everyone in Ballymena.“I know that many people have said its time for change and it would be good to see a few new faces within Mid and East Antrim council.“If this is the case Id like to be one of the new faces.“I can assure people thatelected, I will put my best foot forward every time and will work to resolve local issues for everyone in Ballymena.”Election datesNomination forms for prospective candidates must be ed to the Deputy Returning Officer by pm on Monday April , .The election will be held on Thursday, May , .

The little trawlers are impounded, their crews taken hostage. But why Captain Jamie Bryson was once the Royal Navy’s most decorated and respected nuclear sub commander. But now he’s living in semi-retirement in the sleepy backwater of Donaghadee, tending his garden by day, chairing the parish council by night. When the call comes from Whitehall for him to take to the conning tower for one last top-secret mission, Captain Jamie has to make a choice between his chrysanths and his country#“Action, romance, danger, flute music. This one has it all.” The Ballymena .“An explosive tale of international intrigue that gallops breathlessly from Glengormley to Dundalk and straight to the gates of hell.” Shankill Buy and Sell.“A really cracking holiday read and, believe me, I know what I’m talking about.” Ian Paisley Jnr.“But Sinn Féin.” Slugger O’Toole.Chapter oneCONTACT‘Up periscope!’Captain Jamie Bryson’s voice was tight with tension as he barked the order. He bent and took the handles, his knuckles whitening with the force of his grip. He welcomed the cold anger, it made him feel alive he channelled it, bent it to his will. Anger and training: the fighting man’s best friends – how well he remembered that from his first day at Submarine School Newtownards.The Astute class hunter-killer nuclear submarine sat sleek and silent  metres below the cold, dark Irish Sea. Captain Jamie’s eyes narrowed as he slowly scanned the still waters of Clogherhead harbour, past the pastel colours of the little trawler fleet until at last his crosshairs came to rest on the dull grey hull of the LÉ Orla. The battlecruiser lay squat and sinister in a corner of the harbour commanding a direct view of the two kidnapped Ulster fishing boats, the Amity and the Boy Joseph, two of its four .mm heavy machine-guns trained on the wheelhouses where captain and crew lay on the floor trussed up like pigs.Captain Jamie pushed the periscope handles into the closed position and took a step backward. “Battle stations,” he rasped, “make ready forward torpedo hatches”Executive Officer Willie Frazer’s face creased into a mask of doubt and uncertainty. “But Captain, we’re under strict orders to maintain a watching brief.”He’d served under Captain Jamie for close on  years and never questioned an order – no need to, for Captain Jamie was a Man of the Sea: confident, experienced, exuding an air of calm authority that brooked no dissent.“Mr Frazer, you have your orders.” Captain Jamie’s words were low, but there was no mistaking his deadly seriousness.“Yes, Captain.”A light wind ruffled the short sleeves of Captain Jamie’s immaculately-pressed white shirt and a weak winter sun glinted off the shiny black peak of his cap as he took his place on the conning tower. He fixed his binoculars on the brooding hulk of the LÉ Orla and stood fixed and resolute as a statue. At his shoulder, XO Frazer gripped the cold metal around him to stop his hands from shaking. Though he didn’t take his eyes from the glass, Captain Jamie sensed his number two’s unease.“Mr Frazer,” he said, his gaze still on the enemy ship. “If those trawlers aren’t released by noon, we open fire. Ulster demands it.”• The Clogherhead Convention.

The school, which is still teaching children and young people the precise skill and technique of Irish dancing, was founded by Moya Connnolly who told the Andersonstown News that this year’s reunion is very much “a celebration of the school and friendships that were formed”.“Initially we had pupils from the circle of streets in the Andersonstown area,  pupils at the beginning, and we taught from the ages of four up to ,” she said.“The classes just grew and grew and spread down to Clonard.

It’s about the class, the pupils, it’s a chance for us all to share the experience of the school,” she said."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"making the law work for all of us","story":"WHY is law important  I know, a bit existential for today, but given we are beginning Lent and this is to be a time of reflection, let’s ask ourselves some reflective questions.At the Pat Finucane Lecture a couple of years ago international human rights lawyer Paul Seils said, “Law is humankind’s greatest invention.” I was working at the event and busy doing my thing, but that stopped me in my tracks, and it has stayed with me ever since. It is not without irony that the words spoken at that event proved this week to be prescient.Law is meant to provide a moral compass for society, allow us a set of norms by which we agree to conduct society and protect the vulnerable. We live in streets where for decades law was either disregarded or used as a tool in a weaponry of oppression. Those reading this paper who were subjected to the ignominy of its abuse will all know too well what happens when law does not work. It incites and prolongs conflict, harm and pain. But most of all the corruption of law leads to despair. Where can we gowe do not have the protection of law The single most important achievement of the Good Friday Agreement was the review of criminal justice. It was a recognition that the corruption of law needed to be endedwe were to truly ensure our conflict never happened again.When the Supreme Court in London delivered its findings in the challenge by the Finucane family to the decision by the British government not to hold a public inquiry, it was a finding in law. It was not about Weston Park, nor about governmental promises, nor about changing economic environments. It was about what was right in law. And with its clear, non-political eye, saw that an inquiry was required into this pernicious example of state collusion in the killing of an officer of the courts.When last week there was an announcement that inquests would at last have appropriate structure and funding this was because of the domestic and international courts refusing any argument that the application of the rule of law could be subject to political favour or will. Legal compliance is not subject to negotiation.No matter who the citizen is, whatever their background, they should expect the law to defend them. No matter how big the power, whatever their political philosophy, they should expect the law to hold them to account. That is how it works. And it can remedy previous imbalance.Right now, the long arm of those who abused their position and the law in the RUC is reaching into the PSNI to undermine the courts addressing the crimes of the past. Alongside elements of the military and security services these vested interests are doing it because the law, through its courts and processes such as the Police Ombudsman, is holding previous members of state agencies and the narrative of the state as upholders of law and order to account. This is a critical time. Confidence in the building of a truly human rights-compliant system of law, order and justice relies on the rule of law winning against politically motivated vested interests. Some will try to portray these developments as uneven or unbalanced. Quite the reverse is true."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"two more people to stand trial linked to meli case","story":"TWO more people are to stand trial on offences arising out of the murder of Christopher Meli.-year-old Daniel McManus, of Springbank Drive, and Shannon McIIwaine , of Glenalina Park, both in West Belfast, appeared at Belfast Crown Court on Friday for a ruling on their case.Mr Justice Colton dismissed applications by their legal teams to have charges of affray dismissed on the grounds of insufficient evidence.The senior judge said that although they were not accused of engaging in violence on the night of Mr Meli’s murder in December , he had come to the conclusion, “that their conduct taken at its height is sufficient to put each of the defendants on trial for affray.”Dismissing the application, Mr Justice Colton added: “I am satisfied that the affray took place in a public place and in such a manner that a bystander or reasonably firm character might reasonably expect it to be terrying.” Following his ruling, both defendants were formally arraigned on a single count that they “unlawfully displayed force and made affray” on December, , .Both replied “not guilty” and were released on continuing bail ahead of the start of their trial on September .In January this year, six other people were ed for trial in connection with Mr Meli’s murder.Three are charged with murdering the -year-old father-of-one, while their co-accused face other charges linked to alleged incidents on the evening.Mr Meli was beaten to death at Doc’s Path in the Glasvey Close area of Twinbrook.At the time police, believed up to  young people were involved in a number of violent incidents that culminated in his death.All six accused appeared at Belfast Crown Court where they heard the trial could last up to  weeks.The trio accused of murdering Mr Meli are Caolan Lavertyof Belfast Road in Glenavy, Stephen McCannof Dundrinne Road in Castlewellan and -year-old Lee Smyth, who was living at an undisclosed address in County Antrim.

With  minutes remaining on the clock, Ballynahinch patiently played the ball around the back, waiting for an opening.Ashley Brownrsquos pass then found the lurking Stuart Hunter in space. Hunter was able to pick out roaming right back Leslie Harrison, who pulled a perfect pass back into Millar and he made no mistake in finding the net.Ballynahinch could easily have sat back and closed up shop, but they pinned Ballymena into their own half with a series of concerted attacks.Congratulations to everyone involved with the Ballynahinch menrsquos team, especially the supporters who never miss a game.The celebrations were short-lived as Ballynahinch have a huge game this weekend when they face Portrush in Coleraine in the Irish Hockey Challenge semi-final at pm.Ballynahinch: Aaron Donnell, Rea Coffey, Andrew Mulholland , Ashley Brown, Leslie Harrison, Matthew Martin, Stuart Hunter, William Edgar,Tim Crean, Jason Campbell, Alex Millar, Andrew McIlwaine, Luke Curry, Micheal Carney, Josh Higginson, Steven Crean.Joint men of the match: Alex Millar and Rea Coffey.Ballynahinch Ballymena ULSTER INTER LEAGUE.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"£2m tidal turbine providing energy spins in to action  ","story":"A poundm tidal turbine currently in Strangford Lough could provide electricity for between - homes, it has been revealed.The Scottish firm behind the innovative Subhub has said that energy produced from the fast-flowing lough could cost as low as p per kWH for local industrial load customers.However, the Subhub is not connected to the local electricity grid and is being tested for its environmental impact and maintenance needs.The distinctive yellow Subhub mdash which is roughly the size of of a bus mdash has been in Castleward Bay for the last six weeks.Easily seen from Portaferry, it was towed from Belfast Harbour and fixed into position within  hours on January .Jeremy Smith, managing director of QED Naval, said that Strangford Lough was chosen over the Orkneys for the Subhubrsquos final commissioning before being made available for the global market.Mr Smith explained: ldquoThe Subhub is a foundation structure for tidal turbines and provides a means of transporting and fixing tidal turbines to the sea bed.ldquoWe want to prove the environmental credentials of Subhub after developing it since .ldquoWe selected Strangford Lough as the commissioning site specically as it had the iants of conditions that Orkney hadnrsquot.

Lyng took the resultant penalty, but it was saved by a combination of Karen Haughey and then Sara-Louise Carr in the last action of the half.The second period followed a similar trend as Clonduff dominated the third quarter, Sara-Louise Carr banging over her third point and Gribben, who was picking up so much ball around the middle third, putting four between them once more from a placed ball.Gailltiacuter took over from then on, but will rue near-misses with shots for goal from Jackman, Carroll and Fitzgerald.The latter reduced the margin to the minimum with three scores, the third from play in the th minute after wonderful work by Kate Lynch, but crucially Gribben responded with a fantastic conversion of a free outside the  after a heavy challenge on Megan OrsquoReilly.Lyng made it a one-point game once more from a free, but Clonduff defended resolutely to hold out.Clonduff: K Haughey, N OrsquoHagan, J Boden, S Murphy, C McGilligan, E Rafferty, F Carr , B Fitzpatrick, C Cowan, C Fitzpatrick, SL Carr , P Gribben , O Gribben, K McGilligan.

In fact, the South Eastern Trust has been concentrating for some time on trying to find suitable day surgical services which could be delivered in Downpatrick.Miss Ritchie said it appears ldquovery short sighted to relocate services from the Downe to other hospitals, suggesting the bedding down of eye surgery will result in the increased requirement for theatre access for ENT and other services.She added: ldquoAs the Downe has high level computerised technology theatres, it is important that full use is made of them to ensure continued local accessibility to day surgery services at the point of delivery.ldquoI have already written to the Trust urging that ENT surgical clinics are retained in the Downe Hospital.Also this week, Miss Ritchie has issued a fresh call for a permanent MRI scanner to be installed in Downpatrick.She said that for a number of years the local community has been involved in trying to secure a permanent scanner which health chiefs agree is a necessity.She added: ldquoI understand that the permanent facility is subject to a business case which needs a Minister in place to approve. Whilst the devolved institutions remain in cold storage, the approval of such a facility will probably take some time.ldquoIn the meantime, a mobile scanner has been located at the Downe for a limited period to deal with a current overburdened service at the Ulster Hospital in Dundonald.

The development proposal includes plans for almost  parking spaces, eight of which are reserved for mountain rescue team members.A new pedestrian crossing at the Bryansford Road junction with Shimna Road forms part of the proposal and while planners have received  objections, they have also received five letters in support of the proposal.In papers submitted ahead of next weekrsquos meeting, planners confirm that none of the statutory consultees, including the Department for Infrastructure, Rivers Agency, Environment Agency and the local environmental health department, have lodged any objections to the redevelopment of the former school site.They confirm that roads officials are content that the proposed development will not have any ldquoadverse impact on the existing road infrastructure and is acceptable in terms of road safety.Planners are also insisting that the indicative designs of both the new store and mountain rescue centre would not be inappropriate in this part of the resort.They say it is acknowledged that there are ldquoobvious restrictions for the redevelopment of the existing Lidl store in Railway Street and there are no alternative vacant sites in the town centre which can accommodate the supermarketrsquos needs.ldquoA suitable brownfield site has become available at the edge of the town centre which could accommodate the proposal and has met the requirements of strategic planning policy, say planners.They also confirmed that a study of the impact of the new store on existing retailers shows the proposed investment will not have any ldquosignicant or unacceptable impact on Newcastle town centre.Environmental health officials say they have no objection in principle to the investment, provided conditions are attached restricting hours of business and deliveries, with planners concluding that the overall impact of the proposal, which is close to a number of homes, is not considered to be ldquosignicantly detrimental to warrant a refusal of the application.Lidl has confirmed it plans to develop a new , square metre supermarket, explaining it opted to redevelop the former primary school site as there are limited opportunities to redevelop the storersquos current base at Railway Street in the resort.Lidl says it has been looking for alternative premises in Newcastle town centre for over a decade without success and that while properties have become available, none were suitable because they were too small.It says the current sales area at its Railway Street base is is too small for the store to carry a full range of goods, pointing to narrow aisles with limited circulation space. The company says the car park is too small and fails to meet its requirements, with the general customer experience falling short of a modern food store.Planners say that having assessed the ious planning policies and having regard to all representations made, all consultees engaged and all other material considerations, it is found that the proposal is acceptable in planning terms and approval is recommended..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Newcastle’s pop up beach back on agenda of council  ","story":"A DECISION to reject a proposal for a pop-up beach in Newcastle has been overturned.Last month, a Newry, Mourne and Down Council Committee recommended not to proceed with the articial beach mdash similar to those in Paris and other parts of Europe ndash at the townrsquos promenade.However, the decision was overturned at Monday nightrsquos meeting of the full council when it was agreed to seek funding for the pop-up beach and develop a business case which could pave the way for its introduction.But not all councillors agreed, with Sinn Fein members rejecting it. They said there were health and safety concerns associated with the beach. They expressed support for transporting sand by road from Ballykinlar to Newcastle promenade and implementing an enhanced beach management plan.The radical suggestion to bring a touch of French summer flair to Newcastle was initially discussed last September when it was agreed to further explore the idea, with the initial focus on the cost of developing such a facility.The idea was suggested because of the lack of sand on Newcastle beach.Pop up beaches along the banks of the Seine and other cities and towns across Europe are hugely popular and some local politicians believe they can be a success in Newcastle.Council officials have confirmed that while Newcastle promenade is not suitable for pop-up beaches, two areas adjacent to the Downs Road car park would be suitable and that the cost over a nine-week period would be pound,.At last monthrsquos meeting of the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee, politicians rejected the pop-up proposal and agreed to seek a meeting with the Environment Agency to discuss securing a marine licence to transport sand from Ballykinlar to Newcastle.It was also suggested that groins would be placed along sections of beach to protect the sand and a programme of better beach management introduced. On Monday night, this recommendation was overturned by  votes to .Mournes SDLP councillor Laura Devlin, who initially proposed to explore the merits of a pop-up beach, said the local authority ldquoneeds to think outside the box to create an articial beach or ldquosimply accept that Newcastle will never have a sandy beach.She continued: ldquoIf improving the natural beach was an option I would obviously proceed in that direction. However, it is not workable.ldquoI have been advised in no uncertain terms by a iety of coastal erosion experts that importing sand to Newcastle or removing stones from the beach simply wonrsquot work due to the movement of sediment and that permission to do this work would be denied by central government.ldquoAs a councillor for Newcastle, I want to improve our tourism product and the pop-up beach proposal is simply my suggestion to try and do something dferent. I also recognise that an articial beach would have to be properly managed and maintained.Cllr Devlin added: ldquoA pop-up beach could not just be created at the start of the summer and left. It would have to be adequately cleaned and looked after. As a mother, I would not want my child playing in dirty sand so the management and cleanliness of the pop up beach is essential.ldquoThis suggestion wonrsquot be without itrsquos issues, but surely as a council it is our job to try and make improvements and better our area where possible, expressing disappointment Sinn Fein opposed her proposal.Sinn Feinrsquos Willie Clarke argued that there was no appetite for a pop-up beach and that the suggestion to move sand from Ballykinlar to Newcastle was to replace the hundreds of tonnes which drt away on a seasonal basis.He continued: ldquoHow are you going to manage a pop-up beach that will be filled with stagnant sand  There is the potential for both dogs and young infants to foul the sand and other health and safety issues which need to be addressed.ldquoWill the sand be cleaned every day  What measures will be taken to prevent sand from blowing up Main Street  Local people and traders want to see a sandy beach, not a pop-up beach. I believe it is a no brainer that we try to secure Environment Agency agreement to place sand on the beach.Cllr Clarke said part of the pleasure of going to the beach was being able to go into the water and suggested that a pop-up beach could not provide such an experience.He added: ldquoWe need to look at anti-social behaviour issues associated with pop-up beaches which could contain broken glass. I wonder who is going to look after them given the dficulty I have in getting someone to clean the beach ldquoWe need to invest resources to ensure the proper management of the beach and encourage people to go to parts of it where there is sand.Cllr Andy McMurray described pursuing the idea as ldquofolly given the current problems in keeping the promenade tidy..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Penalties settle derby cup tie  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH Olympic set up a Clarence Cup quarter-final clash away to Comber Rec, but they had to do it the hard way at Kilmore Road on Saturday.The biting cold wind and rain turned this derby clash into a lottery which went to a penalty shoot-out that ended in total controversy.Olympic held a slight advantage at - on penalties when Kilmore goalkeeper Darren Ross threw his side a leline after he brilliantly saved Niall Murrayrsquos spot kick.This was no more than Kilmore deserved, but their players and supporters quickly became incandescent with rage when the referee insisted that Ross had moved off his line and ordered the spot kick to be taken again.Murray made no mistake at the second attempt and blasted Olympic into the last eight as Kilmore were left to rue what might have been.Olympic played with the swirling, gusting wind in their backs in the first half, but Matty Hardy and Jack Larkin at the heart of the Kilmore defence looked calm and composed.Olympic were struggling to get the ball down in the middle of the park and play their normal passing game as Kilmorersquos Michael Monan and Anton McGrattanrsquos forced Stevie and Ryan Noade into hurried passes.However, with  minutes gone Murray used the wind to his advantage.Olympic were awarded a free kick just inside the Kilmore half and out on the line beside their own dugout. Murray launched the ball high into orbit and wasnrsquot the least bit surprised when the wind took over and helped it on its way to the top right hand corner of the net with Ross clutching at thin air.Six minutes later at the other end Anton McGrattan struck yet another free kick from just outside the box past Ryan Walsh to bring the sides level.Olympic continued to see more of the ball, but Jones, when he did receive the ball out wide, was let down on a few occasions by a lack of support in the box and some wasteful finishing from Shane Murray.Kilmore were far from out of it and the bustling Joe McKinney was proving a handful and he almost gave the visitors a nd minute lead when he shot wide after a sizzling breakaway run from Anton McGrattan.Murray missed another good chance for Olympic after Jones carved out another opening before Kilmore seized the lead.Callum Dougan foraged deep and played a delightful through ball into the path of McKinney, who had beaten the offside trap. McKinney wasnrsquot for hanging around and after shrugging off Stevie McGoran, herounded lsquokeeper Walsh to make it -.The unrelenting wind and rain greeted both sets of players back for the second half and it was Kilmore who went on the offensive with Ryan Slavin being denied by Walsh.Two minutes later Kilmore shot themselves in the foot when Murray floated a free kick into the box and Jason Noade had all the time in the world to head the ball past Ross.Things became hot and heavy for a while with the tackles flying in, but clear cut chances at either end were hard to come by.Kilmore were now asking most of the questions, but a resolute Olympic rearguard refused to budge and Walsh had relatively little to do, apart from the odd shot from distance.Extra-time produced little of note, but Kilmore could have wrapped things up in the second period when McKinney crossed for Pete Casey, but, for once, he sliced his effort into no manrsquos land.Jones, Jason and Stevie Noadersquos first three penalties were perfect for Olympic, but they were matched by McGivern, McKinney and Larkin for Kilmore.Adam McLean nudged Olympic - ahead before Anton McGrattan fired his effort wide, advantage Olympic.Murrayrsquos first attempt was saved by Ross, but the referee made him retake the penalty as he insisted Ross had moved forward off his line. Murray was not about to look a gt horse in the mouth and drilled his second attempt to the net, much to the despair of a mightily aggrieved Kilmore side.Ballynahinch Olympic: Ryan Walsh, Dalton Tate, Aaron McClean, Jason Noade, Ryan Noade, Stevie McGoran, Stevie Noade, Ryan Molloy, Shane Murray, Niall Murray.

So can he give an indication to when he thinks those negotiations, that element of the negotiations, which are extremely important, when they are likely to be concluded and when the House is likely to be updated ”Mr Lidington said of the two new documents: “The first provides confirmation that the EU cannot try to trap the UK in the backstop indefinitely and that doing so would be an explicit breach of the legally-binding commitments that both sides have agreed.”He said the “joint instrument” reflects the commitment to “replace the backstop with alternative arrangements by December ”.Mr Lidington added the attorney general would be publishing advice ahead of today’s debate, but needed time to consider the new changes.“The attorney general will publish his legal opinion,” he said. “That will be available in good time before the debate.”The last-ditch bid to make progress in talks came amid predictions the prime minister was headed for a second humiliating defeat on her Withdrawal Agreement and it remains to be seenthe concessions will be enough to see it pass through Parliament.Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said the change “adds nothing” from the letter Mrs May ed from negotiations with on January .MrsMay’s said in Strasbourg: “The deal honours the referendum result and is good for both the UK and the EU.RHI: Government pulls vote after Lord Empey makes last-ditch bid to delay huge subsidy cuts Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“But there was a clear concern in Parliament over one issue in particular: the Northern Ireland backstop.“Having an insurance policy to guarantee that there will never be a hard border in Northern Ireland is absolutely right — it honours the UK’s solemn commitments in the Belfast Good Friday Agreement.“Butwe ever have to use that insurance policy, it cannot become a permanent arrangement and it is not the template for our future relationship.“The deal that MPs voted on in January was not strong enough in making that clear — and legally binding changes were needed to set that right.“Today we have agreed them. First, a joint instrument with comparable legal weight to the Withdrawal Agreement will guarantee that the EU cannot act with the intent of applying the backstop indefinitely.“If they do, it can be challenged through arbitration andthey are found to be in breach the UK can suspend the backstop. The joint instrument also gives a legal commitment that whatever replaces the backstop does not need to replicate it.“And it entrenches in legally binding form the commitments made in the exchange of letters with Presidents Tusk and Juncker in January.”She added: “Second, the UK and the EU have made a joint statement in relation to the Political Declaration.“It sets out a number of commitments to enhance and expedite the process of negotiating and bringing into force the future relationship.“And it makes a legal commitment that the UK and the EU will begin work immediately to replace the backstop with alternative arrangements by the end of December .”Mr Dodds said that “all of this will need to be taken together and analysed very carefully, because we’re speaking at the moment without having had sight of the precise text”.In response, Mr Lidington said he “completely understands” the wish for detailed analysis.try catch  TrendingStorm Gareth worse than originally thought - N.I. to be pummelled by mph galesNewry murders: Distraught father will lsquosell taxirsquo for chance to say goodbyePolice not seeking anyone  in connection with Newry deathsN.I. child reported missing is found safe and wellN.I.

It constitutes a document of reference that will have to be made use ofany issue arises in the implementation of the withdrawal agreement. To this effect, it has legal force and a binding character.“So at its height it is a ‘document of reference’ to which regard will be had in any interpretation issue relating to the Withdrawal Agreement, and that is the only sense in which it has any legal effect or standing. “It creates no change to the Backstop or alternatives to it. In short, it is essentially assurance, not alteration.”Victims’ Commissioner Judith Thompson ‘should apologise for missing Stormont event’ Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Mr Allister added that the supplement to the political declaration “remains mere words with no legal compulsion”.“I therefore fail to see how any MP who with conviction voted against the Backstop a few weeks ago could now vote for it on the basis of thus very thin gruel,” he concluded.try catch  TrendingStorm Gareth worse than originally thought - N.I. to be pummelled by mph galesNewry murders: Distraught father will lsquosell taxirsquo for chance to say goodbyePolice not seeking anyone  in connection with Newry deathsN.I. child reported missing is found safe and wellN.I.

Social media was abuzz this morning as pictures emerged of travellers standing in security lines stretching outside the terminal building.It comes after the airport last month said it was expanding its security area from six to eight search lanes to improve wait times at security.However, in order to facilitate the expansion work, the airport has temporarily reduced the number of lanes to five.Some passengers caught up in the delays took to Twitter to vent their frustration.Paul Fitzpatrick tweeted: “Was here in plenty of time but not even in the airport yet. How will I make my . flight ”Mr Fitzpatrick ended up missing his plane to Edinburgh after queuing in security for over an hour, and had to transfer to another flight at George Best Belfast City Airport.He told the News Letter he would never use Belfast international Airport again, describing the situation as “farcical”.The airport’s managing director Graham Keddie revealed that around  passengers had missed their flights as a result of the security delays.Speaking on Radio Ulster this morning, Mr Keddie apologised to those affected by the situation, but asked passengers to be patient as the airport implements its improvements.He added that the airport currently has % less queueing space in the search area due to the ongoing constructions work.“We dropped the number of lanes to five to facilitate our construction work about  days ago and phase one of this is due to complete by Thursday night when we go back to six lanes. Phase two is due to complete before Easter,” he added.He acknowledged that the reputational damage to the airport was signicant, but added: “We will get it right and by Easter we will be on eight lanes fully manned.Security alert: Suspicious object was ‘nothing untoward’ Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“It is embarrassing and humiliating for us as a team. We know what we have to do to fix it and we will fix it.”Mr Keddie also said some passengers who missed their flights may be entitled to a refund, adding: “We will be looking at each inidual case andit is an issue for Belfast International Airport then they will be reimbursed.”Today’s chaotic scenes are not a new occurrence for the airport, which has come in for heavy criticism from disgruntled passengers over several months, with many complaining of long waits to get through security and miss flights on some occasions.Alliance MLA Stewart Dickson has called on the Civil Aviation Authorityto carry out an investigation into the situation at the airportIn response, Mr Keddie stated: “The airport is fit for purpose in terms of our compliance which is CAA monitored constantly.”In a statement, the airport said it was continuing to advise to advise passengers to arrive two hours prior to departure.try catch  TrendingRoad reopens after collisionNewry murders: Distraught father will lsquosell taxirsquo for chance to say goodbyePolice not seeking anyone  in connection with Newry deathsN.I. child reported missing is found safe and wellStorm Gareth worse than originally thought -

Dealing with this type of call prevents our staff from dealing with genuine emergencies.ldquoCalling an ambulance when you donrsquot need one wastes time and resources which could have been better spent responding someone genuinely in need of the high level clinical care ambulance crews provide. Ambulances are not a taxi service and arriving at hospital by ambulance does not mean yoursquoll be seen quicker.\"She added: ldquoIf someone is seriously ill or injured and their le is at risk, you should call  immediately.

The development connects to the entrance to Murch Road.After complaints from residents of vehicles tracking mud from the site across the nearby Murch Road, Barratt have promised to introduce improved wheel washing facilities.Plaid Cymru Community Councillor Chris Franks said residents had spoken to him to express their frustrations.He said: ldquoThe mud has splattered cars and made the whole area dirty.

The event ran from Saturday March  to Tuesday March .The Vale brewery Tomos and Lilford produced a special beer called ldquoCarnival - Penarth Pale Ale.Meanwhile the two Penarth butchers, Thompson Family Butchers and David Lush Butchers, both created their own special Penarth carnival sausages.The organisers estimated that more than  people took part in costume in the walk through town on Saturday, which saw the coronation of the lsquoFirst Foolrsquo at am. The procession marched from Sully Terrace through town.At .am in Penarth Library, there was a presentation of the head of Bendigeidfran, from The Mabinogion. The head was made by children from Cogan and Penygarth schools.The lsquoFirst Foolrsquo was then sent by train to the Tower of London to bring news of the Carnival to the traditional resting place of the head of Bendigeidfran, where he met the Raven Master.Long distance cyclist Dave Hann was due to cycle to Harlech, north Wales to raise money for the RNLI Penarth, and bring news to Harlech that Carnival had broken out in Penarth.Unfortunately Mr Hann only got as far as Cardigan before Storm Freya made it too dangerous to continue. Organisers have one barrel of carnival ale left and will take it to Harlech by train in the next few weeks to share it and the storybook of the carnival.On Sunday, two rugby teams took part in a ldquotug-o-sausage to decide which butcherrsquos sausage was better. Congratulations were extended to the winners, Team Thompson.Congratulations were also extended to the traders Ener-chi and Lilypad by the organisers, for having the best-dressed shop windows. Particular praise was singled out for the carnival flowers at Holm House Hotel created by Lilypad.Further nights of partying, songs and dancing were spotted in the Albion, St Faganrsquos Castle, and other pubs, bars and venues across Penarth. There were also celebrations on the Penarth Pier on Tuesday night following a Pancake Day event, while wandering bands of musicians like Wonderbrass kept spirits high.The festival culminated in a grand Mardis Gras party on Tuesday, which saw crowds of costumed residents dance the night away.Richard Parry, one of the carnival organisers, said: ldquoToday is Ash Wednesday, the beginning of Lent. Carnival finished last night on Mardi Gras.ldquoThanks to everyone who took part, contributed, encouraged, sponsored, smiled and partied, especially those people who took a carnival Bank Holiday Monday.ldquoIt was fabulous to hear your Carnival Bank Holiday stories, and to all those people who have had little private carnival moments of joy over the festival, thatrsquos what it has all been about.ldquoAnd some people have already said, lsquosee you next year!rsquoldquoThere were lots of people laughing and smiling on the sidelines, telling me they wanted to take part next year ndash just with a little more notice next time. But now itrsquos established, wersquoll be back next year and ready for even more people to join in the fun! article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Wersquore creating work which is not really necessary.If we want to improve the gateway there are other ways of doing it.ldquoIt really doesnrsquot begin to tackle the active travel . I do feel this is about spending the money before next February.Councillors were told the widened roundabout was one part of a wider strategy for transport improvements in Penarth.Charlotte Pugh, senior planner for the council, said the new scheme would transform the area.She said: ldquoThis whole are is going to be completely transformed. At the moment it is not very welcoming to pedestrians.ldquoI think it will go some way to transforming this gateway into Penarth and make it a safer environment.Previous plans to make part of Plassey Street one-way to incoming traffic, and removing the roundabout altogether, were dropped following opposition from the public.The committee agreed to endorse the transport scheme but requested regular updates on the wider transport plans for Penarth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This fantastic choir is run by The Aloud Charity, which is based here in the constituency, and is doing incredible work all around Wales, involving young people in music and teamwork and giving them the confidence to not only succeed in music but in their lives more generally.It was a real honour to host them in Parliament, where they sang for the Speaker, for MPs, and during the St Davidrsquos Day Service in the Chapel, before heading to the Public Gallery of the Commons to watch the St Davidrsquos Day debate.This annual debate is an important one for Wales, allowing MPs to talk about all sorts of issues. I spoke about transport and train services ndash a long running campaign of mine as you will know.I then spoke in the crucial debate on climate change. Believe it or not, itrsquos been far too long since wersquove had a debate on this issue in Parliament, and I spoke about the importance of our investments and pensions going into renewable sources, not into fossil fuels.I also pointed out my support for the young people across the UK who went on a climate strike the week before. Itrsquos their futures that wersquore concerned about here and they were absolutely right to do what they did.And then of course the Brexit shambles continues ndash we cannot escape it ndash but we were debating it again last week, with hugely important votes to come next week.But last week was a signicant one. The PM was forced into a corner, forced to concede that she might have to rule out No Deal and extend Article , and the Labour Party came out decisively for putting this issue back to the people.And this week we saw the Government attempt to win over MPs with a fund it claims will boost less well-off towns after Brexit ndash but in another shambolic aspect to this hapless attempt to bribe MPs into voting for Theresa Mayrsquos so-called deal, there is no cash for Welsh towns.Another example of the Tories letting Wales down, and yet further reason to support the push for a final say on Brexit for the public through a Peoplersquos Vote. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Last month I met with constituents over disruption to local rail services. I know that many of you will have experienced delays and cancellations to services in the weeks following the handover of the Wales Rail Franchise. I understand and share the frustration that these delays have caused. There has been a shortage of rolling stock as a result of a large maintenance backlog following the handover of the franchise together with planned changes to rail services. This has led to a signicant reduction in services and replacement bus services. I have been in contact with the Minister for Transport and Transport for Wales to raise the concerns of constituents. I have been assured that service levels are now back to normal and they do not anticipate any restrictions to services in the coming year. I will of course maintain my interest to see that those assurances are kept. I will update residents again on future plans to deliver improved station facilities, trains and more regular services.As many of you are aware Cardf Bus has recently announced changes to bus services across Cardf and the Vale. A number of bus routes are at risk as part of these changes. The removal of bus links for work, social links and public services, including hospital routes, would have a signicant impact on my constituents.Cardf Bus are not acting to deliberately hurt our communities. Far from being an uncaring organisation Cardf Bus are stuck with a legal framework that stops them from operating on the same basis as commercial competitors. Competitors can cherry pick and target single profitable routes that undermine the wider social propose that most of us want from local bus services. Cardf Councilrsquos Labour leadership has committed to supporting at risk bus services for  years. Unless the Conservative leadership of the Vale Council agrees to Labour councillors amendments to the budget and protects local bus services in the Vale then bus routes will go. The Vale Council leadership could and should act. If they donrsquot then my constituents will suffer.In future, the regulation of buses is the answer. London was the only part of the UK that was allowed to keep a regulated bus service. It is no mistake that it has the best and most coherent service. We now have the legislative powers to regulate bus services here in Wales. The Welsh Government is currently consulting on proposals to reform bus and taxi services in Wales. More information on the consultation can be found at: https:beta.gov.wales improving-public-transport.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Cannot become permanent. It is only temporary.If it is the case that we were ever to get into the backstop.ldquoThe legal instrument that we have agreed is an addition to the Withdrawal Agreement. It has the same legal status as the Withdrawal Agreement. It is legally binding.ldquoThat is what Parliament asked us to secure and that is what we have secured.Our agreement provides meaningful clarications  legal guarantees to the Withdrawal Agreement  #backstop. The choice is clear: it is this deal, or #Brexit may not happen at all. Letrsquos bring the UKrsquos withdrawal to an orderly end. We owe it to history. https:t.co lfyeehEZi pic XCqcLwZVVmdash Jean-Claude JunckerMarch , Mrs May added: ldquoMPs were clear that legal changes were needed to the backstop. Today we have secured legal changes.ldquoNow is the time to come together to back this improved Brexit deal and to deliver on the instruction of the British people.The legal view of the changes taken by Attorney General Geoffrey Cox will be an important factor in the lead-up to the Commons vote.Mrs May said: ldquoThe Attorney General is independent. He will come to his decision. He will publish his legal opinion.The European Commission president insisted there would be no further negotiations on the issue.European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said there will be no new negotiations Mr Juncker said: ldquoThere will be no new negotiations. It is this.ldquoIn politics, sometimes you get a second chance. It is what we do with the second chance that counts. Because there will be no third chance.ldquoThere will be no further interpretation of the interpretations and no further assurances on the reassurances.ldquoLet us be crystal clear about the choice ndash it is this deal or Brexit might not happen at all.Mrs May believes the three new documents agreed with Mr Juncker will give MPs the legally-binding reassurances they require to approve her Withdrawal Agreement and Political Declaration on the future EU UK relationship.The Commons motion the PM wants MPs to back describes the first new document as ldquothe legally binding joint instrument relating to the Withdrawal Agreement.Now #@JunckerEU# #@MichelBarnier# briefing #@Europarl_EN# #Brexit Steering Group on agreement with #@theresa_may#. #@guyverhofstadt# #@ElmarBrok_MEP# #@gualtierieurope# #@danutahuebner# #@ph_lamberts# #@GabiZimmerMEP# pic PdNcEmEjgjmdash Margaritis SchinasMarch , The Government states that the document ldquoreduces the risk that the UK could be deliberately held in the Northern Ireland backstop indefinitely and commits the UK and EU to work to replace the backstop with alternative arrangements by December .The second new document is branded a ldquounilateral declaration by the UK which sets out ldquothe sovereign action the UK would take to provide assurance that the backstop would only be applied temporarily.The final document is a supplement to the Political Declaration ldquosetting out commitments by the UK and the EU to expedite the negotiation and bringing into force of their future relationship.If the package passes the Commons, leaders of the  remaining EU states will be asked to endorse the new documents at a scheduled European Council summit in Brussels on March -, before the final step of ratication by the European Parliament.Mr Juncker said he had spoken to Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, who he said had indicated he was ldquoprepared to back this approach in the interests of an overall deal.pic mOyujcfWMmdash Arlene FosterMarch , Mrs Mayrsquos dash to Strasbourg came amidpredictions the Prime Minister was headed for a second humiliating defeat on her Withdrawal Agreement and it remains to be seenthe concessions will be enough to see it pass through Parliament.The DUP has pledged to carefully analyse the Brexit deal add-ons, remaining non-committal on whether it would now back the Withdrawal Agreement.Deputy leader Nigel Dodds told the Commons ldquoall of this will need to be taken together and analysed very carefully.The DUP position could be crucial in Tuesdayrsquos Westminster debate, and not only because of the votes of its  MPs.The partyrsquos position on the border backstop could also influence how some Tory Brexiteers approach the issue.Jacob Rees-Mogg, chairman of the European Research Group, told the BBC: ldquoItrsquos too early to tell definitively, but itrsquos clearly a step in the right direction.ldquoItrsquos important to see the details, but the DUPrsquos support would be a very important and signicant factor.It was a bad deal in December and three months later nothing has changed. pic RZYJmcdvOmdash Jeremy CorbynMarch , The Prime Ministerrsquos de facto deputy David Lidington said that the new documents gave ldquoconfirmation that the EU cannot try to trap the UK in the backstop indefinitely and that doing so would be an explicit breach of the legally-binding commitments that both sides have agreed.But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn dismissed the move and called on MPs to reject the deal.He said:ldquoThe Prime Ministerrsquos negotiations have failed.ldquoThis eveningrsquos agreement with the European Commission does not contain anything approaching the changes Theresa May promised Parliament, and whipped her MPs to vote for.ldquoSince her Brexit deal was so overwhelmingly rejected, the Prime Minister has recklessly run down the clock, failed to effectively negotiate with the EU and refused to find common ground for a deal Parliament could support.The -strong Independent Group of MPs has tabled an amendment to force the PM to seek an extension of Article  to hold a so-called Peoplersquos Vote before the end of September.In a letter to EU Council president Donald Tusk, Mr Juncker left the option of an extension to Article , but only by a could of months.He said: ldquoI would like to stress that the United Kingdomrsquos withdrawal should be complete before the European elections that will take place between -

How did you get started in the industry  When we first opened Asia Supermarket in , it was the family’s ambition to bring a taste of home to Belfast. We brought the Chinese culture to the local community through cuisine and provided authentic and tasty ingredients for the hospitality trade here. We branched out due to demand to also provide Indian, Korean, Philippine, Thai and Middle Eastern food and are always looking for opportunities to extend our range. Typically, who are your clients or customers  Our customers would be both wholesale and retail to include restaurants all over Northern Ireland, as well as consumers who want to create some unique dishes in their home kitchens. Do you enjoy what you do, and what in particular  Yes, and in particular having just completed the new build we have enjoyed being involved in the day-to-day aspects, given the bespoke nature of the project, coupled with the hustle and bustle of the day to day challenges of satisfying our customer needs. What is the most dficult part of your job  One of the most dficult parts of the job is sourcing good quality produce at competitive prices and enhancing the range of products available. However, we’re very proud of our new supermarket and warehouse which provides even more quality and choice for our customers. What are the challenges facing your sector, and the economy in general  One of the biggest challenges facing our sector is the cost of goods from our suppliers, particularly those procured in foreign currencies which in turn has a knock-on effect on what we charge our wholesale and retail customers. To maintain our share of the market we constantly endeavour to get the best prices from our suppliers so that we can pass on competitive prices to our customers to maintain and grow our market share. With Brexit looming it will bring a major impact on imports costs and supplier prices which will present a major challenge for our business.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/cleaver_1.jpg","title":"is the future bright for the ni energy market","story":"Posted on Tuesday  February  by Ulster Business It is clear that there are a number of signicant challenges facing the energy sector in Northern Ireland but where there are challenges, there are also opportunities, according to law firm Cleaver Fulton Rankin.The ExecutiveNorthern Ireland has just completed its second year without a ing local government and in the words of David Sterling, head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service, the Civil Service is “… doing everything we can in the prevailing circumstances…but civil servants cannot take the place of ministers when it comes to strategic policy development or in taking transformative decisions”.  This is very much the case with regard to energy policy. The Department of the Economy’s Strategic Energy Framework, which was endorsed by the Executive in , has over the last nine years, led to some very positive changes to the energy generation and supply mix, particularly from renewable sources.However the  year framework is nearing its end and needs to be replaced. The Department is making such preparations as it can on a draft Strategic Energy Framework across the areas of heat, electricity, transport and energy efficiency which it aims to make public some time in the spring. Whether or not this region has its Assembly back to adopt such a framework will remain to be seen, but in the meantime it will ensure the subject remains live and high on the agenda.Brexit and I-SEMThe new wholesale electricity market known as the Integrated Single Electricity Marketwent live on October , . It is designed to deliver increased levels of competition which, it is hoped, will help put downward pressure on prices as well as encouraging greater levels of security of supply and transparency. While the island of Ireland is now integrated more closely with European markets, there is a risk that Brexit could halt this integration. British and Irish business groups and energy trade associations such as the CBI, IBEC, Electricity Association of Ireland, RenewableUK, British Irish Chamber of Commerce and EnergyUK all refer to the delivery of I-SEM, or to the UK’s continued access to the IEM, as post-Brexit priorities for security of supply and or consumer protection. I-SEM is clearly a priority that must be preserved.While Brexit may present challenges and continuing uncertainty, there are certainly opportunities for investment and acquisition in the electricity market as more complex, specialist expertise will be required to effectively trade power on the I-SEM. Policy barriers or inaction cannot be allowed to prevent I-SEM from realising its potential of fully integrating the market by efficiently moving energy from producer to demand.Renewable incentive schemesDespite being on track to hit its target of % of electricity generation from renewables, Northern Ireland risks being left behind. The lack of a replacement for the development support mechanism, Renewables Obligations Certicateafter its closure in April , means Northern Ireland is lagging behind Great Britain which has established the Contract for Dference regime and Ireland, which has started work on its Renewable Electricity Support Scheme . While neither scheme is perfect, doing nothing is not an option. The devolution of energy presented Northern Ireland with the opportunity to shape its own policy but without a government, will the sector and the infrastructure be able to remain fit for purpose GasWith its development over the last  years, the gas network in Northern Ireland, with its low population density, must be seen as a success story. Consumers and businesses have been offered greater choice in terms of price and security of supply. Nevertheless there are certainly further opportunities for gas distributors and suppliers to expand the natural gas network, particularly in the west of the country and east Co Down. So despite the apparent obstacles and challenges, there is opportunity for development and progress in Northern Ireland’s energy sector. The benefits for Northern Ireland will be in terms of security of supply, price and environmental sustainability. Cleaver Fulton Rankin,  Bedford Street, Belfast BT FW.

The proposal for the work to Broadcasting House on Ormeau Avenue in Belfast was approved last March by the BBC board, with the announcement made to staff by the BBCs director general Lord Tony Hall. Now, the plans – which include the redevelopment of the exisiting BBC Broadcasting House building, including the refurbishment and extension of the buildings – will be put to the public, as part of a necessary pre-application event before planning can be submitted. It includes a new extension to the rear, including a landscaped plaza opening onto Linenhall Street. A spokesman for BBC Northern Ireland told Ulster Business: \"As part of the pre-planning application process, public consultation events will take place this month before we can move on to the next phase. The investment to BBC Broadcasting House in Belfast, announced in March last year, will transform the iconic building, its technology and facilities, highlighting the BBC’s commitment to audiences in Northern Ireland. We will share more detail in due course.\" Money invested will go towards structural work on the -year-old building to ensure its long-term sustainability, addressing what the state broadcaster has said are \"critical deficiencies\". Before the announcement last year that the BBC was to stay put and develop its existing building, it was understood the broadcaster had been eyeing up other city centre locations, or could create a new media hub in the Titanic Quarter. The event will take place at the Clayton Hotel on March , between pm and pm, and March  between pm and .pm.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20190201_0983.jpg","title":"pwc investing in people purpose and belfast","story":"Posted on Wednesday March  by Ulster Business Almost  years after it moved  staff and , paper files into Waterfront Plaza, PwC will move again – this time taking around , people and some very smart technology to Merchant Square in the heart of Belfast Just  months after being appointed to PwC’s national management board as head of UK regions, Paul Terrington, PwC’s NI regional chair, has no plans to reduce his commitment to keep growing the business locally.“This is an incredibly exciting time to be part of PwC. Since I took on the Northern Ireland role six years ago, we’ve doubled the workforce, become the fastest-growing UK region and are now the biggest office outside London with just over , people,” he says. “Our strategy was to be the leading provider of professional services in the Northern Ireland market but there’s no way we’d be the size we are now had we only focused on that.”Instead Paul built on the legacy of his predecessors and accelerated growth in new, technology solutions, while retaining the traditional accounting, tax and consulting services. Today PwC remains the leading provider of advisory services to the region’s family-owned and owner-managed businesses and multinationals, but has also built an impressive portfolio of cutting-edge technologies, opened the door to signicant export markets and is tackling some of society’s most challenging issues. “We’ve grown in many new areas – blockchain, cyber, cloud-based accounting services – but the single biggest impact has come from developing our distinctive ‘Operate’ ision,” Paul says. ”Operate is our service delivery business, which supports and delivers technology and people solutions to large, often regulated organisations. So instead of just advising clients how to solve their problems, we now do the heavy lting for them.”Run by Ian McConnell, a partner who’s been with the firm for  years, Operate is already attracting global attention. “Clients increasingly don’t want a consulting firm just to tell them what to do: they want a problem-solving partnership.” he says. “In its first year of operation, Operate earned over £m, now has , people and is still growing.”Reinforcing Paul’s confidence to invest in Northern Ireland as a strategic location is a  forecast from TheCityUK that it could become the second fastest-growing financial services region outside London by , helping deliver £bn of additional gross value-addedto the UK economy. But that depends on the ability to recruit the right talent, and he says the challenge now is finding and retaining the skills.That’s an issue that particularly concerns Paul as he looks ahead at the economic picture with Brexit and lack of an Assembly to the fore.“The business community wants clarity and certainty. Ideally we want to see a Brexit withdrawal agreement that then gives the scope for a trade deal that offers Northern Ireland the capacity to trade both with the EU and as part of the UK. The potential competitive advantages and ability to attract investment would be terric and the kind of economic accelerator which we have sought for years, but never managed to gain.“However I do worry about the impact of political stalemate on our long term future. Failure to invest, particularly in education and skills, will impair our competitiveness and make this a less attractive place for business.The decreasing effectiveness of health, environment and infrastructure will mean that talented people will opt to make choices to live their lives where.“In my national role, I see other parts of the country fusing partnerships in innovative and exciting ways between business,education and government. Compared to that, we are already getting left behind. We should be moving forward.”Which brings us to Merchant Square, the £m, , sq ft office development which PwC takes over in . “We have great people and one reason why we’re moving to the city centre is because that’s where they want to be. By the time we’re ready to relocate towards the end of , we will have at least , people moving in to the heart of Belfast.“That makes it important for Belfast too and not just because it’s the city’s biggest-ever private sector office deal. As we were making our decision, the whole Bank Buildings issue was at its height, and we wanted to show our support for the city and its future.” The Merchant Square relocation project is led by Kieragh Nelson, a director who joined the firm in . “We’ve got serious ambitions for Merchant Square,” she says. ”There’s a sense of ‘OK, we’ve just opened flagship offices in London, and Manchester – what more can we do in Belfast how can we make it even better ’ And the vast majority of decisions on how it will look, feel and work are made by the team here. Our goal is to create the most technologically-advanced, innovative and collaborative space for ourselves, our clients, and also for the communities around us.”Doing the right thing is a maxim often repeated in PwC, but it gets backed up. On the morning of our interview, a large group of people from the firm, including Paul, took part in one of their regular ‘Darkness Into Light’ walks to raise awareness of mental health. The firm’s commitment to social mobility has seen a number of employment programmes launched, notably the UK’s first technology degree apprenticeships, with Queen’s University one of five universities selected to run the programme. And it’s expanding its Hive Academy programme, which delivers free technology education to primary and secondary schools, to the Channel Islands.This year the firm challenged itself and created a unique charity partnership – the PwC Challenge – to create innovative suicide prevention programmes.“Our purpose is to build trust in society and solve important problems, and it really does feature in how we look at what we do. We strive to celebrate and share our knowledge widely and unselfishly with our people and communities and not be afraid to take a stand and do the right thing. And we put it at the heart of what we do every day. “Take the PwC Challenge: more people in Northern Ireland have died by suicide since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement than from the violence in the years before. This is a crisis, and it’s one which affects our people, and our communities. So we asked local charities in north and west Belfast, the worst affected areas in the UK, to collaborate and devise really innovative approaches programmes to give opportunities to young people and their families through education, technology, sports, and mental health coaching.“As well as the clubs in PwC which fundraise every year for the challenge, our own people are volunteering every week in ious projects – particularly with our Hive Academy. We want to ensure that people, who are high achievers in many dferent fields, are supported to play their fullest part in society.” For Paul, it’s all about the people. Last year PwC invested around £m on staff development here, and this year, a number of people have begun the first Masters in Operation service delivery, run by Ulster University. “It’s important to support people to develop their careers in ways they mightn’t have considered when they joined. That’s a key building block of our purpose – it drives social mobility, equality and ersity.“It’s true thatsomeone decides they want to head off and join PwC Australia or New York, they can. That’s the beauty of working for a global firm – those opportunities are there. But what I really want to make sure is that you don’t have to leave:you want to live and work in Belfast, and have global clients, work with cutting-edge technology and be part of a firm that’s engaged in society, you can do that too.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/eopen_1.jpg","title":"the open its the biggest thing since sliced bread","story":"Posted on Wednesday March  by Ulster Business With just  weeks until Northern Ireland hosts the biggest sporting event in its history, John Mulgrew speaks to the bosses tasked with organising the legendary Open Championship We’ve come a long way in just a short few years. Despite its huge golfing credentials, especially in the modern game, it had been more than  years since Northern Ireland played host to the Irish Open.That all changed in , when it ed north to Royal Portrush. And that, buoyed on a refreshed and renewed interest in both the tournament, and the sport itself.Now, in  weeks, that same links course will see more than , people flock to arguably the world’s greatest golf tournament and the largest sporting event ever hosted on these shores – The Open – transforming a small Co Antrim town for a handful of summer days.“There is a buzz with everyone at the RA,” Johnnie Cole-Hamilton tells Ulster Business. He’s executive director of championships at the RA – the ruling authority of golf throughout the world, aside from areas such as the US, and organisation responsible for organising The Open.“This will be my th Open Championship, and one reason I continue to be involved is that it’s a challenge every time.”It will see Irish golfing greats, including Open winners Rory McIlroy and Darren Clarke, Graeme McDowelland Padraig Harrington – among others – join the biggest name in sport, Tiger Woods.“One of big drivers to ing to Royal Portrush was the success of the Northern Irish and Irish golfers. They have raised the profile of golf immeasurably. “We are absolutely delighted with the response so far – % of tickets sold in  hours, and sold out within a record-breaking eight weeks.”Johnnie says the decision to choose Portrush, bringing it back to the course after a  year hiatus, was the correct one – buoyed by the support from the community, agencies and organisations. The th Open will be held at Royal Portrush from July -.“In my career, we had a similar scenario, ing to Liverpool for the first time in  years, and we had a very similar response. It ed in , and now Royal Liverpool is firmly on the rota, and I hope that Royal Portrush is similar.”Of course, aside from the golf, both the short-term and long-term economic benefits will trickle down and benefit, not on the surrounding areas, but prop Northern Ireland up on yet another global .According to Tourism NI chief executive John McGrillen that longer-term benefit could be worth up to £m for the wider economy.“There will be , tickets sold for championship days, and % of those sold to people out of state, outside Northern Ireland,” he tells Ulster Business.“It allows us to present an extremely positive image for Northern Ireland, and into key markets across the globe. We will never have experienced the opportunity to provide such a positive image of Northern Ireland. Despite what we might think, there are perception issues.“Northern Ireland has a normalised society and some of the most dramatic golf courses, scenery and landscape to see.“More specically, the fact that the Open will have been here, as one of the world’s top golf courses, will drive up the amount of spend, especially from golf tourism.”That alone makes up around % of Northern Ireland’s tourism intake. John says he wants that to grow to £m by . He says golfing visitors spend around four times that of an average tourist.Johnnie says all signs so far suggest that the Open in Portrush is “going to be an enormous” success. But the process hasn’t come without its challenges – namely theIrish Sea.“This is the first Open Championship we have hosted in my time, in which we have a body of water between our base and our contractor base. There’s getting things across water, and an enormous amount of work on the golf course – new holes, a new road system around the course and a tunnel for the players from one of the new greens to tee. You can’t do that without support from the golf club“The members have been hugely supportive, turning the course upside down, but maintaining integrity and enhancing .”He said, along with the blue light services, local authorities, council and tourism groups, the community in and around Portrush “understands that this will bring great benefits” to the area and Northern Ireland as a whole. “You can overcome dficulties with support,” he says.“Royal Portrush has never had more than , people drive to it, or get the train to it, at the same time. It’s a challenge to make sure we deliver a wonderful Open Championship and a spectator experience.”John McGrillen says the triumph in landing the Open itself was down to the success of the Irish Open in the last few years. “You had more than , people turning out at Portrush… visitor numbers had been dwindling.“That allows us to demonstrate that the course can deal with that many people. Everyoneworked very well, collectively, and that gave confidence to the RA that we would have the capacity to deliver it. The risk factors they had were eliminated because of the success of the Irish Open, and that was very critical.”As for boosting many of the hundreds of businesses in and around the area, John said: “It will do, as it’s showing off Northern Ireland… we have seen a big boost in the number of Americans playing golf. We don’t have to wait until after the event. “The visibility the Irish Open has given us. We have Royal County Down, Royal Portrush and Portstewart – that’s increased signicantly. It’s not just those courses which are benefiting – it’s being spread. People will typically stay in Belfast and travel around.”For John, the best outcome is, of course, an Irish winner. Oh, and clear skies. “A local winner would be phenomenal. It would be fantastic to see Rory win, or Tiger Woods.“If Tiger Woods won the Open in Portrush, that would remain in peoples’ memories forever. While we would love Rory or other locals to win, I would not be disappointed in Tiger winning it.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/pwc_1221.jpg","title":"pwc ni to crack  staff by ","story":"Posted on Thursday March  by Ulster Business PwC is set crack the , staff mark by the end of next year as it moves into its new £m offices in the heart of Belfast city centre, Ulster Business can reveal.Just  months after being appointed to PwC’s national management board as head of UK regions, Paul Terrington, PwC’s NI regional chair, has no plans to reduce his commitment to keep growing the business here.“This is an incredibly exciting time to be part of PwC.
