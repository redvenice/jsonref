Chloe Goins claimed she was assaulted by Crosby at the mansion, but criminal charges in this case were ruled out. It also had a reputation of being dirty after multiple former Playboy bunnies spoke out about the dilapidated building and floors strewn with dog feces and urine.In 2011, health officials confirmed that the bacteria that causes Legionnaires\u0027 disease was found in a whirlpool spa at the Playboy Mansion where more than 100 people fell ill.The Los Angeles County Health Department presented its findings at an annual conference at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta. The legionella bacteria also causes a milder illness called Pontiac fever.Symptoms, which include fever and headache, are the same as those suffered by the Playboy Mansion partygoers. Hefner decided not to leave the mansion to his widow Crystal after his death but chose to sell it while he was still alive - with the condition he was allowed to stay there until his death. However he did leave her $5million and a 5,900 square foot house in Beverly Hills. Most of his fortune was split between his four children and various charities.Crystal, 31, was the third of his wives, having married him in 2012.He had previously been married to Mildred Williams from 1949-1959, with whom he had two children, and Kimberley Conrad - 1989\u0027s 27-year-old Playmate of the Year - from 1989-2010.Cooper, Hefner and Conrad\u0027s elder son, said that he and brother Marston grew up with a framed photo of his mom\u0027s nude centerfold in the home.\u0027Yeah, that was weird,\u0027 he admitted. \u0027It was like the elephant in the room.\u0027Hefner also had a bevvy of \u0027girlfriends\u0027 who lived with him - usually several at a time - at his famed Playboy Mansion in Los Angeles.Despite declaring that he had slept with more than a thousand women, Hefner spent much of his life \u0027looking for love in all the wrong places,\u0027 as he tearfully told The New York Times in 1992.Hefner married Crystal - and took up a life of monogamy - in 2012 after briefly calling off the engagement. \u0027Maybe I should be single,\u0027 he said a few months later.\u0027But I do know that I need an ongoing romantic relationship. In other words, I am essentially a very romantic person, and all I really was looking for, quite frankly, with the notion of marriage was continuity and something to let the girl know that I really cared.\u0027The year before their marriage, he had mused: \u0027I never really found my soulmate.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Eco mob M25 AGAIN","story":"Share this article   A spokesman for the group said in a video released Monday that it wasn\u0027t \u0027scared\u0027 by the court intervention, adding that its members were \u0027prepared\u0027 to continue being arrested.The injunction was designed to act as a deterrent after weeks of blockades on both the M25 and A20 near Dover infuriated motorists and large portions of the British public.  But news that the eco-warriors are still being released without conditions, reported by LBC, raises fears that they will continue to wreak havoc and put drivers\u0027 lives at risk.It comes as spokesman for the group Liam Norton - who became a laughing stock last week when it was revealed his own home hadn\u0027t been insulated - warned in a video recorded at the weekend and released today: \u0027You can\u0027t scare us with these injunctions\u0027.Donning a black t-shirt and standing in front a bare white wall, he said: \u0027I\u0027m going to sit in the roads and directly oppose the injunction handed out by the Home Secretary and the Transport Secretary.\u0027Our message to the Government is that you can\u0027t scare us with these injunctions.\u0027You can send us to prison, and what that will show is the Government\u0027s cowardice, because they\u0027re actually standing up for powerful interests rather than looking after the interests of the vast majority of the British people.\u0027He added: \u0027We just want the Government to get on with the job of protecting the people\u0027s future in Britain and also to stop the needless deaths of thousands of our elderly who freeze to death in their homes each year because they have to make that awful decision between heating and eating.\u0027So our message to the Government is this You can decide to put us in prison, and we\u0027re prepared for that, but what would be better for the country maybe would be to give us a meaningful statement that you are going to get on with the job, so come on Boris, show some leadership, do what you need to do.\u0027 The Metropolitan Police told the Mail Online it could not comment on the breaking of the injunction because it was a \u0027civil issue\u0027. The Home Office has been contacted for comment. "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f895c1faa900a271e4ae06763b01751f5292f0df/0_126_3024_3780/master/3024.jpg?width=445\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=5b71f518403debfbe861c9af7a589943\" height=\"3780\" width=\"3024\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"dcr-1989ovb","title":"juventus v chelsea champions league live","story":"I’m surprised more hasn’t been made of his big-game record.

Dr Anna Durbin, a vaccine researcher at Johns Hopkins University and one of the study’s investigators, said of the overall result: “I was pleasantly surprised.  “It was also highly protective against severe disease and hospitalisation.” There were no cases of severe or critical symptomatic Covid-19 among the more than 17,600 participants who got the vaccine.  This compares with eight such cases among the 8,500 volunteers who got the placebo.  There were two deaths in the placebo group, but none among those who received the vaccine. There were also no cases of a rare blood clotting side effect called thrombosis with thrombocytopenia that has been linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine. The results were published in the New England Journal of Medicine.  The House of Representatives voted 74-26 for the $1.3 billion construction plan and 75-25 to use $400 million from the state’s share of American Rescue Plan dollars to help pay for the construction.  The bills now move to the Alabama Senate, reports AP.  However, the proposal has been slammed by state Democrats, who argued it will not solve the prison problems and said the state has needs in health care and education that could be helped by the $400 million. The lone Democrat in Alabama’s congressional delegation, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell, wrote on Twitter that she is disturbed her state is using the pandemic money for prisons, “especially as the virus rages in our state.” “To be clear, the current state of the Alabama prison system is abhorrent, but the use of Covid-19 relief funds to pay for decades of neglect is simply unacceptable,” she said. The Department of Justice last year sued Alabama, saying male inmates in the state live in prisons “riddled with prisoner-on-prisoner and guard-on-prisoner violence.”Earlier this week, the European Commission, the EU’s executive, had said it would propose such an extension.  However, initially not all governments supported it as EU vaccination campaigns have been advancing quickly and there are no longer any shortages of shots compared to the first half of the year. Uncertainty about the need to secure booster shots as new variants of the coronavirus emerge had convinced all governments to retain some control over exports, an EU official said.The profession is down 126,700 workers from pre-pandemic levels, according to employment data.  As the economy reopens, however, the lack of child care is hampering efforts for some parents to find work or return to work. Prevent Senior, a health maintenance organization with a chain of hospitals and more than half a million members, is currently in the crosshairs of a congressional inquiry into Brazil’s coronavirus crisis and the highly controversial response of President Jair Bolsonaro. Last month a group of whistleblowing doctors handed a 10,000-page dossier to investigators containing a series of incendiary allegations against the São Paulo-based firm that caters to senior citizens. The dossier contained claims that elderly patients had been used as “human guinea pigs” for the testing of unproven Covid “remedies” without full consent being given. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) said the rise of the delta variant and school starting have dramatically increased the risks children face during the pandemic, in court documents submitted in the federal lawsuit against Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds. AP reports the AAP and its Iowa chapter filed a brief on Tuesday with the federal court judge who is considering the lawsuit filed last week by 11 parents of Iowa children and the disability rights group The Arc of Iowa.  It is seeking to reverse a Republican-passed measure that Reynolds signed into law in May that prohibits school boards from imposing mask mandates in schools. The AAP said in the document filed with the court that their review of the research and the experiences of the front-line pediatric practitioners “prove beyond any doubt that universal mask policies in schools significantly reduce the spread of Covid-19 in school populations.”  The group said the prevalence of paediatric Covid-19 has skyrocketed since the school year began, with 20 per cent of all child cases since the beginning of the pandemic diagnosed between 13 August and 16 September. The document said more than 5.5 million child Covid-19 cases have been reported in the United States as of 16 September.  Iowa has reported more than 56,000 child cases, the group said.The UK has placed South Africa on its coronavirus “red list”, forcing travellers into expensive hotel quarantine on arrival. AFP reports that Mr Ramaphosa told a news conference:  However he said they would not be seeking to penalise the UK for the measures, adding:  Across the country, doctors and nurses are dealing with hostility, threats and violence from patients angry over safety rules designed to keep the virus from spreading. Dr Stu Coffman, a Dallas-based emergency room physician said: “A year ago, we’re health care heroes and everybody’s clapping for us.  “And now we’re being in some areas harassed and disbelieved and ridiculed for what we’re trying to do, which is just depressing and frustrating.” Cox Medical Center Branson in Missouri started giving panic buttons to up to 400 nurses and other employees after assaults per year tripled between 2019 and 2020 to 123, a spokeswoman said.  One nurse had to get her shoulder X-rayed after an attack. Some hospitals have limited the number of public entrances. In Idaho, nurses said they are scared to go to the grocery store unless they have changed out of their scrubs so they aren’t accosted by angry residents. Dr. James Lawler, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha, where some doctors have received online threats said: “It’s just another added pressure on health workers who have already been experiencing a lot of stress.”That’s all from me for today – my colleague Jane Clinton will be here soon to take you through the next few hours.

Its recommendations are in line those from organisations including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine. The CDC said in addition to risks of severe illness and death for pregnant people, there is an increased risk of preterm birth in COVID-19 infected iniduals.  "},{"url":null,"title":"i m embarrassed teachers react to unions call to be part of covid bonus talks","story":"Many teachers have taken to social media to say they are not seeking Covid bonus payments. Photograph: iStockWhen teachers’ unions announced they were joining the queue of frontline professionals seeking access to talks over Covid-19 bonuses, they expected a backlash – just not from their own members.“Who asked our union to look for a bonus pandemic payment? How many emails and texts? I haven’t heard even one member,” said one teacher. “What on earth is going on here?”Another local teachers’ union representative said: “I’d be embarrassed to put ourselves in the same category as health professionals . . . No way should we be seeking to get the same reward.”School principals, too, said it was not a matter of discussion or debate in staffrooms.“As a school principal and member of one of these unions, I have not heard a single solitary teacher or school leader colleague even suggest this? Seldom things really irritate me, but this takes the biscuit!” one said.The response shows how a well-meaning Government initiative – to recognise the contribution of frontline workers during the pandemic – risks snowballing into a unseemly free-for-all between civil servants, public sector workers, teachers and retail workers.Growing alarmThe potential for ballooning costs is also a source of growing alarm. The Government estimates that the cost of giving extra leave days across the health sector would be about €377 million, or €1 billion if applied across the public sector.Teachers’ unions were keen to point out that they were not “demanding” bonus payments and have not lodged any claims. Rather, if there are discussions around rewarding workers, they feel they should be at the table. They add that they were simply responding to smoke signals from the Government that the bonus could apply outside the health sector.“Leo Varadkar said last week that it shouldn’t be limited to health workers,” said one union source. “He highlighted the work of civil servants making sure people got pandemic unemployment payments. So, if that’s what we’re talking about, then, yes, we should be at the table.”The debate cuts across another contentious question: what exactly is a “frontline” worker?For many it’s a health professional who had to don personal protective equipment for others, it includes retail workers who kept shelves stacked during the darkest days of the pandemic. Teachers’ unions feel their members are also legitimate frontline workers.“They’re working in crowded classrooms and making huge efforts to keep schools open . . . it’s only right that they should be considered,” said one.The fact that schools closed for a considerable time, however, has fuelled outrage among some that taxpayers could end up footing the bill for teachers’ bonuses or bank holidays.GrievanceThe sense of grievance is especially strong among parents of special needs pupils, who feel let down that special schools closed at a time when they remained open across Europe.“Their refusal to reopen the schools in early 2021 was highly damaging to vulnerable pupils,” one campaigner said. “I think there would be outrage if the Government gives in to these demands.”At Government level, there is now growing awareness that the idea of Covid bonuses is mushrooming into an isive issue. Tánaiste Leo Varadkar acknowledged as much when he spoke to reporters this week.“It’s not just people who were working in the public sector, it’s also people who are volunteering as well . . . It is difficult, but we want to get it right.”"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Another Life: Earlier leaf-fall, even of days, could reduce carbon stored by forestsStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 vaccine tracker how many people have been inoculated in ireland","story":"It has been over a year since the first case of Covid-19 was confirmed in the Republic of Ireland. Since then, over 300,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and over 5,000 people have died.Globally, over 200 million people have been diagnosed and over 4\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Janssen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsphas concluded exploratory talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?Dose: Two doses, between 4 and 12 weeks apartEMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine (also known as Vaxzevria) was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout. This was revised to people aged over 50 on April 27th. On June 28th, Niac revised its advice again and said the vaccine could be given\u0026nbspto people aged under 40, although the mRNA shots were preferable for that age group.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2-8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st.On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.On April 20th, the EMA\u0027s review of these issues found a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, and agreed a warning should be included in the product information.\u0026nbspHowever, it concluded\u0026nbspthe overall benefits of the vaccine\u0026nbspin preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects, and so Janssen announced it would resume deliveries to the EU. In Ireland,\u0026nbspNiac initially recommended that the jab be used only for people over the age of 50, but this was revised to include the under 40s on June 28th. Those aged 18-34 can apply to get the Janssen vaccine at pharmacies around the country.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses in total,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2-8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity.

Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollins“Don’t be tempting me now,” threatened the Taoiseach, as a tantalising thought was planted in his head by the Independent TD for Clare.Although it’s not like the idea hasn’t crossed Micheál Martin’s mind already. What if … what if something came up, something completely unforeseen, something of such enormous magnitude it completely upended the Merrion Street succession agreement?What then? Obviously he would have no choice but to stay on in the top job until things settled down again.It was Michael McNamara who painted this scenario during Leaders’ Questions while raising the situation of craft apprentices due to serve their time in four years but now facing a two-year wait before they can finish their training.He said that 3,500 apprenticeships had been delayed because of backlogs caused by Covid. Given the housing crisis and the pressing need for constructions workers across the country, qualified tradespeople are sorely needed now.Medical students and others in university “are not being told that instead of your four-year degree, it is now going to take six”, McNamara said.The Government should “do whatever it takes” to make sure apprentices “get the training they signed up for in full and on time so that they can enter the workforce.”The Taoiseach was full of praise for the baby plumbers, chippies and sparks. Armed with an impressive array of facts and figures, he held forth on capital investment, increasing capacity, on- and off-the-job training, cutting waiting lists, course restructuring, blended learning and Covid-19.“It is a very pertinent question that goes to heart of the challenges that face us in terms of Housing for All,” Martin said. He forgot to say “unprecedented” but more than made up for that later when the housing plan was discussed.Thanks for all that information, said McNamara, but his one, simple question remained unanswered: will these apprentices finish on schedule? They’ve made plans for entering the world of work, such as looking into buying vans and maybe even buying a house.“I suppose, if I could draw an analogy ... ” continued the barrister from Scarriff, endeavouring to assist the Taoiseach “... your Government is a slightly unusual relationship in that Leo Varadkar is supposed to be the taoiseach again in December 2022. Now, if you turned around to him and said, ‘Well, sure there’s been a lot of difficulties over Covid. Actually you’re not going to be Taoiseach for another year at least … ”Over the oceanMicheál didn’t demur. One couldn’t blame him, with Leo an ocean away in Washington and still leeching his limelight with heavy hints about the budget. Again.Breaking such news to his Tánaiste wouldn’t bode well for the stability of his Government, suggested McNamara. So he might reflect on that and how it must feel like for apprentices who have also made life plans and want to know they are running to schedule.Micheál smiled. “Don’t tempt me now!”Chance would be a fine thing.The state of the housing market and the Housing for All plan took up much of Tuesday’s business. Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald set her party’s tone for the day when pouring scorn on the Minister for Housing’s recent assertion that the property market was not out of control and the Tánaiste’s remark last week that “one person’s rent is another person’s income”.Could the Taoiseach enlighten her? “What planet are these men living on?”Not to mentioned Darragh “your man, your Housing Minister” O’Brien’s new plan, which was “clueless and out of touch”.In support of his man, Micheál managed an unprecedented number of unprecedenteds.“The Minister has produced Housing for All, an unprecedented, comprehensive strategy backed, in an unprecedented way, by resources to make a far greater number of houses available to enable people to buy houses and afford them,” he said. “What has been announced in Housing for All is unprecedented. The investment is unprecedented.”Statements on O’Brien’s unprecedented plan were taken later in the day – to be continued on Wednesday. The exchanges followed a familiar pattern.“I have to say I’ve terrible sense of deja vu,” said Eoin Ó Broin at the outset of his response to the Minister’s speech outlining the merits of his big initiative.Sinn Féin’s housing spokesman reminded the Government of past efforts, unveiled with similar fanfare by Simon Coveney and Eoghan Murphy.Which was very true, but that sense of deja vu went further than a pile of abandoned Government solutions.Another dimensionAlso wearyingly familiar was Sinn Féin’s response to the wide-reaching Housing for All proposals, along with the repetition of the stock “what planet are you on?” reactions.“Do you live in the real world at all, Minister. Do you really?” asked Louise O’Reilly (Dublin Fingal). “What planet are you actually living on?” asked Sorca Clarke (Longford-Westmeath).Kildare TD Réada Cronin took the out-of-this-world line to new heights and said the housing plan was taking people “on a spin on a magic carpet, only there’s a massive hole in it”.The Government hit back. Jennifer Carroll MacNeill held up Sinn Féin’s housing policy. “Rubbish” she scoffed. “There are two more, but don’t go looking for any detail.”Richard Bruton, echoing points made by colleagues from all three Coalition parties, attacked the party on its routine of building a caricature and then attacking it.The latest caricature, he said, was that the Government housing plan was about private developers. “To try to portray it as some type of attempt to get into cahoots with private developers, to hoodwink people, is simply not the case”.Green Party TD Steven Matthews complimented Sinn Féin’s good standard of heckling, “but even the heckling doesn’t stand up to scrutiny.”Darragh O’Brien put up a spirited defence of the plan, outlining its broad reach in detail and his belief it will transform the housing system.“In reality we must use every weapon we have … There is no silver bullet and I can’t tell you it will be fixed overnight,” he stressed, before looking across the chamber at Ó Broin.“We can’t let one party’s perfect be the enemy of the common good. The Opposition needs to show what it is offering beyond soundbites, hypocrisy and ideological dead-ends.”People Before Profit’s Richard Boyd Barrett was hankering after Berlin, where the people have voted for significant rent controls. “They said expropriate landlords. Expropriate!”But what do we do here when faced with vulture funds controlling large swathes of housing? “We pay for it, they run away with the profits and tenants are screwed.”"},{"url":null,"title":"garda%C3%AD criticised over handling of allegations against retired judge","story":"MARIE O’HALLORAN and ANNE LUCEYAllegations that a former judge abused his position to pursue vulnerable women who were before his court raised “fundamental issues” because the claims were not dealt with comprehensively, according to Taoiseach Micheál Martin.People Before Profit TD Paul Murphy highlighted allegations made against a Kerry-based former District Court judge who he named under Dáil privilege as James O’Connor.Mr Murphy said he previously raised the issue in July of allegations about a “gross abuse of power” by the judge who retired in 2018 and “how he had abused his position, persistently and completely inappropriately to pursue a vulnerable woman, who was before his court on a family law matter, for a sexual relationship”.During the summer he was contacted by another woman, “who told me a very similar story relating to the same judge. She too was before him on a family law matter”.The judge “approached her repeatedly, he got her number and then he persistently pursued her. In one incident he told her he had information for her case and told her to meet him at the backdoor of the courthouse. Once there he said he did not have the paperwork and brought her inside to get it, Mr Murphy said. “Then he lunged at me. I pushed him and left. He obviously felt he could have done anything he wanted to,” Mr Murphy quoted the woman as saying.He said “the first woman went to the Garda and was told there was nothing to investigate and it was a normal situation of ‘boy meets girl’”. Mr Martin said the first case had gone to the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission (GSoc) and there was a “real issue” about how diligently the authorities follow allegations of this nature because “they have not been dealt with comprehensively in this case”.Stressing “governments do not engage in the operational side of prosecution” Mr Martin added however that “this raises fundamental issues” and he will consider the issue “to see how we can proceed”.Contacted for his response Judge O’Connor said “no comment”."},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Inside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"familiar slogans starmers team","story":"The resignation of a Corbynite MP from the shadow cabinet indicates that Sir Keir Starmer’s efforts to break the hard Left’s grip on the party are more than superficial. Andy McDonald, the employment spokesman, ostensibly quit over a disagreement about the minimum wage but his departure appears to have been orchestrated to undermine the party leader.Mr McDonald accused Sir Keir of reneging on promises made during his leadership campaign, a view shared by other leading Left-wingers including Mr Corbyn and John McDonnell. They will be even more disconcerted by the leadership’s latest policy initiative – a reprise of one of the more successful slogans of the Blair era, “tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime.”The deliberate invocation of a New Labour mantra seems designed to signal that Sir Keir is moving the party to the centre and focusing on issues that matter to voters. Mr Blair managed to reverse Labour’s reputation as the party of victimhood by ushering in one of the toughest criminal justice crackdowns of recent times overseen by a succession of no-nonsense home secretaries like David Blunkett and John Reid.Harsher sentences saw prison numbers soar while anti-social behaviour measures were introduced to deal with low-level disorder on the streets. Although crime fell during the lockdowns, Labour spokesman Nick Thomas-Symonds said it will increase unless action is taken. He proposed putting more police officers back on the beat, if only to show that in politics there is nothing new under the Sun. The police themselves recognise they have a job rebuilding relations after the pandemic. Sir David Thompson, chief constable of West Midlands, told a conference that “quick law” leading to the enforcement of Covid rules during lockdowns had harmed “police legitimacy”.Mr Thomas-Symonds said the 2019 election defeat demonstrated a loss of trust in Labour on the part of many of its traditional voters wary of Mr Corbyn and his Left-wing backers. The shadow home secretary also committed a future Labour government to removing failed asylum seekers and foreign criminals from the UK, a policy easier to promise than deliver.Nonetheless, the Blairite flag has been hoisted once more over the Labour party. How long it is allowed to fly there before being hauled down is another matter.More from NewsScotland’s Covid vaccine passport plans could be blocked by judgeDrop-in mental health centres needed to help lockdown’s damaged childrenNurses demand more pay as NHS Scotland faces months of crisisPolice officer exploited Covid powers to murder Sarah EverardThe Brexit-hating global elite is watching Britain\u0026#39s chaos with gleeMystery of identical twins could be solved by genetic markings discoveryMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"bbc employs fewer women main rivals ofcom finds","story":"BBC television has a significantly lower proportion of female staff than its main rivals, despite the corporation’s stated commitment to gender equality, according to an Ofcom study.Only 44 per cent of employees in the BBC’s television department are women, compared with 56 per cent at Channel 4, 53 per cent at ITV and 52 per cent at Channel 5’s parent company, Viacom CBS.The BBC also ranks lowest against its three rivals when it comes to women in senior management roles. The only British broadcaster to have a worse record of gender parity is Sky. The figures were contained in Ofcom’s five-year review of ersity and equal opportunities in broadcasting.Ofcom noted that, for the first time, the number of people leaving the television and radio industries exceeded the number joining it - with women making up a disproportionately high number of leavers.“Potential reasons for this exodus include the Covid pandemic and its disproportionate effect on certain groups, such as working mothers,” the report said.It pointed to research carried out recently by the University of Nottingham, which showed that women had faced the brunt of childcare issues and homeschooling during the pandemic.When it comes to radio, the BBC fares better: its workforce is 51 per cent female, putting it on a par with commercial rival Global (whose stations include Classic FM and LBC) and three per cent below Bauer (Absolute, Magic and Jazz FM).But the figures for television will prove embarrassing for Tim Davie, the BBC director-general, who made gender parity one of the central themes of his tenure when he took over a year ago.Mr Davie has also urged other companies to take on the BBC’s “50:50 Challenge” to have an equal gender split of contributors to television programmes.Across broadcasting, older women are poorly represented in the workplace: only 16 per cent of women in the TV workforce are aged 50 and over compared with 22 per cent of men.The report said: “This is unsurprising given that broadcasters’ reporting to Ofcom contains little reference to support for people in older age groups. In fact, nearly all initiatives that focused on specific age groups actually focused on young people.“Broadcasters must re-examine their policies urgently to ensure they support their older employees, especially those aged 50+. In particular, more needs to be done to improve representation for women aged 50+.”In response, the BBC said the proportion of women across the corporation as a whole was higher than the figure for television.It said: “The BBC is committed to representing all audiences both on and off screen  Our latest published data shows women make up 48.6 per cent of all staff.“We have made big improvements, but we recognise there is more to do.”Ofcom’s report brings together five years’ worth of data on ersity in the broadcasting sector.One area explored in the research was religion. Only 29 per cent of those employed by the main TV broadcasters consider themselves religious, with 34 per cent in radio, set against the UK benchmark of 48 per cent.The industry is more representative of the UK in terms of ethnicity than it was five years ago, the regulator said. However, there is “a woeful lack of ersity within senior positions and key decision makers”.Projections suggest that the proportion of TV employees who are disabled will fall over the next five years, and disabled people are less likely to be promoted. The lack of progress in achieving change “has been particularly true at a senior level”.Ofcom recommended that broadcasters consider setting retention targets in addition to recruitment targets. It also called for broadcasters to collect more data on the socio-economic background of staff.More from NewsScotland’s Covid vaccine passport plans could be blocked by judgeDrop-in mental health centres needed to help lockdown’s damaged childrenNurses demand more pay as NHS Scotland faces months of crisisPolice officer exploited Covid powers to murder Sarah EverardThe Brexit-hating global elite is watching Britain\u0026#39s chaos with gleeMystery of identical twins could be solved by genetic markings discoveryMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"course petrol stations should free hike prices demand high","story":"As I write, the petrol panic seems to be subsiding slowly. But could it have been resolved more rapidly had petrol stations felt more freedom to raise prices sharply to slim down queues?In normal times in most markets, when demand rises a little or supply is a little lower than normal, prices will rise. This is the healthy and efficient thing to happen. The increased price cuts back demand until it matches supply again, returning the market to what economists call “equilibrium”.Under some circumstances policymakers and public sentiment object to such price rises. For example, imagine there were three large supermarkets in a town. Any one supermarket could supply all shoppers but they compete, keeping prices down. Then one day there happen to be two accidents at two of the supermarkets, putting them out of action for two months. All the farmers and other suppliers can ert their products to the one remaining supermarket, so there is no shortage as such, but because that supermarket is now the sole supplier it can use that temporary monopoly power to raise prices sharply until the other two supermarkets come back on line.This kind of exploitation of temporary monopoly power in response to accidents, natural disasters or other such passing events is called “price gouging”. In some countries businessfolk attempting it get arrested. In other cases competition authorities intervene either at the time to prevent the behaviour or subsequently to punish the offending firm. Tax authorities may also apply windfall taxes.Not all such price rises are price gouging, however. When Covid hit, there was a sudden increase in demand for hand sanitizer. This wasn’t a case of some temporary loss of supply. It was an enduring rise in demand that lasted many months. The efficient thing to happen would have been for prices to rise sharply initially, to ration supply via price rather than by whoever happened to be at the front of the queue or greediest with their panic buying. Those higher prices would have created strong incentives to increase supply, and as that came rapidly on line prices would have fallen back.Unfortunately, UK competition authorities adopted the perverse posture of stating that they would keep a close eye on any rapid price rises in response to pandemic-related shortages, and punish firms that were deemed to have raised prices too much.That is likely to have had a chilling effect on price changes in response to other demand jumps. In particular, in the case of the petrol panic there was no shortage of fuel per se at all. There was merely a very temporary distribution issue with the transport of small amounts of that fuel to a few places where it was to be sold. In such a case the efficient thing to happen was for any petrol stations where people started queuing to raise prices sharply, until the queue disappeared. Anyone that didn’t strictly need to fuel their tank that first day could wait a day or two until prices were lower and the distribution issue had been resolved. Sufficiently sharp price rises would have eliminated the queues and prevented stores at stations being exhausted.One problem with that may have been limited flexibility or discretion from some franchised petrol station owners to raise prices by enough, quickly enough. But a bigger issue was probably the general policy environment and recent history of policymaker antipathy towards such price rises. Petrol stations would worry about the CMA punishing them or windfall taxes being applied.To address that, the government could have publicly stated, early in the crisis, that it had no objection to stations raising prices sharply to deter or reduce queues, and that it guaranteed there would be no competition authority or tax punishments later.Then prices would have risen, queues would have vanished, and people without urgent need would have waited to buy fuel when they actually required it.More from NewsScotland’s Covid vaccine passport plans could be blocked by judgeDrop-in mental health centres needed to help lockdown’s damaged childrenNurses demand more pay as NHS Scotland faces months of crisisPolice officer exploited Covid powers to murder Sarah EverardThe Brexit-hating global elite is watching Britain\u0026#39s chaos with gleeMystery of identical twins could be solved by genetic markings discoveryMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"modern politics has left starmer behind","story":"It was clear as soon as the opening video soundtrack beeped through the conference like a 1990s bank advert that Sir Keir Starmer had botched his chance. The leader’s conference speech was his big shot to reassure the nation that, after years of Remainer outrage and far-Left dogmatism, Labour is back. The country craves an Opposition that is emotionally in touch with the public and capable of responding to the strange times we are living through.Brexit and Covid have, in their different ways, propelled Britain into a new era. The Blairite years – which promised the end of ideology and ision, as Third Way centrism triumphed and everyone became middle-class – have given way to more fractious and unpredictable times.It was surreal then to see Keir Starmer parsing the last holder of his office to win an election as if nothing had changed since 1997, betraying none of the political instinct that made Blair such a success and which Boris Johnson so wishes he could emulate. Burning with lawyerly righteousness, Sir Keir vowed to be tough on crime. With a toothy grin he made a quip about education adopting a corporate frown, he pledged to make restoring Labour’s fiscal credibility his big priority.Perhaps Starmer couldn’t help but tip into a time warp, as he desperately edged away from sticky issues of the present. A credible leader would have detailed how a centre-Left government might manage endemic Covid without further trashing the economy. How it could put its Remainer past behind it, and in fact make more of Brexit than the disappointing incumbents.Seizing the moment, it would have also addressed the country’s suspicions about Whitehall’s mishandling of the net zero project. More broadly, it would have recognised that Labour’s big task is not to prove it can be trusted with the money (it is now clear that the Tories can’t either). It is to prove that it is in touch with ordinary people.Instead, unable to escape the weight of his own political baggage, Starmer appears to be incapable of speaking to the nation or articulating even the most basic story about today’s challenges.Having championed ruinous lockdowns and criticised the failure to enforce them earlier, Starmer was bizarrely compelled in his speech to skirt around, rather than hone in on, the state of the economy in the wake of the pandemic. Moreover, perhaps because his party faded into irrelevance during the pandemic, he seemed delusionally eager to frame Covid as an event from which we can now all move on to build a caring, socialist utopia. It would be more accurate to see the Covid years as an era that the country is still living through – somehow adapting to chronic risk, and rebuilding an economy hammered by lockdowns.Even more out of touch were Starmer’s passing references to Brexit. He talked mournfully about Britain dealing with its “aftermath” as if it were a tragedy comparable with Covid. His witterings about a “smart” government that “enlists the brilliance of scientific invention” made no mention of how, free from the EU, we can overhaul our intellectual property rules and free the robotics and genomics sectors from Brussels’ rules.It was, however, Starmer’s frenzied package of green policies that made him seem most disconnected from the public mood. Petrol queues and rising energy bills have spooked voters. Alarm is spreading through the country that No 10’s net zero mission could run down energy reserves and cause household bills to rise exorbitantly. The Opposition leader made no mention of this, instead vowing to go harder, with a Green New Deal, retrofitting for every home and bumper investment in the deep-sea wind sector. The grassroots will have liked it, although it will have done little to assuage the anger stoked up by his New Labour routine.Starmer is no doubt more than happy to be seen picking a fight with the Left, but his insipid leadership makes victory far from certain, and this lacklustre speech came just at the time rivals Angela Rayner and Andy Burnham are said to be plotting leadership challenges. His evasive, outdated politics has left him looking less than ever like PM material – something that will play on the minds of his colleagues in the PLP.More from NewsDrop-in mental health centres needed to help lockdown’s damaged childrenNurses demand more pay as NHS Scotland faces months of crisisPolice officer exploited Covid powers to murder Sarah EverardThe Brexit-hating global elite is watching Britain\u0026#39s chaos with gleeMystery of identical twins could be solved by genetic markings discoveryMinisters were warned before Sarah Everard murder that \u0026#39draconian\u0026#39 Covid laws gave police too much powerMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"national highways start legal action against insulate britain","story":"Ministers are set to seek a new blanket injunction against Insulate Britain protesters to halt their continued court-defying blockades of the M25.As the eco-activists occupied a junction of the motorway for a seventh day, government sources said they would be asking the judge to do away with having to serve injunctions on the protesters inidually.The move would expand the injunction already in place but which the protesters have defied to continue their protests on the M25. Yesterday they twice blocked the M25 at junction 3 in Kent – at 7.30am and again at 1pm – with a total of 27 people arrested.It emerged last night that National Highways has already served papers on protesters known to have breached the injunction, warning them that they faced prosecution for contempt of court if they did it again.“We are already knocking on doors and serving papers to offenders who will be sent to court and could face fines or prison,” said a government source.It is understood lawyers are confident they could imminently bring proceedings for contempt, which carries a maximum penalty of two years in jail andor an unlimited fine.The moves followed a cross-government summit convened on Wednesday by Priti Patel, the Home Secretary, and Grant Shapps, the Transport Secretary, amid growing concerns at the apparent failure to halt the Insulate Britain protests.Sources said Ms Patel emphasised the need swiftly to enforce existing laws including highway obstruction, public nuisance and conspiracy to endanger motorists, which can carry jail sentences.“The meeting considered the potential effectiveness of further injunctions, while also looking at what further powers might be required in order to protect the public from continued disruption,” said a Government source. “The contemptible antics of Insulate Britain are no laughing matter for the law-abiding majority whose daily lives are being impacted by their obstructive behaviour.“The police have our full support in clamping down on these dangerous protests. Across government we are working through the legal and legislative avenues available to ensure that these nonsensical demonstrations can be halted and the judgements of our courts respected.“Legal, peaceful demonstrations remain a cornerstone of our democracy, but occupying motorways and major roads, putting lives at risk and causing untold harm, is totally unacceptable.”Lisa Townsend, Surrey\u0027s Police and Crime Commissioner, said admitted it was “very difficult” for the police to bring charges. “If they charge the protesters with a relatively minor offence, it is likely to be discontinued but if they try to elevate the charge to a more serious one, they are finding it is not reaching the necessary threshold,” she said.More from NewsScotland’s Covid vaccine passport plans

Heres what he covered in his speech.Labour leader Keir Starmer gave a long-awaited speech to Labour conference Image: Ian Vogler   Daily MirrorByLizzy BuchanDeputy Online Political Editor:,  Sep Updated:,  Sep | commentsKeir Starmer has vowed to make this nation anew in a major conference speech where he described how his tool maker dad inspired his politics.The Labour leader joked that he had been waiting  months,  days and two hours to address party faithful at conference after last yearaposs gathering was axed due to Covid-.In a speech lasting around  minutes, Mr Starmer pledged to insulate all homes within the decade and to bring about an ambitious schools improvement programme. He spoke about how family and work were the two rocks of my le, as he described visiting his late mother Josephine in hospital, where she was a long-term patient. Mr Starmer also spoke about his father, who worked as a tool maker in factory, saying his example gave him deep respect for the dignity of work.  He contrasted his work at the Crown Prosecution Service with Boris Johnsonaposs background as a newspaper columnist - and branded the PM trivial and a showman with nothing to show. Mr Starmer was repeatedly heckled by a small group of delegates, with chants of shame and calls for a £ minimum wage. But he hit back and asked whether the detractors were shouting slogans, or changing lives. Hereaposs what Mr Starmer announced in his speech - and some other key moments. Insulation for all homes that need it Labour would insulate all homes that need it within the next decade to cut carbon emissions and save families up to £ a year in bills, the party said. The plan would see  million homes upgraded in  years, requiring £bn-a-year in investment. It would be funded by huge public borrowing as part of a £bn-a-year investment in fighting climate change over a decade.They appear similar to the Warm Homes For All scheme announced under Jeremy Corbyn in , which also pledged grants for low-income households - and also would have cost £bn over a decade.If we are serious about climate change we will need to upgrade our homes, he said. So it will be Labour’s national mission over the next decade, to fit out every home that needs it, to make sure it is warm, well-insulated and costs less to heat and we will create thousands of jobs in the process. He also pledged to introduce a Clean Air Act and said everything Labour did in Government would have to meet a net zero test. It comes after a commitment from shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves to spend an extra £ billion each year helping Britain tackle the climate change crisis under Labour. Mental health treatment within a monthPeople will be able to get vital mental health treatment within a monththey need it under a Labour Government.Mr Starmer pledged to help one million additional people get access to mental health support by funding , new staff each year. He warned that the crisis in mental health was one of the most urgent needs of our time, saying: Labour will guarantee that support will be available in less than a month.  We’ll recruit the mental health staff that we need. Labour will set a new NHS target to ensuring patients get appropriate treatment – not simply an initial assessment of needs – within a month of referral. And mental health hubs will be put into schools and in the community to help children and young people. A radical plan for schools Mr Starmer gave a jokey nod to Tony Blairaposs education, education, education speech, by saying: Education is so important I am tempted to say it three times. He said he wanted every parent in the country to be able to send their child to a great state school and promised most ambitious school improvement plan in a generation. He said he wanted to see more focus on practical skills, and vowed to reinstate two weeks of compulsory work experience. Labour would also guarantee that every young person gets to see a careers advisor and also ensure children get a chance to play competitive sport and learn music. Protecting working people from unfair tax burden The Labour leader sought to reassure voters the party could be trusted with the public finances and vowed to protect working people from being crippled by taxes. He said: I take the responsibility of spending your money very seriously. That’s why our approach to taxation will be governed by three principles. The greater part of the burden should not fall on working people. The balance between smaller and larger businesses should be fair. And we will chase down every penny to ensure that people working people, paying their taxes always get value for money.  Making Brexit workMr Starmer, a former shadow Brexit Secretary, blasted the PM for his botched deal.He said: The government is learning that it is not enough to Get Brexit Done. You need a plan to Make Brexit Work. I do see a way forward after Brexitwe invest in our people and our places,we deploy our technology cleverly andwe build the affordable homes we so desperately need. But the public finances we will inherit will need serious repair work. He did not give further details on how this would be done. AskedLabour would renegotiate Brexit, Mr Starmeraposs spokesman said: No. Family and work as the rocks of my le Mr Starmer rfed on his dadaposs work as a toolmaker throughout the speech, in which he vowed to make Britain anew. He said family and work were the two rocks of my le in his most personal speech yet. Mr Starmer told party faithful that his father gave me a deep respect for the dignity of work as he spoke about his background. He said: I learnt it round the kitchen table.cI learnt it at home, from my dad. How pride derives from work.  How work is the bedrock of a good economy and how a good economy is an essential partner of a good society. He also spoke movingly about his mum Josephine, who was a nurse and a long-term NHS patient with Stillaposs Disease. He said the NHS that was her livelihood became her leline and described visiting her in intensive care where nurses were keeping her alive. Family le taught him about the dignity of work and the nobility of care, he said. A jibe at Corbyn with a aposserious plan for GovernmentaposMr Starmer sought to put clear red water between himself and Jeremy Corbyn with a not so veiled jibe at his predecessor.To huge applause from some activists, he said: To the voters who thought we were unpatriotic or irresponsible or that we looked down on them, I say these simple but powerful words. We will never under my leadership go into an election with a manesto that is not a serious plan for government.He also reeled off the achievements of the last Labour Government under Tony Blair - and jokingly nodded to Mr Blairaposs famous education, education, education speech.Comment MORE ON Labour Party ConferenceKeir StarmerLabour PartyPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

And under my leadership we are committed to both. “I can promise you that under my leadership Labour will be back in business.” Here are the policies his party announced this week.  SCHOOLS : Labour would raise taxes on private schools to pay for better state education. Keir Starmer has said he would end the charity status of private schools, which would bring in £.bn factoring in VAT and business rates. He also unveiled “the most ambitious school improvement plan ever”, including thousands of extra teachers. Ofsted would also be asked to refocus on struggling schools.

Mr Starmer said a Labour Government would improve on Mr Johnsonaposs Brexit deal, adding: The government is learning that it is not enough to Get Brexit Done. You need a plan to Make Brexit Work.ECONOMY: Labour would phase out business rates and replace it with a modern business tax. Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves said she would launch a review of all tax breaks, underlining Labour would target tech firmsapos huge profits, buy-to-let landlords and those who make millions from trading stocks and shares.ENVIRONMENT : A Labour Government would invest £bn a year on making the UK more green, with cash to be targeted at including offshore wind farms, planting trees and developing batteries. If we delay action by a decade the costs of climate transition will double, said Mr Starmer.CRIME: The Labour leader underlined Labour would become the party of law and order. He said: Today Iaposm here to tell you what I stand for. But I also want to tell you what I won’t stand for. I won’t stand for the  million incidents of anti-social behaviour this year. I won’t stand for the record levels of kne crime that we have in this country today. And I won’t stand  out of  crimes going unsolved. Labour would back a pro bono service to compel firms to offer a certain amount of free legal advice to those who need it. The Labour leader restated his partyaposs policy that it would fast-track rape and serious sexual assault cases and we will toughen sentences for rapists, stalkers and domestic abusers. DEFENCE : Shadow Defence Secretary John Healey said Labour would use the £ million on supporting Afghan interpreters and veteransapos mental health. The cash for town halls would come from cancelled MoD interpreter contracts.HEALTH : Labour would double the current funding for dementia research, shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth announced, and would seek to “build a national care service” in the image of the NHS. Anyone needing mental health treatment would get it from the NHS within a month under a Labour Government. Keir Starmeraposs plan for mental health includes recruiting , new staff and putting an open access mental health hub for children and young people in communities. A Labour Government would introduce a healthy living index to track happiness. Shadow culture secretary Jo Stevens said as the Office for Budget Responsibility tracks spending the index would monitor wellbeing and help government make better decisions.HOMES : A Labour Government would slash affordable rents and give first-time buyers exclusive rights to purchase new-build homes for six months. Declaring Labour the “party of home ownership” Mr Starmer said first-time local buyers would get priority. Mr Starmer also revealed Labour would upgrade insulation for up to  million homes. It will aim to deliver greener homes, lower bills and require an annual investment of £ billion. He said it will be Labour’s national mission over the next decade, to fit out every home that needs it, to make sure it is warm, well-insulated and costs less to heat.WORKERSapos RIGHTS : Labour would boost fairness at work with new laws introduced within the first  days of Labour winning a general election. Plans include bringing workers and employers together to negotiate pay and conditions in every sector. Labour says it would also increase statutory sick pay, back rights to flexible working and hand employers day-one rights. Labouraposs deputy leader AngelA Rayner said the measures would restore common decency in the workplace.Read moreComment MORE ON Labour PartyNHSEuropean UnionEd MilibandJohn HealeyEducationSchoolsMental healthPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Yet Government officials and scientists did not include them on the vaccine priority list. Speaking at the Labour Conference fringe event, Britain Talks, Darren Lewis, Assistant Editor of The Mirror, said: “This country doesn’t listen when Black and Asian people die of Covid. “We wring our hands and we get upset about it but when vaccine priorities come out and you look down that list you don’t see any Black or brown people eligible for those vaccines, because it wants to say it’s listening but it doesn’t actually listen.”  Earlier this year medical groups representing ethnic minority NHS staff had called for ethnic minorities to be prioritised in the Covid vaccine rollout with a letter backed by  healthcare organisations. They had called on the Government to put them in category six out of the nine priority groups for the vaccine.

He offered a vision for the country based on strong values, and proved he is a credible Prime Minister in waiting. It was a serious speech for serious times. The contrast with Boris Johnson couldn’t be greater. While Mr Johnson lunges from one crisis to the next and demeans his office with his arrogant disregard for the rules, Mr Starmer displayed a quiet confidence and a politics steeped in decency and dignity. The hecklers only drew attention to the fact they are now on the margins of the party. Do you agree  Have your say in the comment section  He does not pretend to be a glamorous politician who plays to the crowd. But he is a principled man who is genuine in his desire to create a fairer and more prosperous Britain. It was clear from the conference hall that Labour is once again hungry for power. Strong performances by the likes of Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves and Shadow Home Secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds showed Starmer has assembled a Cabinet in waiting. The party had its ups and downs this week but it leaves Brighton on the road to recovery. Sarah agony The impact statements by the parents of Sarah Everard are heart-breaking. Their poignant words laid bare the torment they will always have to shoulder after she was murdered by Wayne Couzens. It is dficult to comprehend the trauma of losing a loved one in such a barbaric way.  That agony was made even worse by the fact this crime was committed by someone who was supposed to keep the public safe. If any good can come out of such an act of evil it must be doing everything possible to protect women and girls from violence. Basque in glory Buying expensive undies is better for the environment apparently. You can raise the temperature in the bedroom without adding to global warming.Comment MORE ON PoliticsLabour Party ConferenceLabour PartyKeir Starmer\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

I could sense the urgency in the conversation of the four nurses on my mum’s bed, he said. I knew without being told that they were keeping her alive.I can hardly convey to you the emotion of seeing your mum in that condition.  Sir Keiraposs mum Josephine Baker was diagnosed with Stillaposs disease as a youngster. The condition is a rare form of inflammatory arthritis which severely restricts mobility. As his we Victoria watched, he also spelt out more about his personal le to the audience in Brighton. He felt a moment of horrible irony going to visit his mum in hospital wanting to tell her about his achievements without knowing she was fighting for her le.I had just picked up an award for work on the death penalty I’d been doing which in my own small way was about trying to save people’s lives. I’d gone to the hospital hoping to tell my mum about it. And there in front of me, those four nurses were working to save her le. Ms Baker died just two weeks before Sir Keir was elected as an MP for Holborn and St Pancras in . The Labour leader lted the lid on his personal le in the most important speech of his le. Read more He said family and work are the two rocks of his le, with his tool maker dad who gave him a deep respect for the dignity of work. Every time I enter a high-tech factory, I wonder what my dad would make of it. Not so long ago we shaped metal by drilling it, milling it and turning it.I remember my dad working with a spark eroder submerging metal in liquid and using an electrical charge to shape it.And his mum who gave him an ethic of service even though my mum was also, unfortunately, a long-term patient of the NHS. During the touching speech Sir Keir was heckled. At one point he retaliated saying: Shouting slogans or changing lives conference. The Labour leader had been apparently keen to show members and the nation more of himself.

news politics keir-starmer-promises-patriotic-responsible-\"Starmer says Johnson is a ‘trickster who has performed his one trick’ByPippa Crerar, Political Editor in Brighton:,  Sep | commentsKeir Starmer has urged former Labour voters toto the party promising to fight the next election with a serious plan for running the country.In a powerful speech to his party’s conference in Brighton, the Labour leader faced down left-wing hecklers and closed the door firmly on the Jeremy Corbyn era.He reached out to voters who switched to the Tories at the last election telling them Labour would again be a patriotic, pro-business party that took care with taxpayers’ money.In a sign of the changing direction of the party, he praised Tony Blair ’s record in office. “You want levelling up  That’s levelling up,” he told them.What do you make of Mr Starmeraposs speech  Join the discussion in the comment section  There were big new policy pledges on mental health treatment, school standards and £bn over ten years on home insulation and double glazing saving families £ a year on bills.And he dismissed Boris Johnson as “a showman with nothing left to show” as he contrasted his values with those of the Prime Minister.Putting the Government on notice, he told the PM: “Either get a grip or get out of the way and let us clear up this mess”.  Mr Starmer’s first conference address, billed as the most important of his political le, sought to define the future of Labour under his leadership. It ended a week in which he forced through rule changes to strengthen his own grip on the party and saw the departure of the last Corbynite in his shadow cabinet. The Labour leader faced down protesters chanting “oh Jeremy Corbyn” and calling for the national minimum wage to rise to £.  “At this time on a Wednesday it’s normally the Tories who are heckling me [at Prime Minister’s Questions]. It doesn’t bother me then, doesn’t bother me now,” he told them. After yet more heckles he said they had a choice between “shouting slogans or changing lives”. To the anger of the Left, he promised to never again to go into an election “with a manesto that is not a serious plan for government”.  In a frank admission of the party’s failings under his predecessor, he admitted voters who abandoned Labour in  thought it was “unpatriotic or irresponsible” . His summer tour round the country had shown him some people “reluctantly chose the Tories because they didn’t believe our promises were credible”. He told the voters: “It will not take another election defeat for the Labour party to become an alternative government in which you can trust.  “My job as leader is not just to say thank you to the voters who stayed with us. It is to understand and persuade the voters who rejected us.” And he told his own party: “If theare so bad, what does it say about us  Because after all in  we lost to them, and we lost badly. “I know that hurts each and every one of you. So, let’s get totally serious about this.”  In his -minute address, Mr Starmer contrasted his own seriousness and competence in his former role as Director of Public Prosecutions with Boris Johnson’s frivolity. “I don’t think Boris Johnson is a bad man. I think he is a trivial man. I think he’s a showman with nothing left to show,” he said.He said the PM assumed that he didn’t need to stick to the same rules as everybody  - highlighting his defence of Dominic Cummings ’ visit to Barnard Castle. Later, he joked: “My dad was a toolmaker. Although in a way, so was Boris Johnson’s!” Mr Starmer, , opened up about his upbringing, including how he was the first member of his family to go to university.

The Labour leader credited them with teaching him “how to keep your dignity under severe pressure”. Watched by his we Victoria from the front row, Mr Starmer gave a deeply personal speech in which he described how his toolmaker father had given him respect for the dignity of work.  He opened up about the death of his mum Josephine, describing the moment he saw four nurses rushing to save her le. “The NHS that had been her livelihood became her leline,” he said.Mr Starmer, the former shadow Brexit secretary who pushed for a second referendum which turned many voters away from Labour, tackled the thorny issue head-on.“The economic inheritance from the Tories will be appalling: A botched Brexit followed by Covid has left a big hole,” he said. “The Government is learning that it is not enough to Get Brexit Done. You need a plan to Make Brexit Work.” He also reclaimed the mantle of patriotism with praise for NATO and the armed forces - but also for footballer Marcus Rashford who campaigned for free school meals and took the knee. “I couldn’t believe it when Rashford and the England team took the knee to highlight and condemn the racism they have had to endure, the Home Secretary encouraged people to boo. “Well, here in this conference hall we are patriots. When we discuss the fine young men and women who represent all our nations, we don’t boo.

The Labour leader received a standing ovation from parts of the hall when he told the small number of antagonists: Shouting slogans, or changing lives, conference  Mr Starmer was interrupted several times during his major Labour conference speech, with the loudest heckles coming just after he talked about his late mother Josephineaposs battle with Still’s Disease. He recalled seeing her in intensive care with her bed a riot of tubes and temperature devices - and knowing that nurses were keeping her alive. Carole Vincent, a Labour member from the Leyton and Wanstead area, was holding up a red piece of paper during the speech and heckled immediately after the story, as the MP went on to speak about recognising nurses. She said: Every time he said something that I felt deserved a red cardIaposm showing him the red card every time. Andy McDonald has stepped down and given his resignation letter. Whyaposs he done that  Thataposs because he was being told to not support a £ minimum wage. How are people supposed to live  She added: He doesnapost challenge [the end of Universal Credit] and heaposs not challenging the fact that itaposs because itaposs going to leave people in a desperate situation. Earlier in the Labour leaderaposs speech, a single heckler started singing Oh Jeremy Corbyn from the balcony, to cries of “oh shut up from a handful of delegates. Another shouted, It was your Brexit policy! when he said that Labour had lost support in . Other hecklers then shouted “£!” - a reference to calls for a £ minimum wage which the leader rejected - as he spoke about poverty pay. Mr Starmer joked that “at this time on a Wednesday, it’s normally the Tories who are heckling me in a reference to his usual PMQs clash with Boris Johnson The leader was also booed when he joked that Sunday - when he pushed through rule changes - was “particularly nerve-wracking”… because of Arsenal’s - victory over Tottenham. The loudest heckles in the early part of the speech appeared to come from a handful of delegates directly in front of the leader, a few rows back from his podium in Brighton.  Supporters of the Labour leader suggested the protest may have been organised, after a leaflet encouraged members to “show Starmer the RED CARD” an hour before his speech. A spokesman for Sir Keir insisted the hecklers were a “small number of people” who “didn’t knock Keir Starmer off his stride”. Asked why the hecklers were not removed he said: “It was a small number of people so it needs to be kept in proportion.” The conference was riven by factional warfare after the Labour leader pushed through rule changes giving MPs tighter control on who can run for party leader. Relations with the left collapsed further after Andy McDonald quit the shadow cabinet to support a motion calling for a £ legal minimum wage - which passed last night. Former Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell branded the conference a “s***show” and accused Mr Starmer of going back on his promises. Former leader Jeremy Corbyn accused his successor of wanting to “prop up” the wealthy and powerful. But Mr Starmer denied his party was more ided than ever. In a damning attack on his predecessor - who he did not mention by name - he said: “We will never under my leadership go into an election with a manesto that is not a serious plan for government.” Comment MORE ON Labour Party ConferenceKeir Starmer\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

This afternoon he displayed his own craftsmanship as he set about turning Labour into a force which is ready for government. He was helped in his mission by the repeated heckling from the few members of the audience who remain loyal to the Corbyn cause.Their interruptions only succeeded in drawing attention to how marginalised they have become and how much the party has changed under Starmer’s leadership. His put down the hecklers - should we be “shouting slogans or changing lives ” - showed Labour had moved from a party of protest to a party hungry for power. How do you think Starmer did at conference  Have your say in the comments below  You knew the left had lost the internal battle at the huge cheers which greeted Starmer as he reeled off the achievements of the Tony Blair government. There was applause too for Starmer’s support for the armed forces, his emphasis on patriotism and the strong stance on law and order - all issues that matter to Red Wall voters which were barely mentioned during the Corbyn years. After waiting for  months to deliver his first address in person as Labour leader it was understandable that Starmer had a lot to get off his chest. Many will feel that he was so desperate to catch up on lost time that the speech was too long and unfocused. There was a scattering of policy announcements but there was nothing which could be said to define the essence of Starmerism. Where it succeeded was when he drew a contrast between his responsible approach to politics and the trivial attitude of Boris Johnson. We learned a lot about the values which drive him and his vision for a country that respects dignity in work, cares for its young and elderly, and prizes security and equality. The next challenge is transform these beliefs into goods which be sold to voters on the doorstep. Today’s task was to lay the foundations for an electoral recovery. There is more work to be done before the construction is completed and Labour can once again open its doors to visitors.

Woodson and the Association for the Study of Negro Le and History.As time has gone on, it has evolved and grown to become a universal event.Now formally recognised as “Black History Month”, the observance has since received official recognition in the United States, Canada, Ireland, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom.Black History Month helps give context to modern le and the countryaposs history, whilst championing the experiences and celebrating the contributions of Black Britons here in the UK.When is Black History Month Despite Black History Month being celebrated in the United States from February , till March , it is observed later during the year in the UK. In fact, Britain’s Black History Month takes place from October , to October .During this time, ious events are set to take place, such as art exhibitions honouring black artists and special university lectures. Most schools have yet to introduce Black History Month into their curriculum, and the majority of them will continue to follow the traditional history curriculum. Campaigners have been calling for black history to be included in the national curriculum for years now. Why is Black History Month in October  The British version of Black History Month was first observed in October , and has, as a result, continued to follow the October dates since.  was also a year which marked the th anniversary of Caribbean emancipation, the centenary of the birth of Jamaican activist, Marcus Garvey, and the th anniversary of the Organisation of African Unity. How did Black History Month start   The observation was first organised through the leadership of Ghanaian-born analyst Akyaaba Addai-Sebo. He served as a coordinator of special projects for the Greater London Council. As it was being celebrated for the first time in the late s in London, American activist, Dr Maulana Karenga, was invited at County Hall to mark the contributions of Black people throughout history. Consequently, Akyaaba created a plan aiming to recognise the contributions of African, Asian and Caribbean people to the economic, cultural and political le in the UK. More recently Black History Month has been commemorated as an opportunity to share, and spread awareness and understanding on the impact of black heritage and culture nationwide. Black History Month UK organisation wrote on their website: “This year’s Black History Month in October is more important than ever. “It’s not just a month to celebrate the continued achievements and contributions of Black people to the UK and around the world. “It’s also a time for continued action to tackle racism, reclaim Black history, and ensure Black history is represented and celebrated all year round. “As  showed, and  continues to show, Black history is being made every day, in all kinds of ways. “To shine a spotlight on Black history in the making, Black History Month UK magazine is inviting Black people around the UK to share their stories and experiences.”Get the news you want straight to your inbox. for a Mirror newsletter here.

Heather Riches, , and her partner Sam Heemsbergen, , purchased their first home in Evesham, Worcestershire, for £, in . But the house was not in a liveable condition, with no sewage system, central heating or even a working toilet, so freelance illustrator Heather and tree surgeon Sam got straight to work. Although they wanted to do most of the work themselves, they did receive tips from Heatheraposs father, who is a trained carpenter, and his electrician friend helped rewire their entire home.What do you think about the incredible transformation  Let us know in the comments...Heather said: We decided to strip the whole house back and stay living with my parents to renovate as much as possible before we moved in. We managed to buy a lot of things second-hand, such as the old tiles for the porch and bricks. We found reclaimed pieces with a subtle patina were much more in keeping with the house. For us, the most challenging part was financing the renovation. We have learned so much along the way and think we might have avoided some costly mistakeswe planned the work a bit better.  In an ideal world, we would have fitted central heating first before plastering the whole house, but for us, this wasnapost financially viable. Physically, the most challenging part was digging a three-metre deep hole for the sewage treatment tank and our least favourite job was the plastering. First, Heather and Sam insulated the exterior walls before plastering them, giving them a brand new canvas to work on. Then, they installed a new sewage treatment and drainage system, digging everything out by hand to keep their costs down.

For the living room, the couple removed their old s fireplace and installed a wood burner but kept the original vintage brick design. Heather installed another layer of glass on the windows, making them double glazed for some extra warmth. In total, the couple took two years to renovate their home and they spent a total of just under £, but they are pleased with the final results. Heather said: We are so happy with the outcome, I canapost quite believe itaposs ours to call home. There are still so many things we plan on doing, but after looking at old photos of what the house was like it makes me realise how much weaposve accomplished over the years. We are now saving to pay for new wooden windows my Dad is going to make, which for the materials we are going to budget £,. In the future, I plan on converting the outside stores into a workshop but building supply costs have gone up and Iaposm not too sure how much this will cost.Do you have a story to share  Weaposd love to hear all about it.

Using his Covid mask to hide his face, it was impossible to seethe former Met Police officer was showing any emotion. Sarah’s parents and sister sat in the well of the court staring intently at the monster who so cruelly took her from them. You could sense their frustration at being unable to look evil Couzens in the eye. So when Sarah’s dad Jeremy stood to deliver his victim impact statement, he was determined to face his daughter’s killer. “Mr Couzens, please look at me,” he said to the defendant. There was silence in the court as Couzens raised his head and looked into Jeremy’s eyes. For the first time, there was a sign of emotion from the killer. He began shaking and appeared to sob.  The moment was so powerful it moved some in the public gallery to tears. More tears, this time from hardened court staff and journalists, flowed as Sarah’s sister Katie also told Couzens: “Please look at me.” She broke down only once during her statement, as she spoke of her regret at not being able to save her sister.

Thataposs when the pair refused to stand by, and rushed to help him.  We walked faster at that point, just in case anyone was actually there and in trouble and when we saw the man in the water holding onto a branch, we just immediately started to help him out, Ellie said. The pair formed a human chain to help haul him out of the water. “Ellie had hold of me and I reached out and grabbed the man, Khloe said. I was worried that when he let go of the branch I might lose my grip and he would have gone down the river. “It was very scary. All the time I had hold of Khloe I was saying ‘please don’t fall’, Ellie added.The Mirror is committed to more hopeful news.

For a limited time, it’s acquired an edge, a kick, a fiery twist to tantalise your tastebuds. Introducing the Zinger Popcorn Bucket.Trialled in ten lucky locations in April, it proved so popular it’s now officially launching across the UK, so that everyone can feel the burn! But where are the spice fiends who’ll be going straight off to order it, and which of us Brits are more chary with the chilli  SPICE UP YOUR LIFE KFC surveyed the nation’s spice preferences, asking residents in Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, London, the North East, North West, Yorkshire, East Midlands, West Midlands, East of England, South East and South West how spicy they like their food. The results show that it’s Londoners who have the biggest appetite for heat:  per cent of those in the capital said they like their food to be nice and spicy or even to feel their mouths on fire. The Scots and West Midlanders are runners-up in their love of the burn, at  and  per cent respectively. But spice is off the menu in Yorkshire: around one in five people declared that they prefer their food mild – the highest number of any region surveyed. Hot on their heelswere those in the East of England. The survey also revealed the gap between people’s estimation of their own region’s appetite for spice and the reality. Residents of Northern Ireland were widest off the mark, guessing that only  per cent would like fiery food, whereas the true figure was  per cent. In contrast,  per cent of those in the North West thought their population would love serious spice, but it was actually a mere  per cent. London and the West Midlands came out top when people were asked which region they thought would have the greatest penchant for spicy food, and they were broadly right. But those in the South West were wrongly assumed to have the least tolerance for the tingle factor. And what about you  Can you take the heat  If you’re a dance-till-dawn, touch-of-the-hedonist kind of person who loves food that makes your eyes widen and your tongue take notice, the Zinger Popcorn Bucket is your order of dreams. If you get your kicks from breaking in your new lambswool slippers in front of Call the Midwe, and your flavour frisson comes from a sprinkling of parsley... maybe not so much.

Made of gilt bronze and cut glass, the chandelier features  lights in two tiers and distinctive cut-glass ornaments in the shape of tassels hanging from the top. The impressive installation is believed to have been commissioned by George IV for the saloon at the Royal Pavilion in Brighton when he was Prince Regent.  It was moved several times but was finally hung in the Crimson Drawing Room at Windsor Castle in , on the orders of the Queenaposs grandmother Queen Mary. Damaged in the  fire at the castle, much of what remains is modern restoration. The semi-state rooms at the Berkshire royal residence are open to visitors from Thursday September  until March and entrance to them is included with a ticket to the castle. Staff were also pictured cleaning the th-century gilt bronze candelabra in the scarlet-coloured room.  The drawing room, which was also damaged in the  blaze, boasts stunning views across the surrounding countryside from its large windows. The semi-state rooms were originally George IVaposs private apartments and are among the most richly decorated interiors at the castle. They are used by the Queen and members of the royal family for official entertaining. Another of the semi-state rooms being prepped was the Green Drawing Room, which is often the backdrop for official royal photographs. It was where the wedding portraits of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex were taken in . The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh were also pictured there together to commemorate the Diamond Jubilee.

And it appears Kate choice of sparkling dress was a sweet nod to her late mother-in-law Princess Diana, who wore an extremely similar style of gown to a Bond screening in .Diana attended the British premiere of A View To A Kill, starring Roger Moore, where she wore an eye-catching silver dress - similar in style to Kateaposs - by Bruce Oldfield with matching silver shoes.Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up .She too paired the dress with a beautul pair of gold earrings for the appearance in Londonaposs Leicester Square.Author Elizabeth Holmes, who has written a book on royal style, pointed out the similarities between the gowns on Instagram.One royal fan wrote: Seriously stunning and love the nod to Diana!. While another said: Love it so much! And how much it resembles Diana’s - the best!  Kate often appears to pay tribute to the late Diana through her outfits and is often spotted wearing her jewellery. Of course, Kateaposs dazzling sapphire and diamond engagement ring is the one that once belonged to Diana. When it came to the other royals on the red carpet last night, Camilla opted for a pale blue corseted chfon dress with silver embroidery by Bruce Oldfield. While both William and his dad Charles looked very -like in black tuxedos.  No Time To Die is the th instalment of the spy series and is Craigaposs fth and final outing as Bond. It has faced more than a year of delays due to the Covid- outbreak, but is being released in UK cinemas on Thursday. It takes place after Bond has left active service and is enjoying a tranquil le in Jamaica when his old friend Felix Leiter, played by Jeffrey Wright, from the CIA turns up asking for help. A mission to rescue a kidnapped scientist turns out to be far more treacherous than expected, leading to a mysterious villain armed with dangerous new technology. A number of healthcare workers and members of the armed forces joined the royals and the cast in the auditorium to watch the film last night as a thank you for their work during the Covid pandemic. The world premiere also benefited charities supporting serving and former members of the three intelligence agencies - the Secret Intelligence Service, the Security Service and GCHQ - as well as charities supporting past and present members of the UK Special Forces.

The outburst was caught on CCTV at Chicken Bazooka in Liverpool City Centre at around .pm on Saturday.It started when the man - who claimed he was a bouncer - reportedly didnapost pay for his food and was asked to leave, Liverpool Echo reports. He can be seen pushing the till off the counter as another customer tries to calm him down. Mustafa Alliabi said his dad Nizar, , who owns the takeaway, was forced to pick up a paddle, which is used to take pizzas in and out of the oven, to defend himself.  Mustafa, , told the Liverpool Echo: It was Saturday night, it was quite busy and he was waiting for his food. Usually, the procedure is you order your food, you pay for it, and then the food gets prepared. My dad asked him to pay and he didnapost pay. He was talking to someone and then he said aposwhereaposs my food  And my dad said aposyouaposve still not paid for your foodapos.  Mustafa said then the man started mouthing off and swearing before he was asked to leave. Mustafa said: My dad asked him to leave and thataposs when he responded aposIaposm a bouncer you donapost ask me to leaveapos - and thataposs when it escalated. The unbelievable footage shows the man picking up a red metal bar stool and hurling it in Nizaraposs direction, before going back and picking up a second stool.  The man threw a total of three stools across the restaurant as two customers tried to intervene. Merseyside Police said the man then fled the shop. He is described as a black male, around ft tall, who was wearing all black clothing. Mustafa said his dad was left with bruising down his left arm and a cut to his leg as a result of what happened.  He added: The fact heaposs thrown three stools at people in itself shows he doesnapost care what happensthat hits people. If that had hit someone in the head or in the face itaposs game over. He tried to get into the kitchen but the door was locked. What worries me the most ishe got into the kitchen I donapost know what he would have done. Detective Inspector Chris Saidi said: “We simply will not tolerate such violence towards people simply carrying out their business in our communities and we are working to find the man responsible and bring him to justice. “If you were in the Mount Pleasant area on Saturday night and witnessed the incident, or saw the man described making off from the area, then please let us know. “Similarlyyou captured any mobile phone or dashcam footage when driving on Mount Pleasant then please contact us. Information you hold could be vital to our enquiries.”Anyone who witnessed the incident is asked to contact @MerPolCC, on Twitter, Merseyside Police Contact Centre on Facebook or ring  quoting reference .Alternatively, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on   , or via their website.

Ryan Caine, who is originally from Liverpool but now lives in Glasgow, came to visit the city with his dad who he cares for. The -year-old claims he paid £. a night for two nights at the Adelphi Hotel from Saturday, September  to Sunday, September .Ryan said after a visit to Stoke-on-Trent, the pair decided to visit Liverpool as his dad had never been and he could also visit his mum, Liverpool Echo reports.However, they were not pleased with what they found in his hotel room. Photos of the hotel room show the fire alarm suspended from the ceiling with the wire exposed and yellow stains on the walls. Have you had a nightmare hotel stay  Email webnews@mirror Ryan said: From Stoke-on-Trent we decided to go to Liverpool, [my dad] has never been to Liverpool and I was seeing my ma. We got the Adelphi for two nights, £ and it is meant to be a good hotel. When we got to the hotel our hotel door was open before we could even put our key in it. Then when we got in it, the fire alarm was suspended from the ceiling and there were exposed wires. The walls had nicotine stains and so did the ceiling. There were cracks on the bathroom tiles and on the ceiling and there was damp on the ceiling in the bedroom too. Ryan claims he and his dad also asked for a fan as it was hot in the room, but it was not provided. He said: There were no fridge, no fan and it was hot because it was the end of September. We went downstairs and asked for a fan and they said apossorry we donapost provide thatapos and for the price we paid for, youaposd expect to have a fan. Every other place we stayed in had a fanwe asked for one they would give you one or there would be one in the room. They said there would be clean bedding or towels in the wardrobe - there was nothing in the wardrobe. Ryan said the key cards they were given for their hotel room also kept cutting out and this meant they would have to keep going down to reception to sort it. You have to go back downstairs and wait in a long line because several coaches might have come in just to get a new key card, he explained. The carer said his dad also did not really enjoy himself either. All together it was hot, it smelt damp, and the fire alarm kept going off every five seconds because it was so low and I donapost know why but I think people were trying to go up the fire escape for a ciggie or something.

And Emily Hart’s donor and dad Richard hopes to raise £, for hospitals for her “kidney-versary”, including by running Sunday’s London Marathon. Emily, , was born with kidney failure but battled on with medication and dialysis until she was seven. Her family were then told she needed a transplant or may die.

Because of the transplant and the great care she has had, Emily has done remarkably well.”Have you got an uplting story to tell  Email webnews@mirror  She is now a paediatric nurse at London’s Great Ormond Street Hospital. Richard said: “I’m so proud of her. She takes it all in her stride. What she has managed to achieve blows my mind.” Emily said: “Dad is the most generous, caring person in the whole world. He would do anything for anyone – it’s just in his nature. He said he would donate his kidney to me againhe could.”  Emily is preparing to have another kidney transplant, hopefully this year.

Alan Pritchard, , from Pembroke Dock in south Wales, rescued his best pal Kane through German Shepherd Rescue Elite five years ago. But now Alan spends half-a-grand each month to give Kane a fighting chance against Fibrocartilaginous embolism . The condition causes matter from the spinal disc to migrate into the circulatory system, blocking vessels in the spine. Experts are unsure of the cause of the condition, but symptoms can develop after minor injuries or trauma. Alan was advised to put Kane to sleep two years ago when he was nine after his legs gave out due to old age. But the -year-old wasnapost ready to give up on Kane and sought out canine back treatments.He told TeamDogs : I found an FCE group on Facebook where people were recommending hydrotherapy and acupuncture, so we got in touch with a local vet who offered these services and we have been with them ever since. We only see one vet now because Kane was people reactive when we got him. He was tied up on a farm and wearing a prong collar. The farmer had died and his we had gone into a hospice, so Kane was taken in to rescue. Oak Vets started him off with acupuncture and hydrotherapy on a treadmill but then he broke his dewclaw. He had two hydrotherapy sessions and it became ulcerated. We treated it for  months and it would just not heal and during that time he couldnapost continue with his hydrotherapy. He had also started having canine massages. Abi worked very hard with him and we did physio at home with him. Oak Vets thought he had FCE because he had no feeling in his feet, so we had him referred to Langford Vets in Bristol where he was diagnosed and had to stay for a week. Kaneaposs ulcer was still not healed after  months, so vets recommended his leg be amputated last September. Straight after the amputation, he was trying to run around. He gets around quite well on three legs. He only goes out on his wheels occasionally because after five or ten minutes he starts to drag his back leg. I have to keep him on his lead when he is on his wheels in case he tips them up. We were also advised to take him to see a doggy chiropractor as the masseuse was finding it hard to work deep on him. So we got in touch with one and the results when she visits him are amazing. When she has realigned his vertebrae heaposs like a young dog again. We donapost notice the gradual decline so we book him in every  weeks. Kaneaposs weekly treatment schedule includes a canine massage every two weeks, with hydrotherapy pool and physio sessions with Running Free. Over the past two years Alan says he and we Judith have spent a small fortune on the pooch. Alan says £-£ of his state pension goes towards his best palaposs treatment. My state pension goes on him. We bought him the best wheels we could find. We donapost keep tabs on what we have spent on him but itaposs probably five figures, but in  months we have spent a fortune. Heaposs such a happy boy, he is just an incredible dog and is very strong-willed. Our special thanks go to Caroline Gardner at Oak Vets Haverfordwest, Abi Fernandez at A.F Therapy, Simon and Lisa Mazengarb of Running Free Animal Physiotherapy and last but not least Sarah Wilkinson McTimoney Animal Chiropractor.Comment MORE ON PensionsState pensionTherapyBig DogsDogs\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Calling all dog lovers!to TeamDogs for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.Invalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Shocking video footage shows the moment the thug targeted the mum-of-two, , at the family-run garage on Haverstock Hill in Belsize Park, London. The last drops of fuel had been dished out to drivers waiting hours when the incident occurred at roughly pm. Ms Patel said the last few days have been horric for staff and itaposs not the first time sheaposs been racially abused by panic-buying motorists.

Two moped drivers then arrived and drove through the bollards staff had erected, with one demanding petrol despite bags having been put on the nozzles.He started shouting and swearing aposIaposve come for the petrol so Iaposm gonna get the petrolapos, Ms Patel told the Daily Mail.  He called me a f***ing p**i and said aposI know that you are lying and you have got fuel, youaposre a f***ing scumbagapos. She told him there was no fuel but he didnapost listen and whacked me with the nozzle and pushed me over. He struck me twice and Iaposd fallen over so people came to the scene and tried to restrain him. Speaking to , referring to the racial abuse, she added: I’ve heard it before, although not for quite some years – but over the last  hours I’ve been called that several times.Ms Patel, who has a young son and daughter, went to hospital as she banged her head on the floor, and suffered some cuts and bruises.

Kate looked stunning in a custom sparkling gold sequinned Jenny Packham cape gown and wore her hair up to show off her beautul gold earrings by Onitaa. Camilla opted for a pale blue corseted chfon dress with silver embroidery by Bruce Oldfield. Meanwhile, both Charles and William channelled  himself by wearing black tuxedos. The outing was the first time the foursome had attended a joint engagement in over a year. Then they visited a veteransapos rehabilitation centre together in Loughborough.

But despite having a busy night last night, there was no time to rest for William and Kate today. This afternoon they arrived in Northern Ireland for a visit to Derry-Londonderry and to see students and staff at Ulster Universityaposs Magee Campus. And Kate stunned once again as she bravely held a tarantula spider, called Charlotte, and let it run crawl her hands while touring the university as a seemingly nervous William looked on. After dazzling at the Bond premiere last night, Kate swapped her glittering gown for a vibrant magenta trouser suit by Emilia Wickstead with a dark roll neck jumper and wore her hair in a ponytail.

Serving police officer Couzens deceived Sarah by telling her she was under arrest her as she made her way home from a friendaposs in Clapham, south London, on March  this year. It took just under five minutes for Couzens to get Sarah into the car he had hired before he then drove to Kent where he raped and strangled her. In emotional scenes in court, Sarahaposs dad Jeremy Everard asked for a photograph of my beautul daughter to be put on screen as he read a statement, saying: She also had a beautul mind. He then asked the judge: Can I ask for Mr Couzens to face me  Mr Couzens, please look at me. Couzens appeared to be sobbing behind his mask and was shaking as he looked up for the first time in the hearing. When Sarahaposs sister Katie Everard stood up she also asked Couzens: Can you please look at me.  In a heartbreaking victim impact statement, Sarahaposs mother Susan told how she had kept her youngest childaposs dressing gown still smells of her and said their family will never be the same again. She says she has dreamt of her daughter and every night at the time she was taken by Couzens she lets out a silent scream of: Donapost get in the car, Sarah. Donapost believe him. Run! Sarahaposs mother said the family waited two agonising days after her body was found to discover how she died. She said she feared her daughter had been set on fire before she died and said the burning of her body was the final insult and meant they could never see her sweet face and never say goodbye. In his statement, Sarahaposs father Jeremy said his daughteraposs killing was in his mind all of the time. He said: A father wants to look after his children and fix everything and you have deliberately and with pre meditation stopped my ability to do that. We did not know whether you had burnt her alive or dead. You stopped us seeing Sarah for one last time and stopped me from giving my daughter one last kiss goodbye. No punishment that you receive will ever compare to the pain and torture that you have inflicted on us. Sarahaposs sister Katie heartbreakingly told how the family had to visit Sarahaposs home to pack up her whole le and found signs of a le waiting to be lived.  Chores to be done, ready for her toand continue when she got home. But she never got home because a predator - you - was on the loose. Prowling the streets for hours looking for his prey. She said: Washing left hanging up, half sewn outfits, deliveries waiting to be ed, packages waiting at the door ready to be opened. All signs of a le waiting to be lived. The last moments of her le not with loved ones, but frightened and fighting for her le. I hate to think of her being so scared and alone and that in her last moments she had no one with her. You have ruined so many lives. Dozens of people in the public gallery sobbed as all three statements were read. Sarahaposs family statements in full... Statement from Sarahaposs mum, Susan Sarahaposs mum Susan told the court: Sarah is gone and I am broken hearted. She was my precious little girl, our youngest child. The feeling of loss is so great it is visceral. And with the sorrow come waves of panic at not being able to see her again. I can never talk to her, never hold her again, and never more be a part of her le. We have kept her dressing gown - it still smells of her and I hug that instead of her. Sarah died in horrendous circumstances. I am tormented at the thought of what she endured. I play it out in my mind. I go through the terrible sequence of events. I wonder when she realized she was in mortal danger I wonder what her murderer said to her. When he strangled her, for how long was she conscious, knowing she would die  It is torture to think of it. Sarah was handcuffed, unable to defend herself and there was no one to rescue her. She spent her last hours on this earth with the very worst of humanity. She lost her le because Wayne Couzens wanted to satisfy his perverted desires. It is a ridiculous reason, it is nonsensical how could he value a human le so cheaply  I cannot comprehend it. I am incandescent with rage at the thought of it. He treated my daughter asshe was nothing and disposed of her asshe was rubbish. If Sarah had died because of an illness, she would have been cared for. We could have looked after her and been with her. If she had died because of an accident, people would have tried to help - there would have been kindness. But there is no comfort to be had, there is no consoling thought in the way Sarah died. In her last hours she was faced with brutality and terror, alone with someone intent on doing her harm. The thought of it is unbearable. I am haunted by the horror of it. When Sarah went missing we suffered days of agony, not knowing where she was or what had happened to her. Then, when Sarah’s burnt remains were found, we spent two terrible days waiting for tests to show how she had died, fearing she had been set alight before she was dead - the thought was appalling. Burning her body was the final insult, it meant we could never again see her sweet face and never say goodbye. Our lives will never be the same. We should be a family of five, but now we are four. Her death leaves a yawning chasm in our lives that cannot be filled. I yearn for her. I remember all the lovely things about her: she was caring, she was funny. She was clever, but she was good at practical things too. She was a beautul dancer. She was a wonderful daughter. She was always there to listen, to advise, or simply to share with the minutiae of the day. And she was also a strongly principled young woman who knew right from wrong and who lived by those values. She was a good person. She had purpose to her le. My outlook on le has changed since Sarah died: I am more cautious I worry more about our other children. I crave the familiarity and security of home the wider world has lost its appeal. It is too painful to contemplate a future without Sarah, so I just live in the here and now. I think of Sarah all the time, but the mornings and evenings are particularly painful. In the morningI wake up to the awful reality that Sarah is gone. In the evenings, at the time she was abducted, I let out a silent scream: Don’t get in the car, Sarah. Don’t believe him. Run!I am repulsed by the thought of Wayne Couzens and what he did to Sarah. I am outraged that he masqueraded as a policeman in order to get what he wanted. Sarah wanted to get married and have children, now all that has gone. He took her le and stole her future and we will never have the joy of sharing that future with her. Each day dawns and I think, Sarah should be here, leading her le and embracing new experiences. She had so many years ahead of her.I don’t know how anyone could be so cruel as to take my daughter’s le. What I do know is that Sarah will never be forgotten and is remembered with boundless love. I cling on to memories of Sarah, I hold them tight to keep them safe. The other night, I dreamt that Sarah appeared at home. In my dream I held her and could feel her physically. Jeremy was there, we were comforting her, saying “it’s alright Sarah, it’s alright”. I would give anything to hold her once more I hope I dream that dream again. Statement from Sarahaposs dad, Jeremy Sarahaposs father, Jeremy, told the court: The impact of what you have done will never end. The horrendous murder of my daughter, Sarah, is in my mind all the time and will be for the rest of my le. A father wants to look after his children and fix everything and you have deliberately and with pre meditation stopped my ability to do that. Sarah was handcuffed and unable to defend herself. This preys on my mind all the time. I can never forgive you for what you have done, for taking Sarah away from us. You burnt our daughter’s body - you further tortured us - so that we could not see her again. We did not know whether you had burnt her alive or dead. You stopped us seeing Sarah for one last time and stopped me from giving my daughter one last kiss goodbye. Her body fell apart when she was moved. Her brain and neck bones were removed for months by the pathologist and her body was dficult to preserve so we had to use the services of a specialist embalmer to enable a dignied burial. All my family want is Sarah back with us. No punishment that you receive will ever compare to the pain and torture that you have inflicted on us. You murdered our daughter and forever broke the hearts of her mother, father, brother, sister, family and her friends. Sarah had so much to look forward to and because of YOU this is now gone forever. She was saving to buy a house and looking forward to marriage and children. We were looking forward to having grandchildren. We loved being a part of Sarah’s world and expected her to have a full and happy le. The closest we can get to her now is to visit her grave every day. Statement from Sarahaposs sister, Katie Sarahaposs sister, Katie told the court in her victim impact statement: You treated Sarah asshe was nothing. Placed more emphasis on satisfying your sick disgusting perversions than on a le. Her le. You disposed of my sisteraposs body like it was rubbish. Fly-tipped her like she meant nothing. She meant everything. We couldnapost even see her, she was so badly burnt. Her brain was removed from her skull to check for trauma and cause of death - I still donapost knowthey put her brain back in her head or whether it is lying next to her body in her coffin. Shards of her kneecap were ed to us to be placed with her body - shards that you knocked when moving her burnt body from the fridge you had used to hide her and conceal the fire. We are still missing her hyoid bone from her throat, which is being checked to see the force you used to strangle her, to determine how long she may have survived. We know it was broken. Her burnt body still had her necklace and one earring in her ear - the other had fallen from her ear because it had burnt off. You hear from the police that it takes around  minutes to strangle someone. And around - seconds for them to lose consciousness. At first there is a sense of relief at hearing that your sister might only have been aware of what was happening for - seconds. But have you put your hands around your neck and tried pushing hard  - seconds now seems a long time. You used your warrant card to trick my sister into your car. She sat in a car handcuffed for hours. What could she have thought she had done wrong  What lies did you tell her  When did she realise that she wasnapost going to survive the night  Iaposm constantly replaying in my head - did you rape her, then kill her  Did you kill her while raping her  You get small nuggets of information and the thought process starts again. Your semen and blood were found in your car. So this suggests you raped her in the car. You find out you may have used a belt to strangle her. New horrendous images forming. You stopped to get a Lucozade and water at a petrol station. Was she still alive at this point  Bound in your car  I am horried by your ability to flit between what you did and normal everyday actions. Your casual demeanour on cctv was very upsetting and shocking to see. We had to go to the flat and pack up Sarahaposs whole le - washing left hanging up, half sewn outfits, deliveries waiting to be ed, packages waiting at the door ready to be opened. All signs of a le waiting to be lived - chores to be done, ready for her toand continue when she got home. But she never got home because a predator - you - was on the loose. Prowling the streets for hours looking for his prey. You canapost comprehend what you are being told when it happened because it is so horric. Some sort of sick waking nightmare. You canapost imagine anyone could do such a thing.You are waiting to hear anything from the police. Every bit you get is dferent. You hear her body has been found. Then you find out she has been burnt. So badly burnt you canapost see her. Canapost see her again to say goodbye. The first thought you have in your head after despair and shock is - was she dead before you burnt her  Imagine that even having to be a thought. You find out no soot was found in her lungs which suggests she was burnt after you murdered her. Imagine being relieved to hear your sister was dead before she was burnt.I replay it continuously round in my head. What you may have said to her, what she may have said back, when she realised she was in grave danger and was not going to survive.Hoping my sister was unconscious and drugged, but we know that was not the case - no drugs found in her body, no trauma to the head. Burst blood vessels in her brain from your strangulation. Which meant she was conscious when you were doing these unfathomable things to her. My only hope is that she was in a state of shock and that she wasnapost aware of the disgusting things being done to her by a monster. When you forced yourself upon and raped her. When you put your hands around her neck and strangled her. It disgusts me that you were the last person to touch her perfect body and violate her in the way you did. The last person to see her alive and speak to her. How scared she must have been.The last moments of her le not with loved ones, but frightened and fighting for her le. I hate to think of her being so scared and alone and that in her last moments she had no one with her. No kindness. I hate that I wasnapost there to save her. To stop you. I find it hard to believe she is not just living her own le and sick at the thought that her last moments on this earth alive were so horric.How dare you take her from me  Take away her hopes and dreams. Her le. Children that will never be born. Generations that will never exist. Her future no longer exists. The future I was supposed to live with my sister no longer exists. You have ruined so many lives.Sarah is the very best person with so many people who love and cherish her. I want to speak to her and hug her and hear her laugh and go out for dinners and drinks and dancing. All those conversations we can never have. There were so many things I wanted to share with her - trips abroad, being each otheraposs bridesmaid, meeting her babies and being an Aunty, growing old together and seeing who got the most wrinkles. We werenapost even halfway through our journey and you took it all away! I feel like I live in a make-believe world. Asnothing is real. I have to pretend because the thought of not having Sarah forever is too hard to bear. A letime now seems a very long time. I should never have to write a eulogy for or bury my little sister. There is no punishment that you could receive that will ever compare to the pain you have caused us. We can never get Sarah back. The last moments of Sarahaposs le play on my mind constantly. I am so disgusted and appalled. It terries me that you have such disregard for a personaposs le. You have taken from me the most precious person. And I can never get her back.Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Sarah Everard\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

She vanished as she walked through Clapham in south London after Couzens had been driving for hours around the city. The court heard just three days before, he had taken out a hire car in Devon and had even bought handcuffs from Amazon for the crime.  Prosecutor Tom Little told the court Sarah would have walked all the way back had she not have been kidnapped. However, tragically she was arrested by Couzens who had showed her his warrant and taken on an -mile journey before she was raped, strangled and her body set on fire. Sarahaposs body was found in a woodland stream in Kent, metres away from land owned by Couzens on March .  Mr Little said that at some point, after not being taken to a police station, Sarah must have realised her fate. Her killing prompted outrage across the UK and sparked protests at the rate of violence against women. Sarahaposs family came face-to-face with evil Couzens for the first time today as they sat in the well of packed court . Her father told Couzens to look at him as he read out his heartbreaking victim impact statement to the court.  Jeremy Everard said: The horrendous murder of my daughter, Sarah, is in my mind all the time and will be for the rest of my le. A father wants to look after his children and fix everything and you have deliberately and with premeditation stopped my ability to do that. The footage is from dash-cam and bus CCTV. One image shows the two of them standing behind his distinctive hire car with its hazards on. Another shows her in the back seat Mr Little said: “Sarah Everard is standing on the pavement, behind the car, facing the defendant who is a few feet away. The defendant appears to touch his belt and to be holding up his hand towards Sarah Everard, asshowing her something in it. “A couple were travelling on the south circulate in their car to their home address in south-east London and witnessed the kidnap of Sarah Everard.. The front seat passenger noticed what she described as a man and a woman standing on the pavement with the man behind the woman. “The man was wearing dark clothing and she started to watch more closely because she saw a handcuff. The woman on the pavement already had her left arm behind her back. “She was in the process of aposgiving her other arm behind her backapos as the man, who must have been the defendant, placed the handcuff on her right arm.  “She was compliant, with her head down and did not appear to be arguing. The defendant appeared to be confident. The immediate impression the passenger formed was that she was witnessing an undercover police officer arresting a woman, whom she assumed aposmust have done something wrong.apos “So surprised was the witness by what she had seen, as she considered it to be relatively unusual and not something she had ever witnessed before, she remarked to her husband, ‘I’ve just seen a woman being handcuffed’.  She then saw the man and the woman walking along in the direction of the vehicle with the handcuffed woman in front of the man and close together. “All her husband, who was driving, was able to see or recall of the scene was a stationary white-coloured vehicle with its lights flashing. “They were in fact witnessing the kidnap of Sarah Everard. She was detained by fraud. Couzens will be sentenced on Thursday, September .Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON politan PoliceSarah Everard\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Susan Everard made the upsetting admission while delivering an intense victim impact statement at the Old Bailey today. Speaking alongside daughter Katie and husband Jeremy, Susan spoke directly at former police officer Wayne Couzens, who was being sentenced for murdering the -year-old. In the morning I wake up to the awful reality that Sarah is gone. In the evenings, at the time she was abducted, I let out a silent scream: Donapost get in the car, Sarah. Donapost believe him. Run! she told the court. I am repulsed by the thought of Wayne Couzens and what he did to Sarah.  I am outraged that he masqueraded as a policeman in order to get what he wanted. Sarah wanted to get married and have children, now all that has gone. He took her le and stole her future and we will never have the joy of sharing that future with her. Each day dawns and I think, Sarah should be here, leading her le and embracing new experiences. She had so many years ahead of her. The Old Bailey heard how Couzens, , abused Covid- lockdown regulations to kidnap Sarah in a fake arrest then rape and strangle her. He used his politan Police-issue warrant card and handcuffs to snatch Sarah as she walked home from a friendaposs house in Clapham, south London, on the evening of March .  The firearms officer, who had clocked off from a -hour sht at the American embassy that morning, drove to a secluded rural area near Dover in Kent, where he parked up and raped Sarah. The marketing executive, who lived in Brixton, south London, had been strangled with Couzenaposs police belt by .am the following morning. Married Couzens burned her body in a refrigerator in an area of woodland he owned in Hoads Wood, near Ashford, Kent, before dumping the remains in a nearby pond. Just days later, amid extensive publicity about Sarahaposs disappearance, he took his family on a day out to the woods, allowing his two children to play close by. Couzens concocted a story about being threatened by a gang when he was arrested at his Deal home on March  but later pleaded guilty to her kidnap, rape and murder.  Today, as he sat quaking in the dock with his head bowed at the start of his sentencing, Sarahaposs dad Jeremy demanded the killer look at him. He said: I can never forgive you for what you have done, for taking Sarah away from us. Susan said she was incandescent with rage at what he had done, saying he disposed of her daughter asshe was rubbish. Sister Katie wept as she said: My only hope is that she was in a state of shock and that she wasnapost aware of the disgusting things being done to her by a monster. When you forced yourself upon her and raped her. Met Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick also attended court to hear how one of her own officers had abused his position and used his warrant card to kidnap Sarah by fraud before detaining her by force. Prosecutor Tom Little QC suggested the case was so exceptional and unprecedented that it could warrant a whole le order, meaning Couzens would die in jail.  Opening the facts of the case, he said Sarahaposs disappearance was one of the most widely publicised missing person investigations the country has ever seen. After her body was discovered a week later, it became summarised on social media by the hashtag she was just walking home, which did not completely describe what had happened, he said. Whilst it is impossible to summarise what the defendant did to Sarah Everard in just five words,it had to be done then it would be more appropriate to do so as deception, kidnap, rape, strangulation, fire, said Mr Little. The court heard Sarah was described by a former long-term boyfriend as extremely intelligent, savvy and streetwise and not a gullible person. He said he could not envisage her getting into a car with someone she did not know unless by force or manipulation, said the prosecutor.Couzens had worked on unormed Covid patrols in late January to enforce coronavirus regulations, so would have known what language to use to those who may have breached them, he continued. He is thought to have been wearing his police belt with handcuffs and a rectangular black pouch, similar to a pepper spray holder, when he kidnapped Sarah as she walked home. The fact she had been to a friendaposs house for dinner at the height of the early  lockdown made her more vulnerable to and more likely to submit to an accusation that she had acted in breach of the Covid regulations in some way, said Mr Little. The court heard how Couzens had booked a hire car before going out hunting for a lone young female to kidnap and rape. Chilling CCTV footage played in court showed Couzens raising his left arm, holding a warrant card, before handcuffing Sarah and putting her into the back of the car. A passing couple witnessed the kidnapping but mistook it for an arrest by an undercover officer, the court heard.  Mr Little said: She was detained by fraud. The defendant using his warrant card and handcuffs as well as his other police issue equipment to effect a  arrest. Couzens worked for the Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection Command after joining the Met in , having transferred from the Civil Nuclear Constabulary. He was sacked by the force after entering guilty pleas. Scotland Yard said in a statement ahead of the sentencing hearing: We are sickened, angered and devastated by this manaposs crimes which betray everything we stand for. Lord Justice Fulford adjourned the case until Thursday when he will hand down his sentence.

Duston School, in Northampton, closed its doors today following a suspected outbreak of the eight-legged critters.A  widow spider is often confused with the more dangerous black widow, and they do bite, but very rarely attack humans.They are often sighted at this time of year, and in what the Wildle Trust describes as extremely rare cases of humans being bitten by them, it is compared to a waspaposs sting. If confirmed, the infestation would be the second to shut a Northamptonshire school in as many weeks. Malcolm Arnold Academy had to shut temporarily earlier this month on on Friday, September , after a similar situation, Northants Live reported. The school, on Northamptonaposs Trinity Avenue, was evacuated earlier this month after a small number of  widow spiders were seen on site. Students also stayed at home on the following Monday, while the incident was dealt with. In a letter sent to all parents, Duston principal Sam Strickland confirmed that both the primary and secondary phases of the school would be forced to close. He said that all staff and students will not be able to attend the school while the arachnids are removed.  But pupils will not be getting a day off with teachers set to provide online work to be completed. The letter, sent to parents on Tuesday , said: Please be advised that due to a suspected outbreak of False Black Widow Spiders we are regrettably having to close both phases of the school to all pupils and staff tomorrowto allow the situation to be assessed and for the school to be cleaned. A decision regarding the re-opening of the school will be made following an update tomorrow and this will be communicated to you accordingly. I cannot apologise enough for the inconvenience that this may cause you, especially in terms of organising child care arrangements. However, the health and safety of the school community must come first and foremost. Work will be set for all of our pupils to complete at home via Microsoft Teams.

The three-year-old was repeatedly bitten by another child at Sunflowers Too Day Nursery in Hessle, his mother has claimed.The assault began within weeks of his enrolment last January, the parent who asked to remain anonymous told Hull Daily Mail. A number of injuries were catalogued over the coming months, some of which were caused by the boy. When the mum complained, the other child was removed from the room her son was taught in.  But after the most recent summer holidays they were put back in the pre-school room together without the motheraposs knowledge. It was only when her son came home from nursery with another bite mark and told her the not nice boy had done it, that she found out they were together again. After complaining to the manager she given a dayaposs notice to remove her child from the nursery after being told her contract has been terminated.  She claims: My child has been bitten several times at nursery. He tells me this boy is not very nice to him and he upsets him. I had a meeting last year and the child was removed from the same room.@ She claims he aposgot another bite this weekapos and added that aposhe told me whoaposd done it, and thank goodness he can talk as otherwise I wouldnapost have known he was in the same room as this child, as nursery didnapost tell me.  I emailed my concerns and I was very upset but I wasnapost rude. I got a reply to say she was terminating our contract and I asked for a meeting and she repeated that she was terminating the contract. She claims that because aposthey canapost keep my son safe he is getting kicked out of nursery.apos The mum, who is studying to become a teacher, said she has complained to Ofsted and is now having to keep her son at home until a suitable alternative nursery can be found. This manager is excluding my child from their friends and education, I had raised serious safeguarding concerns.  I have taken advice about the matter and was told thatI have legitimate concerns as a parent and have raised them, they should be looking into these instead of terminating my contract. I am disgusted that instead of addressing the injuries my son has received they are throwing him out of nursery. I have rightfully reported the matter to Ofsted as they have no grounds to rip my son away from his friends and education, she claimed.In an email to the parent, the nursery wrote: On reflection and having taken advice with regard to your concerns about the careis receiving at Sunflowers Too Day Nursery, we have an untenable situation where everything is being questioned and you feel your child is not safe here despite us doing the utmost for allchildren.I feel the parent-carer relationship has irretrievably broken down and I am therefore, terminating our contract. There is a four week notice period, however as you are so disappointed in the service we are providing and absolutely disgusted with my staff, this can be waived. A spokesman for the nursery said: Sunflowers Too Day Nursery have followed all policies and procedures under the Early Years Foundation Stage and safeguarding requirements. We are in communication with Ofsted who are our regulatory body and we have informed them all policies and procedures followed are to keep all our children safe at Sunflowers Too Day Nursery.

Durham University has launched an investigation into its rugby club after the allegations came to light.Just hours before the alleged incident took place, senior members of Durham University Rugby Football Club were reportedly told by a coach that they would be kicked out of the clubthey bullied first years, Chronicle Live reported. One student, who claims to have been at the event, looked to minimise the severity of the incident, claiming it was an accident.  Itaposs just a social, they added. Itaposs fine.

The events of March , when Sarah Everardaposs body was found after days of her going missing, fuelled outrage worldwide and highlighted the epidemic of violence against women and girls. There was grief for a woman who we now know was ly arrested, raped and murdered by a serving police officer, Wayne Couzens. We have heard government officials tell us that they are working tirelessly to fix systemic issues within our society that result in violence towards women and girls, as well as sexual harassment, sexual assault and misogyny from men, but where is this work  We haven’t seen anyone elicit any change towards the sexism that is re within our communities. In fact, the same head of police, Cressida Dick, who said the police shouldnapost have to deal with reports of misogyny and that it should not be a criminal offence, described rapist killer Couzens as just an occasional badaposun. The policing bill currently in committee stage in the House of Lords will allow police to have more powers. One part of the bill gives no clear standpoint on what they will allow police to do with regards to a aposdigital strip searchapos, whereby an officer can request a victim’s phone after an allegation of sexual violence so they can search through years of data. If you don’t surrender your phone, they can drop the investigation against your attacker. Some of these digital searches have resulted in officers asking women about previous partners, whether they have sent explicit messages or pictures to partners, and whether they have engaged in certain sexual activities. All are actions that do not excuse any violent behaviour of men towards women. The response I personally had via a letter from the Home Office stated they were putting more funding into street lights. Street lights do not stop sexual assault. The majority of assaults happen in the home, at work, at school.  If the government really want to enact change, as they keep claiming, they need to stop handing police more powers that could enable more violence. It could review the curriculum and insist students are taught about misogyny and sexual harassment to stamp out ‘lad culture’ and ‘rape culture’. It could put forward legislation that protects women and girls, and make the process of reporting these crimes easier with more support for victims. Male violence towards women has become so profoundly engrained into our society that when women talk about it, people often dismiss it and say it’s ‘not all men’. These violent men are people you spend time with at the pub, theyaposre teachers, doctors, police officers with wives and children. A friend who talks about women asthey were objects is one of these men. The government need to act right now to prevent male violence against women and girls.

The -year-old married father-of-two, from Deal in Kent, abducted Ms Everard in a hire car as she walked home in south London on the evening of March . The sexual predator, who had clocked off from a -hour sht that morning, went on to rape and strangle the -year-old marketing executive then set fire to her body. A week after she disappeared, Ms Everardaposs remains were found in a woodland stream in Ashford, Kent, just metres from land owned by Couzens. The court heard that Couzens had finished a -hour sht with the politan Police before he picked up the hire car which he used to kidnap Ms Everard under the guise of arresting her for breaking lockdown rules.  During his five daysapos leave, he told his work supervisor that he felt unable to carry firearms and felt stressed over a pay dispute. Police identied Couzens through the hire car and quickly established he was a serving police officer. Prosecutor Tom Little QC described her as the victim of “deception, kidnap, rape, strangulation, fire”. Mr Little told the court Couzens had worked on ‘Covid patrols’ in the weeks before the murder.  Detectives believe the off-duty cops used the pandemic as an excuse to ‘detain’ his victim as she walked along the street. He spent weeks planning the crime and booked a hire car to use in the kidnap three days before abducting Sarah. Married dad-of-two Couzens spent hours driving around west and south London before targeting his victim. Dash-cam footage showed Couzens’s rented white and black Vauxhall Crossland pulled up, with its hazard lights on, on the pavement next to his victim.  Mr Little said: “Sarah Everard is standing on the pavement, behind the car, facing the defendant who is a few feet away. “The defendant appears to touch his belt and to be holding up his hand towards Sarah Everard, asshowing her something in it. “A couple were travelling on the south circulate in their car to their home address in south-east London and witnessed the kidnap of Sarah Everard.  “The front seat passenger noticed what she described as a man and a woman standing on the pavement with the man behind the woman. “The man was wearing dark clothing and she started to watch more closely because she saw a handcuff. “The woman on the pavement already had her left arm behind her back. “She was in the process of “giving her other arm behind her back” as the man, who must have been the defendant, placed the handcuff on her right arm. “She was compliant, with her head down and did not appear to be arguing. The defendant appeared to be confident.  “The immediate impression the passenger formed was that she was witnessing an undercover police officer arresting a woman, whom she assumed “must have done something wrong”. The former Met Police officer then raped and strangled the marketing executive after driving her  miles to Kent. He eventually burned her body and dumped it in a builder’s bag in a woodland stream near land he owned in Ashford, Kent.  In the days that followed Couzens was caught on CCTV buying two green rubble bags at a BQ in Dover. He went on to order tarpaulin and a bungee cargo net from Amazon on March , which were shipped with next day delivery. Couzens was arrested at his marital home in Deal, Kent, six days after Sarah’s disappearance. Police had tracked his rental car, which he booked under his own name three days before the murder. The hearing continues.

York Gins is owned and run by Emma Goala, , Pete McNichol, , Paul Crossman, , and -year-old Harry Cooke. Speaking to us following the good news, they said: We’re absolutely delighted to win the prize. As a small business in these very strange and uncertain times, any help we can get is very welcome. We couldn’t quite believe we’d won when we were contacted! We’re pretty used to winning gin-tasting competitions - but this was out of the blue. We think our business is special because we put people, the planet and fun at the very heart of everything we do. We pay the Living Wage and make sure everyone is fully trained and gets any outside training they may need. York Gin only launched in  but has also grown rapidly. The team added: When we started, two of us were working in a cold former chicken shed, making the gin and bottling, labelling and packing everything by hand. We had a good hunch that the local market would provide some demand for a locally-made gin - in fact one of our directors, Paul, is a pub landlord, so we thought at least we’ll have one customer!The team are looking forward to using the new Square Stand Kit, adding: We are always interested in trying new solutions to tricky problems like payments. The loyalty programme Square offers looks particularly interesting.We have plans to grow - but in a controlled and sustainable manner. We have plans to open a second shop in York. We already have a shop in the historic centre right opposite the famous Shambles and now plan a new shop in the city’s train station. We have ambitions to grow our online store too which Square could help us with. Squareaposs POS technology in particular is very flexible for our outdoor events - which are key now we are all doing things outdoors even more! It will make such a dference having technology with the ability to grow with us - Clueit Webb Interiors, Margate Ollie Clueit, , has been surrounded by collectables and antiques as long as he can remember, whether in his family home or at the boot sales and antique fairs his parentsdragged him to. But over the years his parentaposs passion developed into his own love of all things antique and vintage, and three years ago, Ollie left his career in the music industry, retrained as an upholsterer and moved to Margate, where he operated Recovered by Ollie from a  foot shipping container. The business has come a long way since then, claiming a  square foot workshop and a shop space, but it’s during the next exciting phase that the Square technology will be invaluable. Last year, Corinne Webb, , came on board to help Ollie with his workload, brining with her a wealth of experience in textiles and interior design, and the pair quickly realised they made a fantastic team, and decided to go into partnership together to expand and rebrand as Clueit Webb Interiors.  “We are going to be adding extra products to the website and physical shop,” said the duo. “The Square kit will really help us keep track of stock and give us a real understanding of what is selling and what isnapost, and help us decide what we should be restocking. “Plus, the fact that it links up to our accounting software and keeps track of sales on social media will be beyond helpful.” Having combined their years of experience in upholstery, vintage furniture sourcing, textiles and interior design, Ollie and Corinne are able to offer unique and exciting services and products to clients nationally, as well as in the south east. “We have a hands-on approach, working really closely with clients,” they explain. “We have a passion for restoring peopleaposs furniture and helping them craft homes that are a true reflection of our clientsapos tastes.”  With that in mind, Ollie and Corinne are looking to open a larger shop space, take on additional staff and signicantly expand their online presence. And the ability to upgrade the Square software and expand the Square services will make the management of these additional areas so much easier. “We are delighted to win this prize,” they told us. “Our previous POS was very basic and offered no integration with our online store and accounting software, so it will make such a dference having technology with the ability to grow with us.” aposWeaposre over the moon - Square’s architecture is easily scalableapos - Outdoor Fire Pits, Nottinghamshire Husband and we duo Tony and Kate Cox set up their business in  on the eve of Tonyaposs th and say winning our Square bundle will help them continue to grow. The business manufactures beautul, sturdy, steel outdoor fire pits and other steel items for the home and garden. Reacting to winning our prize, Tony said: Weaposre over the moon to have won.  Weaposre on the brink of taking on some staff to run our retail shop, which would mean investing in some permanent payment taking hardware, as to date, we’ve each had a card reader paired with our phone. The Square Register will give us that permanent asset which anyone who runs the shop can use without needing an app on their phone. Secondly, we’ve seen an increase in the number of people who ask to order and pay by phone, which is something missing from our current offering, which will be resolved by Square. Tony and Kateaposs business is booming and has come a long way in a short amount of time. Tony added: Five years ago, we started manufacturing in a tiny  square foot rented barn building, with a lot of time spent on design and selling a couple units per month. We then doubled the size of our space. During the  lockdown to keep up with growth, we successfully partnered with some local welding schools and have now negotiated new partnerships which have given us the capacity to supply a number of garden centres in addition to our own direct sales. We do plan to grow and it’s satisfying to know Square’s architecture is easily scalable, no matter where we go and no matter how fast we get there.

Danni Hamilton dons the kidsapos clothes and sucks a dummy because it acts as a aposcoping mechanismapos for her childhood trauma. The -year-old, from Edinburgh, Scotland, was introduced to the kink scene by a friend two years ago. The Scottish woman says she is fascinated by age-play - and spoke to a counsellor about what it all means. Her therapist gave her the green light to go for it, and Danni began to experiment by playing with baby toys. She said she doesn’t live as a baby full-time, but transforms as a way to relax. The woman revealed her child persona is aged between one to five years old and is very cheeky and clingy. But that hasnapost stopped her being abused online - and she says has lost friends because of her pass-time.  She receives plenty of backlash on social media and trolls call her aposbroken,apos aposweird,apos or even accuse her of being a paedophile. Danni bats off the comments and said: My best friend was into kink. I saw a lot of things related to age-play, and I talked to a counsellor to askage regression can be used as therapy she said yes. Iaposve always loved baby toys and Iaposve never grown out of them like other people do.  My favourite part is letting go and feeling like I have no responsibilities. I had a rough childhood, and this helps to forget about it and relax. Playing is fun even people not in the lestyle love some of the things they did as a child. Itaposs why the term nostalgia exists. I donapost live the lestyle full time, so I can go around as an adult when I need to. In baby mode, Iaposm very cheeky and playful. If I have a partner, Iaposll act very much like a toddler. But this lestyle doesnapost come cheap - and she now knows what parents have to pay for. It can be costly, she said. You can sometimes buy real baby products, but you have to be careful, because real baby stuff can be a bit pricey. Iaposm lucky to have so many friends in the community and one has her own store. Despite the backlash, age-play makes Danni happy and she points out that no harm is being caused by her using the baby lestyle as a coping mechanism.The Mirroraposs newsletter brings you the latest news, exciting showbiz and TV stories, sport updates and essential political information.The newsletter is emailed out first thing every morning, at noon and every evening.

With the crisis now in its sixth day there have been debate over whether keyworkers should get priority access to fuel at petrol stations to keep emergency vehicles operational. A number of petrol stations across the country have even put signs allowing key workers such as ambulance staff to jump the queue.Emma Vogelmann, who lives on the outskirts of Hertfordshire near Royston, says she is concerned with the panic buying as he le depends on carers being able to visit her. The lead policy adviser for the disability charity Scope requires round-the-clock care due to her condition, reported HertsLive. Emma has spinal muscular atrophy, a genetic condition that makes the muscles weaker and causes problems with movement. She also has complications caused by Swine Flu - when she contracted the virus in  it left her needing a ventilator, which helps her to breathe via a tracheotomy. Emma often requires people to manage her airways to assist with breathing and swallowing, so it is vital that her carers can get to her.Some of her team have to travel upwards of  minutes to get to her home, which was an issue on Monday when one of her carers said she might not be able to make it due to being low on petrol.Emma said: “I got a message from my carer on Monday saying she wouldn’t be able to get to meshe couldn’t get petrol. “It was a real stress for me and for her, she was really low and couldn’t find fuel anywhere.” Luckily, she was able to get the help she required because her carer got access to some fuel. Without them, however, she would have to rely on her mum who works as a GP in AE. For Emma, it is an ongoing worry whilst the crisis continues and she thinks that priority should be given to those who require it most. I think that we should be prioritising the people who absolutely cannot work from home, she said. “It leaves disabled people in a dangerous position. “All the people given priority to access the supermarkets during the pandemic should be given to those same people for petrol until the shortage is resolved. She hopes that those who are buying fuel for the sake of it begin to understand that there are people who rely on petrol to survive. She said: At the moment I don’t have anyone telling me they are low on fuel but it is something I am hyper-aware of. “If you’re thinking about filling up because you’re worried about getting any petrol I just want people to think for a moment, do they really need it  “Think about how,you fill up when you donapost really need it, it could have an impact on someone whose le depends on it. “So really just think before you act.” Comment MORE ON Swine fluFluDisabilityPanic-buying\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

As rare as they might be, however, US-based artist Jeff Seymour is selling exactly that, in the form of his colourfully unique two-bedroom home, which is now on the market for £, . Whoever chooses to purchase the quirky property will not only land themselves an interesting new home, theyaposll be left with an entire building filled with original artwork, which Jeff compares toVan Gogh and Dr Seuss had a tree house, while describing it as magically ine digs.  The townhouse, which is located in Waukesha, Wisconsin, over in the states, looks rather unassuming from the outside, with plain red brick walls and a smattering of green and red tiles around the door the only hint of the colourful interior. My interior design strives to counter the building density and hard surfaces of Downtown living which I really enjoy, Jeff explained. I introduced themes and images of aposstoriesapos growing up and mixed them with the beauty and colour of nature and the human form to create a kaleidoscope of happiness, humanity and le. The walls are D plastered and painted. The lightweight concrete floors are hand stamped with leaf shapes hand cut from the cabinet boxes for my unit and then stained. They intend to represent trees, leaves and reflections in a pattern that suggests ornate carpet. The inside, however, couldnapost be any more dferent, with interior walls covered in huge murals, all themed around nature with stunning flowers and leaves painted on every surface. The open-plan dining table is adorned with a giant sunflower, while the floors are painted in green, blue, red and yellow tones. No room is spared, with one bedroom painted in large, block stripes of colour, with paintings of fruit dangling from the ceiling. One of the three bathrooms is slightly more toned down, with a calming ocean-themed mural on the walls – complete with swimming fish and groovy plants. Even the office is decked out with a funky blue cloudy sky painted up above, and tall trees stretching from the floor to ceiling. In the kitchen, huge flowers wind up the walls next to a snake and apple in a nod to the Garden of Eden – and it even comes complete with a large, nude Adam above the sink, culminating in a faucet in place of the penis. Jeff designed the property to be a kaleidoscope of happiness, humanity and le – and those features are certainly present, right down to the controversial sink detail. The condominium was built in , with Jeff hoping to establish an artistic community in the local area.  I built these condos in  to help anchor artists entrepreneurs in a beautul, walkable, historic community named Waukesha Wisconsin, he explained. It was a town that was struggling for an identity as the Malls arose and caused many vacancies in great small towns. Artists creatives are often involved in the rehabilitation of downtowns that are deteriorating. Ownership allows these artists to share in the successes they create by getting involved in the positive change they often incite. Jeff used recycled materials to bring the space to le, including a rounded headboard painted to resemble a sunflower and used as a kitchen counter, a kitchen butcher block from a church renovation, a former bowling alley for the bar, and wood and metal pieces taken from a bin during the building’s construction.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

Chy Brown works as an interior designer and loves trawling old antique markets for new items - but sheaposs not only looking for furniture and artwork to purchase. The -year-old enjoys picking up family heirlooms and tracking down their living relatives tothe long-lost items. So it wasnapost unusual for her to pick up a second-hand photo album at a local market in New York, filled with summer holiday snaps from . But her efforts to trace the previous owner’s descendants left her shocked - after discovering that her relatives were pictured inside.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter hereAfter initially struggling to find any family ties to the quaint-looking photo album which only contained first names, Chy enlisted her genealogist dad’s help. Together the pair uncovered an incredible coincidence in a ’s census which revealed that those pictured in the photos were their distant relations - helping them to link up with Chy’s distant cousins, four to six times removed. “I traced the album back a few weeks ago using census records and I saw that the family member I was ing the album to had similar DNA in common with, Chy said. “It’s a VERY distant relation, but still cool, and now we stay in touch over email.” Unfortunately, Chy found that the man who made the album was the son of some of the people pictured but he had died in . However, she was able to connect with her distant cousin and posted her the album filled with snaps. Chy has sent back around  antiques to the closest family member alive after successfully tracking them down.She often tracks down the former owner’s descendants by scrolling through public family trees on Ancestry.Chy added: “My dad is a genealogist and growing up I saw him help families from around the world for free, not only help them with finding heritage but also help them fill in the missing pieces of their family history. “Because I am an interior decorator, I thrt often and it always broke my heart seeing a family heirloom in some box at the flea market instead of with its rightful family. “One day I just decided to use what I know of genealogy, what my dad taught me, and to use it to trace the items that I find at thrts and flea markets back. Once I started I never stopped. “I try and stay in contact with as many people Iaposve ed heirlooms to as possible!” Despite some of the heirlooms costing hundreds to buy and post, she never asks for a cent from the family members she s the items to. Cha said: “I spend my own money on this and postage and never ask for repayment from families. “I have spent well over , as NYC flea markets are a bit expensive. I’ve also spent hundreds on postage.

But one woman found herself in hot water after she came face-toface with the actor playing Gaston from Beauty and the Beast for a photo opportunity.In a video from  which has recently resurfaced after being posted on Reddit, the woman could be seen attempting to pose for a picture with Gaston when she cheekily placed both her hands on his chest – which left the actor furious.Gaston ordered the woman to leave, but at first it was unclear whether he was being serious or just playing his part as a Disney actor. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. Pointing away from the set, he told her: “Get out. Now. Leave!” The woman then tried to touch him again, but Gaston stopped her and continued to ask her to leave. She then said: “Really ” And Gaston replied: “Yeah, you’re done. There’s children here!” The video has racked up over , comments since it was posted this week, and people were shocked that the woman would touch the actor inappropriately without his consent. One commenter even claimed the woman could have been banned from the park for her actions, stating: “As a former Disney employee I can tell you that characters on any meet and greet put up with all kinds of abuse, from being kicked by children to being groped by teens and adults. “Characters are trained in their responses to all situations. That being said Gaston provided a stern but appropriate response. “This woman could be banned from the parks for trying it and usually a character has an accompanying cast member that can report park guest misconduct.” While another pointed out: “It’s so weird that she continues to touch him.” And a third praised Gaston for setting a good example to others, writing: “Perfect example to set. Coming from Gaston just makes it  times better as a show of respect. Don’t do it, and don’t accept it.”Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON The Walt Disney CompanyViral\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

A study of , adults found a huge  percent feel they are fully aware of the issue of climate change and what causes it. But more than four in ten aren’t aware that nature itself is one of the most powerful tools against it. For example, seven in ten know that trees can absorb carbon, but  percent were unaware that peat bogs have the potential to store twice as much carbon as forests. More than six in tendidn’t realise that the humble wildflower meadow is a climate superhero, with over  species of flower that can help to improve bioersity. A similar numberwere unaware that kelp forests can help protect against climate change by cushioning shorelines against the effects of storm surges and rising sea levels.  And a third didnapost realise the UK is home to its own green technology such as seagrass meadows, which can capture carbon  times faster than rainforests. Only  percent of those polled knew about such carbon-capture technology, and just  percent felt it was a potential solution to climate change. The research was commissioned by Sky Zero and WWF as part of the Force for Nature campaign to highlight the power of the UK’s natural habitats in the battle against climate change.  Tanya Steele, chief executive at WWF, said: “The UK’s natural habitats are a key ally in the fight against climate change, yet they are being depleted at an alarming rate. “From wildflower meadows to peat bogs and kelp forests to seagrass, we must protect these vital assets and secure their future – for our own sake. “All UK governments must keep their climate promises while we still have a chance to turn things around. We all have a role to play and becoming a Force for Nature and helping us plant more carbon-capturing seagrass seeds is one of the ways people can show their support.” The study also found that those polled believe the burning of fossil fuels is the single biggest contributor to climate change , closely followed by deforestation . But more than half of adultsdon’t know what seagrass is, and  per ent don’t know soil can absorb carbon - with grasslands locking in up to a fth of all soil carbon in the UK. When it comes to UK nature,  percent of adults do not realise the UK is one of the most nature depleted nations in the world. While nine in  adults were unaware that over the last  years, more than  percent of UK species have declined, something that has in turn had an impact on the country’s ability to protect itself against climate change.  As a result,  percent believe more education is needed on how nature can help in the fight against climate change. In addition, the study carried out through OnePoll found three quarters of adultswant to do more to help reduce climate change. Jeremy Darroch, executive chairman at Sky and WWF-UK Ambassador, said: “We’re beginning to understand just how at risk our cherished UK landscapes are, from a iety of factors including deforestation, urbanisation and a lack of protection. “However, what is less known is just how powerful these natural habitats can be in the fight against climate change, providing we can restore and protect them. “We’re asking people to become a #ForceForNature to call on UK governments to keep their climate promises and in turn restore seagrass, a carbon-capturing technology that nature itself has provided for us.” For every , Force For Nature sign ups, Sky Zero and WWF will plant , seagrass seeds, up to one million, to showcase the public support for protecting and restoring nature and championing ‘green technology’ that can help save the planet from climate disaster.You can sign up here.Comment MORE ON Climate changeWwf UK\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates from our environment editor on green issues and actions you can takeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

causes of death in Scotland – but a few simple changes can drastically reduce your risk of developing it.Cutting out junk food, ditching saturated fats from your diet and eating more fibre can all have long-lasting benefits.High cholesterol # a type of fat in the blood – is of the biggest risk factors. Cholesterol itself is not unhealthy, as every cell in the body needs it to make cell membranes, hormones, and vitamin D.However, too much of it can block and damage your blood vessels making you more likely to have cardiovascular problems or a stroke.This World Heart Day, we look at some of the easiest ways to lower your cholesterol.Dr Rhianna McClymont, lead GP at digital healthcare provider Livi, says you can get tested for high cholesterol by your local doctor.“Young men are statistically more likely to have problems with high cholesterol than young women, although this trend generally reverses after women reach menopausal age when their risk of high cholesterol increases,” she said.“There are generally no outward signs of a problem # that’s why it’s often best to get tested.“Your GP can measure cholesterol using a blood test and will consider your age, sex, weight, blood pressure, personal and family medical history before deciding on an action.”Thankfully there are several ways people can change their lestyle and Dr McClymont has offered five changes you can make.Eating a diet high in saturated fats increases the risk of high cholesterol.These fats are found in meat, cheese and other animal-based foods, as well as some vegetable oils, including palm and coconut.Cutting your saturated fat intake could reduce the risk of heart disease by %. Switching to unsaturated oils such as sunflower and olive, and generally reducing the amount of fats you use, could lower it by as much as %.Research shows that eating three grams of soluble fibre a day # the amount you get from three apples # can help lower cholesterol.You can increase your fibre intake by eating wholegrain versions of cereals, pasta and bread, and incorporating the likes of more beans, fruit and vegetables into your diet.Oats are also great as these contain both fibre and beta-glucans, a natural sugar that is also proven to lower cholesterol.Exercising regularly reduces your risk of heart diseaseTwo hours of aerobic exercise # movement that gets your heart pumping and makes you out of breath # a week can reduce the risk of heart disease by .% in women and .% in men.It also helps to increase your levels of HDL cholesterol, which is the form that protects your heart.Smokers have lower levels of healthy HDL cholesterol than non-smokers.But those who quit smoking typically show rising levels of it within three weeks.A GP can talk you through the support available to help you stop smoking for good.Processed foods are often high in saturated fats, refined grains, added sugars and salt. These increase the risk of high cholesterol and other heart disease risk factors, including weight gain.Cooking from scratch where possible and using fresh ingredients is healthier.It’s also worth considering a more plant-based, Mediterranean-style diet as research shows it can help reduce blood cholesterol by up to %.This includes brightly coloured fruits, vegetables and wholegrains, as well as servings of fish and healthy fats, like olive oil.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/syndicatenews/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/09/DJI_0068_38424391-620x348.jpg ","title":"aberdeen harbour welcomes new boss at pivotal time for port","story":".dct-cta@-webkit-keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate@keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate.dct-cta__title.dct-cta__content p.dct-cta__content p:not.dct-cta__content p:last-child.dct-cta__label.dct-cta__input.dct-cta__input::-webkit-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::-moz-placeholder.dct-cta__input:-ms-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::placeholder.dct-cta__label:hover.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__label:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__input:hover,.dct-cta__input:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__btn .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn.dct-cta__btn:disabled.dct-cta__btn:not.dct-cta__btn:not:hover.dct-cta__btn:not:hover,.dct-cta__btn:not:focus.dct-cta__btn-text.dct-cta__btn:before .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn-loadingborder-top:px solid #fffborder-radius:%width:pxheight:pxbox-sizing:border-box-webkit-animation:dctSpinner .s linear infiniteanimation:dctSpinner .s linear infinite.dct-cta--signup.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--signup__dialogs.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--success.dct-cta--signup__dialog--error.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__grid.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and @media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap+.dct-cta__content@supports or.dct-cta__flex:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--js-active.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and @supports or.dct-cta__grid:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label,.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__gridgrid-template-columns:fr minmaxgrid-gap:.rem .remAberdeen Harbour#s new boss has pledged to put the port at #the heart of the UK#s energy transition#.Bob Sanguinetti, who has started as the chief executive of Aberdeen Harbour Boardthis week, said the opportunities for the £ million South Harbour expansion and the wider region are “vast” and “transformational”.Mr Sanguinetti joins AHB  from the UK Chamber of Shipping. He takes over from Michelle Handforth who left to take up a role as a regional managing director for infrastructure manager, Network Rail.AHB said the chief executive will oversee “one of the most pivotal points in the port’s history” as the expansion completes sometime next year. The South Harbour is also a key piece of a jigsaw to enable the greening of local industry, including plans for an Energy Transition Zone nearby. Mr Sanguinetti joins following the expansion project having hit a number of delays including the abrupt departure of its main contractor, Spain’s Dragados, which downed tools before work had been completed.The harbour’s bosses also recently issued a plea for more funding from government in order to fund further green infrastructure such as service trenches for clean fuels and quayside electrication, which will be key for the harbour to fulfil its promise as part of the region’s transition from oil and gas.In a statement, Mr Sanguinetti said: “I have long since been impressed by the hard work and vision at the port to ensure transformational opportunities bring prosperity to current and future stakeholders.“The port is a vital piece of infrastructure and will play a key role in the development of offshore wind and green hydrogen production, and as the existing oil and gas industry adapts into one which is sustainable for future use.“The expanded port will be integral to the growth of trade and the maritime industry in Scotland, and I look forward to seeing how the port will play its part in the development of these industries in the coming years.“We will continue to build on what we offer our customers: a unique combination of scale, location and experience, and flexible solutions for their complex operations.”The port sees more than , vessel arrivals each year and handles more than -million tonnes of cargo and , passengers.On completion of the expansion project, Aberdeen Harbour will be the largest berthage port in Scotland, with vessels up to  metres inable to berth alongside the South Harbour quays.Alistair Mackenzie, chairman of AHB, said: “Bob Sanguinetti’s arrival comes at a pivotal moment in our history as our operations, and the sectors we serve, transform with the opening of South Harbour.“Bob brings a wealth of experience and knowledge of the international shipping industry, which will be vital for the harbour, its customers and its port users in the coming years.”For as

CalMac ferry passengers complying with face covering rules have been taken to the Scottish Parliament.Earlier this month it was reported that most customers on crossings were not wearing masks when they had to.This issue is the latest for the operator in a year of many, with services being cut, cancelled and delayed.It is currently mandatory to wear face coverings in all indoor areas of vessels and terminals, including port buildings and offices # unless people are exempt for medical reasons.CalMac managing director, Robbie Drummond, revealed earlier this month that the number of people wearing face coverings has decreased dramatically since the start of the pandemic from around % to around % on some routes.Positive cases onboard CalMac vessels can have a negative impact on island communities.If a vessel has to be withdrawn from the fleet for deep cleaning following a positive case, it can mean island residents have reduced access to the mainland and can impact the delivery of essential medical supplies and food.First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the ferry disruption due to Covid cases should serve as a reminder that the virus is still circling.On Tuesday, Na h-Eileanan an Iar MSP Alasdair Allan took the issue to parliament.Mr Allan said many constituents have gotten in touch with him regarding the issue.He said: “This is an issue which is a source of frustration for many people who get in touch with me.“Despite the fact we still have high numbers of cases, there are far too many people not complying with the rules on face coverings when they travel on CalMac vessels.#This isn’t fair to other passengers or the crew. It also increases the chances of a vessel having to be withdrawn because of a positive case onboard.#Mr Allan added that wearing face coverings can help protect all those onboard CalMac ferries.He said: “I would urge everyone travelling on CalMac vessels to please help protect the crew and other passengers by wearing a face covering.”Ms Sturgeon said: #The recent incidents onboard ferries are concerning and they are a reminder—there are many reminders—that the virus is still circulating, so we all need to continue to take care and think about our behaviour and our compliance with those important mitigations.#CalMac is already taking some steps to improve compliance on ferries. For example, it has increased the frequency of passenger announcements on face coverings and it continues to promote adherence to other baseline measures.#For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2021/09/Stuck-in-rent-featured-image2-300x180.jpg class=attachment-part-medium size-part-medium wp-post-image ","title":"coronavirus in scotland track the spread in these charts and maps2001","story":"We’ve put together a collection of daily updated charts to track the coronavirus crisis in Scotland.

Many of these are linked to previous and devastating trauma and are only made worse by the circumstances they are forced to live in.Part of our work at Crisis is to ensure our clients have the psychological support they need to establish a le away from homelessness. Keeping this going through the pandemic has been a real challenge and Crisis staff have been finding all sorts of creative solutions.In the early days of the pandemic our coaches worked rapidly to provide phones, tablets, laptops and data to our clients who needed it and adapted our services, including our psychological support, so we could provide a continued leline over the phone and online.With lockdown and restrictions now eased, it is a relief for our clients to feel less of the added mental pressure that we#ve had from the circumstances of the last year and for face-to-face support to be more of an option again.Whether in person or online, all our work is only made possible by the fantastic people and organisations who support us, meaning we can continue to help people across the country to leave homelessness behind for good.On behalf of Crisis and the thousands of people we support each year, we would particularly like to thank the players of People’s Postcode Lottery, across Scotland and where, who have helped fund the vital work of our clinical psychologists in such dficult times.Peter Oakes, lead clinical psychologist at CrisisSir,Recent disruptions with our ferry service from Islay to the mainland have once again shown us just how much we depend on a fit-for-purpose service with reliable, newer vessels in operation.Unfortunately this is currently not the case as our ferry fleet has been underfunded for many years,not decades, as a result of decisions made by urban-centric central government.Our frontline CalMac ferry crews and port staff are hard-working and an asset to our island and mainland communities, however they can only work with the tools they have at hand.The -year-old MV Hebridean Isles is one of the oldest in the state-owned fleet and while it was no doubt good in its day that day has passed a long time ago. Problems with our Islay ferry service have also been exacerbated with the continued poaching of one of our ferries in the summer months for other areas that CalMac operates in.On numerous occasions, distillers on Islay said they were facing major problems in transporting whisky to the Scottish mainland because of a capacity crisis on the ferry links.The feeling amongst many of my constituents is that it is we on Islay, Jura and Colonsay who always end up getting a raw deal.This simply cannot be allowed to continue.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward Sir,Thanks to funding from the Scottish Power Foundation, an Argyll and Bute scheme is offering young people a new route to gaining employment and skills in heritage.Heritage Horizons, run by the Culture, Heritage and Arts Assembly, Argyll and Isles , and Argyll and Bute Heritage and Museums Forum, aims to address the issue of an ageing workforce in the heritage and museums sectors by offering skill-building opportunities for young people.The project will work with Argyll heritage venues in areas of high unemployment, developing  accredited placements for young people.

St Peter#sSt Peter#s win - on penaltiesRed Star welcomed St Peter#s to the Ropework last Saturday for their Scottish Cup first round tie and were disappointed to exit the competition after an even contest ended - after  minutes.There weren#t many chances created by either side despite the best efforts of the players with defences largely on top.Star’s best efforts came from distance with Fraser Talbot going close to opening the scoring on a couple of occasions.St Peter’s most likely route to goal was from set-pieces which caused Star a few minor problems early on, but left Jake Weir largely untroubled in the Star goal.The sides exchanged goals late in the first half.Star took the lead from a typically wicked Craig Aitken corner which caused a mixup in the St Peter#s defence and the ball bundled in off a visitors# defender.Star couldn’t hold the lead till the break and St Peter#s were back on even terms after a rare lapse in the Star backline Jake Weir did well to save the initial effort but the St Peter#s winger reacted sharpest to score from close range. -.The second half was once again proving to be a tight affair with neither keeper really being troubled and it was no surprise that the game ended up going to penalty kicks.It was the visitors who edged the shootout with Coll McCallum and Craig Aitken being the unfortunate players to see their kicks saved after Andy Weir and Lee MacLean had scored.St Peter#s made no mistake with their four kicks and booked their place in the next round of the cup.Although disappointed to go out, Star will be delighted to finally play a League game for the first time in  months tomorrow as they travel to Parklea to face Port Glasgow OBU."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor september 10 2021","story":" Updated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowMore Commercial TreesSirI refer to the letter from Mick Bottomley of Forestry and Land Scotland in the August  edition of the Advertiser, where he puts forward the case for more commercial trees.I am very respectful of the timber industry#s important place in the Scottish economy and understand the need to pursue and develop such commercial opportunities in this area for landowners businesses.To balance the growth of the industry of trees for timber I would, however, hope that in turn greater respect is paid to the impact on the landscape the way the land is left after felling and the way the logs are transported.To take the A for example, a road that is promoted for tourism by government marketing initiatives and signs indicating a scenic route .Along the way, you pass and see great swathes of Sitka Spruce or, worse, ugly and bleak areas of devastation where they have been felled.This is while you avoid oncoming log lorries, at times along a very narrow road or, indeed, get stuck behind one.I would suggest thatwe need more commercial trees , we also need greater sensitivity shown and responsibility taken regarding the locations used, the management of the areas and transport.A start would be the edging of the road and forests with mixed deciduous trees so screening areas, particularly when felled,  and to take as much of the transport of logs off lorries and onto the water.Such steps would show some respect to the touristand to the local population.Name and address suppliedSirNew NHS Scotland workforce statistics published on September  show nursing and midwery vacancies have been at a record high since March, with more than , posts unfilled.The statistics show that, as of June , , nursing and midwery posts were vacant, this represents .% of all posts.They also show that in the previous quarter , ,posts were unfilled.

Academics agree that a sustainable level of material use, which would still allow for a high quality of le, is about eight tonnes per person per year.Zero Waste Scotland is advocating for mindful shopping, encouraging Scots to buy smarter and adopt reuse, repair and renting behaviours as well as embracing second-hand shopping.When finished with an item, it is calling on people to dispose of items responsibly by donating, reselling or recycling.With global climate change discussions at an all-time high and COP coming to Glasgow this November, the topic of responsible consumption in relation to the climate crisis has never been more timely.Everything we buy has a carbon cost and we are urging Scots to think dferently about what we buy and how we consume.Changing our own consumption habits is the single biggest thing we can all do to play our part in tackling climate change.Now is the time for action and we want people to bin less and buy better, seeking out items which will last longer.Responsible consumption isn’t on the COP agenda so we wanted to ensure it is top of the consumer agenda.To learn more about the campaign, please visit www.howtowasteless for further details.Iain Gulland, chief executive, Zero Waste Scotland"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters does genetic tolerance aid wild swimmers","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowWild swimming has become increasingly popular during lockdown, but in general people are ided into those who love swimming in cold water and those who think that it’s complete madness.Now scientists have found a possible explanation for this ision related to a muscle protein called alpha-actinin- .We have two types of muscle fibres # type  and type .Type  fibres provide fatigue resistance important for prolonged, submaximal activity like marathon running, while type  fibres produce a rapid and powerful force for short-burst, vigorous activities such as sprinting.The two types of fibres respond dferently to cold exposure # type  fibres produce an involuntary, low-intensity, continuous increase in muscle tone, while type  fibres give bursts of high-intensity activity causing overt shivering.ACTN is only active in type  muscle fibres, and deficiency of this protein is caused by a non-ing ACTN gene.This occurs in - per cent of the world’s population, around . billion people, and is most common in Europe and Asia.These people lack type  muscle fibre activity and although this is compensated by having larger type  fibres, it adversely affects muscle , impacting on athletic performance, particularly in sprint and power activities.Now scientists have investigated the role of ACTN in cold tolerance .Male participants,  with ing and  with non-ing ACTN, were immersed in water at °C for -minute periods interspersed with -minute rest periods at room temperature .The ordeal ended either after a maximum of six immersions or when participants’ body temperature dropped to .°C.The scientists found improved cold tolerance in those with non-ing ACTN, some  per cent of whom maintained body temperature above .°C compared to  per cent of those with al ACTN.So those lacking al type  fibres had better cold tolerance, suggesting that cold-induced increased muscle tone is more efficient at generating heat than overt shivering.Improved cold tolerance probably gave our ancestors an evolutionary survival advantage after their migration from Africa to colder climes in Eurasia, so explaining the high frequency of non-ing ACTN in today’s northern populations.It would be interesting to investigate how many Scottish wild swimmers carry this genetic iant.

He recalled: ‘We were out on a day sailing on the Dasher when she blew up and sank. They lost more than  men that day. And I lost my tools.’It was after the second world war that Peter realised his ambition of running his own electrical company.He had started his electrical apprenticeship in  at the age of  with the Campbeltown and Mid Argyll Electrical Supply Company, and by  he was ready to set up shop in Argyll Street, moving to Colchester Square in the s by which time he and his business partner Davie Wilson employed  members of staff,  working from Campbeltown to Strontian and on Islay, Mull, Coll and Tiree.Peter recalled the start of his career: ‘I used to leave at am, get my rolls in the morning before travelling up to get the ferry to Craignure on Mull,  then I’d take a bus to get the ferry over to Iona and then make the trip back home again. It was very hard work but it’s just what you did back then.’It was also at the end of the war that Peter married a woman he had met while working at the Clyde shipyards. His we Anne was from a family of  children brought up in Kilmacolm.Speaking at Peter#s birthday celebration, his daughter Margaret Loughran said: #My dad, his parents and his sisters Maria and Netta were given a really warm welcome when they moved to Lochgilphead in the s.#There were hardly any other families from outside Scotland living here at that time so they were always really grateful to have been accepted into the community.#I think that#s why Dad worked so hard over the years to support the church and the community more generally.#"},{"url":null,"title":"new argyll shop local gift card set for launch","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowA new gt card is coming soon to help Argyll businesses emerge from the pandemic with the help of local residents.The Argyll and Bute love local gt card will allow holders to enjoy a fantastic range of products, services and experiences on offer across the area, including hotel stays, gts, clothing, dining, household goods, groceries and services such as garages and accountants.Businesses are being encouraged to register for the Scottish Government-backed scheme to stimulate increased local spending and help protect jobs across Argyll and Bute.A map and listings of all registered businesses will appear on a dedicated Argyll and Bute webpage on the Scotland Gts Local website when the card launches next month.The gt cards will be sold online via the Scotland Gts Local , which allows people from all over the world to order a card.An ever-growing number of Argyll and Bute businesses are signing up, including cafes, bookshops, opticians, tourist attractions, gt shops and supermarkets.The scheme is being delivered by Scotland’s Towns Partnership , which is behind the Scotland Loves Local Campaign with funding from the Scottish Government and endorsed by Argyll and Bute Council.Visit www.lovelocal.scot gtcard to find out more about the Scotland Loves Local gt card, including details on how to sign up.Councillor Robin Currie, policy lead for the economy and rural growth, said: #The gt card scheme presents an excellent opportunity to support our local businesses as they continue to recover from the impact of COVID.#It has the potential to generate signicant spending across Argyll and Bute’s economy, helping secure jobs and build a more sustainable future for the region’s communities.#We would encourage all businesses across Argyll and Bute to sign up # this is the perfect way for people to show their support for their local traders particularly in the run-up to the Christmas shopping period.#Scotland’s minister for community wealth, Tom Arthur MSP, said the Scottish Government was #delighted to be backing this innovative scheme#, adding: #The gt card is a quick and efficient way to encourage spend and drive sales growth in our local economies.#The Argyll and Bute gt card is one of , unique to each region of Scotland, and can only be spent in businesses located in the region.[Would you box the following please and set in body of copy ]"},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week september 24 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowI had the wonderful privilege the other week of holding a new grandson for the first time.Isn#t it amazing how a new-born infant can grab hold of your heart  I was filled with so much love and pride and I prayed that his le would be blessed.It so happened that the Gospel reading set for the Sunday after I met my grandson was, in part at least, about a little child.​Mark tells us Jesus was walking ahead of his disciples on the way to Capernaum. When they got there Jesus asked them: #What were you arguing about along the way #They couldn#t answer, for they had been arguing about which of them was the greatest. They were silent, because they#d been caught out.Then Jesus took a little child in his arms and said to them: #Whoever welcomes one such child in my name welcomes me, and whoever welcomes me, welcomes not me but the one who sent me.#Greatness, Jesus was saying to them, is found in welcoming and receiving into our arms someone vulnerable, powerless and dependent, regardless of age.Greatness is found not in what we have accomplished but in what we have done and given to #the least of these#, the hungry, thirsty, naked, sick, and imprisoned: the symbolic children in each of our lives.Greatness never makes itself superior over another. It is not about me, my job, my reputation, my status.

There simply isn’t space to accommodate everybody, so there is a degree of compromise.#There are opportunities for season tickets, but that does come at a cost as part of the council process. There are proposals for permits for businesses as well as residents.Councillor Lorna Douglas said there was #real concern# where staff who were not on high salaries could have to pay for a permit costing more than £.She added: #Luss is not an easy place to get to. I know people who work there and do car pools, but to me, £ for a permit is massive.#Stuart Watson, the council’s traffic and development manager, replied: #Businesses can get two permits which can be for staff as well.

We were delighted to welcome them to Argyll for their first performance as a quartet and for three of the four performers this was the first time they had performed in more than a year.The quartet # Andrew, Dean, Jack and Richard # introduced each piece, giving background to both the role of the saxophone and the composer, with many of the pieces arranged by the group themselves.Purcell’s #Festival Rondeau# was the dramatic opening, a work well-known across all age groups, so a perfect start to the concert.Following this was a work composed specically for a saxophone quartet in  by Jean-Baptiste Singelée, a friend of Adolph Sax who invented the saxophone. We were treated to the traditional Andante before moving onto the exciting Allegro.The third selection of pieces were all by Debussy. This was a surprising choice as the saxophone is not really associated with the Impressionist period, however, it showed the versatility of both the saxophones and performers. #Arabesque No.# was followed by #The Little Shepherd# which was delightful, calm and serene with only the sound of the river flowing through the trees and birds singing along. The jaunty #Cakewalk# completed this ied section.#Air on a G String# by Bach and known to many as a TV advert was the next offering. The opening descending bass line showed the depth and quality of the baritone saxophone in much more than just a supporting role. This music predates the invention of the saxophone by more than  years.Gershwin and a selection of show tunes from the swing era were just what we needed after the relaxing #Air#. The four musical songs, all showcasing dferent styles, certainly had the audience smiling, toe-tapping and singing along. In the final piece #I Got Rhythm# we were all moving to the music, including the quartet. Closing your eyes, you could imagine you were relaxing in a jazz club anywhere in the world.The next piece, #L’Arlesienne Exhibition#, is a collection of highlights for the saxophone in an orchestral situation. The music was composed by Hiroki Takahashi, with many familiar themes from film and TV # including The Apprentice # all thoroughly enjoyable.Gershwin’s #An American in Paris# portrays the many sights and sounds that Gershwin experienced there in the s. While it was composed for an orchestra which included saxophones and car horns, the music played by the quartet didn’t include any car horns # just skilled and imaginative saxophonists.A change of pace to enjoy some relaxed, laid-back music from West Africa followed with Will Gregory’s #High Le#. The repeated rhythms with the peace of Kilmory, the cooling air and the gentle river flowing was almost hypnotic and brought the concert to a finish.The audience cheered, clapped and blew their cars horns to ensure the quartet provided an encore. #Witch Hunt# by Ulrich Schultheiss was the encore # a dramatic and fiery work challenging all the performers and bringing a fantastic concert to a close.The quartet members themselves didn#t feel the cars were a barrier and said they #had a blast at a unique and special event#.MAAA thank the th Argyll Scoutsfor helping with the car parking. Traffic cones and hi-vis waistcoats were loaned by MacLeods and the wagon we used as a stage was from Ferguson#s Butchers. Picnic boxes were pre-ordered from Lucy’s Ardfern.

especially when it comes to the impact of proposed sites on traditional fishing grounds # poor site maintenance and monitoring which can lead to instances of vessel entanglement and also the environmental impact of the sites on both commercial and non-commercial species.The group believes that while the sector has made many advances over the past decade, increased transparency and oversight are needed to ensure the aquaculture sector can better co-exist with the fishing industry.The initial aim of the group would be to ensure that there is a proper analysis of localised fishing and follow up with clear and sensible communication between the two sectors to ensure that with expansion does not come conflict.It is a timeous idea, which will hopefully reassure fishermen that they will not simply be displaced by fish farming but will be respected for their own produce.The group will cement a policy to assist the fishing industry deal realistically with the fish farming industry and the Scottish Salmon Producers Organisation.Simon Macdonald, chair RIFG Aquaculture Work GroupSir,NFU Scotland is calling on the UK Government to address the nation’s growing labour crisis, which is undermining all parts of the food and drink supply chain, leading to signicant losses on some Scottish farms and resulting in a growing number of empty shop shelves.Last week#s #BackBritishFarmingDay on September  came as a UK Government announcement of a free trade #agreement in principle# between the UK and New Zealand is believed to be imminent.Having agreed in June to provide unfettered access in the future to Australia, the cumulative impact of another deal with a major exporting nation has huge signicance for Scottish farmers and crofters.With so much to celebrate about the quality and standards of our food and drink, #BackBritishFarmingDay was a fantastic opportunity to thank the nation for their incredible support throughout Brexit and Covid-.NFU Scotland, both independently and in conjunction with the Scottish food and drink industry, has written several times to UK Government calling for measures that address the shortfall in both seasonal and permanent staff.Should it fail to do so, I have absolutely no doubt that the situation will deteriorate further.It is galling to hear that the UK Government is on the verge of signing up to another free trade deal that will permit a growing level of imports while delivering very little to our food and drink sector in .The blunt fact is that neither deal has been afforded any kind of proper parliamentary scrutiny as the government’s promised Statutory Trade and Agriculture Commission has yet to be established.Safeguards against market disruption are also promised, but the cumulative impact of these deals will be profound for UK farming.If handled badly, these may make it impossible for some of our family farming businesses to continue to compete with high levels of low-cost imports produced to standards that would not be allowed here.Martin Kennedy, president, NFU ScotlandSir,National audits of diabetic services have shown that only around  per cent of people with type one or two diabetes have nine key annual checks to help prevent long-term diabetic complications.The pandemic has made this situation dficult because many routine checks and face-to-face appointments have not been available.The InDependent Diabetes Trusthas published a free new booklet which explains the nine key tests.It helps people look after their health by ensuring that they know what checks they need from health professionals.Get your copy of Diabetes care #

Try and get evergreens planted by the end of the month.Dormant roses are now available at local nurseries and garden centres and are very good value for money.You can easily create a rose garden for the coming year that will provide beautul flowers and fragrance from early summer through to autumn.Before planting, mix in some good quality compost and make sure the plants are watered well once planted.It#s an excellent time to plant coners as well. Coners are cone-bearing seed plants and include cedars, cypresses, firs, junipers, larches, pines, spruces and yews.While being practical and useful, coners are also visually stunning and can transform a garden into something quite magnicent.They are a wonderful way of adding colour and shape to your outdoor space, particularly as many coners change colour throughout the year.With several hundred ieties available in the UK, there is one to suit every type of garden, and they are easy to look after.They need good drainage and water to get them established, but once growing will need little attention as they are pretty disease resistant and maintenance free.In addition to coners, another way to bring colour to the garden at this time of year is with autumn bedding plants.One of the most exciting group of plants to brighten up any part of the garden is heuchera.Native to North America, heucheras were originally grown for their flowers – dainty spikes of red, pink and white

Once they take ownership of the food it becomes more palatable.I donrsquot know any kids who donrsquot like making pancakes. The measuring, cracking eggs making a mess is a great source of fun. The whole thrill of standing over the hob with a wooden spatula trying to flip over a pancake is irresistible.Not only are these courgette pancakes fun to make, but they can also entice even the hardened no -greens eater to be to taste them. The reaction will be a game changer.Ingredients:- courgettes, about g large free-range eggs tablespoons self-raising flour tablespoons milk syboestrimmed and finely chopped sprigs flat leaf parsley and  leaves fresh mint or basil, choppedSea salt and black pepperCorn or vegetable oilMethod:Wash the courgettes and grate on a course grater.Leave in a sieve over a bowl to allow any excess liquid to drain away. .Break the eggs into a large bowl and beat with a fork.Sieve in the flour and add the milk.Beat everything into a batter.Season with sea salt and pepper.Add the grated courgettes, chopped syboes and the herbs.Prepare a warmed plate with a sheet of kitchen paper to lay the cooked pancakes on.Add enough oil to cover the bottom of a non-stick frying pan.Heat the oil and add a teaspoon of the batter to check when it is hot enough.When it starts to sizzle, the oil is hot enough.Add  separate tablespoons of batter into the oil, leaving plenty of space between them.Cook for  minutes or so until they start to look browned.Turn and cook the other side for a further  minutes.When both sides are well browned remove to the warmed plate and leave to drain.Make the rest of the pancakes the same way, adding more oil to the panneeded.Keep the heat high enough to ensure the pancakes cook briskly to prevent them absorb too much oil.Try with a drained tin of sweetcorn as an alternative.Mary Contini OBE is a writer and Director of Valvona  Crolla ltd.

At times, such was the turmoil and ineptitude on display, you would not have left this crew in charge of a rubber duck, never mind a nuclear-powered submarine.Precision was not the point though, this being a piece of fiction. In its favour, Tom Edgersquos drama had a solid gold cast and a strongoccasionally baffling script .Above all, Vigil had pluck and ambition. While this was a tale made for the small screen, the action scenes could have passed muster in a cinema.: No Line of Duty but Jones makes impactWhen we left Amy Silvaat the end of episode it looked as though the jig was up for the DCI.Lamped by a sonar operator who turned out to be an agent for the Russkies, Amy had been stuffed in the same kind of missile casing that had been Martin Compstonrsquos home for the past five weeks. She would have been a goner in the first ten minutessomeone had not walked in on the villain just in time. A lot of that went on in the final hour.Entombed in a tube, all Amy could do was scream for help and think back to the love she had driven away, fellow copper Kirsten , and the daughter who had lost her fatherin a car accident.Eventually, Amy remembered she knew Morse code. As luck would have it, there was someone in the control room who could interpret the messageand with one bound, and a quick vomit, Amy was free to nick the villain.But she had to avoid him killing her first. The chase through the submarine was heart in the mouth stuff, the corridors bathed in red, lights fizzing and flashing.Amy, lithe and muscular, sweating for Scotland in her vest, looked positively Ripleyesque as she hunted the alien presence in her midst.Meanwhile, water was pouring into the boat courtesy of the bad guyrsquos earlier handiwork - he had been a very busy boy - and HMS Vigil was heading for Davy Jonesrsquo locker. The unluckiest submarine in the world looked to be about to meet its fate.But onboard and on shore, the women were not going to let that happen. Though men were predominant, especially at the boss level, it was women who made the key moves, much as in Line of Duty .The men squared off and honour was saved, the anti-Trident MP agreeing to keep quiet ldquothis time. Not before he had a mini rant about getting nukes out of Scotland within his letime, however.It had all been a Russian plot to make the nukes in Scotland seem unsafe and steer MPs into cancelling a replacement deterrent, which sounded a bit rum. Who was to say it would not have had the opposite effect : Was Vigil filmed on a submarine There was no time to worry about any of that because there was hair to be stroked and a relationship to repair. Amy and Kirsten, with their shared love for justice and nice coats, had some talking to do.The last word went to our Martin, which was only fair given he had been stuffed in a tube for a month and a half . As poignant music played he banged on in his last video testament about what a wonderful world it was.The Russkies were back in their box and the planet was safe once more, albeit courtesy of enough explosive power to blow us all to kingdom come.

Some say it has earned a place alongside acknowledged Scottish architectural icons, including Butersquos gothic mansion Mount Stuart House and the Palace of Holyroodhouse.But it has been shut for six years and a re-opening has been limbo for over two years as the process of restoration toit to its s Art Deco glory has stalled over and over again.In the meantime the costs have nearly doubled from initial estimates of poundm.It had been announced in  that that the ldquojewel in Butersquos heritage would re-open its doors in the summer of the same year.The plan was to turn it into a cultural and community hub, with the aim of creating a tourism attraction for Bute and the wider area, with organisers saying it would be a ldquosignicant catalyst for regeneration and change on the island.When complete, it was to see the creation of four separate spaces: a main hall capable of seating up to  people a self-contained studio theatre space for  a flexible exhibition area and a unique glazed top floor with spectacular views for weddings and other bespoke events.But the refurbishment of the building, which has been exposed to the salty air of the Firth of Clyde since opening in  and was placed on the ldquobuildings at risk register in , has since been dogged by issues as a result of weather, construction issues, the insolvency of a contractor and the pandemic.Now the container ship that caused global disruption after blocking the Suez canal earlier this year has been identied as one of the factors which could further hold up the completion of Rothesayrsquos new Pavilion.Argyll and Bute Councilrsquos deputy leader Gary Mulvaney has said in a report that work remains ongoing to ensure that the building can safely be finished.While the Rothesay Pavilion website indicates a re-opening this year - the council before the concerns about the container ship estimated it would not be completed until the summer of next year.Mr Mulvaney has indicated that there could be even more delays, as there are issues because the construction industry was facing ldquounprecedented pressures through the Covid- pandemic.The blockage of the Suez Canal in March,eof the biggest traffic jams in shipping history was also a factor as it delayed the delivery of materials.In May, last year, the resurrection of the Pavilion hit a major blow after Central Building Contractors, the main builders on the poundm project went ito administration.And so far there has been no sign of replacement contractors to carry the work through.Before that the council, which owns the building said attempts to open in the summer of  were put back because a month before it was due to open its doors it emerged that only  per cent of the work had been completed.Project manager Jonathan Miles said it was primarily caused due to works including undercroft excavation, roof replacement, cast stone repairs and cast stone coping replacement, not having progressed as swtly as thought due to weather and \"complexity challenges\".He said that despite the main contractorsrsquo best endeavours, maintaining the water tightness and integrity of the structure had been \"challenging\".There was also concern that asbestos in the existing main hall ceiling was in a far worse condition than surveys led the council to believe.Mr Mulvaney, who is the councils policy lead for financial services and major projects said they had been involved in detailed negotiations with a major construction contractor to take on the rest of the work.\"Our initial engagement with them has enabled their appointment to undertake lsquopreconstruction activitiesrsquo. This is where they will work closely with our inhouse team and our design consultants to further develop our specic technical and contractual requirements for completing the refurbishment of the Rothesay Pavilion,\" he said.ldquoThe construction sector globally is facing unprecedented pressures arising due to a number of factors including the Covid pandemic and the recent blockage of the Suez Canal which, taken in combination, have impacted upon the availability and material and transportation costs for core construction resources, materials, plant and equipment.He added: \"As part of the pre-construction activities, the preferred contractor is undertaking an extensive market engagement exercise with its established supply chain, such that later this year it will be able to submit to us its price and programme of activities to complete the works.\"In July, , Rothesay Pavilion had a video created as part of a countdown to re-opening.The Pavilion, while having played host to seaside entertainment shows such as wrestling and the Miss Rotheseay pageant, in more recent times played host to bands such as the acclaimed Scots post-rock band Mogwai.The council felt that the relaunch would play a pivotal role in the islandrsquos economic regeneration and social inclusion initiatives through increased tourism and an elevated national and international profile.Ambitions for future programming include artistic collaborations and accessible community workshops, offering wide appeal across generational boundaries and erse cultural tastes.It aimed to host national and international music, comedy, theatre and dance acts, as well as showing major exhibitions of history, photography and visual arts."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"September ,  at : amOrkney Islands Council will be carrying out road patching and resurfacing works across the county, as we head into autumn.

This includes Memorandums of Understanding with Orkney Harbour Authority and Scrabster Harbour Trust to enhance port infrastructure and position the area more competitively to support offshore wind projects in the future.The announcement of this bid comes after the completion of the leasing round of Scotwind, a programme which will lease areas of the seabed around Scotland for wind farm developments.The Scottish Government hopes that as much as ten gigawatts of new generating capacity will be built over the next decade.Stephen Kerr, project director of the West of Orkney Windfarm, said: “While ScotWind has created the opportunity for a global industry to tap into Europe’s best wind resource, our consortium believes that success will be driven by targeted proposals built upon strong local relationships.”We have designed our bid specically around this location and brought together a unique combination of stakeholders to maximise the opportunities for the region.“In particular, the upcoming round of offshore wind projects are a terric opportunity for ports in Caithness and Orkney to win signicant long-term contracts in the installation and operational phase of these major infrastructure schemes.“Our agreements with Scrabster Harbour Trust and Orkney Harbour Authority will enable us to work together with a clear focus on long term delivery. Each port has its own specic capabilities and attributes, and on successful site award we have committed to fund collaborative design and supply studies and to invest where appropriate in improving each harbour’s infrastructure.“We will apply a similar collaborative approach across the supply chain, working closely with Scottish and UK suppliers to deliver on climate targets and enhance local economies.”The consortium has undertaken extensive site investigations, including birds, marine mammals and near-shore geophysical surveys, and has finalised a grid connection agreement with National Grid that will enable the project to commence generation in .Jim Buck, harbourmaster for Orkney Harbour Authority, said that Scapa Flow # the second largest natural harbour in the world # offers an environment like no other and said that the £million masterplan to develop ports around Orkney is key in attracting new business to the islands. “Our Masterplan embraces decarbonisation and a transition away from fossil fuels,” said Mr Buck.“It includes a range of infrastructure enhancements across key locations around the Orkney mainland, including a new deep-water facility in Scapa Flow, which will be crucial to us realising our ambition to deliver social and economic benefit from offshore wind energy.“The West of Orkney Windfarm is ideally positioned to make signicant use of these future facilities and this collaboration represents another key step on our journey to position Orkney as a base for innovation and a major contributor in delivering a carbon-free future for the islands.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

MacRae raced onto Jordan Fraser#s lofted pass and as MacDonald advanced the Shiel attacker kept a cool head to deftly clip the ball home and make it -.The goal knocked the stuffing out of Lovat, who struggled to create much in the way of clear chances thereafter. And deep into injury-time MacRae completed the fairy tale with another adroit finish for the hat-trick.There were no shortage of contenders for the Albert Smith medal for man of the match # but the award, now in its th year, went to defensive lynchpin Conor Cormack.After the match the -year-old hat-trick-hero, who previously feared he might have to quit the game after a succession of knee injuries, said: #It#s not really sunk it yet # at the final whistle we had people running to us and crying. It will take a while and maybe it will be a few days before it all hits home.#It#s something we all hoped hadn#t passed us by # you need a good run of games, and fortunately it has worked out for us this year. It#s an amazing feeling.#Kinlochshiel manager Johnston Gill, who has now led the club to the Premier League, MacAulay Cup and Camanachd Cup, added: #Lovat gave us a hard time of it, but we had Keith MacRae on fire today # the whole team were brilliant. #It was nip and tuck after they came back to - but I think we shaded the game as a whole.#We knew the threat they carried, but Fraser Heath was well marked by Finlay MacRae and Conor did a great job against Greg Matheson. #We got our tactics right and used our subs well # they were all outstanding.#It#s a fantastic day # most of the community is here with us in Oban # they are great for us, and give us fantastic backing. We will all enjoy it!#Meanwhile, earlier in the day Skye Camanachd also had a victory to savour as their under- team lted the Ken MacMaster Cup.Goals from Seonaidh MacLeod and Alasdair Stewart sealed a - win over Fort William."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/SHIEL-FOR-THE-CUP-3-1.jpg","title":"norrie t macdonald crofts have become the the bitcoin of the","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineYes, it’s more of a hobby than a full-time commitment, but it’s ‘in the blood’.. But were it not for Murdo Dan’s job as a joiner and Chrissie Mary doing a few shts as a carer, their economic ‘situation’ would be very dficult indeed.To supplement their income, they have decided to use their meagre savings, borrow a not insignicant sum from their local bank, and apply to stick a couple of pods on the croft.Meanwhile, Nigel and Pippa saw a croft for sale in the Sunday Times Property Section for what they thought was a snip at £k and decided to use part of a trust fund to purchase it as a commercial investment.They thought that they could also capitalise on the local tourist ‘boom’ and have applied to turn the derelict croft house into a vegan cafe and craft shop and also to stick several pods on their newly acquired croft to offer a ‘holistic getaway’ for their jet-set pals.Do you, and I certainly don’t mean to pre-judge anyone who reads this paperthink that their ‘cases’ should be treated any dferently by the local planning authorities If the answer is “yes”, then think again.Too dficult a scenario to judge Try this one.Should an application to build a couple of pods on a croft, which is basically  per cent bog, in the middle of Ranish and has no view of anywhere except adjacent croft bog, be given any additional merit over a similar application in beautul Scaristavore or Ardroil where ‘breathtaking scenery’ will be the selling tagline Wrong again.As a member of the local planning board here in the Western Isles, I’m more than well aware of what my responsibilities are and it’s certainly not to pre-judge any applications based on my own preconceptions, or prejudicesof what should or shouldn’t be allowed.I’ve to stick to the guidelines and the training I’ve been given, understand what’s expected of meand to base my decision without emotion or bias. across the front pages of this paper and others, on social media and the television news, can influence any of my our decisions.The capitalist playground which crofting tenure has now become, and the seismic change in the scale of speculation on ‘marketable’ properties available, is in danger of knocking the fragile socio-economic balance of the west of Scotland even further off its already very shoogly axis.Crofts have now become the equivalent of crypto-currency the ‘Bitcoins’ which can provide financial security for those fortunate enough to be sitting on ‘gold’.What’s being done to stabilise and bring a dose of reality to a market which threatens to get completely out of control How can single iniduals be able to own several crofts with not an intention to ‘work’ or develop any single one of them I believe that a crofting historian once said that this form of land tenure has become ‘the single biggest impediment to sustainable development in Western Scotland and the Highlands and Islands’.That wasn’t yesterday.‘Things’ are already well out of control.But who should intervene I’m not the only one who keeps asking the question.Apparently ‘we’ should legislate to address.We need, it has been suggested, to become Jersey or Guernsey.That people shouldn’t be allowed to buy homes here unless they intend to be used as a primary residence .Second homes taxation needs to increase signicantly and the additional income be used to support tourism infrastructure.From the Butt to Bodmin there have been ious proposals as to how to legislate to prevent the worst effects of tourism from destroying fragile local economies.Have any worked, andso, could they be implemented here to make any dference Let me be very clear.Tourism is hugely important to our rural economy.More so since Brexit and Covid.But I’ll say this again, at the risk of boring you all: it needs to be carefully nurtured and sustainably developed.We cannot survivewe turn our villages into ‘ghost-towns’#yes, I know…..for the winter months.We need a balance, we need the ‘tools’ with which to legislate properly and we need those charged with ‘oversight’ to take better ownership.We need, and I’ve yet to see any evidence of this, these same people to begin to take this seriously.For our future generations.They are the ones who will be impacted mostwe don’t sit up and pay attention.Now."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CATTLE-SALES-SEP-21-2-scaled.jpg","title":"remember your roots skye plan is urged to recognise","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThose were the comments of Roddy Murray, former Western Isles councillor and now the grazings clerk for Tarskavaig in Sleat, who this week voiced his concern that there was no mention of crofting at all in the ‘Skye and Raasay Future’ plan published in August with the full backing of all four local councillors.He told the Free Press: “There are  projects listed in the plan but not a single mention of crofting. Crofting is the basis for so many of the settlements on Skye outwith Portree, Broadford and Kyleakin and this should have been acknowledged.“There is quite a signicant impact from crofting on the economic and social well-being of Skye and Raasay. You only have to look at the , high quality calves sold for high prices last week in Portree to see that.”In terms of infrastructure improvements to support crofting, Mr Murray said the auction mart in Portree must be redeveloped to improve parking and animal welfare, and an abattoir facility must be provided so that livestock does not have to be driven to Dingwall.He added: “We are being told by the Scottish Crofting Federation that there is a huge demand for new crofts.#To meet that demand we either have to encourage landowners to make this happen or there has to be acquisition of an estate.“If we want to keep our young people in our communities we need to address the availability of crofts.”The Scottish Government are guilty of an “abject failure” when it comes to creating new crofts on publicly-owned land, Mr Murray added.Stung by the criticism, the council said they hoped to “discuss the plan further with organisations like the Crofting Commission” and would be keen to hear from any other interested parties.A spokeswoman said: “Skye and Raasay Future has been prepared with and by wider representatives of the community across the area.#It reflects people’s vision and priorities for the future, following feedback gathered through workshops and online consultations held throughout the year.“In workshop discussions, the important role that crofting plays in the identity and culture of Skye and Raasay communities has been clearly referenced..#Skye councillor John Finlayson said all stakeholders should be involved in “shaping, evaluating and changing” the plan’s priorities and he acknowledged the importance of crofting “in all its guises” across Skye and Raasay.He added: “Crofting is still a central part of le on Skye and while it is part of our history and culture it will also I hope continue to be a key part of our future and it is an important element of SARF.#As those who took part in the engagement to create the initial plan agreed, it is important that representatives from the crofting community are fully engaged in the continued development and implementation of the plan and I am confident this will happen.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4097188.jpg--.jpg?1632220580000\n","title":"ni businesses showcase their produce and services at london exhibition","story":"DOZENS of Northern Ireland businesses have showcased their products and services at an exhibition in London.The Westminster event is part of the Northern Ireland Offices centenary programme.Business leaders also attended a reception at Downing Street last Wednesday hosted by the prime minister.The government said it would provide businesses with an opportunity to network with international companies and investors.The exhibitors represented a cross-section of sectors within the Northern Ireland economy and included  start-ups.

By gathering as much information as we can, we will be able to help people and dogs live the best lives possible together.”The online survey asks dog owners about everything from how their dog behaves and what training they do with their four-legged friend, to questions about their relationship such as do they celebrate their dog’s birthday and do they tell them they love them. It also covers people’s post-pandemic plans for their dog such as are they hoping to take them into the office with them or will they employ a dog walker,they are ing to their workplace.The survey, which can be completed online at www.nationaldogsurvey.org.uk, also asks people to say how having a dog improves their le, what advice they would give to people looking to welcome a dog into their family and what one thing could Dogs Trust do to help them and their dog live happily together.Conor adds:“We always love to hear tales from owners who have adopted from us, and every single one of them has a dferent story to tell. We now want to capture the experiences of all local dog owners so we can build a picture of dog ownership today and what more Dogs Trust can do to help them and their dogs.“This will be the most comprehensive census of dogs and dog lovers ever completed and we would love iteveryone who is passionate about dogs could do their bit to help our four-legged friends of the future have the best lives possible.“What people tell us today will help us make sure we are able to do everything we can to support dogs and their owners for the next  years and more.”For more information and to take part in the National Dog Survey, visit www.nationaldogsurvey.org.uk Dog owners who complete the survey will get tailored behaviour advice sent direct to them.

A total of £m in UC claims were paid out during the financial year, compared to £m the previous year.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Mr Donnelly said: Aside from the considerable increase in numbers of UC claims, the Department also introduced a number of changes to the administration of the benefit and reduced checks for a short period of time to get money to those in need as quickly as possible.In my opinion, the estimated value of overpayments and underpayments due to fraud and error in benefits, other than State Pension, remains material and the qualication of my audit opinion reflects this. The Department’s accounts have been qualied for a number of years due to material levels of overpayments and underpayments in benefit expenditure. The nature and reasons for these levels of fraud and error y every year.The report also notes that, when there was a signicant increase in UC claims at the beginning of the pandemic, DfC were able to identy , suspicious claims, of which % were found to be wholly or partly suspicious and were not paid out as a result.“It is encouraging that in the midst of the pressures arising from the pandemic that Department staff were alert to the possibility of fraud and acted accordingly, Mr Donnelly said.While there was an increase in overpayments due to fraud and error, underpayments for the same reasons decreased. In  , this figure was £.m , compared to £mthe previous year.To mitigate against the impact of Covid, DfC was allocated an additional £m to deliver support schemes. The NIAO report details how this money was spent, with the majoritygoing towards grants for local councils. Some £.m was spent on heating payments, £m on the sports hardship fund, and £.m on the culture resilience scheme.Elsewhere, £.m was paid out in charitable grants, and £.m was spent on supporting the homeless..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Related topicsDepartment for CommunitiesMore On Department for CommunitiesCheers to that!

Most of the remaining provisions will come in to effect in April  with some others requiring a slightly longer period.”Colin Neill, chief executive of Hospitality Ulster, commended Ms Hargey for implementing the legislative changes which he said will “enhance the offer of our local hospitality sector”.The entire industry has been struggling over the last eighteen months and this will provide a confidence boost, and will bode well for the future of the hospitality offer as we plan ahead,” he said.“This marks a signicant step forward for the hospitality industry here as the benefits of the modernisation of our outdated liquor licensing legislation begins to be realised.”Mr Neill added: “The updated Liquor Licensing legislation will see a well-balanced approach to how the hospitality sector trades, addressing the perennial question marks around the likes of permitted Easter opening times and drinking up time and will provide greater opportunity to attract more tourists and visitors to our shores as we compete in the international market place.We look forward to seeing the positive impacts of these changes.”.app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Read MoreProgress on NI licensing laws reform hailed as ‘modest but signicant’ changes by hospitality chiefRelated topicsDeirdre HargeyDepartment for CommunitiesMore On Deirdre Hargey PremiumFrustration as  requests for NDNA language discussion at Executive deniedBelfast City council will ask public to vote on name of new bridge crossing River Lagan PremiumNI Assembly s: Agenda for ministers as new term set to test leaders’ political skills to limit PremiumFirst and Deputy First Ministers urged to explain delay in welfare mitigation legislation PremiumMinister is urged to increase grant for upgrades to homes of disabled peopleMost ReadWilliam and Kate begin Northern Ireland visit by meeting university studentsEx-Presbyterian minister faces trial over indecent image of children chargesFurious judge calls Northern Ireland prosecutors ‘utterly inept’ over domestic violence kne casePanic at the pumps: How NI missed out on fuel crisis – but could now see petrol prices rocketNI’s used car prices rocket as demand exceeds supply, with some selling for more than list price of new modelTop VideosPlayVideo: Kate gets hands on tarantula during Ulster University visitPlayVideo: RAF Tornado fighter arrives at Ulster Aviation Society hanger in LisburnPlayVideo: Man smashes car with weapon in Belfast attackLatest Northern IrelandWilliam and Kate get a kick out of Derry sports project on Northern Ireland visit simple changes you can make to your home that will help to reduce energy billsBlue plaque honours portable defibrillator inventor Frank PantridgeMichael Conlan’s  Olympic loss may have been due to ‘bout manipulation’, report findsLonger passenger train begins service on NI railway networkLatestGerard ‘The Monk’ Hutch appears in court charged in relation to the gangland murder of David Byrne at the Regency HotelCha lose again after Federico Chiesa hits winner for JuventusCristiano Ronaldo strikes at the death to snatch Man Utd victory over VillarrealWilliam and Kate get a kick out of Derry sports project on Northern Ireland visit simple changes you can make to your home that will help to reduce energy bills,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendNewsEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: PacemakerOlivia FletcherSeptember   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailThe saying usually goes “Christmas has come early” – but in Rod Ferris’ case, it’s come  months late, after he received a rather belated Christmas card from his friend on Tuesday.In what he describes as “amusing and just baffling”, Mr Ferris , who was working from his Bangor home for his job in the transport industry, went to collect his post at around pm and discovered a card marked with a “happy holidays” stamp.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseRod Ferris receives a Christmas Card  months after it was posted fro AmericaPMAKER FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueRod Ferris receives a Christmas Card  months after it was posted fro America“As usual, you have your flyers, your Domino’s etc and there was this card… and I looked, and I recognised it was from a friend of mine who lives in a place called Pottstown, Pennsylvania, quite near the suburbs of Philadelphia. And I looked and it had my name on it. I went, ‘Holy smoke. I don#t believe this’.”He had expected the card to arrive in December , after it had been posted by his American friend, Dan Pettigrew, on December  that year.“I maybe thought to myself it must have got lost in the post and that was going back to January. I never thought any more of it,” Mr Ferris told the Belfast .“And today,” he went on to say, “we’re sitting here on  September and out of the blue, I get this card. And I just looked at it, and what I did straight away was I made a WhatsApp video of it and sent it to Dan, my brother and a friend. There’s four of us in a WhatsApp group, and so everyone comes back and says, ‘There’s no way’.”But things got even stranger when Mr Ferris found out that his brother had also received his Christmas card from Mr Pettigrew on Tuesday.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseRod Ferris Receives a Christmas Card  months after it was posted from America.

Ten months to send a Christmas card’ ”And in the WhatsApp group, Mr Ferris joked to his friend: “Don’t be bothered about sending me one for this year.

Credit: PacemakerThe pair have known each other for about seven years.Mr Pettigrew, who started coming over to Northern Ireland when he traced back ancestry and distant relatives to Bangor, was looking for people from the area to attend a Northern Ireland match with him in the Faroe Islands.Mr Ferris, an avid supporter of the Northern Ireland football team, met him there and they have kept in touch since – including by sending Christmas cards to each other annually.“The irony is – and Dan#s got a wicked sense of humour – the card says, ‘I bought you this card for the holidays. It#s printed on a special paper that repels the Coronavirus’, and then it says inside, ‘just kidding. You should definitely wash your hands right now’.”And he joked: “It’s near enough ready for Santa Claus to deliver it this year.”A Royal Mail spokesperson said: It is dficult to speculate what may have happened to this item of mail, but it is likely that it was put back into the postal system by someone recently, rather than it being lost or stuck somewhere. Royal Mail regularly checks all its delivery offices and clears its processing machines daily.

I’m thinking about it...”The paucity of new cars is a result of the global shortage of semiconductors which began in the first quarter of this year and has halted assembly lines around the world.Many motorists, meanwhile, are changing cars with the money saved from not getting away on expensive family holidays during the Covid- pandemic.In some cases, six-month-old cars with , miles on the clock are changing hands for more than they would cost new.Richard Ramsey, Ulster Bank chief economist, told the Belfastthat the used car market has been affected by a double whammy of a slump in available stock and a surge in prices.“UK new car registrations recorded their slowest August in eight years with sales down % compared to August last year, and it’s a similar story in Northern Ireland,” he said.“Local dealers had their worst August since the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Tradersseries began, with sales down % year-on-year and were one-fth lower than pre-pandemic levels in August .“During the first eight months of the year there were fewer than , new cars sold.“That may be % higher than last year, but it is over , fewer thanthe corresponding period in .”Mr Ramsey said the undersupply of new cars has continued to reduce the flow of stock into the used car market here.“For example, in  there were , new cars sold in Northern Ireland,” he said.“This fell by % year-on-yearto less than , in  with the latter marking a series low for new car sales locally.“Strong demand and limited supply are pushing prices higher. Indeed, UK second-hand car prices jumped by .% year on year in August.”Parkers, the popular online car price guide, researched how much the price of several three-year-old cars with , miles on the clock had increased since February this year – a time when second-hand vehicles would normally depreciate in price by around %It found that a Toyota Auris hybrid had gone up %, from £, to £, Mazda MX- .% from £, to £, Mercedes C-Class Cabriolet .% from £, to £, Vauxhall Mokka .% from £, to £,.Meanwhile, second hand Toyota Yaris GRs – which are listed at £,. new – have been advertised online for over £,.Another online seller was asking £, for six-month-old Dacia Sandero – £,. more than the price of buying a new one.It’s clear that,you own a car you don’t need – perhaps due to working from home instead of the office – now would be a good time to sell.It will only benefit you, however,you don’t want a replacement – which will also have cost a lot more than it did six months ago..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Read MoreSam McBride:OpinionJournalists want to bring the public the truth... but they need help to do it and it’s vital that Northern Ireland’s defamation law is changedMost ReadWilliam and Kate begin Northern Ireland visit by meeting university studentsEx-Presbyterian minister faces trial over indecent image of children chargesFurious judge calls Northern Ireland prosecutors ‘utterly inept’ over domestic violence kne casePanic at the pumps: How NI missed out on fuel crisis – but could now see petrol prices rocketNI’s used car prices rocket as demand exceeds supply, with some selling for more than list price of new modelTop VideosPlayVideo: Kate gets hands on tarantula during Ulster University visitPlayVideo: RAF Tornado fighter arrives at Ulster Aviation Society hanger in LisburnPlayVideo: Man smashes car with weapon in Belfast attackLatest Northern IrelandWilliam and Kate get a kick out of Derry sports project on Northern Ireland visit simple changes you can make to your home that will help to reduce energy billsBlue plaque honours portable defibrillator inventor Frank PantridgeMichael Conlan’s  Olympic loss may have been due to ‘bout manipulation’, report findsLonger passenger train begins service on NI railway networkLatestGerard ‘The Monk’ Hutch appears in court charged in relation to the gangland murder of David Byrne at the Regency HotelWe should have been sharper – Thomas Tuchel demands cutting edge from ChaPresenting line-up revealed for GamesMaster revivalBenfica cruise past Barcelona to pile pressure on Ronald KoemanCha lose again after Federico Chiesa hits winner for Juventus,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendNewsEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

In April, we didn’t have the Delta iant, now Delta is our major iant and more transmissible than the Kent iant which was dominant at that point.“In regards to where a vaccine certicate could be used, there will be dferent benefits in dferent situations at dferent points in time.“But before the Executive can make that decision collectively, we need to have one.”Mr Swann, who was attending the launch of the new Laboratory Information Management Systemat the Ulster Hospital, stressed it was for the wider administration at Stormont to decide what sectors should use vaccine certication as an entry requirement.But he said that could only happen once a system was developed.He has criticised the Executive for failing to progress that development.On Wednesday, Mr Swann said would take between six to eight weeks to get a scheme ready to use, once it was approved.“Before we can discuss where we use it in Northern Ireland, we need to have one, and that has been part of my frustration in the debate that has happened recently over the past number of weeks that we haven’t got actually the decision where we’re able, as a health department, actually to take that step forward, spend the money and actually produce one,” he said.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland a .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_dea-ec-b-bee-dfb_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news

Stormont ministers agreed a plan to drop the one-metre social distancing requirement across a range of venues, but decided that mitigation measures requiring proof of vaccine for entry to indoor seated venues would be advisory only.At the meeting, SDLP minister Nichola Mallon proposed Covid vaccine passports for those venues should be compulsory and introduced by way of legal regulation.While the proposal was backed by Alliance minister Naomi Long, it was voted down by the other Executive ministers, including Mr Swann.Those ministers instead voted to issue guidance to the venues, which include theatres and indoor concert venues, recommending the use of proof of vaccine as one entry requirement.SDLP leader Colum Eastwood branded the decision as “astounding and reckless”.Mr Swann said he did not back the proposal to make passports mandatory for indoor seated venues because such a scheme was “neither agreed nor ready”.He said the Executive would have been “ridiculed”it had told businesses fearful about the end of the furlough scheme that ministers had decided to mandate a vaccine passport system that was not ready to use.The issue is set to come to a head again next week when ministers consider whether to remove the one-metre social distancing requirement for hospitality venues.The DUP has consistently voiced concern about any move to introduce vaccine passports, citing potential human rights and equality issues.Two further deaths of patients who had tested positive for Covid- were reported in Northern Ireland on Wednesday along with , new confirmed cases.On

With the furlough scheme set to end this week and a number of Covid- restrictions remaining in place, he argues until businesses can operate without restrictions the scheme should be retained. At the beginning of the pandemic in March , immediate thoughts turned to how businesses could stay afloat and how jobs and incomes could be protected. googletag.cmd.push The UK Government, to its credit, moved rapidly and put in place the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, better since known as the furlough scheme. As of this month, over . million workers across the UK have been furloughed at one time or the other, with the government supporting up to % of their wages in order to protect jobs and avoid widespread destitution. Sixty-six billion pounds has been spent by the Exchequer on the furlough scheme, a testament to the government’s commitment to protecting livelihoods and protecting businesses. However, the decision to wind down the scheme this month and remove the furlough safety net appears premature and may leave businesses and employees in the lurch. With coronavirus restrictions still in place in Northern Ireland, and no date set in stone yet for the removal of all remaining restrictions, businesses here are not operating with full freedom and full flexibility. If pandemic restrictions persist, then pandemic protections should also. Executive Ministers, including the First and Deputy First Ministers, have recently made confusing and contradictory comments about the future of the pandemic and restrictions in Northern Ireland. While the Economy Minister has shown an urgency and willingness to set a date for the lting of all remaining restrictions, the First Minister recently dampened these expectations while the Deputy First Minister refused to rule out future lockdowns or so-called ‘circuit breakers.’     The continued confusion and uncertainty over restrictions is bad for business, bad for employers, bad for workers, and bad for the wider economy. The last thing the business community needs after  long months is the threat and anxiety of another deeply damaging lockdown. Until we get to a stage where we can fully operate and live without restrictions, however, pandemic protections like the furlough scheme must remain in place.

In circumstances like this, cash is king, but when you continue to stockpile cash long after you’ve reached your emergency fund number, that’s when it begins to hurt you financially.Excess savings sitting in accounts earning negative s mean the purchasing power of those savings are going down in value, and whilst that may not hurt your finances much in the short term, it’s the opportunity lost in not investing in accounts that are producing much better s that will.The opportunity cost for one client of mine who had €, sitting in a deposit account, that had no reason to be there, was €, over just one year.         I had a zoom call with her back in February and she told me she had savings of c. €, sitting in a deposit account earning .%. But when you factor in DIRT tax and inflation, her actualwas -.%.Anyway, she knew she was cash heavy, but was unsure how much of the €, she should ide up and what number should be assigned to her emergency fund and what could be set aside for investment and so on.So, what I suggested to her was very similar to what is primarily used when it comes to pension planning in retirement, and it’s known as The Bucket Strategy. I thought the concept is such a great one, it should be adapted and used when it comes to iding up the amounts people have accumulated in cash.The solution is iding up the amount you have in savings into three dferent accounts, and the amount you deposit into each account is based on:*When you need the money*How long you want it to last for, and*How much you need or can set asideWhen we applied this logic, the strategy for her looked something like this:Bucket Number  – Emergency FundAccount Type: CashRisk: ZeroPurpose: Covers emergency expenses for  monthsOptimum Balance in Account: €,We looked at what deficit would existthere was a loss of income, and we focused on the cost of funding those priority expenses that must be covered and paid. And we discovered that monthly cost was €,.We were happy that having  months of those expenses in an account dedicated for this eventuality was enough.So, she set up a separate account, called it her emergency fund and transferred €, into it. Next up was,Bucket Number  – Short Medium Term ExpensesAccount Type: Cash Fixed TermRisk: ZeroPurpose: Known, once off expenses, incurred in the next   monthsOptimum Balance in Account: €,This is an account you set funds aside for large once off expenses you know you’re going to incur in the next  months.The women I met was planning on changing her car next year and whilst she didn’t know exactly what car she was going to buy, €, was a good number to ring fence from her savings.But rather than leaving this amount sitting in a deposit account, she moved it to a fixed notice account for  months, earning .%. It’s still a terriblebut at least it was  times better than leaving it where it was.Bucket Number  – InvestmentAccount Type: EquityRisk: MediumPurpose: Make money beat inflationOptimum Balance in Account: €,Now more than ever, you need to be invested in equity-based accounts, you just have to.We set up this type of account up for the woman I met back in February where she deposited €, into it. And theon the account since then, has been +.%. The same account had s of +.% over  year and +.% over  years.Contrast them to the .% she was making by holding excess savings in cash.It meant her €, was going down in value by € every year.But had she set aside €, a year ago in an equity account, it would have gone up by €,.And eventhe equity s dropped in value by c. % from what they made last year, they’d still be % more than what she’d getshe left her money languishing in a deposit account.Whatever way you want to present it, the dference is staggering, and the reason I said from the outset, why holding too much cash is bad for your finances.One of the long-term financial effects, Covid could leave on people, is a fear that something like this could happen again, so people begin to hoard money and whilst there isn’t anything wrong with that, it’s where they leave this money accrue that’s the problem. And that’s in cash accounts that are earning nothing.Let me repeat again, those accounts are fine for your emergency fund, but once you’ve past that amount, you really need to consider other accounts that will yield higher s.And perhaps not everyone will have enough in savings to fill three buckets.They may not have enough to fill even one, and that’s okay as well becauseyou follow this very simple strategy, it will prevent you from using money that’s being invested but should really be assigned to your emergency fund or leaving money in an emergency fund that should be set aside for investment.So, you really need to know your numbers and the dficulty I find with people, is that they have one, maybe two accounts and the amount they’ve accumulated is used for everything i.e. emergency fund, investment and once off expenses.And this is one of the reasons people are not optimising their finances. They may have spare cash that could be used towards investment, but it’s getting lumped in with emergency funds and once off expenses and it stays there and earns nothing.Having a dedicated amount for specic purposes makes things much easier because you know, you have the optimum amount in place for each purpose and you know you’re not affecting other areas, either.And using the Bucket Strategy will help. It’s not time consuming to set up, but I assure you, it will be time well spent.Liam Croke is MD of Harmonics Financial Ltd, based in Plassey.

Mrs McLaughlin was speaking in a debate the impact of the proposed Universal Credit cut in Foyle in the Assembly at Stormont. She highlighted the West-East discrepancy in terms of where the highest and lowest levels of employment are with the west of Northern Ireland coming a poor second to the east. googletag.cmd.push One aspect she focused on was the amount of investment that has come to Belfast in comparison to Derry. The SDLP spokesperson for the Economy and Energy pointed out that while , jobs have been announced this year by the economy minister for location in Belfast, that none have been announced for Derry. She said: “I have in front of me a map. It is coloured in shades. The darkest colours show the highest rates of Universal Credit receipt.  “Three constituencies are in the darkest colours. Those are Foyle, North Belfast and West Belfast. There is one really, really light-coloured area which represents Lagan Valley. “Much of the East is actually pretty light, which shows where the highest paid jobs and the highest employment rates are located. “When the UK’s prime minister justies cutting Universal Credit, he says that he wants people to earn more through their work, rather than through their benefit payments. “Well, where in Derry are those jobs  Perhaps the communities and economy ministers can suggest how those who are unemployed in Derry can get jobs  And how those in badly paid jobs can get work that pays more      “I hear, yet again, this week of new jobs going to Belfast. ASOS is bringing  jobs to Belfast. “Two weeks ago, the economy minister announced Agio are to create  jobs in Belfast. “Last month he announced  jobs at Tribe, on the edge of Belfast. In June, it was  jobs with PwC, in Belfast. “Also in June, it was  jobs in Belfast with Vision . In February, it was  jobs in Belfast with KPMG. “In January, it was  jobs with Everquote, headquartered where  Belfast of course. “Not that all the jobs have gone to Belfast. Some  have gone to Bangor. “But where and when are the jobs coming to Derry  “In April, the then-economy minister said the recovery in the North West is important. “In February that same former economy minister expressed concern about Derry – not about the lack of jobs being created in my city, but about additional students coming to Magee to study health and le science, and what that might mean for Coleraine. “However, congratulations to Belfast, with its large university campuses, graduates, commuters and much higher pay than in the West.” Speaking on the session in the Assembly yesterday on the impact of the proposed Universal Credit cut in Foyle, People Before Profit MLA Gerry Carroll highlighted the neglect and poverty that Derry has suffered – which he warned would get worse with the pound cut in Universal Credit. He said: “Like my own constituency of West Belfast, far too many peoplestruggle with poverty, the lack of housing, low wages and the effects of decades of neglect. “The failure to increase Magee to a , student population by now is one of the many injustices the Stormont Executive has failed to recty. So is the abysmal failure to improve and vastly expand rail provision for Foyle and across the entire North West. “As my colleague Eamonn McCann has said many times, the old Stormont regime failed the people of Derry and Foyle but so too has the new Stormont regime. “Twenty-seven per cent of people in Derry and Strabane live below the poverty line. Foyle, just like West Belfast, has been ravaged by the welfare reforms brought in by the Executive. “The Executives determination to run public services into the ground in favour of privatisation that allows a tiny few to profiteer is also having a dramatic impact on peoples wellbeing. “Theres no doubt that people across the North, including in Foyle, will be hit very hard by the proposed cut to Universal Credit. “Given Derry and Foyles existing levels of deprivation, the cut to Universal Credit, out of control energy prices, pay cuts for health workers and new taxes will hit the area very hard. “The Stormont Executive is talking about finally putting in place an anti-poverty strategy. But it will mean very littlewe cant protect people right now. “Its shocking to me that the Executive has done nothing to demand a Wealth Tax on billionaires, rich corporations and elites. Its clear they dont want to upset elites. “Theres a lot of feigned concern for those trapped in poverty and dependent on food banks in the Assembly from Executive parties. “But all five of those parties campaigned for a massive cut in taxes for rich, very rich, corporations while they agreed to bring in Tory welfare reforms. That action tells us more about the priorities of government parties than all their words of concern. “If the Tories follow through on plans to slash Universal Credit, People Before Profit is calling for the Executive to step-in with funding to make sure no one loses out. “We need less talk about anti-poverty strategies. We need action not promises from the Executive. “The Executive threw people in Foyle, and across the North, to the wolves by signing up to Tory welfare reforms. The Executive shouldnt do it again. Lets commit now to making sure no one is punished by the cruel Tory cut to Universal Credit.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Local NewsWhale carcass on County Derry beach is posing a health risk overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsJudge orders top Derry cop to court overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Road works have been causing dficulties in Dungiven.Local NewsCalls for County Derry roadworks to be suspended overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsHospital fundraiser launched after death of popular County Derry businessman overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSerious sexual assault on woman in County Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out  About at foam party in Dormans Bar, Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out  About at foam party in Dormans Bar, Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Constable Michael Ferguson, , was shot dead in Derry in January, .DerryNowMan arrested in Derry for  murder of policeman Michael Ferguson overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMuch-needed resurfacing completed on County Derry road overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia WATCH: Blah, blah, blah - Greta Thunberg blasts world leaders for climate inactionNational NewsWATCH: Blah, blah, blah - Greta Thunberg blasts world leaders for climate inaction overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out  About at foam party in Dormans Bar, Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out  About at foam party in Dormans Bar, Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm. When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny.     The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Local NewsWhale carcass on County Derry beach is posing a health risk overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsJudge orders top Derry cop to court overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Road works have been causing dficulties in Dungiven.Local NewsCalls for County Derry roadworks to be suspended overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsHospital fundraiser launched after death of popular County Derry businessman overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSerious sexual assault on woman in County Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out  About at foam party in Dormans Bar, Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out  About at foam party in Dormans Bar, Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Constable Michael Ferguson, , was shot dead in Derry in January, .DerryNowMan arrested in Derry for  murder of policeman Michael Ferguson overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMuch-needed resurfacing completed on County Derry road overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia WATCH: Blah, blah, blah - Greta Thunberg blasts world leaders for climate inactionNational NewsWATCH: Blah, blah, blah - Greta Thunberg blasts world leaders for climate inaction overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out  About at foam party in Dormans Bar, Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out  About at foam party in Dormans Bar, Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Reporter: Liam Tunney Sept Email: liam@derrypost  addthis, A County Derry coffee shop has begun hosting weekly parent and toddler sessions as it looks to provide a safe place for them to socialise. Liam Tunney caught up with owner FiFi Garrett to find out why.The sound of excited children floats down the steps of Cumber House and echoes off the high wall of trees that flank either side of the laneway leading up the hill. Cars are parked around the gravel that surrounds the house, most pointed towards the trees and away from the village of Claudy that lies further up the hill to its rear. googletag.cmd.push At the top of the ornate steps sits a small sign that gives some clue to the source of the excited voices and laughter. The popular coffee shop is based in the historic Cumber House, Claudy. FiFi Garrett opened Slothy Coffee in July . It marked the next step in a personal journey that was given a signicant nudge by the Covid- pandemic. “I was on universal credit pretty much since the pandemic started, and it was really hard,” she told the County Derry Post. “I was an unemployed artist I do a lot of digital art, but obviously, that doesnt pay the bills. My partner was working from home at the time, and we both just said we couldnt go on like this. “We knew we needed to do something, and wed noticed a lot of these small coffee shops popping up, so that was our original business model. “We approached the council, but getting licences was really hard, so they suggested we went for private land.” As luck would have it, a postcard-perfect stretch of private land lay just a stones throw away at Cumber House.     Picturesque surroundings at Cumber House. Owned by local GAA club John Mitchels GAC, the building already had a commercial kitchen in place, which meant FiFi and her husbands plans would have to change a little. “We suddenly had to change our model from very small to something a lot bigger, but its been really exciting,” she said. “We put together our business plan and opened in July. We had to get a personal loan, because we didnt qualy for any funding. “It has been a case of one hand in, one out, for buying more furniture. We got a really good deal to get the machine that we rent. “We knew we had the customer base, but the problem here is that you dont get the passing trade, so thats what started us off with running events. “We have to find inventive ways of getting people in, so thats where Tots n Toast came in.” Tara Craig and Roisin McCloskey enjoying the morning with sons Dylan and Adam. Now in its second week, the Tots n Toast initiative has drawn in a healthy crowd of local parents and toddlers, and is proving a big hit. FiFi says she had hoped to bring some of the calming atmosphere of the houses surroundings into the event. “I have a five-year-old daughter who has special needs, and I found a lot of groups that were popping up around Derry were very loud and very noisy. “Theyre great, but theyre not necessarily for every child. She hated noise, shed just sit there covering her ears. “I wanted to do something a bit more serene, because you have the relaxing surroundings of the forest here. “I wanted to do books that would inspire them to explore, so we did The Gruffalo last week. You can imagine them all going round afterwards looking for it.” Ann and Michael Feeney, Claire and Islay Donaghy and Catherine Mullan with sons Aodhaacuten and Oisiacuten enjoyig their morning out at Slothy Coffee in Claudy. With the local area not qualying for the SureStart programme, there have been limited opportunities for parents and toddlers in Claudy. Two local parents, Roisin McCloskey and Tara Craig, tell me the weekly event is providing them with a safe space to socialise. “This is my first time here. Since Covid, all the wee toddler groups have stopped and its hard to get spaces.” said Roisin. “Its lovely and its great for the children. It helps, because there has been nothing for the weans this last while, nowhere to bring them.” “Its a space where they can be themselves and you can actually enjoy your coffee, because everyone is doing the same thing,” said Tara. “People are still quite cautious about getting out and about, but its nice to be able to do that. Every week Ive come in, Ive met someone new.” As well as the safety and openness of the space, other parents mentioned the beauty of the houses grounds and the peaceful atmosphere. “Its a lovely, relaxing, pleasant wee morning, and its great for the weans to get out as well,” said Claire Donaghy. “There are no real places like this in the village. Round here is nice, with the setting and the walk way, and the children love it.” Catherine Mullan said her sons Oisiacuten and Aodhaacuten loved getting to see the other children. “Its a great place Im surprised there has been nothing in here before,” she said. “Its nice that the weans can go and play with other children and you get to meet other parents as well. “Plus, the coffee is great,” she added.  FiFi says meeting the parents has emphasised for her just how important socialising is on the back of the last  months of Covid-related restrictions. “Depression and anxiety is a real problem at the moment,” she said. “There are many parents whose partners may be going back to work again, and suddenly, theyre isolated on their own. “Its good to get people out and talking to other parents who are in the same boat that they mightnt have met yet. “Its been really popular.

Reporter: Liam Tunney Sept Email: liam@derrypost  addthis, A County Derry coffee shop has begun hosting weekly parent and toddler sessions as it looks to provide a safe place for them to socialise. Liam Tunney caught up with owner FiFi Garrett to find out why.The sound of excited children floats down the steps of Cumber House and echoes off the high wall of trees that flank either side of the laneway leading up the hill. Cars are parked around the gravel that surrounds the house, most pointed towards the trees and away from the village of Claudy that lies further up the hill to its rear. googletag.cmd.push At the top of the ornate steps sits a small sign that gives some clue to the source of the excited voices and laughter. The popular coffee shop is based in the historic Cumber House, Claudy. FiFi Garrett opened Slothy Coffee in July . It marked the next step in a personal journey that was given a signicant nudge by the Covid- pandemic. “I was on universal credit pretty much since the pandemic started, and it was really hard,” she told the County Derry Post. “I was an unemployed artist I do a lot of digital art, but obviously, that doesnt pay the bills. My partner was working from home at the time, and we both just said we couldnt go on like this. “We knew we needed to do something, and wed noticed a lot of these small coffee shops popping up, so that was our original business model. “We approached the council, but getting licences was really hard, so they suggested we went for private land.” As luck would have it, a postcard-perfect stretch of private land lay just a stones throw away at Cumber House.     Picturesque surroundings at Cumber House. Owned by local GAA club John Mitchels GAC, the building already had a commercial kitchen in place, which meant FiFi and her husbands plans would have to change a little. “We suddenly had to change our model from very small to something a lot bigger, but its been really exciting,” she said. “We put together our business plan and opened in July. We had to get a personal loan, because we didnt qualy for any funding. “It has been a case of one hand in, one out, for buying more furniture. We got a really good deal to get the machine that we rent. “We knew we had the customer base, but the problem here is that you dont get the passing trade, so thats what started us off with running events. “We have to find inventive ways of getting people in, so thats where Tots n Toast came in.” Tara Craig and Roisin McCloskey enjoying the morning with sons Dylan and Adam. Now in its second week, the Tots n Toast initiative has drawn in a healthy crowd of local parents and toddlers, and is proving a big hit. FiFi says she had hoped to bring some of the calming atmosphere of the houses surroundings into the event. “I have a five-year-old daughter who has special needs, and I found a lot of groups that were popping up around Derry were very loud and very noisy. “Theyre great, but theyre not necessarily for every child. She hated noise, shed just sit there covering her ears. “I wanted to do something a bit more serene, because you have the relaxing surroundings of the forest here. “I wanted to do books that would inspire them to explore, so we did The Gruffalo last week. You can imagine them all going round afterwards looking for it.” Ann and Michael Feeney, Claire and Islay Donaghy and Catherine Mullan with sons Aodhaacuten and Oisiacuten enjoyig their morning out at Slothy Coffee in Claudy. With the local area not qualying for the SureStart programme, there have been limited opportunities for parents and toddlers in Claudy. Two local parents, Roisin McCloskey and Tara Craig, tell me the weekly event is providing them with a safe space to socialise. “This is my first time here. Since Covid, all the wee toddler groups have stopped and its hard to get spaces.” said Roisin. “Its lovely and its great for the children. It helps, because there has been nothing for the weans this last while, nowhere to bring them.” “Its a space where they can be themselves and you can actually enjoy your coffee, because everyone is doing the same thing,” said Tara. “People are still quite cautious about getting out and about, but its nice to be able to do that. Every week Ive come in, Ive met someone new.” As well as the safety and openness of the space, other parents mentioned the beauty of the houses grounds and the peaceful atmosphere. “Its a lovely, relaxing, pleasant wee morning, and its great for the weans to get out as well,” said Claire Donaghy. “There are no real places like this in the village. Round here is nice, with the setting and the walk way, and the children love it.” Catherine Mullan said her sons Oisiacuten and Aodhaacuten loved getting to see the other children. “Its a great place Im surprised there has been nothing in here before,” she said. “Its nice that the weans can go and play with other children and you get to meet other parents as well. “Plus, the coffee is great,” she added.  FiFi says meeting the parents has emphasised for her just how important socialising is on the back of the last  months of Covid-related restrictions. “Depression and anxiety is a real problem at the moment,” she said. “There are many parents whose partners may be going back to work again, and suddenly, theyre isolated on their own. “Its good to get people out and talking to other parents who are in the same boat that they mightnt have met yet. “Its been really popular.

The financial support is helping firms across the nation to adapt, innovate and protect jobs. Here are two examples of how companies have been helped, and what support is available. googletag.cmd.push NORTHERN IRELAND IN NUMBERS , jobs furloughed through the Coronavirus Jobs Retention Scheme up to May  , claims amounting to pound million through the Self- Employment Income Support Scheme up to May  Across the whole UK  per cent of those eligible for SEISS made a claim. The average value of a claim is pound, Source: Her Majesty’s Treasury CASE STUDY  SHNUGGLE  Planning, forward-thinking and invaluable help from the UK Government has enabled a Northern Ireland firm to ersy and remain solvent. When Covid- struck, Newtownards baby product manufacturer Shnuggle’s owners Sinead and Adam Murphy were prepared thanks to advice from their export colleagues in China. Sinead said: “We reduced our out-goings, put on pause our marketing spend in the business. We just tried to protect the cash that we had. “The first impact was our customers that we sell to in Asia. They all went into lockdown so our orders and sales to them stopped. But also a lot of our production happens out in Asia so our factories went into lockdown. “Luckily we had bought a lot of stock beforehand. We were so relieved that we had, at least we could carry on trading with our UK and European customers.” With around half of the company’s sales in the UK and Ireland and half in the export business, Shnuggle had to rely on their local retail-base. Sinead continued: “Baby items were classed as essential goods which was a huge relief to us. This meant as long as we could socially distance within the warehouse we could continue trading and selling online. All of our business is supplying other retailers like John Lewis, Mamas and Papas, Amazon. But our online sales actually grew because everyone was at home and maybe an element of panic buying.”      CASH HELP: The Shnuggle team Shnuggle took advantage of the furlough and Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Schemeschemes. Sinead said: “We furloughed five out of our  team, and were able to access the Business Interruption loan through Ulster Bank. “We were relieved to get the money in quickly, so we weren’t worrying about paying wages or our biggest overhead was our suppliers in China who were calling in all of their debts. “That was our biggest headache and stress, we owed signicant amounts of money to them and we didn’t have the cash as we needed time to sell our products.” Shnuggle also received a pound, Small Business Grant. Adam said: “Furloughing was brilliant, and the CBILS was the one that was the best for us because it meant that we could keep all our suppliers happy. “So even though we had a temporary dip in our sales, and obviously the inventory was sitting there ready to sell, it just kept us solvent and the cash flow moving. It’s really going to help us trade out of it, andall goes well, we should be able to get back into a reasonably strong cash position within the next six to  months. The loans coming in helped us to sleep at night.” The Government schemes also gave Sinead and Adam the freedom to ersy into the PPE market and the development of HeroShield Ltd, enabling local firms to unite to develop a protective face covering for key workers. This non-profit company designs, produces and distributes reusable visors.   ‘It’s surprisingly easy and money arrives quickly’ CASE STUDY  Q-MASS An unprecedented package of UK Government financial support has helped firms like Q-Mass in East Kilbride weather the coronavirus crisis. Director Ronnie Robertson said lockdown hit his company’s order book, but the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has been vital to help them hang on to their valued staff. Ronnie said: “Before this, we had quite a good order book, with three to four months of work planned, so we were pretty worried where it was going to take us.” At first, he was worried how he would keep Q-Mass’  staff on the payroll, but then the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme was announced. It offers UK Government support to pay  per cent of staff’s wages up to pound, a month, and the scheme has now been extended until the end of October. Q-Mass manufactures bespoke parts for the oil, gas and defence industry so staff training is important. Ronnie said: “Our staff are very highly skilled. We’ve gathered a bunch of people here and trained them up and taken on apprentices. We do a lot of training, we’ve got good people, we train them a lot and we want to hang on to them.” He found applying for the furlough scheme quick and straightforward. He said: “It was surprisingly easy and we were surprised that the money came through relatively quickly.” Now staff at the firm who’ve been furloughed are gradually ing to work, with strict safety measures in place. Ronnie said: “We’ve put a day sht back on and we’ve still got a few office people working at home, with quite a few still on furlough.  ‘SURPRISINGLY EASY’: Q-Mass director Ronnie Robertson praises the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme “We’re just ticking over. We’re trying to cover our costs every month, trying to break even, to stay still. We’re looking at it thatwe can stay still we’re doing very well.” And because of the size of the building, maintaining a two-metre distance hasn’t been a problem for ing staff. Ronnie said: “It’s been really easy. We’ve got a big workshop with wide corridors and we’ve got a lot of the doors propped open internally so no-one has to touch doors or handles. We’ve got a few toilet areas with restrictions on them and a couple of one-way corridors, but the offices are open plan, so there’s no real need for people to be near each other. The workshop’s a big, wide-open space and we have to keep cleaning things like photocopiers and touch screens, but it’s been quite straightforward.” Now Ronnie’s looking forward to a brighter future. He said: “I feel like we’re on the side of the valley and we’re looking across to the other side and it looks absolutely fantastic.” Money for business and staff Here are some examples of the support available for businesses and workers. middot The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has enabled businesses to put employees on a period of temporary leaveand apply for a UK Government grant to cover  per cent of those workers’ usual monthly wage costs, up to pound, a month. middot The Self-Employment Income Support Scheme will allow eligible self-employed iniduals to claim a taxable grant of  per cent of their average monthly profits, up to pound,. middot UK VAT-registered firms have been given the option to defer VAT payments until the end of June.

ONEILLS DERRY SFC ROUND  Slaughtneil -Swatragh - The -point winning margin saw Paul Bradleys side finish in second spot behind Lavey, with the Davitts dropping to third on score dference.With ongoing maintenance on their main pitch at Davitt Park, Swatragh have been playing on their training pitch and while it was in pristine condition, its tight confines made it dficult to find space.Swatragh were more aggressive on their press and limited Antoacutein McMullan to just one short kick-out and a  percent first-half retention rate. A possession won by Fionnbharr McGuigan was the only break won with the rest coming from frees awarded for pushes in a congested middle third.At the other end, Sean McNicholl had marginally more freedom and kicked excellently throughout, losing just two kick-outs over the hour.Kevin Madden handed Michael Friel a first start of the championship and stationed him at corner forward, where he was picked up by Brendan Rogers. Karl McKaigue went across to Francis Kearney, with Peadar Kearney on Fintan McGurk.Oisin McWilliams wore number , but started at midfield where Chrissy McKaigue lined up against him. In the reshuffle, Cahal Murray started at centre forward where he pulled to the wings and the centre of Slaughtneils defence was manned by the rotation of Patsy Bradley and Padraig Cassidy.It left Slaughtneil needing a high concentration level to balance a compact centre with Cassidy getting forward to punch holes in Swatraghs defence. Brendan Rogers also had a major impact on the game and got forward at every opportunity.At the other end, Sean Francis Quinn picked up Christopher Bradley, who played slightly ahead of Shane McGuigan and Brian Cassidy. Sean Tad Cassidy and Seaacuten Oacute Caiside were alternating on Slaughtneils right wing against James Kearney and Niall Coyle. Oacute Caiside was later forced off with a suspected torn cruciate ligament injury.On the other wing, Keelan Feeney got on enough ball to keep Sean Martin Quinn out of the game. His case wasnt helped by not having a gumshield and Barry Cassidy let him re-enter the fray with one in situ.Feeney and McGrath combined on the left wing for Shane McGuigan to get a run on Diarmuid Dillon and fist over the first score of the game and the Emmets doubled their lead with a confident Sammy Bradley point at the end of a Rogers foray upfield.Midway through the first-half, a McMullan kick-out was punched back into the Slaughtneil defence where Chrissy McKaigue saw black for taking down the galloping Oisin McWilliams.Three minutes later a Diarmuid Dillon body check on Brian Cassidy also saw him in the sin-bin and it opened the game up.A close-range Meehaul McGrath goal after the water break put Slaughtneil - to - ahead. After Rogers and Padraig Cassidy ran at the Swatragh defence, McGrath was calm enough to sidestep in a crowded penalty area before slotting to the net.Slaughtneils game of closing down the midfield involved players dropping off to the closest man, but when Sean Cassidy lost his footing Sean Francis Quinn came forward to kick a point with the outside of his right boot.Peadar Kearney, who escaped an earlier yellow card, was walking a fine line after another foul on Fintan McGurk who was Swatraghs most potent forward. James Kearney missed the free, but when Conor McAtamney won the next kick-out, McGurk went through to make it a three-point game, - to -.The Swa then had a goal chance, started by Francis Kearney and involving McGurk, that saw Kearneys low shot blocked by the feet of Rogers. Oisin McWilliams and Francis Kearneyalso missed chances to eat into the lead before half-time.Friel started the second-half at centre-forward and after an early Christopher Bradley wide, Francis Kearney hit Swatraghs only point of the second-half from a free.Seven minutes into the half, a well-worked move involving Rogers, McGrath and Sammy Bradley saw Shane McGuigan in on goal, where he was fouled and referee Cassidy awarded a penalty. Sean McNicholl saved McGuigans first attempt, but only into the Slaughtneil man path and he finished the rebound to the net.McNicholl worked the kick-out short and an Oisin McWilliams run up the right flank pulled Slaughtneil out of position and when the ball was squared, Cahal Murray palmed to the net at the far post, making the score - to - in the visitors favour after  minutes.Swatragh had a spell with the McWilliams twins inside, but Murrays goal was their last score of the game. With limited space, the diagonal ball wasnt an option and anytime it was played in straight, Rogers was able to come from behind to turnover the ball.McMullan was able to poke some of his kick-outs to Feeney and slowly but surely Slaughtneil got a firm grip on the game. Rogers got forward to kick a point, followed by a Christopher Bradley point after Seacute and Shane McGuigan linked up on the left wing.When Francis Kearney kicked the ball over the sideline, and with Swatraghs defence open, Cormac ODohertys cross field ball found the run of Shane McGuigan who thumped the ball high, confidently and straight between the posts for a - to - lead to rubber-stamp Slaughtneils rampant third quarter.With the eight point winning margin in sight and with the game firmly in their clutches, Slaughtneil hit five unanswered points in the final  minutes on their way to a commanding win. googletag.cmd.push SLAUGHTNEIL: Antoacutein McMullan Peadar Kearney, Karl McKaigue, Brendan RogersSeaacuten Oacute Caiside, Padraig Cassidy, Keelan Feeney Patsy Bradley, Chrissy McKaigue Sean Cassidy, Cormac ODoherty, Meehaul McGrathChristopher BradleyShane McGuigan , Brian CassidySUBS: Fionnbharr McGuigan for S Oacute Caiside , Seacute McGuiganfor B Cassidy , Francis McEldowney for P Kearney , Ronan Bradley for M McGrath BLACK CARD: C McKaigue YELLOW CARD: P Bradley  SWATRAGH: Sean McNicholl Aaron McGuckin, Diarmuid Dillon Sean Francis QuinnBrian Diamond, Tiarnaacuten Walsh, Niall Coyle Conor McAtamney, Oisin McWilliams Sean Martin Quinn, Cahal Murray , James KearneyMichael Friel, Francis Kearney , Fintan McGurk SUBS: Lorcan McWilliams for J Kearney , Patrick Turner for B Diamond , Liam Kearney for N Coyle , Niall McAtamney for C Murray BLACK CARD: D Dillon YELLOW CARDS: M Friel , O McWilliams  REF: Barry Cassidy     ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Local NewsWhale carcass on County Derry beach is posing a health risk overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsJudge orders top Derry cop to court overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Cllr Heaney, who represents the Foyleside ward, hailed the decision as “an important move” in helping motorists to transition from traditional fossil fuels – such as petrol and diesel – towards electric power. googletag.cmd.push The Parking Strategy for Derry City and Strabane District identied the need to review the current electric charging infrastructure and quanty the council’s future needs as one of its proposed strategic options. It is hoped that by changing the electric vehicle charging infrastructure in its off-street car-parks, the council is removing any potential barrier to visit and stay in the city Cllr Heaney said: “At the council meeting, we agreed to explore further the possibility of getting new and improved electric charging points for electric motor vehicles into all council car-parks throughout our city and district. “It is an important move as the council plays its part in tackling the climate crisis as we encourage and incentivise as many motorists as possible to move away from fossil-fuelled cars and into electric cars. We want to see this progressing soon. “I was delighted to support this proposal at the council’s Business and Culture committee. Recent figures have revealed that only . per cent of electric vehicles in the north are owned by residents of our council area. “The lack of modern and efficient electric vehicle charging points within our council boundaries is clearly a factor influencing this low figure.     “Council officers have now been tasked with scoping out how charging points can be installed in all council car parks which will massively increase the charging infrastructure, encourage the purchase of more electric vehicles and further decrease the carbon footprint within our city and district.” ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Local NewsWhale carcass on County Derry beach is posing a health risk overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsJudge orders top Derry cop to court overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Road works have been causing dficulties in Dungiven.Local NewsCalls for County Derry roadworks to be suspended overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsHospital fundraiser launched after death of popular County Derry businessman overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSerious sexual assault on woman in County Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out  About at foam party in Dormans Bar, Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out  About at foam party in Dormans Bar, Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Constable Michael Ferguson, , was shot dead in Derry in January, .DerryNowMan arrested in Derry for  murder of policeman Michael Ferguson overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMuch-needed resurfacing completed on County Derry road overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia WATCH: Blah, blah, blah - Greta Thunberg blasts world leaders for climate inactionNational NewsWATCH: Blah, blah, blah - Greta Thunberg blasts world leaders for climate inaction overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out  About at foam party in Dormans Bar, Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out  About at foam party in Dormans Bar, Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Councillor McGlinchey made the comments last night , three days after a continuous lane closure was put in place at Chapel Road, Dungiven. Temporary traffic lights have been operating since Friday, September  and are expected to be in place until Friday, October  to facilitate work as part of the bypass of Dungiven town. googletag.cmd.push As a result of the lane closure, there has been y tailbacks in both directions, something which Councillor McGlinchey says must end. Fridays Derry intermediate football championship clash between Steelstown and Ballymaguigan was scheduled for pm at Derry GAAs Centre of Excellence in Dungiven, but county officials were forced to delay the throw-in by  minutes as Ballymaguigan supporters, players and match officials were caught up in the tailback. Lavey supporters attending their clubs senior championship clash  with Claudy, also on Friday night, missed part of the first half, with the roadworks also causing their delay in getting to Banagher. “The long delays are totally unacceptable and just not good enough,” said Councillor McGlinchey. “People living in Magherabuoy, Traceys Way, Abbey Fields and Glenroe Park cannot get in and out of their homes because of the traffic and drivers blocking the entrances to the estates. “Our party met with the Department for Infrastructure six months ago and asked them to come back and complete the roundabout at a later date. The contractor, Wills Bros, have been very accomodating but it is the Department for Infrastructure and the client Aecom that need to make the decision.” Councillor McGlinchey said the long delays are also having a major impact on local businesses in Dungiven.     “People are avoiding stopping at local shops because of the long delays in traffic and these businesses are missing out even though there is a simple solution,” he said, adding that his party colleague, MLA Caoimhe Archibald has called for an urgent meeting with DfI and Aecom to discuss the issues. “We are asking the Department and client Aecom to intervene as this cannot continue. A common sense approach is needed here and I will be calling on these roadworks to be suspended until such times as a solution is found.” Last night, a DfI spokesperson said: “The Department can confirm that Caoimhe Archibald MLA has todayrequested a meeting to discuss the roadworks at Dungiven. “The Department has been engaging with local representatives and has received positive feedback on this engagement. The Department is happy to arrange another meeting with Dr Archibald.” Aecom was contacted for a response, however at the time of going to print, they had failed to respond to the County Derry Posts request.

This C Class Road carries abnormal amounts of traffic linking the Mayogall and Ballymacombs Rds. “I have recently conducted a community survey along this stretch of road and this was the number one issue identied. Hopefully the remaining stretches of the road will merit consideration in the future. “The erection of new poles along this road has also caused concern as to visibility especially at the Ballymacombs Rd junction. “I have been in contact with the service providers and a solution is currently being worked on.”“I commend the patience of these rural dwellers and I will continue to push for repairs to other roads across the council area.” Sinn Feacutein councillor Sean McPeake praised the work of the Roads Service in getting the work done. “I wish to commend DFI Roads Service and in particular Mr Conal Mc Kee for agreeing to my earlier request to carry out these much needed works along this stretch of roadway,” he said. “These repairs will assist those travelling daily along this stretch of roadway and will minimise potential ponding of road surface waters.     “I thank local DFI officials for their continued cooperation on these road improvement requests.” Both councillors indicated further work was planned on the Innishrush Road in Clady and the Drumard Road, Kilrea.

The Action Plan was funded through the European Union’s PEACE IV Programme, which is managed by the Special EU Programmes Body, and the programmes delivered focused around Children and Young People, Building Positive Relations and Shared Spaces and Services. googletag.cmd.push Match-funding for the Action Plan was provided by The Executive Office, Northern Ireland and the Department of Rural and Community Development, Ireland. First Minister Paul Givan said: “I would like to congratulate Mid Ulster District Council on the success in delivering its PEACE IV Programme. I commend all those involved in this wide range of initiatives, both as organisers and participants. Through the building of positive relations, this programme has supported children and young people, while creating and promoting shared spaces and services throughout Mid Ulster. These improvements at an inidual and community level are the foundations for a better future for us all. This is a great achievement which will leave a positive lasting impact on all those involved. It also makes an important contribution to the Executive’s vision for Northern Ireland as a place which is inclusive, shared and safe.” The deputy First Minister, Michelle O’Neill said: “I am delighted that The Executive Office has been able to support this transformative PEACE IV programme in my own constituency. The Mid Ulster Local Authority Action Plan has brought hundreds of children and young people from dferent traditions and backgrounds together, helping them to form positive and effective relationships.     And it has also helped to create shared spaces and build good relations that will support meaningful integration in years to come. I would like to congratulate everyone involved in the programme and thank them for their incredible efforts towards ending ision and promoting community cohesion. Initiatives such as this are crucial in helping our entire society move forward and become an inclusive, united community where everyone is treated equally.” Minister for Rural and Community Development, Heather Humphreys TD, commented: “I want to congratulate Mid Ulster District Council on their achievements under their EU PEACE IV funded Local Authority Action Plan. “I am delighted that my Department was able to provide match funding and support for the delivery of this important plan which has delivered beneficial projects and six shared spaces for all those living in the area, which I am sure will serve as a tangible memory of your hard work and dedication. The accomplishments and goals achieved as part of this Action Plan would not have been possible without the involvement of all the participants. I look forward to seeing your great achievements built on under the new PEACE Plus programme which will provide substantial investment in the region over the coming years”. Speaking at the event, Chair of Mid Ulster District Council, Councillor Paul McLean said: “The PEACE IV funded Local Authority Plan delivered in our district has hugely benefited all communities, successfully delivering positive relations within and across district boundaries. In particular, it has contributed to the lives of over , children and young people, who participated in a range of projects focusing on cultural ersity, good relations and sports engagement. “The legacy of the PEACE IV programme is perhaps most visible in the development of six shared sites that encourage use by erse communities, and play a vital role in the revitalisation and ongoing vibrancy of our towns and villages. We are extremely grateful to our funders for supporting such a successful programme.” Other projects funded under the action plan were instrumental in building positive relations, including both small grants delivered by a range of local community groups, and council led initiatives delivering Cross Border engagement. This activity has been successful in re-affirming peace and reconciliation across the border through shared heritage of the Clans and shared literature of our Poet Laureates, Yeats and Heaney. The Shared Spaces and Services strand of the programme has created six shared sites across Mid Ulster, including Aughnacloy, Castledawson, Donaghmore, Draperstown, Moneymore and Moy. A further three grants were funded under this theme to promote shared space, peace and reconciliation. Most recently, a newly funded programme aimed to develop an all year round events space has been launched. Discussing the signicance of Mid Ulster’s Action Plan, Gina McIntyre, CEO of the Special EU Programmes Body, said: “Unfortunately, despite many years of positive progress, we still continue to experience high levels of sectarianism and racism, with many communities remaining segregated, and limited opportunities for people to engage with each other. The PEACE IV-funded Local Authority Action Plans, across Northern Ireland and the border counties of Ireland provide opportunities to change this, and have supported many thousands of people to take courageous steps forward to create a more cohesive and forward-thinking society. These Action Plans have helped overcome barriers to cross-community engagement and built capacity for many dferent groups to engage in peace and reconciliation activities. I congratulate the Council on their dedication to delivering this Action Plan, particularly given all of the many dficulties resulting from COVID-,” she continued.

The Action Plan was funded through the European Union’s PEACE IV Programme, which is managed by the Special EU Programmes Body, and the programmes delivered focused around Children and Young People, Building Positive Relations and Shared Spaces and Services. googletag.cmd.push Match-funding for the Action Plan was provided by The Executive Office, Northern Ireland and the Department of Rural and Community Development, Ireland. First Minister Paul Givan said: “I would like to congratulate Mid Ulster District Council on the success in delivering its PEACE IV Programme. I commend all those involved in this wide range of initiatives, both as organisers and participants. Through the building of positive relations, this programme has supported children and young people, while creating and promoting shared spaces and services throughout Mid Ulster. These improvements at an inidual and community level are the foundations for a better future for us all. This is a great achievement which will leave a positive lasting impact on all those involved. It also makes an important contribution to the Executive’s vision for Northern Ireland as a place which is inclusive, shared and safe.” The deputy First Minister, Michelle O’Neill said: “I am delighted that The Executive Office has been able to support this transformative PEACE IV programme in my own constituency. The Mid Ulster Local Authority Action Plan has brought hundreds of children and young people from dferent traditions and backgrounds together, helping them to form positive and effective relationships.     And it has also helped to create shared spaces and build good relations that will support meaningful integration in years to come. I would like to congratulate everyone involved in the programme and thank them for their incredible efforts towards ending ision and promoting community cohesion. Initiatives such as this are crucial in helping our entire society move forward and become an inclusive, united community where everyone is treated equally.” Minister for Rural and Community Development, Heather Humphreys TD, commented: “I want to congratulate Mid Ulster District Council on their achievements under their EU PEACE IV funded Local Authority Action Plan. “I am delighted that my Department was able to provide match funding and support for the delivery of this important plan which has delivered beneficial projects and six shared spaces for all those living in the area, which I am sure will serve as a tangible memory of your hard work and dedication. The accomplishments and goals achieved as part of this Action Plan would not have been possible without the involvement of all the participants. I look forward to seeing your great achievements built on under the new PEACE Plus programme which will provide substantial investment in the region over the coming years”. Speaking at the event, Chair of Mid Ulster District Council, Councillor Paul McLean said: “The PEACE IV funded Local Authority Plan delivered in our district has hugely benefited all communities, successfully delivering positive relations within and across district boundaries. In particular, it has contributed to the lives of over , children and young people, who participated in a range of projects focusing on cultural ersity, good relations and sports engagement. “The legacy of the PEACE IV programme is perhaps most visible in the development of six shared sites that encourage use by erse communities, and play a vital role in the revitalisation and ongoing vibrancy of our towns and villages. We are extremely grateful to our funders for supporting such a successful programme.” Other projects funded under the action plan were instrumental in building positive relations, including both small grants delivered by a range of local community groups, and council led initiatives delivering Cross Border engagement. This activity has been successful in re-affirming peace and reconciliation across the border through shared heritage of the Clans and shared literature of our Poet Laureates, Yeats and Heaney. The Shared Spaces and Services strand of the programme has created six shared sites across Mid Ulster, including Aughnacloy, Castledawson, Donaghmore, Draperstown, Moneymore and Moy. A further three grants were funded under this theme to promote shared space, peace and reconciliation. Most recently, a newly funded programme aimed to develop an all year round events space has been launched. Discussing the signicance of Mid Ulster’s Action Plan, Gina McIntyre, CEO of the Special EU Programmes Body, said: “Unfortunately, despite many years of positive progress, we still continue to experience high levels of sectarianism and racism, with many communities remaining segregated, and limited opportunities for people to engage with each other. The PEACE IV-funded Local Authority Action Plans, across Northern Ireland and the border counties of Ireland provide opportunities to change this, and have supported many thousands of people to take courageous steps forward to create a more cohesive and forward-thinking society. These Action Plans have helped overcome barriers to cross-community engagement and built capacity for many dferent groups to engage in peace and reconciliation activities. I congratulate the Council on their dedication to delivering this Action Plan, particularly given all of the many dficulties resulting from COVID-,” she continued.

The call comes from SDLP Foyle MLA Sineacutead McLaughlin who was speaking after being told by Health Minister Robin Swann that the local service was under serious pressure,to the point that thealready long waiting list to access contraception through the Family Planning Service was closed to new appointments. googletag.cmd.push Ms McLaughlin said: “Several constituents contacted me to complain about delays in accessing contraception servicesthrough the Family Planning Service. In his answer to my written question, health minister Swann revealedthat people in Derry are at a signicant disadvantage compared to people in other areas in the North when it comes to accessing this essential healthcare service. “While I am pleased the Western Trust was able to start accepting new clients from July this year, I am very concerned at the impact of waiting for access toa full range of contraceptive options. “These need to be accessible to all who need them, when they need them. “I have also written to Health Minister Swann to ask whether his department has any strategy in place to tackle this issue and whether he will commit to making the necessary funding available to ensure there are enough staff to meet demand and reduce waiting times for an appointment. While I realise the Western Trust is dealing with a range of dficult challenges, including staff shortages, it must recognise that access to contraception can be essential in avoiding unintended pregnancies and the personal crisis this can cause.     “Not only do my constituents deserve improved access to the full range of healthcare services, but increased investment in contraception has been demonstrated to save public money in the long term.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Local NewsWhale carcass on County Derry beach is posing a health risk overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsJudge orders top Derry cop to court overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Road works have been causing dficulties in Dungiven.Local NewsCalls for County Derry roadworks to be suspended overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsHospital fundraiser launched after death of popular County Derry businessman overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSerious sexual assault on woman in County Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out  About at foam party in Dormans Bar, Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out  About at foam party in Dormans Bar, Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Constable Michael Ferguson, , was shot dead in Derry in January, .DerryNowMan arrested in Derry for  murder of policeman Michael Ferguson overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMuch-needed resurfacing completed on County Derry road overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia WATCH: Blah, blah, blah - Greta Thunberg blasts world leaders for climate inactionNational NewsWATCH: Blah, blah, blah - Greta Thunberg blasts world leaders for climate inaction overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out  About at foam party in Dormans Bar, Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out  About at foam party in Dormans Bar, Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

The Forum is one of  groups across the north of Ireland to receive a chunk of the pound.million funding pot which is part of the first tranche of grants from the Mental Health Support Fund. googletag.cmd.push General manager of the Forum, Aileen McGuinness, expressed her delight at the award saying the money would help improve existing community programmes as well as allowing the Forum greater scope to develop new ones. She said: “The mental health strategy came out and there was a lot of consultation around it. We were very central in tying in with that as its been a direction of the organisation for a long time with mental health services that have been very much underfunded. “A lot of mental health services we funded ourselves through fundraising events like Jog In The Bog and other events. “We saw the strategy come out which we were really excited about. Obviously half a million pounds is a big pot of funding. Ourselves and other community organisations in the five areas – ourselves, Outer West, Outer North, Waterside and Strabane – came together to put in a large application. “We found out that our application was successful last week and were over the moon. “It would have been a very hard competition out there with a lot of other people because mental health hasnt been funded.     “A lot of people would have seen the benefits of bringing that funding under their own communities. “So were delighted that Derry and Strabane was recognised as an area where theres a need for investment. The award is going to give us a wee bit of substance to the programmes that were doing. “It will help support those people in need. It doesnt have to be people, for example, that need one-to-one counselling, its a wide range of programmes that we provide from physical activity, mental health support, group sessions, nutritional support. Its a holistic programme. “Then there is that higher level of one-to-one support and theres small group sessions. “The programme dont necessarily have to be for anybody who is in dire need, it is a preventative programme as well as an intervention one too. “We just want to make sure that we get that message out there that there will be programmes running within the area that could be a -week cooking programme or a -week physical activity programme. “Its just getting that message that every element of your le is impacted by your mental health. “The award will give us the freedom to introduce new programmes as well. There will be four new -week programmes across the five areas. “They will obviously be catered towards the needs of each area. For example,someone has been isolated for a long period of time, they will receive some support to come into community organisations. “What we find is that the major challenge for people getting out there is hitting that first step over the doorway of our community organisation. But once they make that first step, thats where we see their engagement increase and then become a member of their own community and feel pride in it. Ms McGuinness admitted that had the Forums application for the award not been successful, then the pressures faced by them prior to receiving the good news would still be there. She added: “Had we not got this award, we would be back to fundraising ourselves – not that theres anything to be taken away from that. “But these areas would have needs that could not be addressed and those pressures would still be on the community organisations. “Our services are very strained and we can only do as much as we can. “If we didnt have this award, we would just be battling the same battle as we have always done, day in, day out and going above and beyond. “Hopefully this will give us room for manoeuvre to bring people through the door but also to provide extra training and support for community organisations so that we can become a trauma informed district. “This basically means that staff would be trained to have a unied approach identying that there is trauma out there. “We all have trauma in our lives – it doesnt have to be this big massive impact. Its how a person reacts to a situation and everybody being open and understanding to that.” While Ms McGuinness says that the award is a boon for the Forum, a lot more help and support is needed from the powers that be in order for mental health support to covered across the north of Ireland. She continued: “Obviously in the long term, mental health needs more funding from the Government and the Executiveso that we dont have to rely on a grant application every year being successful. “This is the start of the ten-year strategy so we hope that this is a continuation. Also with integrated care systems coming down the line, we hope this is a new way of working in that were listening to community organisations on how they work and address the issues we face.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Local NewsWhale carcass on County Derry beach is posing a health risk overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsJudge orders top Derry cop to court overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Road works have been causing dficulties in Dungiven.Local NewsCalls for County Derry roadworks to be suspended overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsHospital fundraiser launched after death of popular County Derry businessman overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSerious sexual assault on woman in County Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out  About at foam party in Dormans Bar, Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out  About at foam party in Dormans Bar, Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Constable Michael Ferguson, , was shot dead in Derry in January, .DerryNowMan arrested in Derry for  murder of policeman Michael Ferguson overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMuch-needed resurfacing completed on County Derry road overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia WATCH: Blah, blah, blah - Greta Thunberg blasts world leaders for climate inactionNational NewsWATCH: Blah, blah, blah - Greta Thunberg blasts world leaders for climate inaction overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out  About at foam party in Dormans Bar, Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out  About at foam party in Dormans Bar, Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

The Forum is one of  groups across the north of Ireland to receive a chunk of the pound.million funding pot which is part of the first tranche of grants from the Mental Health Support Fund. googletag.cmd.push General manager of the Forum, Aileen McGuinness, expressed her delight at the award saying the money would help improve existing community programmes as well as allowing the Forum greater scope to develop new ones. She said: “The mental health strategy came out and there was a lot of consultation around it. We were very central in tying in with that as its been a direction of the organisation for a long time with mental health services that have been very much underfunded. “A lot of mental health services we funded ourselves through fundraising events like Jog In The Bog and other events. “We saw the strategy come out which we were really excited about. Obviously half a million pounds is a big pot of funding. Ourselves and other community organisations in the five areas – ourselves, Outer West, Outer North, Waterside and Strabane – came together to put in a large application. “We found out that our application was successful last week and were over the moon. “It would have been a very hard competition out there with a lot of other people because mental health hasnt been funded.     “A lot of people would have seen the benefits of bringing that funding under their own communities. “So were delighted that Derry and Strabane was recognised as an area where theres a need for investment. The award is going to give us a wee bit of substance to the programmes that were doing. “It will help support those people in need. It doesnt have to be people, for example, that need one-to-one counselling, its a wide range of programmes that we provide from physical activity, mental health support, group sessions, nutritional support. Its a holistic programme. “Then there is that higher level of one-to-one support and theres small group sessions. “The programme dont necessarily have to be for anybody who is in dire need, it is a preventative programme as well as an intervention one too. “We just want to make sure that we get that message out there that there will be programmes running within the area that could be a -week cooking programme or a -week physical activity programme. “Its just getting that message that every element of your le is impacted by your mental health. “The award will give us the freedom to introduce new programmes as well. There will be four new -week programmes across the five areas. “They will obviously be catered towards the needs of each area. For example,someone has been isolated for a long period of time, they will receive some support to come into community organisations. “What we find is that the major challenge for people getting out there is hitting that first step over the doorway of our community organisation. But once they make that first step, thats where we see their engagement increase and then become a member of their own community and feel pride in it. Ms McGuinness admitted that had the Forums application for the award not been successful, then the pressures faced by them prior to receiving the good news would still be there. She added: “Had we not got this award, we would be back to fundraising ourselves – not that theres anything to be taken away from that. “But these areas would have needs that could not be addressed and those pressures would still be on the community organisations. “Our services are very strained and we can only do as much as we can. “If we didnt have this award, we would just be battling the same battle as we have always done, day in, day out and going above and beyond. “Hopefully this will give us room for manoeuvre to bring people through the door but also to provide extra training and support for community organisations so that we can become a trauma informed district. “This basically means that staff would be trained to have a unied approach identying that there is trauma out there. “We all have trauma in our lives – it doesnt have to be this big massive impact. Its how a person reacts to a situation and everybody being open and understanding to that.” While Ms McGuinness says that the award is a boon for the Forum, a lot more help and support is needed from the powers that be in order for mental health support to covered across the north of Ireland. She continued: “Obviously in the long term, mental health needs more funding from the Government and the Executiveso that we dont have to rely on a grant application every year being successful. “This is the start of the ten-year strategy so we hope that this is a continuation. Also with integrated care systems coming down the line, we hope this is a new way of working in that were listening to community organisations on how they work and address the issues we face.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Local NewsWhale carcass on County Derry beach is posing a health risk overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsJudge orders top Derry cop to court overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Road works have been causing dficulties in Dungiven.Local NewsCalls for County Derry roadworks to be suspended overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsHospital fundraiser launched after death of popular County Derry businessman overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSerious sexual assault on woman in County Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out  About at foam party in Dormans Bar, Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out  About at foam party in Dormans Bar, Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Constable Michael Ferguson, , was shot dead in Derry in January, .DerryNowMan arrested in Derry for  murder of policeman Michael Ferguson overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMuch-needed resurfacing completed on County Derry road overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia WATCH: Blah, blah, blah - Greta Thunberg blasts world leaders for climate inactionNational NewsWATCH: Blah, blah, blah - Greta Thunberg blasts world leaders for climate inaction overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out  About at foam party in Dormans Bar, Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out  About at foam party in Dormans Bar, Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council held a confidential ‘in committee’ meeting on Monday night to discuss legal advice on the ownership of Portstewart Town Hall. googletag.cmd.push In , the Council received Notice to Quit from the buildings legal owners, the Montagu Estate. A -year lease taken by the Council on the property had expired in the s. Portstewart Community Group had launched an online petition urging the Council to pause legal proceedings, and this evening slammed the actions of the Council, saying they were ‘deeply disappointed’. ”The council is proceeding with the handover to the Montagu Estate, despite the fact that, in just a few days, our petition requesting a pause to legal proceedings has gained over , signatures from concerned members of the public,” they said. “One of our greatest frustrations has been that so much business has been conducted under the shroud of legal privilege.  “This has frustrated our efforts to retain the building in public ownership and it has made it almost impossible to hold the council to account for their actions and decisions. “Nevertheless, the vote to hand the building over and the vote against delaying the legal proceedings are both on public record, and we are grateful to all those councillors who voted to support the community in their desire to retain the town hall. “What is neither clear nor available on public record is what efforts were made by the Council to retain the town hall for the people of Portstewart.”     The group are now worried a precedent has been set by the Council in relation to public ownership or buildings. “This property transfer is a worrying precedent for the town of Portstewart and the entire borough. What other buildings might be affected in a similar way  This issue raises serious concerns regarding Council governance,” they said. “It is a shame that the Council used its statement to say that ‘previous leaks to the media about this matter harmed its legal position.’  “Public and media scrutiny of the Councils actions are an important element of democracy and accountability. “The Council must expect such scrutiny, particularly over such a contentious issue, and particularly when the Council has been so reluctant to release information or respond to Freedom of Information requests on the matter. “So much of the anger and frustration felt by the community is a result of the lack of communication from, and accountability by, our Council.” Council Mayor Richard Holmes said the community were free to engage directly with the Montagu Estate over the future of the building, and the group said they intend to continue their cause. ”We will continue to seek avenues to retain Portstewart town hall for our community,” they said. ”It is deeply regrettable that Portstewart Conservation Society was not supported in its efforts to source grant funding for the repairs needed to bring the town hall back into use and to keep the building in public ownership. “It is clear that Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council have not been good custodians of our historical town hall, which has served our community and sat at the heart of our town since the s. ”We thank the public for their ongoing support of our campaign. We are proud to be serving our community to work in its best interest and to hold our council to account for its actions and inactions.  “We will strive to continue to do this, despite the frustrations we have encountered to date, because this is what our community is asking us to do. ”Our town, and our town hall, deserved so much better than this.“  Council to proceed with handover of County Derry town hall  The Mayor said the community were ‘free to negotiate’ with the owners over its use.    Ongoing petition urging Council to keep County Derry town hall  The Council will hold a confidential meeting tonight to discuss legal advice on the halls ownership.    Council accounts ratication delayed by ownership issues  Cllr Aaron Callan has said work is underway to address the issues.

Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council held a confidential ‘in committee’ meeting on Monday night to discuss legal advice on the ownership of Portstewart Town Hall. googletag.cmd.push In , the Council received Notice to Quit from the buildings legal owners, the Montagu Estate. A -year lease taken by the Council on the property had expired in the s. Portstewart Community Group had launched an online petition urging the Council to pause legal proceedings, and this evening slammed the actions of the Council, saying they were ‘deeply disappointed’. ”The council is proceeding with the handover to the Montagu Estate, despite the fact that, in just a few days, our petition requesting a pause to legal proceedings has gained over , signatures from concerned members of the public,” they said. “One of our greatest frustrations has been that so much business has been conducted under the shroud of legal privilege.  “This has frustrated our efforts to retain the building in public ownership and it has made it almost impossible to hold the council to account for their actions and decisions. “Nevertheless, the vote to hand the building over and the vote against delaying the legal proceedings are both on public record, and we are grateful to all those councillors who voted to support the community in their desire to retain the town hall. “What is neither clear nor available on public record is what efforts were made by the Council to retain the town hall for the people of Portstewart.”     The group are now worried a precedent has been set by the Council in relation to public ownership or buildings. “This property transfer is a worrying precedent for the town of Portstewart and the entire borough. What other buildings might be affected in a similar way  This issue raises serious concerns regarding Council governance,” they said. “It is a shame that the Council used its statement to say that ‘previous leaks to the media about this matter harmed its legal position.’  “Public and media scrutiny of the Councils actions are an important element of democracy and accountability. “The Council must expect such scrutiny, particularly over such a contentious issue, and particularly when the Council has been so reluctant to release information or respond to Freedom of Information requests on the matter. “So much of the anger and frustration felt by the community is a result of the lack of communication from, and accountability by, our Council.” Council Mayor Richard Holmes said the community were free to engage directly with the Montagu Estate over the future of the building, and the group said they intend to continue their cause. ”We will continue to seek avenues to retain Portstewart town hall for our community,” they said. ”It is deeply regrettable that Portstewart Conservation Society was not supported in its efforts to source grant funding for the repairs needed to bring the town hall back into use and to keep the building in public ownership. “It is clear that Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council have not been good custodians of our historical town hall, which has served our community and sat at the heart of our town since the s. ”We thank the public for their ongoing support of our campaign. We are proud to be serving our community to work in its best interest and to hold our council to account for its actions and inactions.  “We will strive to continue to do this, despite the frustrations we have encountered to date, because this is what our community is asking us to do. ”Our town, and our town hall, deserved so much better than this.“  Council to proceed with handover of County Derry town hall  The Mayor said the community were ‘free to negotiate’ with the owners over its use.    Ongoing petition urging Council to keep County Derry town hall  The Council will hold a confidential meeting tonight to discuss legal advice on the halls ownership.    Council accounts ratication delayed by ownership issues  Cllr Aaron Callan has said work is underway to address the issues.

Opel’s ground-breaking powertrain technology and architecture means that the low, flat battery gives the Vio-e a stable centre of gravity and maximum cabin space. Designed from the ground up with both diesel and electric powertrains in mind, the Vio-e is based heavily on the Opel Corsa-e and its driveline fits comfortably between the chassis rails of the new Vio-e.     Power comes from a kW motor producing Nm of torque for smooth, swt and linear acceleration. The kWh battery is made up of  modules consisting of  inidual cells, while the larger kWh battery has  cells split over  modules.Cooling for the batteries comes from the van’s own in-cab cooling system, which Opel says helps to increase their range and letime. All Vio-e models come with three driving modes and switchable regenerative braking as standard.The standard on-board charger is a .kW single phase unit, while DC charging of up to kW is also supported.Trim and Body Options         Trim levels in the new Vio-e  van consist of Edition and Sportive models, both of which come with standard features such as driver and passenger airbags, electric parking brake, cruise control, full size spare wheel, .” colour dashboard display, remote central deadlocking, two side loading doors, electric front windows, electrically adjustable and heated door mirrors, -speaker audio with a USB inlet, Bluetooth, steering-column remote audio controls, and a DAB radio.Top-spec Sportive trim brings with it air-conditioning, ” colour touchscreen with smartphone projection, body coloured bumpers , LED daytime running lights, front fog lights, rear parking sensors, automatic lights and wipers, electrically folding door mirrors, acoustic windscreen and full-size wheel covers.Available with two body s and two roof heights, the Vio-e is just as flexible as a diesel van with a load volume of up to .m. Because the batteries are between the chassis rails, the total capacity of the load space is completely unchanged, allowing ,mm s in the L model and up to ,mm in the L when using the load-through bulkhead.Otherwise, the standard maximumcapacity of the van is ,mm for the L and ,mm for the L.Payloads are equally impressive, as replacing the engine and transmission with batteries and a motor doesn’t signicantly harm it’s capacities.All Vio-e vans have a gross vehicle weightof .-tonne, and depending on spec you can get a maximum ,kg payload out of a L standard roof height van with the kWh battery.Specying the larger kWh unit brings that figure down to ,kg.Those figures are just kg less than a diesel-engine Vio — a far cry from the disadvantage that battery electric vehicles used to have when compared to diesel-powered vans in the past.Test VanMy test van was a new Vio-e SportivekWh finished in stylish Moonstone Grey metallic paint. The three-seater Vio-e has storage under the passenger bench, while the driver’s seat comes with an adjustable armrest and -way seat adjustment. Being an electric van where the full amount of torque is available from just rpm all the way up to ,rpm, it is exceptionally quick off the mark.Unladen, the Vio-e accelerates with impressive urgency, and I have no doubt it would still prove fast even with a full payload on board.The top speed is limited to km h in order to preserve the battery range, but this is something that should not be of any concern to Vio-e drivers, as the van is more than capable of overtaking slower moving traffic with great ease.The regenerative braking system in the Vio-e is selected by pressing the ‘B mode’ button beside the gear selector, and this applies enough braking to activate the brake lights and slow the vehicle down before the driver presses the brake pedal.I loved the fact that the Vio-e is very car-like to drive, and the selectable Eco, Normal and Power driving modes ensure that there is a mode to suit every type of driver and every type of load. The Vio-e remains composed and comfortable when driven over rutted road surfaces, while body lean through bends is very well controlled.The Vio-e pulls away in silence, with just a hum from the on-board sound generator that is designed to warn others of your presence at low speeds, with just minimal levels of tyre and wind noise noticeable at higher speeds.Charging TimesCharging the Vio-efrom a domestic socket can take up to  hours, but this drops dramatically to . hours when charged from a .KW wall box charger .However, DC rapid charging from a kW sourcetakes just half an hour for the kWh battery and  minutes for the kWh version.Verdict  PricingOverall, the new Opel Vio-e is a genuinely impressive van to drive, easy to live with on a daily basis, offers fast-charging options and it is a good looking van too.In my opinion, this is the class-leading  van in the all-electric light commercial vehiclemarket right now, and deservedly so too.

Available exclusively in Attitude Black paintwork, the new Sport Black Edition brings a distinctive sporty look to Toyota’s fth-generation RAV, and is available in front-wheel-driveguise only.  googletag.cmd.push   However, for buyers looking for the added security of an all-wheel-drivedrivetrain in their new RAV, there is the option of AWD in Sol, Sport and Platinum iants, while the entry-level Luna model is FWD only.Petrol Electric PowertrainLike every iant in the RAV range, the Sport Black Edition is powered by a .-litre four-cylinder petrol-electric hybrid powertrain, which produces bhp and Nm of torque and enables the five-seat family SUV to sprint from -km h in just over  seconds. Standard across the entire RAV range is a suite of safety features which offer maximum protection for all occupants, while providing the RAV driver with the latest technology in driver assistance systems.     Collectively called Toyota Safety Sense  , features include Pre-Collision Assistance , Speed Assistance , Lane Keepingand Automatic High Beam Assist.Gracious Exterior, Spacious InteriorThe exterior design of the new RAV is more appealing and less anonymous that its predecessor, and this is gained by way of boxy wheel arches, a squared-off nose with a large grille, and angular edges and creases in the bodywork. I feel that Toyota has done a great job of making the new RAV look and feel more ‘premium’ than ever, while also offering more interior space than any of its predecessors.         Cabin quality is exceptional, with sturdy and durable materials used throughout, while overall passenger space is generous in every respect. This has been made possible by placing the front and rear axles mm further apart than before, and even tall adults will be able to sit in the rear seats comfortably, with plenty of legroom and headroom on offer.The RAV’s battery is located under the floor, but its boxy dimensions help to hide it well, with a slightly higher boot floor the only clue to what lies beneath.Compared to its predecessor, the RAV’s boot capacity has grown to -litres , with a massive ,-litres available when the rear seats are folded down.The RAV was awarded a full five stars by Euro NCAP in  and that was thanks in part to an upgrade to the second-generation of Toyota Safety Sense for the latest model.Test CarMy test car was a RAV Sport Black Edition which drew lots of admiring glances due to its terric road presence and distinctive design details.An impressive array of standard equipment includes TEX leather black upholstery with heated front seats, powered driver seat, auto-dimming interior mirror, front and rear parking sensors, rear view camera, auto lights and wipers, LED front light guide with daytime running lights, LED projector headlights, electrically operated boot door, ” Toyota Touch multimedia system, dual zone climate control, rear privacy glass, satellite navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, black headliner cloth, paddle sht, light blue ambient lighting, and illuminated entry along with many more comfort, convenience, safety and infotainment features.As is the case across all models in the RAV line-up, fuel consumption as low as .l km is achievable on a WLTP combined driving cycle, while Co emissions of between  and g kmensures low annual road tax in addition to low overall running costs.Toyota’s advanced hybrid technology ensures that the RAV’s petrol engine and electric motor combine seamlessly to deliver extra performance and outstanding fuel efficiency, while remaining ultra-smooth and extremely quiet when driving in electric mode.Toyota claim that up to % of the time you drive a Toyota Hybrid, you are in electric mode, with the added advantage that you never have to plug the car in to charge the battery.Toyota’s self-charging hybrid harvests the energy normally lost from deceleration and braking into a small battery. This unit doesn’t have enough capacity to propel the RAV alone for any considerable distance, but it does offer the convenience of being able to charge itself without any input from the driver.The RAV sits on Toyota’s New Global Architecture, which is also used in the Toyota Prius, C-HR and Corolla models. It brings big benefits in ride and handling, with more sophisticated suspension than the old model, so the RAV is capable of turning into corners with a surprising amount of poise and precision, with plenty of grip while resisting dramatic levels of body lean.The RAV’s CVTtransmission is smooth and slick in its operation, while a well-insulated cabin ensures that on-road refinement is top class. When travelling through towns and cities at low speed, the RAV’s electric motor is barely audible, with the engine shutting off entirely when stationary in traffic. At motorway cruising speeds, the RAV settles into a quiet hum, with only small amounts of tyre and wind noise getting through to the cabin.Verdict, Cost and WarrantyWith its unique and distinctive modern styling, faultless build quality, impressive tally of standard equipment and frugal petrol electric hybrid technology, the new RAV has all the necessary ingredients to comfortably fulfil the needs of a growing family.The new RAV Sport Black Edition represents great value. The new Toyota RAV is backed by a three-year ,km warranty, along with a five-year ,km warranty on hybrid components.Additionally, a hybrid battery warranty of up to an incredible -years is available upon completing an annual hybrid health check through Toyota’s nationwide dealer network.

The Formentor’s design inside and out is something quite dferent to what we have seen before, and brings with it a new dimension in style and sophistication. Being part of the Volkswagen Group means that Cupra has access to cutting-edge mechanicals and technology, and this has enabled the new Formentor compact SUV to hit the ground running, so to speak.  googletag.cmd.push   There is a lot of money and confidence behind the Cupra brand, and that is evident in the bold product plan promised by the company.Engine  Trim OptionsThe Formentor sits on the familiar MQB set of chassis components that also underpins other crossovers such as the Seat Ateca and VW Tiguan. Petrol engine options in the Formentor consist of a .-litre TSI with bhp and a .-litre TSI unit with a choice of ,  or bhp. The . TSI engine is available as a -speed manual or -speed DSG , while the . TSI comes with a DSG transmission as standard, with Cupra’s Drivesystem standard in bhp guise. A . TDIEVO engine is available with bhp and can be mated to a -speed manual or -speed DSG transmission, with the latter coming with Drive as standard.     Additionally, a .-litre e-Hybrid powertrain is available with a choice of bhp or bhp, both of which are mated to a -speed DSG transmission with promised fuel consumption as low as .l km on a combined WLTP driving cycle.There is a choice of two trim levels in CUPRA’s new compact SUV — Formentor and Formentor VZ — with the latter being the Cupra Formentor’s most powerful trim, named in reference to the Spanish word ‘Veloz’, meaning ‘fast’.The Formentor VZ trim offers high-performance powertrain options. Coming with ” alloy wheels, a ” Navigation system, autonomous assistance technology and performance bucket seats as standard.         Test CarMy test car was a Cupra Formentor . TSiDSGwhich was finished in stylish Graphene Grey Premium metallic paint with optional ” Exclusive Aero Black and Copper alloy wheels for an added dose of visual drama. Producing bhp and Nm of torque, the ,cc engine propels the Formentor from a standing start to km h in just .-seconds, on its way to a top speed of km h .Key standard features include full LED headlamps and Daytime Running Lights, rear ‘coast to coast’ light with welcome ceremony, front fog lamps with cornering , heat-insulated and tinted rear windows, leather-wrapped multi- heated sports steering wheel, dark aluminium glossy interior package, textile sport seats, keyless unlocking and ignition system, .” Digital Cockpit, ” Media System with DAB radio, Connect Online infotainment , rain and light sensor, heated front seats, adaptive cruise control, park assist, rear view camera, Drive Profile Selection, and auto high-beam assist, along with a suite of advanced safety systems.Optional extras fitted to my test car included premium metallic paint, black leather bucket seats, ” alloy wheels, hands-free electric tailgate, Dynamic Chassis Control, and Safe  Drive “L” . The sweet-revving petrol engine in my test car produces bhp and Nm of torque, enabling the car to sprint from -km h in .-seconds, with claimed fuel consumption as low as .-l km .As in other VW Group models, the .-litre engine is commendably quick to drop onto two cylinders to save fuel when cruising, and the process of cutting out and back in again is hard to detect. Composed and predictable handling is admirable, as is the Formentor’s ability to soak up road imperfections with ease.Impressive Sporty InteriorTake a seat behind the wheel of the CUPRA Formentor and you could be forgiven for thinking that you are in a hatchback rather than a compact SUV. The seating position is low, as is the base of the windscreen, so you feel like you sit much closer to the road — as you would in a performance-focused car.Selectable driving modes in the Formentor consist of Comfort, Sport, Cupra and Inidual, with each mode bringing a greater degree of aggression and engine noise that gets pumped through the cars speakers.Cabin space in the Formentor is excellent, with adults over six foot tall still able to sit comfortably in the rear seats. You could even sit three abreast thanks to the shallow transmission tunnel. The use of quality materials, with a grainy metal finish in the middle of the fascia, makes the cabin of the Formentor a pleasant and comfortable place to be, while bronze Cupra highlights on the air vents add a sense of occasion to every journey. The boot capacity of -litres in the Formentor . TSI can be expanded by dropping the rear seatbacks, allowing for even greater practicality when called upon.The Formentor scored a full five star rating in its Euro NCAP crash test, thanks in part to standard safety systems such as lane-keep assist, forward collision warning, predictive cruise control and driver alert warning.The new Cupra Formentor offers a more exclusive, contemporary vision of sportiness, which is instilled into an exquisitely sleek and bold design.

People have been urged to get their tickets early with an expected surge of people buying tickets as the time nears. The Lotto jackpot is currently capped at €. million and this represents the record breaking Lotto jackpot win by the Dan Morrissey syndicate in Carlow in June , which was the largest amount ever seen in the Lotto game. googletag.cmd.push If tonight’s Lotto jackpot exceeds the current jackpot cap of €. million and is won, then that amount will become the new Lotto jackpot cap going forward. If tonights Lotto jackpot exceeds the cap and is not won, Saturdays Lotto jackpot will remain capped at that level. As the jackpot will be capped, this means that no additional money will be added to the jackpot prize until it is won. The funds that would normally go to the jackpot will be distributed to the next lower prize tier at which there are winners. A National Lottery spokesperson said:“Tonight’s draw is set to be one of the most exciting in the history of Lotto! If the jackpot is higher than €. million, the current record for highest jackpot ever will officially be broken. And of course,there is a jackpot winner, they will become the biggest Lotto winner in the history of the game in Ireland – what a title to take! The current jackpot roll has lasted for almost  months and we understand just how much of a buzz there is around the hugely le-altering amount. As we get closer to the cut-off time for sales at .pm this evening, we expect there to be an uptake in sales. We are advising players to purchase their tickets early and to follow public health guidelines while doing so. Don’t forget that tickets can be purchased in-store, on the National Lottery app or at www.lottery.ie.”     Meanwhile, there was no winner of last night’s €,, EuroMillions jackpot which means that Friday’s jackpot is now set to roll to a massive € million.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Local NewsWhale carcass on County Derry beach is posing a health risk overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsJudge orders top Derry cop to court overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Road works have been causing dficulties in Dungiven.Local NewsCalls for County Derry roadworks to be suspended overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsHospital fundraiser launched after death of popular County Derry businessman overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSerious sexual assault on woman in County Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out  About at foam party in Dormans Bar, Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out  About at foam party in Dormans Bar, Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Constable Michael Ferguson, , was shot dead in Derry in January, .DerryNowMan arrested in Derry for  murder of policeman Michael Ferguson overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMuch-needed resurfacing completed on County Derry road overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia WATCH: Blah, blah, blah - Greta Thunberg blasts world leaders for climate inactionNational NewsWATCH: Blah, blah, blah - Greta Thunberg blasts world leaders for climate inaction overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out  About at foam party in Dormans Bar, Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out  About at foam party in Dormans Bar, Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

People have been urged to get their tickets early with an expected surge of people buying tickets as the time nears. The Lotto jackpot is currently capped at €. million and this represents the record breaking Lotto jackpot win by the Dan Morrissey syndicate in Carlow in June , which was the largest amount ever seen in the Lotto game. googletag.cmd.push If tonight’s Lotto jackpot exceeds the current jackpot cap of €. million and is won, then that amount will become the new Lotto jackpot cap going forward. If tonights Lotto jackpot exceeds the cap and is not won, Saturdays Lotto jackpot will remain capped at that level. As the jackpot will be capped, this means that no additional money will be added to the jackpot prize until it is won. The funds that would normally go to the jackpot will be distributed to the next lower prize tier at which there are winners. A National Lottery spokesperson said:“Tonight’s draw is set to be one of the most exciting in the history of Lotto! If the jackpot is higher than €. million, the current record for highest jackpot ever will officially be broken. And of course,there is a jackpot winner, they will become the biggest Lotto winner in the history of the game in Ireland – what a title to take! The current jackpot roll has lasted for almost  months and we understand just how much of a buzz there is around the hugely le-altering amount. As we get closer to the cut-off time for sales at .pm this evening, we expect there to be an uptake in sales. We are advising players to purchase their tickets early and to follow public health guidelines while doing so. Don’t forget that tickets can be purchased in-store, on the National Lottery app or at www.lottery.ie.”     Meanwhile, there was no winner of last night’s €,, EuroMillions jackpot which means that Friday’s jackpot is now set to roll to a massive € million.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Local NewsWhale carcass on County Derry beach is posing a health risk overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsJudge orders top Derry cop to court overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Road works have been causing dficulties in Dungiven.Local NewsCalls for County Derry roadworks to be suspended overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsHospital fundraiser launched after death of popular County Derry businessman overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSerious sexual assault on woman in County Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out  About at foam party in Dormans Bar, Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out  About at foam party in Dormans Bar, Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Constable Michael Ferguson, , was shot dead in Derry in January, .DerryNowMan arrested in Derry for  murder of policeman Michael Ferguson overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMuch-needed resurfacing completed on County Derry road overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia WATCH: Blah, blah, blah - Greta Thunberg blasts world leaders for climate inactionNational NewsWATCH: Blah, blah, blah - Greta Thunberg blasts world leaders for climate inaction overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out  About at foam party in Dormans Bar, Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out  About at foam party in Dormans Bar, Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Pic by George Sweeney, nwpresspicsReporter: Gary Ferry Sept Email: gary@derrynews.net  addthis, Derry City  Longford Town  Goals from Jamie McGonigle, James Akintunde and Junior Ogedi-Uzokwe earned Derry City a comfortable win over Longford to move within three points of Sligo Rovers in third place. In a one-sided game, the Candystripes were too strong for the visitors. A fairly low-key start at the Brandywell ended when Derry City took the lead on  minutes. It was entirely preventable from a Longford point of view as Eoin Toal’s high ball forward was flicked on by Junior Ogedi-Uzokwe into the path of defender Joseph Manley. The centre-half hesitated however and Jamie McGonigle took advantage, charging the ball down and racing clear to finish past Lee Steacy for his second goal in a week. googletag.cmd.push It was all Derry City and they doubled their lead just before the half hour mark. This time McGonigle turned provider, as his ball in from the right picked out Will Fitzgerald in the area, and his touch set up James Akintunde, whose shot from  yards took a big deflection off a Longford leg to wrongfoot Steacy who could only watch as the ball rolled past him into the net. The Longford goalkeeper got his own slice of luck moments later as the Candystripes threatened to finish the game as a contest. Junior looked a touch ambitious when he lined up a free kick  yards from goal, but it was spilled by Steacy into the path of McGonigle, who would surely have made it - had an awkward bounce not taken the ball away from him at the crucial moment. The dynamic of a comfortable game almost changed just minutes into the second half when Darragh Nugent burst forward from midfield, into the area and around Nathan Gartside, but shanked his effort wide and over of the open goal.     That was as good as it got for Longford however, and Derry got their third goal nine minutes from time. Evan McLaughlin’s pass picked out the run of Danny Lafferty in behind the visitors’ defence, and although his volley was brilliantly parried by Steacy, the ball fell for Junior, whose shot into the ground bounced over the goalkeeper and into the net for -.  DERRY CITY: Gartside, Lafferty, McJannett, Toal, Boyce , Harkin , Hery , Fitzgerald , McGonigle , Akintunde, Ogedi-Uzokwe.

Duffy first appeared under Declan Devine in , but didn’t become a regular until a year later. It wasn’t until he played regularly under Peter Hutton however that Duffy hit the headlines, with  goals in the  season, which earned him his move to Glasgow Celtic. googletag.cmd.push Today, we look back on Duffy’s best five moment in a Derry City shirt:  First goal vs. Shelbourne It was no surprise that Duffy began to make giant strides with the first team in  and he soon made his mark with his first senior goal away at Shelbourne on June , the young striker firing the ball ferociously into the roof of the net past Niall Burdon to ensure a - victory at Tolka Park. Double at Dalymount Derry City were struggling for consistency in the league, but cup success seemed plausible, even more so after Duffy’s brace at Dalymount Park sent the Candy Stripes into the League Cup semi-finals. Europa League statement Aberystwyth lost - at the Brandywell in their first leg Europa League tie in July, but still claimed they were on a par with Derry City, with a red card the only reason they had lost so emphatically. Proving a point, Derry went out and hammered them - in theleg, with Duffy scoring amidst a - win . The score line was also the highest ever recorded for an Irish side in European football history. Duffy and his team mates had made their point.     First hat trick Despite the disappointment of Europa league elimination against Shakytor Soligorsk, July,  ended on a high note for Derry City as they thrashed UCD - in Dublin. It was a game memorable for Michael Duffy’s first senior hat trick, three terric and confident finishes which added to the growing reputation of the youngster. Rovers’ downfall The FAI Cup semi-final replay at the Brandywell in  was hugely dramatic. After Rory Patterson had missed a late penalty, the game seemed to be headed to extra time until Duffy struck in the very last minute of the game. The forward reacted first to steer the loose ball past Barry Murphy and into the Rovers goal to send the Brandywell wild.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Local NewsWhale carcass on County Derry beach is posing a health risk overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsJudge orders top Derry cop to court overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Road works have been causing dficulties in Dungiven.Local NewsCalls for County Derry roadworks to be suspended overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsHospital fundraiser launched after death of popular County Derry businessman overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSerious sexual assault on woman in County Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out  About at foam party in Dormans Bar, Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out  About at foam party in Dormans Bar, Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Constable Michael Ferguson, , was shot dead in Derry in January, .DerryNowMan arrested in Derry for  murder of policeman Michael Ferguson overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMuch-needed resurfacing completed on County Derry road overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia WATCH: Blah, blah, blah - Greta Thunberg blasts world leaders for climate inactionNational NewsWATCH: Blah, blah, blah - Greta Thunberg blasts world leaders for climate inaction overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out  About at foam party in Dormans Bar, Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out  About at foam party in Dormans Bar, Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Duffy first appeared under Declan Devine in , but didn’t become a regular until a year later. It wasn’t until he played regularly under Peter Hutton however that Duffy hit the headlines, with  goals in the  season, which earned him his move to Glasgow Celtic. googletag.cmd.push Today, we look back on Duffy’s best five moment in a Derry City shirt:  First goal vs. Shelbourne It was no surprise that Duffy began to make giant strides with the first team in  and he soon made his mark with his first senior goal away at Shelbourne on June , the young striker firing the ball ferociously into the roof of the net past Niall Burdon to ensure a - victory at Tolka Park. Double at Dalymount Derry City were struggling for consistency in the league, but cup success seemed plausible, even more so after Duffy’s brace at Dalymount Park sent the Candy Stripes into the League Cup semi-finals. Europa League statement Aberystwyth lost - at the Brandywell in their first leg Europa League tie in July, but still claimed they were on a par with Derry City, with a red card the only reason they had lost so emphatically. Proving a point, Derry went out and hammered them - in theleg, with Duffy scoring amidst a - win . The score line was also the highest ever recorded for an Irish side in European football history. Duffy and his team mates had made their point.     First hat trick Despite the disappointment of Europa league elimination against Shakytor Soligorsk, July,  ended on a high note for Derry City as they thrashed UCD - in Dublin. It was a game memorable for Michael Duffy’s first senior hat trick, three terric and confident finishes which added to the growing reputation of the youngster. Rovers’ downfall The FAI Cup semi-final replay at the Brandywell in  was hugely dramatic. After Rory Patterson had missed a late penalty, the game seemed to be headed to extra time until Duffy struck in the very last minute of the game. The forward reacted first to steer the loose ball past Barry Murphy and into the Rovers goal to send the Brandywell wild.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Local NewsWhale carcass on County Derry beach is posing a health risk overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsJudge orders top Derry cop to court overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Road works have been causing dficulties in Dungiven.Local NewsCalls for County Derry roadworks to be suspended overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsHospital fundraiser launched after death of popular County Derry businessman overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSerious sexual assault on woman in County Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out  About at foam party in Dormans Bar, Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out  About at foam party in Dormans Bar, Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Constable Michael Ferguson, , was shot dead in Derry in January, .DerryNowMan arrested in Derry for  murder of policeman Michael Ferguson overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMuch-needed resurfacing completed on County Derry road overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia WATCH: Blah, blah, blah - Greta Thunberg blasts world leaders for climate inactionNational NewsWATCH: Blah, blah, blah - Greta Thunberg blasts world leaders for climate inaction overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out  About at foam party in Dormans Bar, Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out  About at foam party in Dormans Bar, Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Any chemistry student is automatically tutored in such hazards, the campaignersrsquo letter continues.ldquoThis is not a new subject and CIL , had it been so worried about it, should have acted decades ago on the mercury issue. Your concerns now ring hollow and you are using the issue to pursue your own interests in the modernisation of lighthouses.Campaigners have asked CIL to provide evidence of what training was given to lighthouse keepers in mercury usage and what so-called Material Safety Data Sheets on mercury were and are supplied to lighthouses in its jurisdiction.They say they are not impressed with CILrsquos progress when it comes to environmental heritage matters, pointing to the many changes which have taken place at St Johnrsquos Point over the years, including a reduction in use of the borm Fresnel lens to single lens and the removal of the original mechanics that powered the rotating lens.Other changes highlighted by campaigners included the abolition of keepers and attendants and the planned reduction in maintenance of the Killough stationrsquos walls and outbuildings.The letter continues: ldquoWhilst several of these changes may be understandable, you go too far with the removal of the heritage rotation system and in the employment of LED as the light source. You must surely be aware of thegrowing concerns in the environmental community worldwide about LED lighting.ldquoThe Lecale Lightkeepers will further resist your plans for St Johnrsquos Point, but we urge you to take note of the facts and of the strong local opposition to your plan.Campaigners say they are prepared to cooperate with CIL and others in developing suitable preservation plans for the historic lighthouse, including the engine room, while the organisation maintain itrsquo important role as an Aid to Navigation.Their letter adds: ldquoKeeping the existing lens rotation system and a health and safety review of your LED plans are, however, prerequisites to our cooperation..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29September2021-GoDigital.jpg","title":"Downe U3A members enjoy fun day out  ","story":"MEMBERS of Downe UA had a marvellous and unusual day out at Crawfordrsquos Rock, near Kilkeel, recently.Local businesswoman Michelle Wilson took them, armed with collecting bags, on a foraging trip along the shore.She pointed out the dferent types of seaweed, telling which of them are best for cooking, which are ingredients of skin care products and which she recommended for a healthy seaweed bath.With their collected seaweeds the group then retreated to a gazebo on the shore where they were served up some shlauch mdash or shlucht mdash seaweed with seaweed bread and cod roe.This was followed by many courses of local produce, langoustines, mussels, crab toes, haddock landed fresh in Kilkeel that morning, then steak, potatoes, seaweed and chilli chocolate, ending with Crawfords Rock Seaweed Companyrsquos award-winning peppermint and kombu tea.The group agreed that it had been a day to remember.

centre and be up and running within the next few years.News of the shock decision to abort the Dunleath Park scheme was confirmed at a meeting in the town on Monday night when it was revealed that for legal and financial reasons, developing the facility at this location was simply not a viable option.If the council forged ahead with the plan for Dunleath Park, it would have to pay compensation to Dunleath Estates, based on the current commercial value of the land required to house the new cinema and associated parking.Alternatively,the existing lease is amended to allow the construction of the cinema, around one third of the income would have to be paid to Dunleath Estates with the remainder of the cash used specically for the playing fields, in keeping with stipulations laid down by the

now has no idea what the future hold and fears what may happen when winter sets in and he has no help to light his fire in the morning.Local community worker Billy Walker, who is fighting the decision

Championship campaign with an impressive win over last yearrsquos runners-up Carryduff on a sun-drenched Saturday evening.Despite being considered slight underdogs before the contest, the green and white outfit proved they were anything but as they found the back of the net three times in the opening half.Goals from Oran Cunninghamand captain Conor McGrady put the Hoops too far in front at the interval, with the Carryduff men left frustrated at their missed chances.There was a notable turnout at the Darragh Cross venue, with waves of supporters from both sides allowing their voices to be heard throughout the duration of the match.Despite Carryduff winning the throw-in, it was Downpatrick who opened the scoring through a Jarlath Brannigan free after three minutes had been played.Brannigan doubled his tally just two minutes later in what was a determined start from the Hoops.However, this would be no stroll in the park as Josh Connery dummied his marker to send Carryduffrsquos first effort over the bar after some silky work from team-mate Owen McCabe.Downpatrick goalkeeper and joint captain James Deeny displayed pin-point accuracy with his kick-outs countless times throughout the match but perhaps needed the opening minutes to settle any nerves.A wayward punt upfield was gobbled up by Carryduffrsquos Pearse McCabe who relayed the ball quickly to Cian Clinton to level the scores.Caolan Mooney made his presence known with his usual rapid pace and precision. The former Rostrevor and current county player drew a foul before Conor McCarron calmly converted to put Downpatrick back in front.It was Carryduffrsquos turn to showcase their county talent as Daniel Guinness again levelled the tie with an emphatic point before captain Joe McFlynn swung the match back in their favour.However, with a minute to go to the first water-break Downpatrick got the reward for their relentless work in the middle of the park.McGrady and Mooney swarmed the Carryduff midfield with a barrage of tackles before some quick passing allowed the ball to enter into the hands of Downpatrickrsquos young forward Oran Cunningham.The Downpatrick number  made no mistake in blasting his effort past opposing lsquokeeper Mark Hynes to give his side a two-point lead.This advantage didnrsquot last until the quarter as Carryduff replied with two well-taken scores to bring the contest even.A few wides from both sides were observed after the water-break before Conor Doherty curled his left-footed free in-between the posts for Downpatrick.With  minutes played on the clock it was Cunningham again who would prove the major dference after his long-ranged effort looped over the head of Hynes and into the back of the net to double his tally.Hynes could be excused for this as Cunninghamrsquos effort struck most around the pitch as a cross rather than an attempt at goal.Nevertheless, Carryduff kept plugging away and answered with a James Guinness point.Conor McGrady saw his effort at goal crowded out by the determined opposing defenders before Gerdie Collins saw his effort drt over the bar to restore Downpatrickrsquos four-point lead.Mooney pointed again for the Hoops before McGrady added his sidersquos third goal of the half after the green and white forward line took advantage of a defensive mix-up.Daniel Guinness tried to rally his team as best as he could, soloing past three RGU shirts before registering the final point of the half. Half-time: Downpatrick - Carryduff -.Whatever the management team of Paddy Doherty, Shane OrsquoNeill and DJ Morgan told their Carryduff side during the interval must have struck a chord as they started the second half with clear intent.Despite a James Guinness wide, points from McCabe and McFlynn chipped away at the deficit for the purple, gold and black side.Cunningham was unlucky not to hit a hat-trick of goals after his lobbed effort was fantastically cleared of the line by Daniel Coogan.RGU followed this up with two efforts which both veered wide, before McFlynn again pointed for Carryduff leaving the score - to - in favour of the Downpatrick side at the second water-break.It was clear that legs were beginning to tire in the final quarter after a gruelling physical showing from both teams meant more and more chances went begging.Downpatrick finally registered their first point of the second half through another Doherty free.Carryduff refused to go quietly and were given added encouragement when RGUrsquos Tim Prenter was shown a black card with five minutes remaining.However, the frustration continued for both Carryduff and James Guinness as his effort veered wide of the target again.Deeny was rewarded for keeping his concentration after making an impressive save with his feet to deny Carryduff a certain goal in the dying moments of the game, although he could do nothing about the converted free a minute later.Mooney fisted over the bar in the next run of play for Downpatrick before Carryduff substitute Joe Tunney completed the scoring in the last passage of play.After the match, Downpatrick manager Aidan Robinson reflected on his sidersquos winning performance.ldquoIn the first half we worked incredibly hard, we turned the ball over a lot at the halfway line which we got a lot of scores from and we managed to get the goals, he said.ldquoWe built a good  for ourselves and spoke at half-time about kicking on from that, but we didnrsquot really manage to.ldquoI think in the third quarter of the game we were pretty flat and Carryduff got back into the tie, but we got over the line and we will learn from that.He added: ldquoIrsquom very happy with the result and very happy to be in the next round.Downpatrick: J Deeny, E Rooney, A Doherty, R Murphy, T Smyth, J Bell, C Doherty, D Turley, C McCarron, T Prenter, G Collins, C McGrady, J Brannigan, P Turley, C Mooney.Subs: A Og Robinson, M Fitzpatrick, O Cunningham, S Bell, T Loudon, T McNeill, N Cunningham, D Brannf, T Savage, C Boyd, R Og Quinn, C Farrell, R Quinn.Carryduff: M Hynes, D Coogan, C Cassidy, C McCullagh, L Toal, J Connery, D Guinness, B Cox, P McCabe, O McCabe, J McFlynn, C Clinton, S McGonigle, R Beatty, J Guinness.Subs: T Connery, M McGrath, P McConnell, C Sherry, R Reilly, C Cunningham, R Boyle, J Tunney, M Lawson, C Rooney, J Henry, D Connelly, D Connor.Downpatrick -Carryduff -MORGAN FUELS SFC ST ROUND.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22September2021-Joanne.jpg","title":"Joanne organising event to thank Air Ambulance staff  ","story":"A LOCAL show jumper is organising a fund-raising campaign as her way of saying thank you to the Air Ambulance.Joanne Clough was airlted to hospital after suffering a serious head injury. A year on, she has launched the lsquoHorse Powered Take Offrsquo campaign and competition to raise vital funds for Air Ambulance NI.On September  last year Joanne was competing in a show jumping competition at Ardnacashel Equestrian Centre near Comber, when a serious accident meant she needed urgent medical care.Joanne was warming up on her horse, Juno, when the horse seemed to become spooked and jolted, then began bucking uncontrollably, throwing her from the saddle. As she fell to the ground, Joanne hit her head on a brick wall.Joanne, who lives near Crossgar, said: ldquoI have no memory of the event and apparently lost consciousness. Having spoken to others, I know that the show at Ardnacashel was then stopped, and the organisers along with first aiders on site came to my side and called for an ambulance.ldquoEveryone was really supportive and helpful to ensure myself, my horse, my helper and my seven year-old daughter, Erin were looked after.The Air Ambulance carrying the Helicopter Emergency Medical Service Teamlanded in the fields beside Ardnacashel. The team treated Joanne at the scene before transferring her to the Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast.Joanne remained in the hospital for the next  hours, having tests for potential brain injuries, which were even more pertinent as Joanne had undergone brain surgery to remove a tumour in August .Joanne sustained three fractures to her cheek, damaged the iris of her right eye, resulting in blurred vision, and lost her short-term memory for a couple of months due to severe concussion.It has been a long road to recovery, but now Joanne is starting to feel back to normal. She said: ldquoThe scars and fractures on my face have healed, along with the fatigue, weakness and confusion, but my balance remains something that I am continuing investigations for as my eyesight remains imperfect.ldquoMost importantly for a horsey girl, Juno has been treated for pre-existing injury in the sacroiliac joint in her back, which had caused her to react the way she did on the day. After a sincere apology from her, I am slowly gaining trust and confidence in her again in the saddle.Joanne continued: ldquoThere are no words to describe the gratitude I feel for the assistance of the Air Ambulance NI team and crew that day. Had they not acted so quickly, treated me with such level-headed efficiency and taken me to the hospital so swtly, I have no idea how I might have ended up.ldquoA head injury cannot be underestimated and to have been saved from potential disaster by the medical team in this way is a miraculous success. I owe them my everything and to demonstrate my gratitude, I am running a nationwide equestrian campaign and competition to raise awareness and funds for Air Ambulance NI. Thank you so much to the Air Ambulance team mdash you are amazing.With the recent easing of restrictions, Joanne was recently able to visit the Air Ambulance NI airbase and meet with representatives of the medical team.Joanne is encouraging the entire Equestrian Community to support her campaign. You can do so by Supporting the Horse Powered Take Off competition via https:dragoncompetitions product horse-powered-take-off .Including Ambulance NI in your horse show, such as by making a small donation from ticket sales.Organising your own lsquoHorse Powered Take Offrsquo event, such as a cake sale, tea party, sponsored give away, or hack and snack.Working alongside Dragon competitions, Joannersquos competition will run throughout September and October and she has secured some fabulous prizes, including an equine bundle worth pound, from Fane Valley, pound, in cash and a horse solarium worth pound from R Nesbit Paddock Equipment. The winners will be drawn on October  by Dragon Competitions.Grace Williams, Area Fundraising Manager for Air Ambulance NI, said: ldquoWe are so inspired that Joanne has made a great recovery. Patients are at the centre of everything we do, and it is always lovely when patient families choose to get in touch.ldquoWe are humbled she decided to support the of wonderful work of Air Ambulance NI through her equestrian competition and campaign.ldquoAs a service we rely heavily on charitable donations to keep the medical team in the air, delivering critical care to patients who have suffered trauma throughout Northern Ireland.

For that particular scene, we approached Kilmore Coach Hire who drove us around the village until we got what we needed.The cast and crew also filmed inside Bright Parish Church before they set off to allow a christening to take place.ldquoWe were lucky the farmer who owned the surrounding fields was so generous in allowing us to film, as well as the church minister, said Declan.ldquoIt was kindness such as this from the locals which allowed us to make this happen.The McIlmail duo were not the only local faces who appeared in the award winning short, as Newcastlersquos Sandra Brown portrays lsquoMaggiersquo and Crossgarrsquos Chris Heath takes up the role of lsquoEamonrsquo.Notably, not all of these cast members have actually met each other in person. Due to the restrictions in place, actors only metthey were in the same scene.Declanrsquos cousin, Aroacuten Holden from Downpatrick, was the editor for the film who helped piece each scene together. Aroacuten also introduced Declan to a number of others who assisted in creating the short, and therefore was referred to as ldquoan invaluable help by the young director.The short continues to enter numerous film festivals in the hopes of adding more honours, including ceremonies in England, Scotland and the USA.Meanwhile, Declan is currently directing a new featurefilm based in Belfast named lsquoThe Trick Roomrsquo, which entails the story of a cross-community cricket team.To keep up to date with the latest news surrounding Shine, visit @shine_shortfilm on Instagram or check out https:www.imdb title tt ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22September2021-Jockeys.jpg","title":"Locals among the prizes at Downpatrick meeting  ","story":"IT was a good day for local owners and trainers at Fridayrsquos penultimate meeting of the year at Downpatrick.They were successful in three of the seven races on the card, that featured four over hurdles, two chases and a bumper.

When Seamus passed away Corinne had horses in her own name or as part of a syndicate. She was a well known figure at local point-to-points in her wax coat and wellies, often accompanied by her dogs and daughter Peita.Another great loss to local racing.

There is also the potential to add morethey are required.While three options have been drawn up, members of the local authorityrsquos Active and Healthy Communities Committee favour one that involves reconfiguring a meeting room and foyer into one large, open space with a new extension to the front to a  square metre multi-purpose room.In addition, two changing rooms are to be knocked into one with a  square metre kitchen area.A third changing room is to be converted to provide a so-called changing places toilet and there is also a store area for the meeting area.Asking the public for its view mdash which must be submitted online by Wednesday, September  mdash council officials say they recognise there is a need renovate the existing centre to meet current demands and services the community expects.In addition, Rowallane area councillors have highlighted concerns that currently, only one activity can take place at the centre at a time due to the current layout. They also recognise the need to offer additional space for extra activities.As part of the consultation process, residents are asked to complete a small online questionnaire, with all information used by the council to determine the best way forward.News of the proposal to upgrade the community centre comes after the local authority was asked to address its under investment in the market town and ensure that enhancing leisure facilities was a critical component of its future investment plans.Earlier this year, the need for ultra-modern leisure provision topped the agenda during an online meeting between local politicians and senior council officials who were asked to examine the potential of extending and upgrading the existing community centre at Windmill Street or a complete new-build, potentially on available land at the townrsquos Langley Road or at the Newcastle Road.Major new leisure provision has recently been provided across the council area, including Downpatrick, Saintfield and Newry, with plans in the pipeline for signicant investment in new leisure services in Newcastle.Politicians say that while Ballynahinch has missed out on major local authority investment over recent years, the organisation needs to address this now to cater for the needs of local people and sporting organisations.They argued that the current community centre needs major improvement or potentially replaced and that funding must be earmarked to allow this to happen.Politicians say itrsquos vital that Ballynahinch is a key part of any future council strategy when it comes to leisure activities.Several councillors believe the current Ballynahinch Centre requires signicant investment to meet the needs of local people and while many favour a new-build, they recognise that this is unlikely in the short to medium term.Moving forward, they say Ballynahinch cannot be left behind given that it has missed out on major funding for a signicant number of years and that ratepayers in the town and surrounding area deserve nothing less.The consultation closes at pm on Wednesday, September  and to take part, log on at https:tinyurl uejtmpc.

But not long ago there was strong Eurosceptical sentiment south of the borderThe ‘It’ in question being his Holy Grail-like obsession to create a pan-European army.In the middle of last week the French President once more floated the idea of an EU-wide military force of around , personnel. This time around Macron’s recooked proposal was prompted by the sting of betrayal after the Australians reneged on a deal to buy French submarines opting instead to purchase American made subs. This switch by the Aussies was in large part due to Down Under joining a new military alliance in the Pacic alongside the United States and the UK.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Henry McDonald is a formerand Observer Ireland correspondent and author of books including a biography of David Trimble and INLA: Deadly DivisionsIf Macron’s dream of an alternative European army ever does become reality there is one nation within the EU family of nations he definitely cannot rely on: the Republic of Ireland.The corner stone of Irish foreign policyis military neutrality. Ireland never joined Nato although it has a long and commendable record in sending its military around the world on UN peacekeeping duties. None the less the odds of the Irish Defence Forces providing recruits to a new pan EU army in the foreseeable future are remote.Amid all the gushing, uncritical public discourse in the Republic regarding all things EU these days it is worth remembering that not very long ago there was a powerful Eurosceptical sentiment south of the border. Twelve years ago, in the first referendum on the Lisbon Treaty Irish voters rejected the treaty by .% as opposed to .% who backed the drive towards greater EU integration.One of the principal reasons why Ireland initially voted No was over fears about threats to Irish neutrality and concern about conscription into a European army. Although it was debatableLisbon actually entailed any compulsion to join an EU military force the spectre of it was enough to chill a signicant segment of the Irish electorate.The Dublin government at the time sought to allay these fears but also make the Irish vote again in a second referendum, which was in itself a massive anti-democratic con trick. As someone who reported from the frontline of the later protests against EU imposed austerity measures on the Republic after the Celtic Tiger collapsed and the state headed towards national bankruptcy I often wonder what that second vote would have beenit had been held in the middle of the economic shock treatment being applied from Brussels, Frankfurt, Berlin and the IMF.During those days of protests in  and  I followed tens of thousands marching through Dublin demonstrating against the EU and European Central Bank’s austerity-imposed cuts on Irish public services. I can still hear the speeches from public commentators denouncing the bureaucrats in Brussels, Angela Merkel in Berlin and the bankers at the ECB in Frankfurt on s such as one outside the GPO in O’Connell Street. It’s funny to listen to some of these same voices now in the post-Brexit era lavishing their praise and support on the EU while engaging in some old-fashioned Brit-bashing.In Northern Ireland too there are lots of these voices articulating a misty eyed, sentimental longing to be back in the EU. Nationalists meanwhile are using the enticement of EUas an argument someone for a United Ireland wrapped inside a reunited Europe. As someone who didn’t actually vote for Brexit I am still perplexed over the suspension of critical faculties when it comes to what the EU does in practice as opposed to its rhetoric.Having reported  years ago during that Holy Week of negotiations leading to the Belfast Agreement I cannot recall and none of my colleagues from the time can either the letters E and U being mentioned. Aside from peripheral peace building projects and welcome structural funding, the EU was not a major player in the torturous discussions that eventually created the Good Friday Agreement. Their interference post Brexit in Northern Ireland’s politics and in particular the imposition of the Protocolhowever has the potential to unravel that settlement.For its own economic and strategic interests the EU has used Northern Ireland as a means to punish Britain for leaving the union. By doing so it has generated a widespread perception across the unionist community that the EU is now in league with one side in a ided society – Irish nationalism, north and south. Before Brexit the EU at least had a positive reputation for being neutral on the Northern Ireland question.Irish foreign policy neutrality will undoubtedly prevail evenPresident Macron ever gets his way and establishes his EU army. With the imposition of an Irish Sea Border and the refusal, at least so far, of Brussels to compromise on frontier checks including even medicines EU neutrality in Northern Ireland no longer exists. • Henry McDonald Sep : Row involving President Higgins confirms that those who want a tolerant Ireland are being marginalised• Ben Lowry Sep : Colum Eastwood is right to say that vaccine passports allow us to open up• Ruth Dudley Edwards Sep : New NIO minister is a Gay Catholic Tory who will listen to unionist fears• Owen Polley Sep : Dublin would be horriedfaced with an all-Ireland state• Other articles by Henry McDonald below, beneath that information on how to subscribe to the News Letter:• Henry McDonald Sep : Journalists should shun this Dublin-funded study into how the media uses language• Henry McDonald Sep : The cross border policing pursuit plan has not been thought through• Henry McDonald Aug : INLA’s biggest propaganda coup since Wright murder• Henry McDonald Aug : Irish nationalists can’t rely on Biden, as Kabul shows——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Please try again later.Submitting...While the proposal was backed by Alliance minister Naomi Long, it was voted down by the other Executive ministers, including Mr Swann.Those ministers instead voted to issue guidance to the venues, which include theatres and indoor concert venues, recommending the use of proof of vaccine as one entry requirement.SDLP leader Colum Eastwood branded the decision as “astounding and reckless”.The health minister said he did not back the proposal to make passports mandatory for indoor seated venues because such a scheme was “neither agreed nor ready”.He said the Executive would have been “ridiculed”it had told businesses fearful about the end of the furlough scheme that ministers had decided to mandate a vaccine passport system that was not ready to use.The issue is set to come to a head again next week when ministers consider whether to remove the one-metre social distancing requirement for hospitality venues.The DUP has consistently voiced concern about any move to introduce vaccine passports, citing potential human rights and equality issues.It has also emerged that Mr Swann wrote to all ministers on Saturday expressing frustration that the Executive Office’s Covid- task force had still not produced a policy paper on the issue, five months after he asked for the work to be done.In the letter, seen by the PA news agency, Mr Swann wrote: “I would ask as a matter of urgency that the TEO paper on domestic use certication be brought to the Executive without further delay.”In a statement yesterday, he added: “I want a domestic vaccine certication scheme to be in place, on the books, available for use as soon as necessary.“It is regrettable that the Executive has yet to agree a policy position on this. I wrote to Executive ministers as far back as April  asking for this matter to be taken forward by TEOthrough the creation of a cross-departmental working group.“We have waited for the Covid Task Force to pick up the ball and run with this. It is central to the task force’s entire purpose – charting a pathway out of restrictions.”Mr Swann said a passport system could be voluntary in the first instance with the option to make it mandatorythat was necessary.“If we can get a domestic scheme agreed – with the necessary regulations and technology in place – it gives us both options and opportunities, new tools to userequired,” he said.  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularDublin and Brussels ‘changing their tune’ on Northern Ireland Protocol: Sir Jeffrey DonaldsonFormer IRA ‘folk hero’ is ‘hardly fitting face for Amnesty International campaign’ say unionistsRuth Dudley Edwards: President Michael Higgins should say sorry for his Northern Ireland centenary snub or resignFuel shortage: Does Northern Ireland have a petrol and diesel shortage, and why is fuel running out in the UK William and Kate follow Bond premiere with visit to Northern IrelandMost PopularWilliam and Kate follow Bond premiere with visit to Northern IrelandEx UDR soldier: I would never have missed the fine th anniversary tribute parade in Lisburn to an almost forgotten armyNorthern Ireland Office did not follow own rules on ‘equality screening’ for Troubles legacy plans – new reportWhat is bunny hugging  - Boris Johnson reference mocked by leading climate activist Greta ThunbergThe unionist parties come together to reject the Northern Ireland Protocol, and call for its replacement with arrangements that respect NI’s place in UK                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-kTUwUJ sc-dqBHgY ciFbrr\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperCoronavirusMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

The Minister said: “This is a big day in the roll-out of the High Street Scheme. I am delighted to announce that the portal for applications for the Spend Local card has now opened.” The Minister once again reminded applicants that the portal will remain open until October  and that there will be enough time for everyone to apply, receive and use their Spend Local card. Applicants can register for their card at http:nidirect.gov.uk spend-local He said: “Around . million people are entitled to apply for their Spend Local card, so we expect the portal to be extremely busy in the first few days. That is why it is important to remember that the portal will be open for four weeks and that everyone will have enough time to apply for their card. So please be patient.” The Minister reminded applicants to have their key information to hand when they come to apply. For verication purposes, all applicants will be asked to provide their name address age gender disability status National Insurance number email address and telephone number. He said: “Please ensure that you have all your required information ready when you apply, including your National Insurance number and driving licenceyou have one. There will be enough time for everyone to apply, receive and use their Spend Local card. The applications portal is robust and ready and it will be able to handle over . million applications over the course of the four-week period. But we expect early demand to be extremely high. Therefore, by being patient and ready with your information, you will be helping yourself and everybody .” Minister Lyons also warned people to be wary of scams and emphasised that the Department will never ask anyone for their personal banking details. He said: “Unfortunately, there are unscrupulous iniduals who will look for every opportunity to steal from others.
