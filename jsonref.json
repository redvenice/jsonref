Video: AccuWeather\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Chicago River as it winds its way through downtown after being dyed green. Photograph: Scott OlsonGetty ImagesIf you suffer from chlorophobia (fear of the colour green), downtown Chicago is not the place to be around St Patrick’s Day. But if you happen to be a chlorophobic unionist, it must be a nightmare.The worst part is the mysterious powder with which the locals famously dye the river every year. It starts out orange, of all colours, before being miraculously transformed on contact with the water. Then, before you can say “Mary Lou McDonald”, the orange turns to a green so intense, especially when the sun shines on it, it’s like the 40 shades combined.Not even the most devout Catholic nationalists in Chicago would claim the river contains holy water. But the formula for the dye, said to be vegetable-based, environmentally friendly, and of a kind once used by plumbers for detecting leaks, is the closely kept secret of two local families, the Rowans and the Butlers, who have been performing this sacrament for more than half a century.So it retains an air of mystery, even though the process is itself an annual spectacle. Three hours before the St Patrick’s parade, two boats take to the river, the first crew distributing “40 pounds” of the magic powder, the second mixing it. It takes a while to achieve the perfect consistency. But the boat crews know their trade, and by the time the marchers pass, the effect is at its height.Toxic substanceBack at the start of the parade this year, meanwhile, there was another colour change – subtle but noticeable – going on. It affected the demeanour of the official Irish delegation, who were left red-faced by the unforeseen addition of a toxic substance called “Conor McGregor” to the guests of honour.McGregor absorbs attention in the US like the Chicago river absorbs powder, so the official VIP Leo Varadkar was badly upstaged. The box-office mismatch aside, the Taoiseach was also forced into uncomfortably proximity with a man who seems ever-more intent on justifying the nickname “Notorious”.At one point, only the Chicago mayor, Rahm Emanuel (who may have had some explaining to do), separated his two guests. Thereafter, the number of buffers grew to something more comfortable.Varadkar was diplomatic about the encounter afterwards. Asked how he felt about McGregor representing Ireland in the parade, he showed deft footwork, worthy of the fighter himself. McGregor was not representing Ireland, he said: “That’s kind of what I was doing.”He was back on safer ground by then, or rather water, as guest of a river boat tour hosted by Tourism Ireland. Having launched the boat, they also launched a book called Ireland’s Greening of the World, marking 10 years of the ingenious national marketing campaign by which multiple global landmarks are colonised by coloured lighting every March 17th, at very little cost.This year the list included everything from the Leaning Tower of Pisa to Dubai’s Burj al Arab. But the piece de resistance, arguably, was the stuff by now under Varadkar, and all around him.Picture yourself in a boat on a river, rendered bright green by a tangerine dye. The effect was psychedelic. With the sun glinting on the water, and off the surrounding skyscrapers (including the local Trump Tower), it was like an Irish-themed LSD trip: Leo in the Sky with Diamonds.An Irish weddingAn experience of a rather earthier kind had awaited the Taoiseach when he was chief guest at the annual Irish Fellowship of Chicago dinner the night before. His speech included a joke about the belated official pardon for Mrs O’Leary’s Cow, long blamed for starting the great fire of Chicago, which Varadkar then developed into a serious point about the scapegoating of immigrants generally.But it was not an occasion for subtlety. Speakers had to shout to be heard by the huge, raucous gathering. Only the priest who gave the pre-dinner invocation was heard in silence. Otherwise it was like the advanced stages of a very large Irish wedding, or wake. Or both. The Taoiseach would have needed a loudhailer to be heard.Long-time observers thought the occasion more suited to the oratorical talents of Michael Ring, who was also part of the visiting delegation. He was not among the speech-makers, but he was certainly in his element. Noting the high numbers of Mayo emigrants present, and in Chicago generally, he was even thinking of a late career change. “If I ran for mayor here, I’d be elected,” he told us afterwards. We had no trouble believing it."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Cuvier\u0026rsquos beaked whale showed signs of starvation, dehydration and had been vomiting bloodCountry also hit by earthquake, triggering landslip that hit popular waterfall on LombokSuspect Brenton Tarrant (28) understood to have held firearms licence and five gunsSite to remove any clip of gunman\u0026rsquos footage even if it would not normally break its rulesAt least 50 dead after gunman opened fire in two mosques in ChristchurchAustralian politicians call on social media companies to do more to prevent violent content after live stream of attack went viralMosque shooting survivor chased away the gunman armed only with a credit card machineDeath toll rises to 50 as 36 remain in hospital police have confirmed\u0026lsquoHad it provided details that could have been acted on immediately it would have been\u0026rsquoPrime minister says gun laws will change after 49 are killed in Christchurch mosque shootingsThe country has an estimated 1.5 million firearms in a population of under five millionSocial media company says video was quickly removed after police alerted itPeople in Christchurch describe scenes of carnage after mosque attacks leave 49 deadData shows one of three attackers had planned shooting at least 2 years in advancePrime minister says gun laws will change after country\u0026rsquos worst mass shootingTotal of 49 dead, 48 injured, four arrested and one chargedPeople from Bangladesh, Malaysia, Afghanistan and elsewhere on missing persons listOwnership of unregistered military-style \u0026lsquoassault weapons\u0026rsquo legal for those over 16Diplomat says Washington threw away a golden opportunity at Hanoi summit last monthFrightening how well online community worked in Christchurch gunman\u0026rsquos favour"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3829663.1552855121!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit no vote on deal this week without dup and erg support","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds, with fellow MP Emma Little-Pengelly, after speaking to the media outside the Cabinet Office. Photograph: Henry NichollsReutersTheresa May will not put her Brexit deal to a vote at Westminster this week unless the DUP and hard-line Conservative Brexiteers agree to support it, two of her top ministers have warned.Chancellor of the exchequer Philip Hammond and international trade secretary Liam Fox said there would be no point in bringing the deal back for a third vote unless the government was confident of winning.“We’re not just going to keep presenting it if we haven’t moved the dial. But what’s happened since last Tuesday is that a significant number of colleagues, including some very prominent ones who’ve gone public, have changed their view on this and decided that the alternatives are so unpalatable to them that they, on reflection, think that the prime minister’s deal is the best way to deliver Brexit,” Mr Hammond told the BBC.MPs voted last week to delay Brexit by three months if the House of Commons approves the deal by Wednesday. But Mrs May warned that failure to endorse the deal this week could lead to a much longer delay of anything between nine and 21 months.Talks between the DUP and the UK government are expected to continue on Monday following lengthy meetings during the past few days.The DUP is seeking legal assurances about the temporary nature of the Northern Irish backstop and guarantees from London that regulations in the North will not be allowed to erge further from the rest of the UK without the approval of the Stormont institutions.The party has insisted that it is not talking about “cash” but Mr Hammond declined three times to rule out extra money for Northern Ireland if the DUP backs the deal.“This isn’t about money. It’s about a political assurance,” he said. “We are coming up to a spending review and we will have to look at all budgets, including devolved block-grant budgets.“We hope that once we’ve got Brexit dealt with, we will be able to resume the powersharing executive in Northern Ireland, and then of course we will need to look at the spending review.”Labour stanceJeremy Corbyn said on Sunday that Labour would support an amendment that would approve Mrs May’s Brexit deal on condition that it could not be implemented without being endorsed in a confirmatory referendum. But he suggested that if the amendment passed, Labour would still vote against the Brexit deal itself in the main motion.“We’re not supporting Theresa May’s deal at all, because we think it’s a blindfold Brexit, which would do enormous damage to our economy,” he told Sky News.In Brussels on Sunday, Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said that if the UK were to seek a lengthy extension, it should be accompanied by a re-evaluation by London of its Brexit approach.Speaking in Chicago at the weekend, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said he would be meeting European Council president Donald Tusk in Dublin on Tuesday, followed by a Cabinet meeting on Wednesday.“At the Cabinet meeting, we will be in a position to sign off on a package of support for business, for farmers, for the agri-food sector, for exporters, for anyone who may be adversely affected by a no-deal Brexit,” he said. “Obviously we are hoping that the deal will be ratified by the House of Commons before then, but if it is not, we are ready.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph:  AFPGetty ImagesPrime minister Theresa May’s Brexit plans were thrown into turmoil on Monday when the speaker of parliament said she could not put her orce deal to a new vote unless it was re-presented in a substantially different form.Speaker John Bercow said the government could not bring forward proposals for a vote that were substantially the same as had already been defeated twice before, in January and last week.According to precedents stretching back to 1604, parliamentary rules say that substantially similar proposals cannot be presented for a vote more than once during the same session of parliament.The pound fell to its day’s low against the euro and the dollar.“This ruling should not be regarded as my last word on the subject,” Bercow said. “It is simply meant to indicate the test which the government must meet, in order for me to rule that a third meaningful vote can legitimately be held in this parliamentary session.”The British government is likely to need to win changes to its Brexit deal with the EU in order to be allowed to put it to a further vote in parliament.Asked by a lawmaker whether further changes to the deal itself would be needed, Mr Bercow said, “in all likelihood, the answer ... is yes”, adding that a change in opinion would not constitute a change in the deal on offer.“Fundamentally, for something to be different, it has to be by definition, fundamentally different. Not different in terms of wording, but different in terms of substance and this is in the context of a negotiation with others outside the United Kingdom, ” he said.Earlier on Monday it had appeared that Mrs May was winning some support for her Brexit deal, but Mr Bercow’s ruling will leave the prime minister scrambling for options.As it stands, Britain is due to leave the EU on March 29th. But parliament has voted for a delay and Mrs May is expected to seek an extension to that deadline when she meets EU leaders at a summit on Thursday.To add to her problems, Mrs May appeared unlikely to reach agreement this week on her Brexit plans with the Democratic Unionists, whose support is vital if she is to get her EU departure deal through parliament.Mrs May had earlier warned lawmakers that unless they approve her Brexit orce pact, Britain’s exit from the EU could face a long delay which many Brexiteers fear would mean Britain may never leave.After two and a half years of negotiations with the EU, the final outcome remains uncertain – with options including a long delay, exiting with Mrs May’s deal, a disorderly exit without a deal or even another EU membership referendum.Mrs May’s blueprint, an attempt to retain close trading and security ties with the EU while leaving the bloc’s formal political structures, was defeated by 230 votes in parliament on January 15th, and by 149 votes on March 12th. – ReutersDeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

The 46 year old offers the politics of feelings.“I don’t have a team counting delegates,” he told Vanity Fair, adding, “It’s probably not the most professional thing you’ve ever heard about this, but I just feel it.”Joe Kennedy built his family’s political myth on good hair, white teeth and glossy star quality. Why shouldn’t Beto?Afterall, during his 2008 campaign, Obama merely went back to Chicago to see Malia perform in The Odyssey. Beto loved the epic so much, he thought about naming his son Odysseus, settling instead for Ulysses.Cult of personalityWandering alone, as Jesus, Barack and Beto did, is part of the hero’s journey defined by Joseph Campbell. Beto loves Joseph Campbell and Star Wars, which was inspired by Campbell’s work.The last One, about the same age when he jumped into national politics precociously aiming to usurp his elders, was also a uniter who went on an odyssey of self-discovery in New York while at Columbia.The last One also sold a cult of personality, offered himself as a symbol of modernity, sparked Oprah’s interest and had a preoccupation with being cool.Indeed, Obama told David Axelrod recently on The Axe Files that Beto reminded him of himself.The One anointing the New One. Joe Biden, pushed aside by Obama in the last election, was understandably irritated.Just as reporters once swooned when Obama made like Jay-Z and brushed imaginary dirt off his shoulder after a tough primary debate in Philly in 2008, reporters were entranced when O’Rourke air-drummed Baba O’Riley by The Who at a Whataburger drive-through after his debate with Cruz.To many, Beto’s appeal is his persona as a quasi-rebellious 1990s suburban teenager, a skateboarding punk rocker who seems to have modelled his campaign logo on the spicy ketchup logo at Whataburger.But others are less charmed. A satirical video on Twitter by skaters mocked “bad-skater Beto” as the kind of middle-school poser who “went to Zumiez and spent $27 on stickers”.‘Psychedelic Warlord’In a new Reuters story, Joseph Menn reveals that while O’Rourke was still a teenager, he was a member of the Cult of the Dead Cow, a stealthy hacking group named after an old Texas slaughterhouse. A kind of Neo-lite, he used the handle “Psychedelic Warlord” looking for free video games. (Socialist alert!)A hacker might be refreshing after a president who refers to Tim Cook as Tim Apple. Still, Menn writes, “it’s unclear whether the United States is ready for a presidential contender who, as a teenager, stole long-distance phone service for his dial-up modem, wrote a murder fantasy in which the narrator drives over children on the street, and mused about a society without money”.The 15th entry in the Democratic race is at the nexus of many tricky issues for a party desperate to oust Inidual 1 from the White House.Is it better to nominate a celebrity like Obama with a slight record that cannot be targeted or someone with established credentials? Should the nominee spring from the far left, the vector brimming with electricity and fight, or is that suicidal in a national election?Can white men jump in, or is this post-#MeToo era the time when Democratic and independent women will demand a woman at the top of the ticket? Will Democratic voters longing for another Obama and the minority voters who strayed from Hillary want an African-American?Can pugilistic progressives stomach a rich kid like Beto at a time when the country is in an eat-the-rich mood? Will they tolerate candidates like Beto and Biden, who speak well of Republicans and have a history of working with them?As the Wall Street Journal reports, O’Rourke tried to please Texas Republican business leaders when he “opposed Obamacare, voted against Nancy Pelosi as the House Democratic leader and called for a raise in the social security eligibility age”.The fever is running high in his party. Will Beto turn out to be born for it or borne away by it?"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/02/10/TELEMMGLPICT000051671687_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqO65TkrT7BriBrd3fK6VEg2oOnP5Tf-6BsL77M1adEXU.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"sir philip green staff told wear revealing clothes visited","story":"Sir Philip Green in 2014 with models, left to right, Suki Waterhouse, Kate Moss, Cara Delevingne, Sienna Miller and Naomi Campbell.

However, a partially crushed pen was found within the fuselage.The damage to the pen indicated that it was the probable cause of the control restriction. “The pilot reported that, prior to the incident flight, a pen top had been recovered from the rear cockpit of the aircraft during the pre-flight loose article check but no other articles had been seen.As a result of the incident, the pilot has introduced more rigorous pre- and post-flight inspections of the aircraft for loose articles and only allows pens to be carried if they are securely tied to the pilot’s or student’s flying suit.  Please review our commenting policyBrexit latest news - John Bercow warns Theresa May he will block third meaningful vote unless substantial changes are madeNurse jailed for injecting husband with insulin could have murder conviction quashed, court hearsHusband says \u0026#39I miss being a daddy\u0026#39 as his wife is jailed for murder of their three-year-old daughterHigh levels of heavy metals found in body of \u0026#39bunga bunga\u0026#39 model who was due to testify against BerlusconiDebate: Should Brexiteer MPs switch to backing Theresa May\u0026#39s deal?Elite Chinese pigeon fanciers pay world record £1m for \u0026#39Lewis Hamilton of racing pigeons\u0026#39Eurostar warns passengers not to travel to France amid border chaos and five-hour queuesMesut Ozil sparks new political row over wedding invite for Turkish presidentComment: The Brexit deal remains flawed.

After an hour-long battle, XDDPO emerged triumphant with a €1.25 million bid.Mr Verschoot was stunned at the outcome of the auctionMr Verschoot said, “The two Chinese had told me in advance that they absolutely wanted Armando. But I didn\u0027t see this coming. This is a crowning glory of all those years in the pigeon sport. The icing on the cake.Mr Verschoot has been involved in pigeons for 50 years, catching the bug from his father. After 40 years working in an abattoir, he retired and was able to concentrate all his time on his hobby.I have now earned more in two weeks than in those 40 years, he said, after the crowning of the world’s most expensive pigeon and the sale of another 177 pigeons netted him more a total of more than £1.7 million.Armando is so sought after because of his exceptional strength that allows him to race in all weather conditions.He has never lost a race Mr Verschoot told the Het Nieuwsblad newspaper. In 2017 and 2018 he was the best in Belgium and in 2018 the best in Europe.”Armando, who at the age of five is nearing the end of his racing life, will now take a plane to China and be put out to stud with an expensive hen.Please review our commenting policyComment: Jeremy Corbyn\u0026#39s Bloody Sunday stance is finally bringing his IRA links under suspicionBrexit latest news - John Bercow warns Theresa May he will block third meaningful vote unless substantial changes are madeNurse jailed for injecting husband with insulin could have murder conviction quashed, court hearsHusband says \u0026#39I miss being a daddy\u0026#39 as his wife is jailed for murder of their three-year-old daughterHigh levels of heavy metals found in body of \u0026#39bunga bunga\u0026#39 model who was due to testify against BerlusconiDebate: Should Brexiteer MPs switch to backing Theresa May\u0026#39s deal?Eurostar warns passengers not to travel to France amid border chaos and five-hour queuesMesut Ozil sparks new political row over wedding invite for Turkish presidentComment: The Brexit deal remains flawed.

But stepping away from Jo Malone, the company she created at her kitchen table, proved harder than she thought.The Estée Lauder deal included a “lockout clause”, which meant she was contractually prevented from being\u0026nbsppart of the beauty industry and forced into a five-year exile.

Flybe said it cancelled 994 flights in the three months to 31 March, compared to 372 in the same period last year.“I missed the industry so much. Believe it or not, it never really felt like a business to me. When I’m creating and working I literally come alive, it’s something that’s in me,” she tells\u0026nbspThe Independent.This might be why those\u0026nbspclose to her\u0026nbspwere not surprised when she told them about her idea to launch a second global fragrance brand.Nearly half of business people ‘miss family when travelling’“My family knew because I’ve been such a nightmare to live with for five years. They knew I had to get back there, it was inevitable.“But some of my friends did tell me: ‘I know you’ve got another business in you Jo but should it be fragrance again?’” she adds.Sometimes in business you know you’ve made a big mistake but you don’t have the money to put it right straight away, so you have to salvage as much as you can and that’s what I did“I still love Jo Malone, of course, even if I don’t identify with it creatively anymore. I’m still proud of it and Estée Lauder has done an incredible job. But Jo Loves doesn’t feel like a business, it’s an extension of who I am,” she says.Being a household name, you might assume building a start-up would have been easier the second time around, but Malone laughs out loud as soon as she hears the question: “I’ve got to be honest with you, the first two years were just excruciating.\u0026nbsp“Now I can say this because we have passed that stage, but I’m not sure I could have told you this at the time, I felt so embarrassed. I’m afraid – and I say this to all the people that are building their businesses today – if success does land on your doorstep on day one, you’re one in a million.”Espresso shot mochi ice cream balls unveiled at Selfridge’sAccording to Malone, she made every mistake possible, from packaging to distribution, when launching her new brand.\u0026nbsp“We were about to launch our capsule collection in Selfridges over Christmas, a fantastic opportunity. We were building the pop-up the night before opening day and I just knew I had made the biggest mistake with the packaging, it just wasn’t right.“Sometimes in business you know you’ve made\u0026nbspa big mistake but you don’t have the money to put it right straight away, so you have to salvage as much as you can, and that’s what I did in the first two years. What I knew was I had a product that could still be global and that’s what drove me.”“During these two years, I just kept thinking, I have to get through the week, the month, Christmas. The thing that motivated me the most were the people working with me and the salaries I was responsible for. At one point when there was not enough coming in, I started doing speaking engagements across the country. I knew these engagements would give me a fee that would guarantee a month’s\u0026nbspsalary.”At the time, Malone operated from a creative studio in west London. Customers from all over the world would have to call and make an appointment to order a candle or a fragrance, buying 10-15 bottles in bulk. She had a thriving little business, but she knew it needed a home.After an 18-month delay, which allowed her to replace the initial red packaging with a more subtle white, she launched with a single shop on Elizabeth Street in London’s Belgravia in 2013 – in the very same space where she started her shopkeeper journey more than 30 years ago.\u0026nbsp“Sometimes life will bring you back to where you started,” she says.Malone’s business philosophy comes from a continual desire to innovate and inspire, which is why her shop was always going to be different.\u0026nbsp“I didn’t want to do another candle store. So I thought of a new way to present everything. It’s about changing the way that the industry looks at cosmetics and fragrance,” she adds.Created with Sketch.Tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit  Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.There will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersThe store itself is a delight to the senses the second you step into it. The elegant white design of the shop allows your eyes to relax and the door is always kept closed, enabling customers to be stimulated by the scents in the air – the perfect setting for Malone’s “Fragrance Brasserie Bar”, where customers can try out a complimentary fragrance “tapas” experience.\u0026nbspDuring the experience,\u0026nbspshoppers can start by selecting their desired fragrance to create a palate of scents – similar to a food tasting, but for the nose. Bath cologne is first warmed in a tagine before being presented to you as a cloud of steam\u0026nbspa cleanser is then shaken over ice and strained into a Martini glass. Lastly, lotion is whipped and foamed before being painted onto your skin.\u0026nbspSometimes when you’re on your own and you start your business from your spare room, it can be isolating. I want to inspire the next generation but also tell them that they’re not on on their own“In the same way we all remember our first kiss, I wanted my customers to remember their first experience with my brand. It adds value to the brand with no costs and translates into a sale 97 per cent of the time,” she says.For Malone, perfume is strongly associated with memories. Her bestseller scent Pomelo – a fresh, citrus smell with hints of rose and patchouli, reminiscent of a summer holiday – is now one of 14 fragrances inspired by her own experiences. Other products include bath and body lotions, and candles of course.In 2017, Malone started using a paintbrush as part of the brand’s fragrance tapas\u0026nbspexperience, which inspired her to change how her customers applied scent. Although very few believed in the idea originally, it’s now her flagship product.“Whenever someone says ‘no one is going to use that’\u0026nbspor ‘it’s never going to work’, it always goes into my head. These paintbrushes became my golden ticket, the product that got me all over the world telling creative stories. So, if someone tells you you can’t do it, stick to your guns. Don’t always listen to the voices around you.”Jo Loves was always designed to be a global brand and Malone is planning to open new stores soon, both in the UK and across the Atlantic –\u0026nbspalthough she doesn’t want to discuss the exact locations just yet.Jo Malone launches new collection with Poppy Delevingne“I can see the potential in my business and it’s something I would never take for granted,” she says.For any young entrepreneur starting their business, Malone’s story is an inspiration. Perhaps\u0026nbspbecause she was repeatedly told she would fail, she’s keen to give back to the next generation and tell them that they are not alone.With that in mind, Malone has recently taken part in Secret Leaders – a business podcast that es deep into the stories of top CEOs, their brands and their personal lives.“Sometimes when you’re on your own and you start your business from your spare room, it can be isolating. There’s a lot of self-doubt. I want to inspire the next generation, but also tell them that they’re not on on their own.”“So Secret Leaders is a way to share my story with them – the good the bad and the ugly. Sometimes hearing someone else’s story might inspire you to think differently.”Malone cites\u0026nbsppassion, resilience and respect for the currency of creativity as the three most important values in developing a new brand.\u0026nbspWhen I ask what advice she would give to a young business owner in doubt, she quotes the catchphrase from the movie The Imitation Game,\u0026nbspin which\u0026nbspBenedict Cumberbatch plays British mathematician Alan Turing: “Sometimes it’s the people no one imagines anything of who do the things that no one can imagine.”\u0026nbspWe’ll tell you what’s true.

Pilgrims bathe in the river believing it cleanses them of their sins and ends their process of reincarnation.

But when people see you are one-sided, it just makes it tough. I’d just like to see a bit of civility come back to it, you know?”Oliver addressed the comments on Last Week Tonight\u0026nbspduring a segment on public shaming.

The meth maker believes his days of cooking are long over. Having lunch with his family, everything seems perfect. And then everything goes wrong. So, so wrong. Hank (Dean Norris) goes to use the toilet and picks up a copy of Walt Whitman\u0027s Leaves of Grass – a gift from Gale to Walter White. “To my other favorited WW. It\u0027s an honour working with you. Fondly, GB.” And with that, as Hank realises Walt’s true identity, the end of Heisenberg’s empire begins.The debate over whether certain final scenes of television shows are actually good will rage on and on. The Sopranos remains front and centre of the conversation. It\u0027s a seemingly banal occasion – a restaurant dinner scene. We watch on as Tony sits there, observing other customers. Carmela arrives, then AJ and Meadow, who the last we see, is parking her car outside. A bell rings, Tony looks up and the screen cuts to black. It’s an ending that’s inspired essays offering varied interpretations but ultimately, it remains a beautifully-executed few minutes of television – and a cliffhanger that’ll never have a resolution.337 EastEnders – The Kat and Zoe revelation (2001)“You can’t tell me what to do ‘cause you ain’t my muvva”  “YES I AM!” - not the work of Shakespeare, granted, but surely one of the biggest moments in soap history. The nation’s jaws collectively dropped as they learned that Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace) wasn’t Zoe’s sister at all, but her mum.  437 Game of Thrones – The Rains of Castamere (2013)Game of Thrones knew George RR Martin was willing to kill off leading characters, but nothing prepared non-book readers for The Red Wedding. Robb Stark (Richard Madden), Talisa Stark (Oona Chaplin) and Catelyn Stark (Michelle Fairley) are attending the wedding of Roslin Frey (Alexandra Dowling) and Edmure Tully (Tobias Menzies) when things go terribly, terribly wrong for the Starks. The Freys turn on them, killing Robb, Talisa and their unborn child. Then, as the blood spills everywhere, Catelyn’s throat is slit. Cut to black. Devastating.The cliffhanger that kickstarted the end of season cliffhanger trend. Larry Hagman’s oil baron JR Ewing had made plenty of enemies in Dallas. By the end of season three, one of them took justice into their own hands, shooting JR in the back twice. However, rather than reveal the culprit, the team behind Dallas left the case unsolved. And over the next eight months – the time between seasons – the whole world was asking “Who shot JR?” Unsurprisingly, considering the hysteria around the mystery, 350 million people tuned in to watch the revelatory episode “Who Done It”.Showrunner Matt Groening had long wanted to do an episode where Mr Burns was shot, and the culprit was not revealed until the next episode. Taking inspiration from Dallas, the animation concluded Part One with the nuclear power plant owner being shot by an unknown assailant. Then, after a Summer of waiting, fans were finally treated to the answer. The two-part episode has gone down as a classic and is often heralded as the series’ best.737 Doctor Who – The Parting of the Ways (2005)Choosing one standout Doctor Who cliffhanger is almost impossible – especially when you consider that all 37 (and counting) seasons have frequently used the plot device. While the introduction of John Hurt’s Doctor certainly ranks among them, one of best came at the end of the rebooted first series. Having absorbed a bunch of vortexes, the Doctor is struggling and on the verge of regenerating. Turning to Rose (Billie Piper), Christopher Eccleston’s incarnation of the iconic character utters the timeless lines: “Before I go, I just want to tell you, you were fantastic. Absolutely fantastic. And you know what – so was I.” Queue shoddy CGI and the introduction of the soon-to-be nation’s favourite Doctor, David Tennant. “So, where was I? That’s it – Barcelona.”Gale (David Costabile) is one of the nicest characters on Breaking Bad. He is not interested in wealth or fame, but in science. However, niceties and a good cup of coffee are not enough to stop him getting in Walter White’s (Bryan Cranston) way. When the choice between their lives has to be made, Walter chooses his own and sends Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) to do the dirty work. Season three ends with Jesse killing Gale – an incident that eventually brings down the drug kingpin Gus Fring.937 The West Wing – “What Kind of Day Has it Been” (2000)The West Wing’s biggest cliffhanger came in the season one finale. The episode works its way back from the beginning as we see a Secret Service Agent sense danger from a nearby window at a town hall meeting with the president in attendance. When the episode catches up, gunfire rings out and each member of his senior staff is thrown to the floor. Cut to black as we hear an agent ask over the radio: “Who’s been hit?”It wasn’t until the third season finale of Smallville that Superman fans’ patience was rewarded as viewers saw Clark (Tom Welling) appear naked in the middle of a Kryptonian symbol burned into the field of his family’s farm. “You shall be reborn,” Jor-El can be heard saying to Clark Kent, but he wasn’t the alone one the ending marked a radical turning point for the series.Twin Peaks’ season two finale – the mystery drama’s last episode for 27 years – may have featured the most chilling cliffhanger, but the biggest gasp of the series came at the end of season one as the seemingly untouchable Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan) responds to a knock on his hotel room door, only to be gunned down by an unseen assailant.1237 Buffy the Vampire Slayer – The Gift (2001)The 100th episode of Buffy ended with one of the show’s most shocking moments (and no, we’re not talking about the musical episode). Season five concluded with the eponymous ass-kicker sacrificing herself to save the world by jumping into a demonic portal. The episode ends with a slow zoom onto Buffy’s tombstone, which reads: “Beloved sister. Devoted friend. She saved the world. A lot.“It\u0027s easy to forget that True Blood began life as an acclaimed Emmy-nominated drama, and it was a cliffhanger such as this that made it so: Sookie Stackhouse (Anna Paquin) falls asleep with the friendly neighbour dog Dean for company. Upon waking up, Dean is gone and in his place is local barman Sam Merlotte ( Sam Trammell). Turns out he\u0027s a shapeshifter.1437 The Walking Dead – Last Day on Earth (2016)After eight episodes of build-up, the comic book’s deadliest villain, Negan, reared his head in a scene fans were dreading. With the majority of the main cast lined up at his mercy, Negan – in retaliation for the death of one of his gang – decides which one to kill by using “Eeny Meeny Mino Moe”. After selecting his victim, the camera switches POV and Negan bludgeons the unseen character to death leaving fans with a six-month wait before finding out who had met their maker.Lost co-creator Damon Lindelof\u0027s HBO drama was set in a world that saw two per cent of the world’s population disappear into thin air during a tragic event known as the Sudden Departure. Season two presented an intriguing mystery: the disappearance of three teenage girls from a Texan town that nobody had vanished from. It was the season\u0027s penultimate episode that cleared up this plot line as Matt Garvey (Chris Zylka) breaks into a heavily-guarded trailer – only to be met with the three teenage girls staring back at him. What’s more is they’re dressed all in white, a callback to the disbanded cult from the first season.In episode 11, the writers had introduced a hatch buried underground and, week in week out, the fans waited patiently for any detail about the mysterious structure the writers were willing to give them. The end of episode 19 saw a desperate John Locke (Terry O’Quinn) banging on the door, just as desperate to get inside as the viewers were... only for a light to come on from within. This ending remains an unforgettable moment for those who watched it at the time of broadcast.1737 Lost – “Two for the Road” (2006)“I’m sorry.” “For what?” BANG. On paper, not so effective but on screen, it equated to one of Lost’s most gasp-inducing cliffhangers. Viewers watched behind their eyes as Michael (Harold Perrineau), desperate to save his son from the mysterious Others, shoots Ana-Lucia (Michelle Rodriguez) and, in a cruel twist, Libby (Cynthia Watros), who has accidentally stumbled upon the whole thing while looking for some blankets.1837 Lost - \u0027Through the Looking Glass – Part 2Whether you love or hate Lost, there’s no denying that the season three finale deployed one of the most breathtaking rug pulls in television history as writers Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse revealed a shake-up long in the running: flashbacks featuring a suicidal Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) were, in fact, flashforwards to the future. The Oceanic Flight 815 plane crash survivor made it off the island he’d been so desperate to get off for three whole seasons, but was, disturbingly, desperate to get back. The ending set the benchmark for all future finale and was so huge it made newspaper headlines.1937 Line of Duty – Series four premiere (2018)The fourth series of Line of Duty didn’t hold back on the shocks. In fact, its first episode featured a cliffhanger ending to rival the best of them. With DCI Roz Huntley (Thandie Newton) dead on his floor, her murderer – Forensic Coordinator Tim Ifield (Jason Watkins) – sets about dispatching her body, but as his chainsaw nears her face, Roz’s eyes suddenly open.After season one, Heroes became pretty dreadful television. But this cliffhanger looms in the memory for being so left-field it warrants applaud: having captured serial killer Sylar, Angela Petrelli – parent to superheroes Nathan and Peter – tells him she can provide him with the love and guidance he needs. Angry, Sylar tells her she’s not his mother to which Angela drops the bombshell: “But I am dear, I am.” A head-scratching mid-season reveal that had fans chomping at the bit for the next episode.After spending an entire season watching the blossoming romance between medical intern Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) and Dr Derek Shephard (Patrick Dempsey), the world of viewers was rocked upon discovering the shock revelation that Derek was married all along.Channel 4 sitcom Green Wing took the term “cliffhanger” quite literally for each finale of its two series. While it became a tad gimmicky the second time around, the first remained a genuinely surprising way for a comedy series to end: having discovered that the colleague he’d just slept with was his mother, drug-addled anaesthetist Guy Secretan (Stephen Mangan) steals an ambulance, drives it to the country and loses control. After crashing, the episode ends with Guy and several other characters dangling – you guessed it – off a cliff.A particularly nail-biting fourth season was shaping up to end well: after weeks of playing cat-and-mouse with the Trinity Killer (John Lithgow on Emmy-winning form), Dexter finally put an end to his murderous ways and returned home ready to pack up and join his wife Rita on their vacation. Only Rita’s still at home... dead in the bathtub. Trinity killed her before Dexter got to him. A heartbreaking end to a standout season.When things are going supremely well towards the end of a season finale, you know something big is about to go down. Battlestar Galactica proved no different. After destroying the Cylon Basestar – a warship belonging to the enemy – crew member Boomer, who viewers had learnt was a Cylon in the mini-series that aired the year before, fires a round into the chest of Commander Adama (Edward James Olmos), the show’s main character.Having been warned for two seasons that Z’ha’dum means death, fans expected big things from an episode called “Z’ha’dum”. They weren’t wrong. It ended with the show’s lead character jumping to his death. The episode was so big the episodes leading up to it teased “Z minus 14 days” and “Z minus 7 days.”24 was filled to the brim with huge cliffhangers, but this one – arriving at the 16 episode mark – stands out for sparking what would be the show’s best run of episodes. President Charles Logan (Gregory Itzin) is revealed to be the mastermind behind the shocking assassinations of David Palmer and Michelle Dessler, which kickstarted the season. And thus the show’s most memorable villain was born.2737 Friends – The One with Ross’s Wedding (1998)While Ross (David Schwimmer) and Rachel’s (Jennifer Aniston) “will they, won’t they” courtship arguably went on far too long, there was one moment during the season four finale that left fans with their jaws on the floor. Just after Rachel had accepted Ross was happy with fiancé Emily (Helen Baxendale), everything goes catastrophically wrong. Instead of saying Emily’s name during the wedding vows, Ross says the iconic line: “Take thee Rachel”. After the wedding, as the season finished, everyone was left wondering whether the pair would finally rekindle their romance for good.“I’m in a boxcar, buried inside a quarry, and there are bodies everywhere,” says Mulder to Scully during the season two finale. And just as Mulder solves the riddle of how those people died, the roof of the boxcar slams shut, trapping him inside. Worse still, the Smoking Man then arrives with a unit of soldiers. When they open the boxcar, Mulder’s somehow nowhere to be seen and they decide to blow the freight to smithereens. Did Mulder survive? Did he get away?2937 Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life – Fall (2016)“It certainly wasn\u0027t the ending I expected,” Rory Gilmore actor Alexis Bledel said of the finale. “Fitting but frustrating”, was how Vanity Fair referred to the episode. The Gilmore Girls sequel, A Year in the Life, concluded with a four-word exchange between Rory and her mother, Lorelai (Lauren Graham). “Mum”, the daughter says, sitting in a park’s bandstand. “Yeah”, she replies. “I’m pregnant,” Rory says. Queue hundreds of fans wanting more from the story, which had, ultimately, come full circle.3037 Star Trek: The Next Generation – Best of Both Worlds (1990)Another science fiction show filled to the brim with cliffhangers. Star Trek: The Next Generation had many, but few can measure up to Picard (Patrick Stewart) becoming a Borg. The season three finale sees the Enterprise’s crew having no choice but to turn on their former captain, with Riker (Jonathan Frakes) ordering Worf (Michael Dorn) to open fire on Picard’s Borg ship. Fans had to wait three months to discover whether Picard could be saved – and the fandom almost imploded in the meantime.Marissa Cooper (Mischa Barton) and Ryan Atwood (Benjamin McKenzie) would have done anything for each other. When Ryan’s brother Trey (Logan Marshall-Green) gets in the way, attacking Marissa, Ryan has no other course of action but to settle things “once and for all” between them. As the brawl ensues, Marissa somehow ends up shooting Trey. And as the bullet goes through him, Imogen Heap’s song “Hide and Seek” – AKA the “Mmmmh, what you say?” song – suddenly starts playing. It’s hard not to laugh. The pop song cuts through the scene, completely at odds with what’s happening on screen. No wonder, then, that Saturday Night Live famously parodied the scene in one of their most-beloved skits of all time.Jim (John Krasinski) and Pam (Jenna Fischer) were the ultimate “will they, won’t they” couple, their chemistry electrifying the early seasons of The Office. Things peaked for the first time during the season two finale. Following Casino Night at Dunder Mifflin, Jim finally takes Pam aside to reveal his true feelings, telling her: “I’m in love with you.” She is, at the time, engaged to Roy (David Denman), and decides to reply to Jim: “What are you doing?” While all hope for the pair seems lost, Jim finds Pam (calling her mother) before the episode’s end and kisses her. Cruelly, the showrunners decided to cut to black after the moment, leaving fans wondering for months whether the couple would return to screens happily together (spoiler: they do not).JJ Abrams loves ending things on a twist. Before creating the mystery-box filled Lost, the filmmaker created Alias, and the season two finale marks one the show’s greatest endings. The episode sees Sydney (Jennifer Garner) discover that Francie (Merrin Dungey) is not Francie at all, but a duplicate. The two then brawl, ending with Sydney shooting Francie and then collapsing due to exhaustion. We immediately jump to Sydney waking up in Hong Kong. After reuniting with her lover Michael Vaughn (Michael Vartan), Sydney realises things are amiss as Michael is wearing a wedding ring. Turns out, she has been missing for almost two years. Cut to black, and the world asking “What just happened?”3437 Spooks – Smoke and Mirrors (2003)The season two finale of Spooks shocked the nation. While the episode begins with the CIA taking on a seemingly straightforward mission – to prevent a member of the Cabinet being assassinated – we soon discover that everything’s not as it seems. The formerly-presumed dead Herman Joyce (Tomas Arana) is still alive and masquerading as Herb Zeigler. Not only that, but the villain has masterminded an elaborate plan to make it seem as if Tom (Matthew Macfadyen) has assassinated the Chief of the Defence Staff. With everything working against Tom, the agent finds himself backed into a corner. And when Harry (Peter Firth) loses faith, Tom decides to shoot Harry with his shotgun. Does Harry die? Will Tom ever be found innocent? The questions were many.3537 Dragon Ball Z – Next time on Dragon Ball ZThere’s really no definitive Dragon Ball Z cliffhanger, as almost every single episode in the series finishes with one. From Vegeta staring menacingly at the camera to the villainous Cell launching a deadline attack on Goku, the series leaves you anywhere and everywhere. When that voice-over comes in with “Next time on Dragon Ball Z”, you can guarantee any child watching will be hooked and instantly wanting to watch the next episode.Pushing Up Daisies was unceremoniously brought to an end after just two seasons, with showrunner Bryan Fuller having to quickly conclude the whimsical series with very little notice. The epilogue was added late into the writing process and sees the narrator offer some closure to each characters’ story. Yet, with Ned (Lee Pace) and Chuck (Anna Friel) standing on her aunts’ doorstep, waiting to finally reveal that she’s alive, fans could see that there were originally supposed to be many more seasons to come – and they still want them desperately.Following a war of words with Jim Moriarty (Andrew Scott) on the roof of a building (in which Moriarty shoots himself in the head), Sherlock (Benedict Cumberbatch) decides to seemingly commit suicide by jumping off the building. However, not all is at it seems, as Sherlock is seen alive before the episode end. Fans of the series – plus Martin Freeman’s Watson – were left questioning what exactly happened to Sherlock, with all being revealed in the following special.Karma for killing Gale comes for Walter White in season five. The meth maker believes his days of cooking are long over. Having lunch with his family, everything seems perfect. And then everything goes wrong. So, so wrong. Hank (Dean Norris) goes to use the toilet and picks up a copy of Walt Whitman\u0027s Leaves of Grass – a gift from Gale to Walter White. “To my other favorited WW. It\u0027s an honour working with you. Fondly, GB.” And with that, as Hank realises Walt’s true identity, the end of Heisenberg’s empire begins.The debate over whether certain final scenes of television shows are actually good will rage on and on. The Sopranos remains front and centre of the conversation. It\u0027s a seemingly banal occasion – a restaurant dinner scene. We watch on as Tony sits there, observing other customers. Carmela arrives, then AJ and Meadow, who the last we see, is parking her car outside. A bell rings, Tony looks up and the screen cuts to black. It’s an ending that’s inspired essays offering varied interpretations but ultimately, it remains a beautifully-executed few minutes of television – and a cliffhanger that’ll never have a resolution.337 EastEnders – The Kat and Zoe revelation (2001)“You can’t tell me what to do ‘cause you ain’t my muvva”  “YES I AM!” - not the work of Shakespeare, granted, but surely one of the biggest moments in soap history. The nation’s jaws collectively dropped as they learned that Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace) wasn’t Zoe’s sister at all, but her mum.  437 Game of Thrones – The Rains of Castamere (2013)Game of Thrones knew George RR Martin was willing to kill off leading characters, but nothing prepared non-book readers for The Red Wedding. Robb Stark (Richard Madden), Talisa Stark (Oona Chaplin) and Catelyn Stark (Michelle Fairley) are attending the wedding of Roslin Frey (Alexandra Dowling) and Edmure Tully (Tobias Menzies) when things go terribly, terribly wrong for the Starks. The Freys turn on them, killing Robb, Talisa and their unborn child. Then, as the blood spills everywhere, Catelyn’s throat is slit. Cut to black. Devastating.The cliffhanger that kickstarted the end of season cliffhanger trend. Larry Hagman’s oil baron JR Ewing had made plenty of enemies in Dallas. By the end of season three, one of them took justice into their own hands, shooting JR in the back twice. However, rather than reveal the culprit, the team behind Dallas left the case unsolved. And over the next eight months – the time between seasons – the whole world was asking “Who shot JR?” Unsurprisingly, considering the hysteria around the mystery, 350 million people tuned in to watch the revelatory episode “Who Done It”.Showrunner Matt Groening had long wanted to do an episode where Mr Burns was shot, and the culprit was not revealed until the next episode. Taking inspiration from Dallas, the animation concluded Part One with the nuclear power plant owner being shot by an unknown assailant. Then, after a Summer of waiting, fans were finally treated to the answer. The two-part episode has gone down as a classic and is often heralded as the series’ best.737 Doctor Who – The Parting of the Ways (2005)Choosing one standout Doctor Who cliffhanger is almost impossible – especially when you consider that all 37 (and counting) seasons have frequently used the plot device. While the introduction of John Hurt’s Doctor certainly ranks among them, one of best came at the end of the rebooted first series. Having absorbed a bunch of vortexes, the Doctor is struggling and on the verge of regenerating. Turning to Rose (Billie Piper), Christopher Eccleston’s incarnation of the iconic character utters the timeless lines: “Before I go, I just want to tell you, you were fantastic. Absolutely fantastic. And you know what – so was I.” Queue shoddy CGI and the introduction of the soon-to-be nation’s favourite Doctor, David Tennant. “So, where was I? That’s it – Barcelona.”Gale (David Costabile) is one of the nicest characters on Breaking Bad. He is not interested in wealth or fame, but in science. However, niceties and a good cup of coffee are not enough to stop him getting in Walter White’s (Bryan Cranston) way. When the choice between their lives has to be made, Walter chooses his own and sends Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) to do the dirty work. Season three ends with Jesse killing Gale – an incident that eventually brings down the drug kingpin Gus Fring.937 The West Wing – “What Kind of Day Has it Been” (2000)The West Wing’s biggest cliffhanger came in the season one finale. The episode works its way back from the beginning as we see a Secret Service Agent sense danger from a nearby window at a town hall meeting with the president in attendance. When the episode catches up, gunfire rings out and each member of his senior staff is thrown to the floor. Cut to black as we hear an agent ask over the radio: “Who’s been hit?”It wasn’t until the third season finale of Smallville that Superman fans’ patience was rewarded as viewers saw Clark (Tom Welling) appear naked in the middle of a Kryptonian symbol burned into the field of his family’s farm. “You shall be reborn,” Jor-El can be heard saying to Clark Kent, but he wasn’t the alone one the ending marked a radical turning point for the series.Twin Peaks’ season two finale – the mystery drama’s last episode for 27 years – may have featured the most chilling cliffhanger, but the biggest gasp of the series came at the end of season one as the seemingly untouchable Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan) responds to a knock on his hotel room door, only to be gunned down by an unseen assailant.1237 Buffy the Vampire Slayer – The Gift (2001)The 100th episode of Buffy ended with one of the show’s most shocking moments (and no, we’re not talking about the musical episode). Season five concluded with the eponymous ass-kicker sacrificing herself to save the world by jumping into a demonic portal. The episode ends with a slow zoom onto Buffy’s tombstone, which reads: “Beloved sister. Devoted friend. She saved the world. A lot.“It\u0027s easy to forget that True Blood began life as an acclaimed Emmy-nominated drama, and it was a cliffhanger such as this that made it so: Sookie Stackhouse (Anna Paquin) falls asleep with the friendly neighbour dog Dean for company. Upon waking up, Dean is gone and in his place is local barman Sam Merlotte ( Sam Trammell). Turns out he\u0027s a shapeshifter.1437 The Walking Dead – Last Day on Earth (2016)After eight episodes of build-up, the comic book’s deadliest villain, Negan, reared his head in a scene fans were dreading. With the majority of the main cast lined up at his mercy, Negan – in retaliation for the death of one of his gang – decides which one to kill by using “Eeny Meeny Mino Moe”. After selecting his victim, the camera switches POV and Negan bludgeons the unseen character to death leaving fans with a six-month wait before finding out who had met their maker.Lost co-creator Damon Lindelof\u0027s HBO drama was set in a world that saw two per cent of the world’s population disappear into thin air during a tragic event known as the Sudden Departure. Season two presented an intriguing mystery: the disappearance of three teenage girls from a Texan town that nobody had vanished from. It was the season\u0027s penultimate episode that cleared up this plot line as Matt Garvey (Chris Zylka) breaks into a heavily-guarded trailer – only to be met with the three teenage girls staring back at him. What’s more is they’re dressed all in white, a callback to the disbanded cult from the first season.In episode 11, the writers had introduced a hatch buried underground and, week in week out, the fans waited patiently for any detail about the mysterious structure the writers were willing to give them. The end of episode 19 saw a desperate John Locke (Terry O’Quinn) banging on the door, just as desperate to get inside as the viewers were... only for a light to come on from within. This ending remains an unforgettable moment for those who watched it at the time of broadcast.1737 Lost – “Two for the Road” (2006)“I’m sorry.” “For what?” BANG. On paper, not so effective but on screen, it equated to one of Lost’s most gasp-inducing cliffhangers. Viewers watched behind their eyes as Michael (Harold Perrineau), desperate to save his son from the mysterious Others, shoots Ana-Lucia (Michelle Rodriguez) and, in a cruel twist, Libby (Cynthia Watros), who has accidentally stumbled upon the whole thing while looking for some blankets.1837 Lost - \u0027Through the Looking Glass – Part 2Whether you love or hate Lost, there’s no denying that the season three finale deployed one of the most breathtaking rug pulls in television history as writers Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse revealed a shake-up long in the running: flashbacks featuring a suicidal Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) were, in fact, flashforwards to the future. The Oceanic Flight 815 plane crash survivor made it off the island he’d been so desperate to get off for three whole seasons, but was, disturbingly, desperate to get back. The ending set the benchmark for all future finale and was so huge it made newspaper headlines.1937 Line of Duty – Series four premiere (2018)The fourth series of Line of Duty didn’t hold back on the shocks. In fact, its first episode featured a cliffhanger ending to rival the best of them. With DCI Roz Huntley (Thandie Newton) dead on his floor, her murderer – Forensic Coordinator Tim Ifield (Jason Watkins) – sets about dispatching her body, but as his chainsaw nears her face, Roz’s eyes suddenly open.After season one, Heroes became pretty dreadful television.

I remember the campaign well because it was the subject of an article I was producing for a university magazine, the first I ever wrote for any publication.The election was considered particularly\u0026nbspimportant because the Northern Irish prime minister, Terence O’Neill, was seeking endorsement of his policy of moving towards granting civil and political rights to the Catholic minority – a policy over which his own unionist party was split.I had a sense early on that it was already too late for compromise because institutionalised anti-Catholic discrimination had cut too deep for change to come without violence.There were signs of this in the villages and small towns around the lakes of Fermanagh. I was following the campaign of a Catholic candidate who held progressive opinions. One evening we saw a group of men standing beside the road and he made a short speech denouncing the unionist establishment. After he had finished, one of the men said that the candidate had no need to worry “because nobody here is going to vote for a Protestant”.Like many appeals to the moderate centre in Northern Ireland over the past half century, O’Neill’s did less well than many expected. The prime minister said he had received 150,000 letters supporting political compromise, but these failed to turn into enough votes on election day to give him the mandate he needed.Derry Girls has created a joyous and complex identity for N IrelandHe won only a slim majority among pro-reform unionist MPs and was humiliated when he almost lost his seat in Bannside to the virulently anti-Catholic preacher Ian Paisley, who was just gaining prominence in Northern Irish politics. O’Neill resigned as prime minister a few months later and Paisley went on to win the seat in the next election in 1970 as the candidate for the Protestant Unionist Party, which soon afterwards changed its name to the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).Half a century later many things have changed in the world, from the fall of the Soviet Union to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq that followed 911, but the DUP is very much the same today as it was then.The only (big) difference is that it is no longer a fringe party but one that provides the essential parliamentary support to keep the British government in power. Its views are eagerly and respectfully sought by politicians and media alike as to the terms under which Britain should leave the EU, seemingly ignoring that the DUP agenda is very different from that of the Conservative Party and other Brexit supporters.One of the many extraordinary things about Britain in the age of Brexit is that the nature and history of the DUP is not more closely examined. On the other hand, it is in keeping with a tradition in Britain of proud ignorance of Irish politics north and south as something not worth considering. This despite the fact that the fate of the Northern Irish backstop is a lead item in newscasts and at the centre of the most important decision in UK history since the Second World War. Tony Blair was one of the only British leaders to know much about Northern Ireland, which explains why he was able to negotiate the Good Friday Agreement (GFA) in 1998 that ended three decades of fighting. \u0026nbspPaisley mellowed in his last years, becoming first minister of the Northern Ireland Executive in 2007, but the DUP changed less than he did and remains closer to the uncompromising and sectarian views that he espoused for most of his career. Once he was asked about building bridges between the Protestant and Catholic communities in Northern Ireland and his reply explains much about the DUP’s approach today. “Where do bridges go?” he asked rhetorically and gave the classic response, damning in his eyes, that “they go over to the other side”.McGuinness (Getty)There is strong evidence that the DUP leader Arlene Foster, who opposed the GFA as a member of the Ulster Unionist Party before joining the DUP, still thinks along these lines. Asked in 2017 why she had not compromised with Sinn Fein, the dominant Catholic and nationalist party and her partner in the power-sharing Northern Ireland Executive, she replied: “If you feed a crocodile it will keep coming back and looking for more.”She later expressed regret for the crocodile comparison but her record in office appeared to back up her words in the eyes of Catholics, who now make up half the 1.9 million population of Northern Ireland.DUP tells May not to ‘roll over’ to the EU in fresh warningLater the same year, Theresa May lost her parliamentary majority in the general election and reached a confidence and supply agreement with the DUP. This came with a £1bn subsidy for Northern Ireland in addition to the usual UK annual grant of £11bn a year.It was an extraordinary piece of luck for the DUP, though perhaps less lucky for the UK as whole, that the party should hold the balance of power at such a critical moment, though its beliefs had changed little since the first years of the Troubles.Dr John Kyle, a councillor for the Progressive Unionist Party on Belfast City Council and GP in the Protestant heartland of east Belfast, has had a close-up view of the DUP in action over many decades.He says: “The DUP remains socially conservative, politically right wing, strongly sectarian, very pragmatic, tough negotiators and always reluctant to change.” He adds that the central ground in Northern Irish politics remains sparsely inhabited because of the polarisation which has been exacerbated by Brexit.The DUP is much more like the Republican Party in the southern states of the US, with its backbone of fundamentalist evangelical Christians, than it is like other British political partiesGiven its undoubted influence in Westminster, the DUP has no need to share power with anybody in Northern Ireland and is likely to do even better than before in the next election there.Yet the DUP remains a stranger movement than most people notice when watching its MPs being interviewed by the British media. At its core are two highly sectarian and regressive organisations: the Free Presbyterian Church, founded by Ian Paisley in 1951, and the Orange Order.Three in 10 (30.5 per cent) of the DUP membership belong to the Free Presbyterians according to The Democratic Unionist Party: From Protest to Power by Jonathan Tonge, Maire Braniff and others, who interviewed three-quarters of the party’s members. This is a high proportion of the DUP given that there are only 10,068 Free Presbyterians, who make up 0.6 per cent of the Northern Irish population.Belonging to the Orange Order is the other feature which distinguishes the DUP, with 34.6 per cent of members belonging to an organisation whose determination to parade through Catholic areas has frequently provoked sectarian violence in the past (though much reduced today by the rerouting or banning of parades going through sensitive areas).The DUP is thus much more like the Republican Party in the southern states of the US, with its backbone of fundamentalist evangelical Christians, than it is like other British political parties. Its social policies on issues like abortion are regressive and it has a tradition of homophobia that has not changed since Ian Paisley led the “Save Ulster from Sodomy” campaign in 1977.The fortuitous political triumph of the DUP comes at the moment when the Protestant and unionist community is on the retreat socially and demographicallyLord Patten, the former Conservative Party chairman and EU commissioner, who is one of the few British political leaders with knowledge of Northern Ireland, is quoted as saying in a newspaper interview this week that Theresa May’s deal with the DUP in 2017 was “a huge mistake”. He believes that the British government has “compromised its balanced position on Northern Ireland in order to get into bed with the DUP”.The DUP denies that it wants a hard border, which would be economically devastating for many of the businessmen and farmers who vote for the party. But it is widely suspected in Northern Ireland that this is not true and that at heart the party does want a hard border iding Northern Ireland from the Irish Republic because this would be a death blow to the Good Friday Agreement. Foster said last October that the agreement was not “sacrosanct” and could be changed in order to take account of Brexit.“The DUP were never in favour of the GFA,” says Morris, arguing that there is nothing surprising about the party’s hostility to the Good Friday Agreement. “They voted against it at the time. Why should they protect it now? It was meant to have fairly similar nationalists and unionist forming a government. But the DUP and Sinn Fein disagree on almost every economic and social policy. They don’t even agree what to call the place: Sinn Fein still calls it the North and the DUP Northern Ireland.”Surprisingly Sinn Fein leaders do not sound concerned about the DUP’s predominance, arguing that it is only temporary and will end as soon as the DUP no longer holds the balance of power in Westminster. There may be an element of wishful thinking in this and political parties all like to imagine that the successes of their opponents are Pyrrhic victories. But Lord Patten argues that the DUP does “more for Sinn Fein than Sinn Fein does by undermining confidence in the existing economic and political relationships between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, Europe and the Republic of Ireland”.The Catholic community is relying on another long-term factor which it believes will negate any tactical gains made by the DUP. Their numbers are growing faster than the Protestants and they will be in the majority by 2021, which is coincidentally the hundredth anniversary of the foundation of the Northern Irish state.Of equal importance is that the Catholic community is becoming more prosperous and better educated than the Protestants. Once it was the Catholics who worked in menial jobs and had twice the unemployment rate of Protestants – 18 per cent compared to 9 per cent in 1972 – but this gap has disappeared. The Catholic middle class was the great beneficiary of the peace process and Catholics make up 60 per cent of those in higher education.Karen Bradley’s ‘mistake’ reveals far more than just her ignoranceQueens University in Belfast is increasingly seen as a “green” institution, while Protestants often go to Scottish or English universities and many do not return after graduating. Catholics increasingly dominate professions like law, medicine, and accountancy.“The professional classes are increasingly populated by the nationalist community,” says Dr Kyle, adding that young working-class Protestants in east Belfast would historically have gone into the shipyards and worked as welders, painters, plumbers – heavy industrial jobs which have now disappeared. Ironically, Catholics were less vulnerable to de-industrialisation because discrimination had prevented them getting the industrial jobs that have now disappeared. \u0026nbspMorris recounts her own family background to illustrate this trend: “My mother was a cleaner, she had eight children my father was mainly unemployed because of the Troubles. She was pulled out of school when she was 14 to mind the other children, but she was obsessed with education, as many Catholic families were, and she pushed us all to go to grammar school.”The fortuitous political triumph of the DUP comes at the moment when the Protestant and unionist community is on the retreat socially and demographically.Dr Kyle says that “most unionists would feel that it is only a matter of time before a majority of the population are from nationalist or Republican backgrounds”. He believes that DUP “arrogance and smugness”, and its effort to impose Brexit despite a majority in Northern Ireland being opposed to it (56 to 44 per cent in the referendum in 2016), will be counterproductive because it alienates nationalists and middle-class unionists.The Good Friday Agreement is being undermined by the prospect of a hard border despite its great success as a historic compromise between the two communities. The economic benefits are visible everywhere. politan Belfast, with a population of 600,000, looks more prosperous than many cities in the rest of the UK.It is this success which is now being put at risk. That does not mean there will be a rerun of the Troubles after 1968-69, but it does mean that friction between Catholics and Protestants is on the rise again after falling in recent years.Morris recalls reporting on Orange Order parades around 12 July, usually a peak point in sectarian violence. “I would often return home at four or five in the morning covered in bruises from metal bolts thrown during the parades,” she says. But clashes have become far less frequent and in the last three years, she says: “I have often found myself sitting in a bar with a glass of wine in my hand by seven in the evening.” \u0026nbspThis trend could go into reverse as Brexit pushes up the political temperature in Northern Ireland. The lack of concern and ignorance about what might happen is illustrated by the way in which Brexiteers denounce the backstop as a conspiracy by the EU and the Irish Republic to trap Britain in the customs union rather than as a necessary measure to prevent a hard border which would topple the Good Friday Agreement.The GFA was probably the greatest achievement of the British state over the last half century. The DUP would like to see it go or strip it of any meaning, and it may well succeed. As during the general election of 1969, Northern Ireland is once more at the crossroads.We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

Entrances to fields and farms were blocked with disinfected straw members of the public were not allowed to enter them.Humans are usually safe from the disease, but at least one person died from the epidemic some of the worst outbreaks were in Cheshire, Shropshire and Wales.The disease was later reckoned to have been virtually eradicated throughout the European Union after a campaign of vaccination and slaughter. That makes yesterday’s action, in which the EU banned all meat, milk and livestock exports from the UK, understandable.After slaughter, farms had to be scrubbed twice a day with special disinfectant and animals were not allowed on to the land for at least six months. Restricted entry signs stood over the entrance to farmland, bearing warnings including: “You are now entering an infected area.”Horse racing was suspended in Britain after the 1967 outbreak and the official Shrovetide football game in Ashbourne, Derbyshire, was cancelled in 1968 because of continuing restrictions.The outbreak was finally linked to frozen lamb carcasses imported from Argentina.Although Britain did suffer another foot-and-mouth outbreak in 1981 on the Isle of Wight, it was easily isolated. A total of 200 cattle and 369 pigs were destroyed.This article first appeared in The Independent on 22 February 2001We’ll tell you what’s true.

In nine days, Scottish farmers and dealers reach the more important deadline when they can apply for a resumption of overseas exports, because then they will have been free of the disease for 90 days.The auction at Kirkwall, capital of the Orkneys six miles off the mainland, was seen as a trial run for the resumption of trade in other unaffected areas of the United Kingdom.Though no more than two dozen buyers, many of them mainland farmers from Aberdeenshire, made the ferry trip for yesterday’s sale, only auction and government veterinary officials, and representatives from the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, were allowed close contact with the livestock. The buyers, dressed from head-to-toe in hats, clean boiler suits, rubber boots and white plastic raincoats, had to forgo the usual close inspections of the cattle before the sale began.For the Orcadians, the resumption of the weekly cattle mart was more than just a lifeline for business. The social effect of the closure has been devastating. Since the beginning of the crisis, movement on the island has been curtailed because friends and neighbours fearful of spreading the disease kept their distance from other farms.Created with Sketch.How the 2001 foot-and-mouth outbreak brought Britain to a standstill Show all 26Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Around 150 dead cows that may have come in contact with foot-and-mouth disease are burnt on a funeral pyre at Great Warley Hall farm in Great Warley, Essex, 27 February 2001.

Fox hunting suspended24 February: slaughter of livestock begins27 February: agriculture minister\u0026nbspNick Brow, announces £200m compensation for farmers1 March: outbreaks in Northern Ireland and Scotland confirmed. Cost of epidemic put at £2.6bn8 March: more than 100 cases. Chief veterinary officer\u0026nbspJim Scudamore\u0026nbspsays outbreak will last ‘for a long time’13 March: first case in France. US and Canada ban European exports22 March: first case in Ireland. About 50 new cases reported daily28 March: Blair asks public to visit rural areas to limit cost to tourism2 April: Blair announces general election will be held on 7 June23 April: suspected case of human catching virus25 April: Phoenix the calf saved from cull3 May: Blair says UK is in ‘home straight’\u0026nbspafter 1,536 cases and 2.5 million slaughtered4 May: hundreds of footpaths reopened7 May: government announces £24m package to help businesses £625m expected for farmers3 July: cost to tourism put at up to £4bn18 July: Blair rules out public inquiry9 August: start of three independent inquiries20 August: first sale of live cattle since start of crisis, in Orkney islandsAt the Kirkwall sale, Jim Walker, president of the National Farmers’ Union Scotland (NFUS), warned that complacency could reignite the epidemic. “We have to remember that foot-and-mouth is still raging across the border in England,” he said. “The last thing we want is for it to start up again in Scotland, because then all the games are off, and we’ve got 3.5 million animals to shift between now and the end of the year.“We have been through hell and back and this is a small but important step forward. There’s much still to do to get out of the mess that foot-and-mouth has caused and get the farmers back to a kind of normality.”Steven Metcalf, chairman of Orkney Auction Mart, said: “The social effect of the mart reopening is good news. Early in the outbreak people were frightened to move around and weren’t visiting neighbours or friends. It is a good boost for the morale of agriculture and it is a step nearer to normal trading and normal life.”Although the slaughter of more than 800,000 animals north of the border has so far limited the number of confirmed cases to 187, Maria Limonci, spokeswoman for the NFUS, said Scottish farmers needed to see export bans lifted. “Around 40 per cent of the sheep produced in Scotland usually go out of the country and at present they have nowhere to go,” she said. “More farmers deal in sheep than cattle, and this was only one sale. It’s a huge step in the right direction but it doesn’t mean things are now OK.“We have to hope nothing goes wrong in next few days. Having 90 clear days would give Scotland grounds to put forward the proposal to Europe to allow exports to restart.”In England, continuing restrictions prompted 600 farmers yesterday to demand a public inquiry into the handling of the crisis.David Handley, head of the pressure group Farmers For Action who spearheaded last year’s fuel blockade, led a protest march from Hyde Park to Downing Street to hand in a petition condemning the government’s policy on dealing with the crisis and the failure to implement a vaccination strategy to prevent the spread of the disease.Although the turnout was lower than expected, protesters included farmers from foot-and-mouth hotspots in North Yorkshire, Cumbria and Devon and Cornwall.Up to 3,000 civil servants at the Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs held a one-day strike on 20 August 2001 over pay inequalities that followed formation of the new departmentThis article first appeared in The Independent on 21 August 2001We’ll tell you what’s true.

Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga.On Deerhunter’s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail. Death is everywhere on Why Hasn’t Everything Already Disappeared?, as much as others may refuse to see it.After a period of tumult, Sharon Van Etten’s fifth album is a reinvention. But beneath its hazy synths and electronics are songs of endurance and inner peace, of settling after a flurry of activity. 418 Bring Me the Horizon  – AmoBMTH frontman Oli Sykes wants to assert the fragility of the boundary between love and hate. Amo is a way of exploring that, even down to the title itself.518 Nina Nesbitt – The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will ChangeNesbitt is back with her second LP, switching to a brand of soul and R\u0026ampB-fused pop that feels bang on time, and suits her far better. The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will Change has slick, polished production from Fraser T Smith (Adele), Lostboy (Anne-Marie), Jordan Riley (Zara Larsson), and Nesbitt herself.This self-titled record, a loose but beautifully crafted collection of folk-rock songs, explores the kinds of anxieties intrinsic to the modern age – the longing to be at once noticed and invisible the paralysing effects of limitless information, and the desire to do good versus the desire to be seen doing good.The album is packed with personal confessions for the fans – “Arianators” – to pick over. It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (Helen Brown)The perma-brilliant James Blake has flooded his fourth album – Assume Form – with euphoric sepia soul and loved-up doo-wop. His trademark intelligence, honesty and pin-drop production remain intact. But the detached chorister vocals of a decade in which he battled depression have thawed to reveal a millennial Sam Cooke crooning: “Can’t believe the way we flow, way we flow, way we flow...”While he recognises his roots and includes plenty of nods to grime, AJ Tracey\u0027s magpie’s eye for a good melody or hook extends far beyond that. With the help of stellar producers like Cadenza (Kiko Bun), Swifta Beater (Kano, Giggs), and Nyge (Section Boyz, Yxng Bane), Tracey incorporates electronic music, rock, garage and even country on his most cohesive work to date.The album title of the year gives us an image of Brexit Britain trashed by Old Etonians David Cameron, Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, but the fifth studio work from the punk duo has more than social commentary to offer. There’s some of that, as vocalist Jason Williamson skewers documentary-makers who take advantage of the poor in “Kebab Spider” – “the skint get used in loo roll shoes” – but elsewhere this is a record that expands the idea of what Sleaford Mods could be.“Do you still have that photograph? Would you use it to hurt me?” asks Australian indie rocker Julia Jacklin, against the menacing throb of “Body”. The tension is stormy: imagine a mid-period Fleetwood Mac song, covered by Cat Power. It’s a masterclass in narrative songwriting.With praise from Kendrick Lamar, five EPs released by the time she was 21, tours with Lauryn Hill, collaborations with Gorillaz and two critically praised albums – including 2017’s excellent concept album Stillness in Wonderland – fans and critics alike wondered what else Little Simz could do to find the kind of mainstream success enjoyed by so many of her male peers.1318 Solange – When I Get HomeSolange Knowles has never been coy about the intent behind her music. Beautiful arrangements and seamless production notwithstanding, you get the sense, each time she drop a project, that it serves a distinct, zeitgeist-shifting purpose.1418 Foals – Everything Not Saved Will be Lost (Part 1)FoalsMerging their asymmetrical early math pop with the deep space atmospherics of Total Life Forever and Holy Fire, plus added innovations – ambient rainforest throbs on “Moonlight”, deadpan EDM on “In Degrees”, Afro-glitch Radiohead on “Café D’Athens” – they’ve created an inspired album of scorched earth new music that, in all likelihood, will only really be challenged for album of the year by Part 2. (Mark Beaumont)At her best, Sigrid throws out precision-tooled high notes like icicle javelins into vast, blue Scandi-produced skies. Then she growls like an Icelandic volcano preparing to disrupt western civilisation until we sort ourselves out.Tracks are at once astute and deeply personal in how they capture vignettes of everyday life and spin them into important lessons. “Black”, the most recent single from the record, considers what that word means to different people around the world, as well as to Dave. “Voices” has him singing over an old-school garage beat, fighting off personal demons.1718 Karen O and Danger Mouse – Lux PrimaLux Prima was born just over a decade ago from a drunken phone call from Karen O to Danger Mouse – real name Brian Joseph Burton – during which the pair vowed they would work on something together. It wasn’t until after O had given birth to her son, though, that recording finally began, and there is a beatific sense of contentment on songs like “Drown”, with its Kamasi Washington-like choirs and stately horns.This is an ambitious creation, meticulously crafted and assembled. For a start, the range of guest performers is a cornucopia of contemporary soul and hip-hop collaborators: vocalists Moses Sumney, Roots Manuva, Heidi Vogel, Grey Reverend and Tawiah strings player Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, and keyboardist Dennis Hamm – both of whom have worked with Flying Lotus and Thundercat.It’s not uncommon for an artist to be influenced by the place they grew up in.

I want someone at least answerable to me that I can say: \u0027F*** off, you\u0027re useless!While Daltrey\u0026nbspmay be confident about the impact (or lack of) that Brexit will have on the music industry, a number of prominent industry figures have been airing their concerns over the past year.\u0026nbspWhat will happen to the UK music industry after Brexit?In December 2018, artists including Annie Lennox, Paloma Faith, Pink Floyd\u0027s Nick Mason, Nadine Shah, Billy Bragg and Blur\u0027s Dave Rowntree, plus\u0026nbspmusic companies including Kilimanjaro Live and Beggars Group, and\u0026nbspindustry bodies like AIM, the Musicians Union and the Music Producers Guild, all signed a letter seeking more concessions against Brexit\u0027s potential impact on the industry.\u0026nbspThe letter was drafted by the pro-Europe group Music4EU, and stated: Brexit represents a significant threat to the UK\u0027s music industry. Leaving the EU customs union, single market, VAT area and regulatory framework (in whole or part) could devastate our global market leadership, and damage our freedom to trade, tour and to promote our artists and works.It continued: The music industry contributes £4.5bn to the UK economy, and our world-beating artists helped to create exports of over £2.5bn, which is growing fast in a global digital music business. Live music is at the heart of every artist\u0027s business and contributed around £1bn\u0026nbspto the UK economy, and freedom of movement is core to an artist\u0027s ability to tour and promote their art.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Parked next to each other, the model numbers spell out S3XY.The release ends a plan that began more than 10 years ago, when Tesla unveiled the Model S.He celebrated the move with a strange tweet on Twitter, posted soon before the car was unveiled at a launch event.Mr Musk has said that he would have liked to have the word written with the E, but that wasn\u0027t possible because Ford opened the copyright to the name.The new all-electric SUV known as the Model Y was unveiled to cheers from a hangar-packed crowd of Tesla customers, employees and members of the media welcomed a blue Model Y as it rolled out onto a stage next to the automaker\u0027s other models.\u0026nbspIt has the functionality of an SUV, but it will ride like a sports car, CEO Elon Musk told the crowd. This thing will be really tight on corners and we expect it will be the safest midsize SUV in the world by far.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 42Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.5G wireless internet is expected to launch in 2019, with the potential to reach speeds of 50mbsUber has halted testing of driverless vehicles after a woman was killed by one of their cars in Tempe, Arizona.

At this biennial event, the participating companies exhibit their latest service robotic technologies and componentsThe robot developed by Seed Solutions sings and dances to music during the Japan Robot Week 2016 at Tokyo Big SightThe Model Y seats seven and has a panoramic glass roof and a 15-inch (38-centimeter) touchscreen interface for accessing all the car\u0027s controls.\u0026nbspThe all-electric, mid-size SUV will start at $39,000 for the standard range version, which the company said can go 230 miles (370 kilometers) on a single charge. The long-range model, which starts at $47,000, has a range of up to 300 miles (483 kilometers) on a single charge - less range than the Model 3.\u0026nbspA dual-motor, all-wheel drive version of the Model Y starts at $51,000 while the performance version of the car, which boasts acceleration of 0-60 mph (97 kph) in as little as 3.5 seconds and a top speed of up to 150 mph (241 kph), starts at $60,000.The Model Y may be Tesla\u0027s most important product yet as it attempts to expand into the mainstream and generate enough cash to repay massive debts that threaten to topple the Palo Alto, California, company.\u0026nbspTesla got a huge boost toward ensuring its survival with the 2017 debut of its Model 3 sedan, but an SUV could have even more mass appeal, given how popular SUVs have become in the U.S., Europe and Canada.\u0026nbspThe U.S. market share for SUVs, crossovers, vans and pickup trucks stood at 69 percent in January, up from just 48.5 percent a decade ago, according to the research firm IHS Markit.\u0026nbspBut most SUVs still run on gasoline, leaving Tesla to cater to consumers looking for an all-electric alternative. The Model Y\u0027s main competition in this still-nascent market is likely to be the Mercedes-Benz EQC, and to a lesser extent, the Jaguar I-Pace, according to the research firm LMC Automotive.\u0026nbspThis could be Tesla\u0027s most profitable vehicle, with the giant asterisk that the company doesn\u0027t do some of the dumb things it has in the past, said Gartner analyst Mike Ramsey.\u0026nbspMany of Tesla\u0027s past follies have been tied to Musk\u0027s penchants for making grandiose promises that the company hasn\u0027t been able to keep in terms of production, delivery and execution.\u0026nbspProduction of the Model 3 quickly fell behind schedule as Tesla struggled to come up with adequate manufacturing capacity and it took much longer than anticipated to lower the sedan\u0027s starting price to the $35,000 level that Musk had been promoting. Instead, the lowest priced version of the Model 3 had been selling for $43,000 until a couple weeks ago when Tesla reached the promised price point by laying off thousands of workers and imposing other cost-cutting measures.\u0026nbspOverseeing the ramp-up of Model 3\u0027s production nearly drove Musk to exhaustion last year, a factor that may have contributed to a mystifying pattern of behavior that included tweeting about having lined up the financing for a potential buyout of Tesla. That misleading statement jeopardized his job and resulted in a $40 million settlement with stock market regulators.\u0026nbspMusk alluded to the troubled production of the Model 3 during his remarks to the crowd Thursday night.\u0026nbspBecause of extreme challenges with the Model 3 production, we have to basically allocate all resources to Model 3 production, because otherwise we\u0027re going to die, Musk said with a chuckle, eliciting laughs from the crowd.\u0026nbspHe then added: 2018 probably felt like aging five years in one. It was really intense.\u0026nbspTesla expects to deliver the performance, long range, rear-wheel drive and dual-motor, all-wheel drive versions of the Model Y in the fall of 2020. The standard version of the Model Y is expected to roll out in the spring of 2021.\u0026nbspAs with all electric vehicles, the distance that the Model Y can cover on a fully charged battery is likely to be one of its key selling points - or downsides. Teslapegged the Model Y\u0027s range at up to 300 miles compared to 325 miles for the Model 3.\u0026nbspTesla is hoping there will pent-up demand for the Model Y, nearly four years after Musk first began touting the company\u0027s plans to make an SUV. Bringing in early down payments for the vehicles would help Tesla generate the cash it needs to repay nearly $1.7 billion in loans that come due within the next 16 months.\u0026nbspThe company began the year with about $11 billion in debt and $3.7 billion in cash, but those figures presumably fell recently when it repaid about $920 million in bonds.\u0026nbspAnother $566 million in notes are scheduled to be repaid this November followed a $1.1 billion credit line in June 2020.\u0026nbspConsumers who plop down their deposits for the Model Y may have to cross their fingers for their vehicles to be delivered on schedule.\u0026nbspTesla\u0027s recurring production and delivery problems have resulted in consumers having to wait longer than they were originally told. Musk now says Tesla has worked out those issues.\u0026nbspRamsey, though, remains skeptical about whether the company will have adequate manufacturing capacity for the Model Y. He expects the Model Y\u0027s journey to the mass market to provide another wild ride for the company, its investors and customers.\u0026nbspUntil Elon is gone, Tesla is going to be a crazy company that occasionally makes breathtaking products, Ramsey predicted.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We’ve been speaking about it for seven years.”Mr Mughal accused social media firms of taking a “racialised” approach to extremism and letting the far-right slip through the net.Facebook has removed 1.5 million videos of New Zealand attackOldham man arrested for Facebook post ‘supporting’ New Zealand attack “We’re dealing with lives here and these guys are dealing with profits,” he added. “This is appalling.”Golding also paid for two adverts that ran on Facebook in recent days.Seen by up to 100,000 people, one advert urged viewers to follow Golding’s “official Facebook page”, and the other linked users to a Britain First petition.Golding’s two new pages were deleted after The Independent requested comment from Facebook.The internet giant has said it works to remove extremist content of all kinds through human moderators and artificial intelligence. But it\u0026nbsphas faced renewed calls to increase its efforts following the New Zealand attack.Britain First\u0026nbspadverts were permitted despite its official Facebook page and those of Golding and co-leader Jayda\u0026nbspFransen being deleted in March last year.The pair had just been jailed for religiously aggravated harassment, and pressure to de-platform Britain First mounted after its posts were linked to the Finsbury Park terror attack, murder of Jo Cox and a car ramming targeting Muslims.Britain First supporter who drove van at curry house jailedAt the time, a spokesperson for Facebook said the official Britain First page and those of Golding and Fransen had repeatedly broken its community standards.“There are times though when legitimate political speech crosses the line and becomes hate speech designed to stir up hatred against groups in our society,” a statement said.“They have repeatedly posted content designed to incite animosity and hatred against minority groups, which disqualifies the pages from our service.”Theresa May was among those welcoming the announcement, which anti-Islamophobia campaigners said was “long overdue”.Britain First styles itself as a “patriotic political party” and is currently applying to register with the Electoral Commission in Northern Ireland, while candidates campaign for English council seats.anti-Muslim hate crimeFounded in Swanley as a splinter group of the British National Party, members became known for launching so-called Christian patrols and mosque “invasions”, while campaigning against immigration and Islam.Britain First forged links with extreme nationalist movements across Europe, with Fransen attending a march in Poland where she called Islam a “cancer moving through Europe”, adding: “Our children are being bombed, our children are being groomed and our government does nothing.”The Finsbury Park terror attacker, Darren Osborne, read Britain First posts while planning his attempted massacre of Muslim worshippers, while neo-Nazi Thomas Mair repeatedly shouted “Britain first” while murdering Labour MP Ms Cox.The group gained international notoriety after videos posted from Fransen’s Twitter account were re-tweeted by Donald Trump in 2017, sparking a diplomatic row between Downing Street and the White House.After being released from prison last year, Golding and Fransen focused their activity on Northern Ireland and have been charged with several other offences relating to protests.Fransen announced she had left Britain First to start an “exciting new chapter” in January, leaving Golding as its leader.We’ll tell you what’s true.

It means the government\u0027s plan of trying to force its deal through by holding a third and even fourth Commons vote in the next two weeks appears to have been scuppered.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspTheresa May now has few options left. She can either try to seek a significant change to the deal, which is now all but impossible in the short term, or she will have to ask for a lengthy extension to Brexit in order to allow her to do so.\u0026nbspThe prime minister\u0027s deal now appears to be dead - or at least on\u0026nbsplife support until May, when the new parliamentary year starts. That is the point at which a fresh vote on the agreement could be held.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMs May will travel to Brussels on Thursday to ask for a delay to Brexit. She had hoped to do so having won a last-minute Commons vote on her deal, which would have allowed her to seek only a three-month extension. But with no deal in place, the prime minister will likely have to request a much longer delay, with nine months reported to be the length being considered.This is crucial. Responding to Hilary Benn, chair of the Commons Brexit committee, John Bercow appears to suggest that he would consider any substantial change to the Brexit deal to involve renegotiation\u0026nbspwith the EU. A simple change in the wording of the motion would not be enough to warrant another vote, he says.\u0026nbspIt means the government would probably not be able to hold another vote on its deal simply if it had won the DUP\u0027s support, or if attorney general Geoffrey Cox revised his legal advice. Instead, the deal itself would have to be fundamentally different. Hugely important.\u0026nbspJohn Bercow confirms, in response to a point of order from Jacob Rees-Mogg, that the rule about not having repeated Commons votes on the same issue only applies\u0026nbspwithin the same sitting\u0026nbsp- meaning another vote could be held when the next parliamentary year starts in May...This is the key part\u0026nbspfrom John Bercow - and it\u0027s hugely significant.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspSpelling out his position, he says:\u0026nbspIf the government wishes to bring forward a new proposition that is neither the same nor substantially the same as that disposed of by the house on 12 March, this would be entirely in order.\u0026nbspWhat the government cannot legitimately\u0026nbspdo is to resubmit to the House the same proposition or substantially the same proposition as that of last week, which was rejected by 149 votes.John Bercow\u0026nbspsays it was quite right and proper that MPs were given a second vote on Ms May\u0027s deal because the agreement being voted on had changed since the first vote, and therefore it could credibly be argued that it was a different proposition.\u0026nbspJohn Bercow says there are at least 11 occasions on which a Speaker has ruled that a vote cannot take place because\u0026nbspthe issue in questio\u0026nbsphas already been voted.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThat this hasn\u0027t happened since 1920 isn\u0027t a sign that the convention has ended but rather that it has been followed, he says.John Bercow is giving a statement in the Commons about whether MPs can be asked to vote\u0026nbspseveral times on Theresa May\u0027s Brexit deal.\u0026nbspHe says parliamentary rules state that a motion\u0026nbspthat has already been voted on by the Commons cannot be voted on against in the same parliamentary session.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThis convention is very strong and of long standing, dating back to 2 April 1604, he says.\u0026nbspHe says the rule is necessary to ensure the sensible use of the House\u0027s time and the proper respect for the decisions which it takes.Foreign secretary\u0026nbspJeremy Hunt\u0026nbspis in Brussels today for meetings with his EU counterparts.

The backstop\u0027s legal risk remains unchanged - we could be trapped indefinitely. I will vote against.The law as it stands says we are leaving on March 29 with or without a deal. I intend to honour that. It is now up to parliament if it wishes to ignore the result of the largest democratic exercise this country has ever seen.Theresa May could sacrifice her\u0026nbspchief Brexit negotiator in a bid to save her premiership, reports suggest.\u0026nbspMPs have reportedly been told that Olly Robbins, who has led negotiations with the EU,\u0026nbspwould be removed as soon as a withdrawal agreement is passed. The civil servant has been criticised by Tory Eurosceptics, who\u0026nbspclaimed he wants a softer Brexit than they would like.\u0026nbspAccording to the\u0026nbspEvening Standard, one Tory MP lobbied by No10 was told that the prime minister would “update her negotiating team” before the next phase of Brexit talks, while another was told that Mr Robbins\u0026nbspwould “go as soon as the deal is through”.We’ll tell you what’s true.

It is not compatible with WTO rules and it’s the start of a process where they’ll have to get approvals,” he told reporters in Dublin.“If they want to operate on the basis of being in defiance of well-established WTO rules well then that’s their decision. But ultimately that will not succeed because they will be taken to a panel of dispute settlement.”The commissioner, who is Ireland’s member on the EU’s executive, added: “I think the timing of it was unfortunate and it was a deliberate attempt to put Ireland more on the agenda, as if it wasn’t on the agenda already.”Brexit plan to slash tariffs after no deal condemned as ‘madness’He claimed that the “stunt” was an attempt by the UK to “weaken the unity of the EU26 in relation to the Irish backstop”.The UK plan would mean that 82 per cent of imports from the EU would be tariff-free, down from 100 per cent now.Imports from the rest of the world would be 92 per cent tariff-free, up from the current 56 per cent.The WTO’s “most favoured nation” rule, which the UK would have to follow after Brexit, means that countries must treat other WTO members equally in terms of tariffs and quotas, unless they have a recognised free trade agreement in place.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Coffins of victims of the crashed accident of Ethiopian Airlines are gathered during the mass funeral at Holy Trinity Cathedral in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.

Talks between ministers and the Unionist party are ongoing, but it is sticking to its red line that Northern Ireland cannot be treated differently from the rest of the UK in the exit deal.After the official legal advice accepted the UK could still be trapped in the Irish backstop – potentially introducing border checks in the Irish Sea – the prime minister has an uphill task.Meanwhile, 23 anti-EU Conservatives have signed a letter insisting they will never vote for the deal. A further seven pro-EU Tories opposed it last week.* What else can Ms May do to win the vote?Well, there’s always throwing hard cash at Northern Ireland – which the chancellor has declined to rule out. There is even talk of cutting air passenger duty as a carrot.Meanwhile, some Tories have suggested they could back the deal if the prime minister agreed to quit immediately afterwards, so a different leader can embark on the trade talks. She was said to be “surprised” by the suggestion.* What happens if there is no meaningful vote – or it is lost?Corbyn is helping Britain leave the EU – he always was a BrexiteerFrench EU minister names cat \u0027Brexit\u0027 because of its indecisive natureBrexit and climate change are a product of our failing democracyRoger Daltrey snaps over question on Brexit and the music industryFarage targeted with \u0027where\u0027s Nigel\u0027 signs on anti-Brexit marchThe prime minister says she will be forced to seek a “long” extension of Article 50 at the EU summit in Brussels on Thursday, which MPs would then vote on next week.It is unclear what “long” means, but it could be nine months or as long as 21 months – allowing the UK to carry out future trade talks with the EU as a member, rather than in a ‘transition period’ outside the bloc.* What about the European Parliament elections in May?Downing Street insists the UK would have to take part, if Article 50 is extended beyond the end of June. And MPs would have to vote to reinstate the unpopular elections.This is still a powerful card to play – so expect a ‘meaningful vote 3 (or 4)’, just days before the 29 March deadline if necessary, and a final arm-twist on MPs.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Political editor Joe Watts looks at what they might be promisingClick to followIndy Politics‘We are not discussing cash,’ insists DUP Westminster leader Nigel DoddsWhen Philip Hammond, Michael Gove, Theresa May’s deputy David Lidington and chief whip Julian Smith all sit down to make you an offer, you know it is going to be a serious one.This was the assembled cast earlier in the week as the government began the difficult business of trying to convince their Northern Irish partners to back the prime minister’s\u0026nbspBrexit deal – absolutely critical to its chances of passing through the Commons on Tuesday.The\u0026nbspDUP have long taken an absolutist line on refusing to back her withdrawal agreement because of the presence of the Irish backstop.But there has always been a suspicion in some quarters that the ferocity of their opposition is a handy facade, appearing to be tough-as-nails negotiators to get what they want.The fact that they are still in talks at all\u0026nbspshows that they are prepared to cut a deal regardless of whether the backstop in the agreement is changed, since that is no longer possible.Hammond says cash to Belfast will be reviewed amid Brexit ‘bung’ claimThat they agreed a confidence-and-supply deal with the government two years ago for an extra £1bn in spending in Northern Ireland also suggests they are not immune to the pull of hard cash.So taking in what can be gleaned from public statements and private steers, it looks like the offer being worked on can be ided into three categories: weakening the grip of the backstop\u0026nbspensuring Northern Ireland does not erge from the rest of Britain and financial sweeteners.The first might end up being addressed by a unilateral declaration from the UK government that it will, if needs be, use international law to get out of the backstop so hated by Eurosceptics.Created with Sketch.Tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit  Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.There will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersThe backstop is an arrangement that comes into play in December 2020 if no new trade deal has been signed by the UK and EU by then. Its purpose is ostensibly to ensure the Irish border stays open, but it would also have the effect of potentially keeping the UK in a customs union with Brussels indefinitely.While recent additions to the withdrawal agreement have strengthened the UK’s ability to leave the arrangement in some circumstances, the new declaration would commit a future British government to determinedly using international law to try and escape it.Corbyn indicates he could vote Leave in a second Brexit referendumThe government is said to be trying to address the ergence questions with a new “Stormont\u0026nbsplock”, some legal text to be enshrined in the yet-to-be-passed withdrawal agreement bill stating\u0026nbspthat any new regulation pushed upon Northern Ireland from Brussels while the UK remains in the backstop\u0026nbspwould be accepted or rejected by the whole UK as one.One area that falls into the financial sweetener category is the possibility that Northern Ireland would be allowed to reduce air passenger duty, which is currently lower in the Republic of Ireland, putting the north at a competitive disadvantage.Then there is likely to be the lump sum cash element, which will probably not become clear until a spending review later in the year. That will give ministers in London and politicians in Belfast cover to deny support has been bought in any way.The DUP –\u0026nbspand it is the Northern Irish party in the driving seat of these talks – has a propensity for cutting deals at the last second, so chances are there will be no sign of a breakthrough until late Monday or even Tuesday.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

This led other cities across Japan, including Tokyo and Osaka, to develop tactile paving in the following years.Seiichi Miyake\u0026nbspinvented tactile paving, also known as tenji blocksHowever, it was not until the 1990s that Miyake’s invention became commonplace in western countries such as the UK, US and Canada.The most common types of tactile paving include raised lines or domes. The former design indicates that it is safe to walk on a particular path, while the latter acts as a ‘stop’ sign to alert users to potential dangers.Created with Sketch.

The Kumbh Mela is a series of ritual baths by Hindu sadhus, or holy men, and other pilgrims at Sangam that dates back to at least medieval times. Pilgrims bathe in the river believing it cleanses them of their sins and ends their process of reincarnation. The event, which UNESCO added to its list of intangible human heritage in 2017, is the largest congregation of pilgrims on earth.

One man is seen kicking the boy while he is on the ground. On Sunday, the prime minister Scott Morrison told reporters: “The full force of the law should be applied to Senator Anning.” Victoria Police has said it is investigating the actions of the senator and his supporters as well as those of the teenager.One of those who tackled the boy was far-right activist Neil Erikson, who was controlling access to the building. During the scuffle to apprehend the boy, he shouted for reporters to be removed from the area. “Get the journalists out of here ... If you don’t like, get out,” Erikson said, according to The Sun-Herald newspaper. While the child was being held in a chokehold, one of Mr Anning’s supporters is heard telling him: “You are nothing but a weak human f***ing being, you f***ing prick.”New Zealand attacker’s gun club was reported to police, man claimsDeath toll from New Zealand terror attacks rises to 50Egg a day may increase heart attack risk, study saysThe teenager has won considerable support for egging the far-right senator. A crowd-funding page set up to help pay for any legal fees he may face has raised almost 30,000 Australian dollars (£16,000). The page initially said: “Money raised will go to EggBoi for: Legal fees. More eggs.”But it was later updated to say the 17-year-old “is committed to sending a majority of the money to the victims of the Christchurch terrorist attack.”In a video posted after the egging incident the boy urged people not to follow his example. “Don’t egg politicians. You get tackled by 30 bogans at the same time,” he said in the video, using Australian slang for an unsophisticated person. “I learnt the hard way,” he added. Mr Anning caused outrage after the attack in which 50 Muslims were killed in two mosques, with a statement calling Islam “the religious equivalent of fascism”.He said: “The real cause of bloodshed on New Zealand streets today is the immigration program which allowed Muslim fanatics to migrate to New Zealand in the first place.“Let us be clear, while Muslims may have been the victims today, usually they are the perpetrators. World-wide, Muslims are killing people in the name of their faith on an industrial scale.”He added: “The truth is that Islam is not like any other faith. It is the religious equivalent of fascism. And just because the followers of this savage belief were not the killers in this instance, does not make them blameless.”A Change.org petition to remove him from parliament has accrued almost a million signatures and has made it the biggest and fastest-growing petition ever hosted on the platform.

And this week will\u0026nbspsee a possible third rejection of Theresa May’s Brexit deal by the House of Commons.“He wakes me up every morning meowing to death because he wants to go out, and then when I open the door he stays put, undecided, and then glares at me when I put him out,” Ms Loiseau\u0026nbspsaid.Ms Loiseau is set to be the top candidate for Emmanuel Macron’s party in the upcoming European Parliament elections, where she will go head-to-head with Marine Le Pen, who is hoping to lead a far-right insurgency.France would block Brexit delay ‘without clear objective’, Macron saysThe minister has taken a tough and sometimes provocative line in Brexit negotiations so far, proactively shooting down UK proposals and warning of the risks of a no-deal Brexit.In October she controversially suggested that a no-deal Brexit would be better than Theresa May’s Chequers proposals for the EU, taunting the prime minister\u0026nbspher own phrase: “No deal would be better than a bad deal”.Her approach has echoed the tone set by her president Emmanuel Macron, who has warned he could block an Article 50 extension if the UK does not come up with new choices to justify it.The EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier has taken a minister tone, asking: “Why would we extend these discussions? The discussion on Article 50, that is done and dusted. We have the withdrawal agreement, it is there. That is the question asked and we are waiting for the answer to that.”Created with Sketch.

Year on year other techniques, including facial recognition, are getting better.“And as we use that technology to revisit and review that which we captured in the past, there’s every likelihood that something we already know will slip into position.”He also appeared to hint that her disappearance could be connected with human trafficking.He added: There is no doubt that human trafficking is a massive problem.“On the internet you can go into those dark places and say, This is who I am and this is what I do’.And you’re made to feel better about who you are because there’s so many others.In the eight-part film, Mr Gamble revealed that he initially thought that Gerry McCann could have been responsible for his daughters disappearance.He said he asked Gerry to write an appeal to Maddies abductor in a bid to encourage the British doctor to confess.However, the highly experienced police officer insists he soon realised that the childs parents were innocent.Mr Gamble said: Now I dont believe that Kate or Gerry McCann had anything to do with the fact their daughter has gone missing and potentially had been abducted.”Jim Gamble is a top detective deemed responsible for pushing child abuse to the forefront of Britains crime agenda.He became widely acclaimed for his brazen attitude and fearless response to such crimes.The Child and Exploitation and Online Protection Centrewhich launched under his lead in , became internationally recognised.But in a dramatic move, he resigned two years later, after Mrs May decided to join the group with the National Crime Agency.He is now known for being an expert in online and child crime, but his career started as an ordinary policeman.Although he was born in Bangor, Northern Ireland, he spent a lot of time in Singapore or moving around the UK as a child.His parents Lily and James worked for the RAF.After he rose through the ranks, Mr Gamble fast became the head of the Northern Ireland anti-terrorist intelligence unit in Belfast.He then became the Deputy Director General of the National Crime Squad, which soon joined with the Serious Organised Crime Agency.At this time, he led the UKs biggest ever police investigation into who viewed child internet abuse images.In , Mr Gamble was awarded the Queens Police Medal in the New Year Honours list.He became chief executive of the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre, but resigned in October , after then Home Secretary Theresa May merged the group with others into a new National Crime Agency.The documentary was released on Netflix on March .It explains how Portugal is the perfect location for child traffickers because it’s a well-placed gateway allowing abducted children to be instantly taken overseas by boat or driven across Europe.And it shows the moment a snfer dog trained to detect blood alerts its handler inside the McCanns apartment.The documentary is ided into eight parts and will be available in full to Netflix’s million subscribers around the globe.The hope is that it will raises awareness of the case for a new generation.The programme, to be released after months of delays and rows, suggests Madeleine could still come home alive.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Too many are holding out for something better.It’s not coming.Mrs May’s shock victories last night leave her battered agreement as still somehow the only viable option, evenshe has been humiliatingly reduced to asking the EU for a short delay.Kill it again next week and that’s it.The PM will be ordered to beg a long delay, swallowing any conditions Brussels wants to impose.Remainer MPs will take back control, as they failed to do last night by only two votes, and Tory support will collapse.Brexiteers should listen to Donald Trump dangling the carrot of a UK-US trade deal of “unlimited” scope. It is only even remotely possible under May’s deal. Remainers will prevent No Deal.Corbyn, meanwhile, plumbed pitul new depths of dishonesty last night.Having helped send the “people’s vote” crashing to a deserved defeat — to avoid offending his Leave voters — he absurdly reaffirmed his support for it to avoid offending Labour Remainers.Give it up, Jezza. No one is buying it.IT is grimly fitting that John Bercow is the ringmaster of the most discredited, broken, undemocratic Parliament of our letimes.This odious slug is not the impartial referee of Commons debates his predecessors were. He is the chairman and enabler of a smug Remoaner elite ­systematically trying to strip .million people of the Brexit they won in .For months he has abused his power on behalf of his mates. Yesterday he made it all too obvious, picking their flimsy amendments, yet rejecting one signed by  MPs from three parties designed to rule out a second referendum.His bias would have been the last straw in any ing Parliament.But Remain diehards don’t carehe violates his historic position as long as he helps them. Some will destroy Brexitour very democracy has to burn with it.Bercow is meant to be its custodian. Instead he will go down in infamy as the man who shredded his role’s reputation.We hope voters boot him and his friends out at the first opportunity. It may be the only democratic power millions have left.MOST sensible people would want thugs locked up automatically for a second kne-carrying offence.That’s why the Tories’ “two strikes and you’re out” rule made sense.

I got my two best friends to record me reading a scene from the movie and we stupidly decided to do it after a bottle of wine for Dutch courage.When I sent my audition tapes through I sounded more Irish than American and I missed out on a potentially huge role.I just wish I had put my mind to it more, but I didn’t really have an interest in acting back then.Kelly Rohrbach got the lead and looked amazing in it. The film wasn’t actually that great . . . but it would have been pretty cool to work alongside Zac Efron and The Rock.SET the controls for the best day of my childhood – Saturday July , , a glorious day of sunshine and showers when England won the FIFA World Cup Final against West Germany.Every second of it is etched in my mind – Nobby dancing, Bobby Moore’s golden aura and Kenneth Wolstenholme’s commentary.“There are people on the pitch – they think it’s all over – it is now!”It was a day to make you believe in magic.I watched it, aged , with my mum – my dad worked every weekend – and I squeaked “F***” when the Germans equalised to make it - at the end of normal time.It was the only time in my le that I ever said “F***” in front of my mum.She forgave me immediately “as it’s the Germans,” she said, the Blitz still fresh in her memory after  years – and went to put the kettle on as we settled down for extra time.It was a day of excitement, pride, patriotism, passion and pure, undiluted drama.WHEN I was a kid I wanted to be an astronautand also an RAF fighter pilot.I was lucky enough to be taken up in a Phantom jet in September , when I helped launch the annual air show at RAF Leuchars, in Fe.Awesome is an overused word, but not in this case.I was given training, poured into a G-suit and for the next hour I had the thrill ride of a letime.Obviously I did nothing but sit there enthralled while not touching any important buttons.We pulled three Gs, which was a bit like being cuddled by a gorilla, but women withstand G-Force better than men and, unlike Jeremy Clarkson, I managed not to throw up.At one point I was upside down and flying so fast I felt I had left my body behind.I wish I could go back in time to relive that moment again and again.I HAVE done a lot of really stupid things – often on purpose. When I told my mum I was leaving college to join a band she told me not to be stupid. But that actually worked out OK.For sure I’ve taken plenty of bad advice over the years and committed countless, colossal clangers.If I could go back in time I absolutely would but not to sort out any of my messes.I’d like to make something that was totally brilliant even more mind-blowingly brilliant than it was to start with.It would be to the summer of . I’d just got my new racing bike. That bike was my first true taste of freedom.I spent the whole summer tearing all over Dorset with my two best friends.I’m not sure anyone ever felt quite as free in the moment as that -year-old boy racing a new bike down a massive hill as fast as possible in the sunshine.There’s no way I’d let my kids do it now. Far too many cars on the road. But I can remember exactly how it felt, clear as anything. Woo-hoo.I WOULD go back to the autumn of , when I was living in New York.My flatmate was in real estate and he had got wind of an apartment building, jointly owned by the residents, that had gone bankrupt.He said you could now buy two-bedroom apartments in this building for as little as ,. It was a risk, sinceit didn’t come out of bankruptcy I’d lose everything.But the upside was thatit came out of bankruptcy, the flat would immediately multiply in value. He was going to buy one. Did I want to buy the one next door I owned a flat in London and could have drawn down on my mortgage to borrow the money.I ummed and ahhed about it and, eventually, chickened out. You can probably guess the rest.My flatmate bought an apartment for ,, the building’s finances were restored and it’s now worth .million.I would like nothing more than to use a time machine to buy the flat next door. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Starting over is just not an option — andNo Deal is unpalatable toMPs, then the obvious solution is to support leaving with a deal.Secondly, a y delay puts us in the awkward position of having to stand candidates for the European Parliament election.This would be a humiliation and the public would be right to be furious.Worse still, as part of an offer for a long extension, the EU may require us to hold a second referendum.Thirdly, we came dangerously close to a backbencher coup — where those who did not win the right to govern wish to take over the role of government, in an extra-ordinarily unconstitutional move that would overturn years of parliamentary conventions with the sole aim of stopping Brexit.Make no mistake, their motives were not to deliver a dferent Brexit or to honour the result of the referendum — it would be to stop Brexit in its tracks. All the while, our hard-working voters and our long-suffering businesses just want to get on with le beyond Brexit.In a survey by market researchers Survation, the majority of Conservative voters said they would take Theresa May’s deal over every other option — No Deal, a long delay or another referendum.There is, however, an obvious solution to all this — and every parliamentarian can choose to take it.I spend my days at the legislative coalface as Leader of the House of Commons. I know what we need to get done to leave the EU in a smooth fashion — and I also know that we do not need is a y extension.While the negotiators have been hard at it in Brussels, I’ve been preparing for and delivering the legislative changes needed for Brexit to make sure our laws work when we leave.So I know thatwe get this deal passed next week, we can deliver Brexit quickly — and potentially much faster than the end of June.If both Houses — the Lords and the Commons — acknowledge the country’s desire to get this settled, we can crack on with passing the Withdrawal Agreement Bill.A short extension to get the legislation finalised is far better than a long one — which would come with unacceptable conditions we have no control over.In setting out the parliamentary timetable, I will, as I always do, fully respect Parliament’s desire to scrutinise and debate.But I will also be looking to move quickly, so Parliament can turn its attention to the wealth of opportunity that awaits us when we leave the EU.As I said at the dispatch box this week, this is an important time for Parliament and there have been dficult decisions to make.With such strongly held views across the House, it’s vital that we continue to listen to each other with respect and understanding.Over the centuries, the country has looked on as Parliament has faced historic decisions.Even in the most challenging of times, we have pulled together and put our duty above all .So I hope the House will now find a consensus that delivers on the will of the people to leave the EU as close to March  as possible.We can then, finally, turn our eyes to the bright future ahead of us and seek to reinstate confidence in British politics.Let’s do our duty — and do our country proud.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We all stand united as brothers and sisters”.Her defiant words are a fitting epitaph for the New Zealand victims: “We must tell them you will not win.”ENOUGH is enough on the Brexit shambles. We want out as soon as possible.A poll today shows that  per cent want PM Theresa May to ignore MPs and leave the EU without a deal.Buther exit plan does not get past Parliament, Britain’s departure could be postponed for two years. As Andrea Leadsom says, a y delay would be humiliating.MPs must unite behind the deal on the table — or waste the chance of a letime to wave goodbye to Brussels.Sort it. Anything  is a betrayal.TRAGIC Jade Goody’s most worthwhile legacy is sadly being squandered.The -year-old’s death from cervical cancer ten years ago was a wake-up call for millions of women. But the smear test rates that shot up after she lost her le have now plummeted to record lows.Backed by this newspaper, the NHS is urging women to take the le-saving test.So our message is don’t delay, go today.

It would be an Establishment stitch-up, with serious consequences for the public’s faith in democracy for decades to come.For those Labour supporters who voted to leave, it’s a reminder that the party’s MPs are desperate to overturn the result of the ‘People’s Vote’ in June .There are some notable exceptions. But the vast majority are determined to frustrate Brexit, regardless of the result of our biggest ever democratic exercise.Labour is now far more interested in north London than the north of England.The threat of Remainers wrecking our departure gets more pressing by the day.Brexiteers must accept reality and back the best Brexit possible: the PM’s deal.MIKE Thalassitis’ suicide is a wake-up call for Britain’s TV companies — and the country at large.Suicide is the single biggest killer of men under  in the UK.

I under­stand these talks were broadly positive. One Cabinet minister close to the process tells me the chances of the DUP backing the deal are, “a bit better than :. I’d put it at :”.What is winning round the DUP is the promise of putting into the Withdrawal Agreement Bill, which puts the deal into UK law, a requirement that there be no ergence between Northern Ireland and Britain.The Withdrawal Agreement Bill would be so-called superior legislation. This would mean it would trump any other bill, giving the DUP some reassurance that the next Prime Minister couldn’t let regulatory dferences emerge between the rest of the UK and Northern Ireland.Parliament will also be given a scrutiny power over the backstop, allowing it to vote every few years on how it is operating.At the same time, the UK Government will seek to offer the DUP some reassurance about this country’s ability to get out of the backstop. I am told thatAttorney General Geoffrey Cox’s legal advice had been dferent, then the DUP would have been on board this week. One Cabinet minister tells me:“Geoffrey did cost the DUP.”To sweeten the deal for the DUP, there will be money and ladles of respect. The DUP want a new “policy package” to replace their confidence and supply deal with the Tories which runs out in June.To say that these negotiations are delicate would be an understatement. I am told, “ people put too much pressure on them, there’s a danger that they’ll bolt”.But with this Speaker and this Parliament any hopes for a better one, or for a clean break, seem for the birds.As James Forsyth says, the “big beasts” of the backbenches must show some leadership.Boris Johnson, Dominic Raab and Iain Duncan Smith were leading lights of the Leave campaign, but by not backing the deal they are now imperilling the whole project. They won’t be forgiven.Good card players know when to hold ’em and know when to fold ’em.Wise politicians must be no dferent.Butthe Government can get the DUP, it is confident that Jacob Rees-Mogg will then come on board.Despite voting against the deal on Tuesday, European Research Group chairman Rees-Mogg left himself a ladder to climb down, repeat­edly declaring that the only reason to vote for this deal wasBrexit was in genuine danger.After the Commons voted against No Deal and for an extension, it clearly is.The big question is how many Brexiteer rebels climb down Jacob’s ladder. Downing Street think there are  to  Tory diehards who won’t vote for the deal even with the DUP on board.The precise number is absolutely crucial. As one senior Downing Street source explains: “If it is at the lower end of that scale, it can be made up with Labour. If it is at the higher end, it can’t be.”There are, I’m told, between  and  Labour MPs prepared to back a deal but onlyit has a realistic chance of passing. Influential figures in the Cabinet are urging No to make the vote on Tuesday a free vote, to make it easier for Labour MPs to support it.If the deal doesn’t pass on Tuesday, then Mrs May will have to go to the European Council on Thursday and beg for a full-on extension to the Article  process. I am told she is dreading this personal and national humiliation.The Commons should spare her and, more importantly, the country, that.RIGHT now there is little sign that either Boris Johnson or Dominic Raab are going to move and back the Brexit deal.Both feel that their reservations about it are still too strong.But there is a danger for them both –  Tory Eurosceptics voted against the deal on Tuesday night.Whatever happens with the DUP, that number will drop a bit when the meaningful vote comes back for a third time.The danger for Boris and Raab is thatthey walk through the lobbies with this shrinking group, they will start to be seen as purely factional candidates, and purely factional candidates rarely win leadership contests.Already some of those who backed Boris last time and had been planning to do so again are peeling away.Now is a moment that calls for bigness.If either Boris or Raab were prepared to say that – despite their reservations – they were going to try to get the deal over the line, because Brexit is only going to get softer otherwise, they would show they have the selflessness necessary to lead.WHEN your voice is going, what’s the last thing that you want  A meeting with a heavy smoker.But that is what Theresa May had to contend with on Monday after she flew to Strasbourg for last-minute talks with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker.By Wednesday, Mrs May’s voice was so bad that No had a plan for Andrea Leadsom,  to take over halfway through PMQsher voice gave out completely.TO get people to do things you need both a carrot and a stick.But the problem for the Government is that its warnings to Brexiteer rebels are all stick.It is pointing out that Brexit will only get softerMPs don’t vote for the deal. This is right, but these MPs need a positive inducement too.One Tory who carries messages from Theresa May’s Downing Street to the Brexiteer rebels tells me: “If she offered to go, she would get very close and possibly do it.“It unlocks those people whose self-perception is that they don’t give in to blackmail.” This source continues: “If the DUP move, Jacobmoves,Jacob moves others follow, but you don’t quite get there without the carrot.”Mrs May could leave with dignity, having secured an orderly Brexit and having managed to avoid a split in the Tory party.She wouldn’t need to leave the next day, either.But just in time to ensure that a new Prime Minister had their feet firmly under the desk before a new European Commission comes into office this autumn.One reason why an indication that May will go is so important is that there is assumption she will try to staythe withdrawal agreement passes.One Cabinet minister tells me: “If she gets a deal through, she won’t be able to resist clinging on.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I replied that no ruling was necessary at that stage but that one might be required at some point in the future. Subsequently members on both sides of the house and indeed on both sides of the Brexit argument have expressed their concerns to me about the house being repeatedly asked to pronounce on the same fundamental proposition.  The th edition of Erskine May states on p that, and I quote, a motion or an amendment which is the same in substance as a question which has been decided during a session may not be brought forward again during that same session. It goes on to state that, and I quote, attempts have been made to evade this rule by raising again with verbal alterations the essential portions of motions which have been negatived. Whether the second motion is substantially the same as the first is finally a matter for the judgement of the chair. This convention is very strong and of long standing, dating back to  April . Last Thursday [Chris Bryant] quoted examples of occasions when the ruling had been re-asserted by four dferent Speakers of this House, notably in , , ,  and . Each time the Speaker of the day ruled that a motion could not be brought back because it had already been decided in that same session of Parliament.  Indeed Erskine May makes reference to no fewer than  such rulings up to the year . One of the reasons why the rule has lasted so long is that it is a necessary rule to ensure the sensible use of the House’s time and the proper respect for the decisions which it takes. Decisions of the House matter. They have weight. In many cases they have direct effects, not only here but on the lives of our constituents. Absence of Speaker intervention since  is attributable not to the discontinuation of the convention but to general compliance with it. Thus, as Erskine May notes, the Public Bill Office has often disallowed Bills on the ground that a Bill with the same or very similar long title cannot be presented again in the same session. So far as our present situation is concerned, let me summarise the chronology of events. The draft EU Withdrawal Agreement giving effect to the deal between the government and the EU was published on November  and the agreement itself together with the accompanying political declaration on the future relationship received endorsement from the European Council on November . The first scheduled vote on what I will hereafter refer to as ‘the deal’ was due to take place on December . However, on December  the vote was postponed after  speeches had already been made over three of the five days allotted for the debate. That postponement was not caused by me, nor by the House, but by the government. Indeed I pointed out at the time that this was deeply discourteous to the House and I suggested that the permission of the House for that postponement should be sought. Regrettably, it was not. Over five weeks later, following a further five day debate, the first meaningful vote was held on January , which the government lost by a margin of  votes - the largest in parliamentary history. Subsequently the second meaningful vote was expected to take place in February but, once again, there was a postponement. It finally happened only last Tuesday, March . The government’s motion on the deal was again very heavily defeated. In my judgement that second meaningful vote motion did not fall foul of the convention about matters already having been decided during the same session. This was because it could credibly be argued that it was a dferent proposition from that already rejected by the House on January . It contained a number of legal changes which the government considered to be binding and which had been agreed with the EU after further intensive discussions. Moreover the government’s second meaningful vote motion was accompanied by the publication of three new documents - two issued jointly with the EU, and the third a unilateral declaration from the UK, not objected to by it. In procedural terms it was therefore quite proper that the debate and the second vote took place last week.The government responded to its defeat as it had promised to do by scheduling debates about a no deal Brexit and an Article  extension on March  and March  respectively.It has been strongly rumoured, though I have not received confirmation of this, that third and even possibly fourth meaningful vote motions will be attempted. Hence this statement, which is designed to signal what would be orderly and what would not. This is my conclusion. If the government wishes to bring forward a new proposition that is neither the same - nor substantially the same - as that disposed of by the House on March , this would be entirely in order. What the government cannot legitimately do is to re-submit to the House the same proposition - or substantially the same proposition - as that of last week, which was rejected by  votes. This ruling should not be regarded as my last word on the subject. It is simply meant to indicate the test which the government must meet in order for me to rule that a third meaningful vote can legitimately be held in this parliamentary session.

Speaking on LBC radio, he said that he would wait to see how the DUP decided to vote before reaching a conclusion. No deal is better than a bad deal but a bad deal is better than remaining in the Europe Union, he said. Mrs Mays deal, however bad it is, means that we are legally outside the European Union. If we remain, we will never leave. We have got as close to leaving as we will ever get under these circumstances. If it is thwarted now no one is ever going to allow us another chance to have a vote. The whole weight of British establishment opinion will prevent that ever happening again.   Rees-Mogg said his dream option would be a no-deal exit on March  but that he felt May - a former supporter of EU membership who won the premiership in the turmoil that followed the Brexitreferendum - would seek to stop a no-deal. The question people like me will ultimately have to answer is: can we get to no-deal instead  If we can get to no-deal instead, that is a better option... but I am concerned the prime minister is determined to stop a no-deal. Mays deal, a bid to keep close trading and security ties with the EU while leaving the blocs formal political structures, was defeated by  votes in parliament on Jan. , and by  votes on March .   If she could get the deal approved after the biggest parliamentary defeat for a government in modern British history, it would mark a spectacular and surprising turnaround and by far the biggest achievement of her crisis-riven tenure.To get her deal through parliament, May must win over at least  lawmakers - dozens of rebels in her own Conservative Party, some Labour lawmakers, and the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party , which props up her minority government.The biggest issue is the so-called Northern Irish border backstop, an insurance policy aimed at avoiding post-Brexitcontrols on the United Kingdoms border with EU-member Ireland. ManyBrexiteers and the DUP are concerned the backstop will trap the United Kingdom in the EUs orbit indefinitely, and have sought guarantees it will not.

Furious campaigners say the letters have had a devastating impact on benefit claimants who suddenly have zero income for months. And they mean sick and disabled people are turning to foodbanks to avoid a very real threat of homelessness, a charity warned. The row erupted after the government tweaked a standard letter that is sent to GPstheir patients are refused Employment and Support Allowance . Under DWP rules, people who appeal an ESA decision can continue to claim a basic assessment rate, worth up to £. a week, while their appeal is being carried out. To do that they must provide evidence such as a fit note from a GP. However, the new-style letter tells GPs you do not need to provide any more fit notes to the named patient.  The DWP today insisted the letter wording was not intended to dissuade GPs from issuing fit notes. But it has meant people are struggling to obtain fit notes from their GPs, according to welfare advice charity the Zacchaeus  Trust. The charity helped one man, Louis, who was hurled into debt, turned to food banks and faced eviction due to the misleading DWP letter to his GP. ZT chief executive Raji Hunjan said: It is not for the DWP to interfere with the GP and their patient. Sending these letters directly to the GP, without even informing the patient, is putting doctors in a position which both undermines their role and puts their patients at risk. The impact of these letters can be devastating.  We have seen how they lead to our clients who are seriously ill, suddenly have zero income, other benefits are comprised, become reliant on foodbank vouchers and loans, and face a very real threat of homelessness. Ella Abraham, the charityaposs Policy and Campaigns Officer, added: “We have launched a petition to ensure that these backdoor policies are brought to light. We see time and again, dferent government departments attempts to force doctors into positions where they must act as benefits assessors or border guards. The DWP must withdraw the letters. The new-style letter is a sharp departure from the previous version, which explicitly told GPs you may have to give your patient new medical statementsthey appeal.  The new letter prints a link to further guidance for GPs, but advice about appeals is missing from the text of the letter itself. Commons Work and Pensions Committee chief Frank Field raised the issue in January, saying: The letter is sent to the GP of every claimant who is refused ESA. As a result, GPs are ceasing to issue fit notes. There is a risk that this change will leave severely ill and disabled claimants unable to obtain ESA to which they are entitled pending appeal. Shadow minister for disabled people Marsha De Cordova said the misleading letters from the DWP to GPs were leaving sick and disabled people close to destitution. Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, the chair of the Royal College of GPs , told thethe letters “threaten the long-standing trust that patients have in their family doctor.” However, the DWP insisted the Royal College was one body that helped clear the letters for publication. The DWP appeared to concede it will consider changes to the letter. A DWP spokesperson said: “These letters simply inform GPs when a claimant has been found fit for work and are not intended to dissuade them from issuing fit notes for ESA appeal purposes, to claim otherwise is inaccurate. “We are committed to ensuring our communication is clear, which is why the wording of this letter was cleared by both the British Medical Association and the Royal College of General Practitioners. However, we will of course consider feedback when revising the letter.” "},{"url":null,"title":"kevin maguire time running out","story":"NewsopinionKevin Maguire: Time is running out for Theresa May and paralysed ParliamentThe stumbling PM and Tory hardline Brextremists DUP reactionaries have gted the EU unprecedented momentary power over BritainShareCommentsByKevin MaguireAssociate editor:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR NewsopinionTheresa May has been dealt a series of blows in the Commons in the past weeks \"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTo foist a third and possibly fourth vote on  MPs while denying million people a second referendum is gshyrotesque hypocrisy from a Prime Minister for the few not the many. Time is running out for incompetent Theresa May and with Parliament paralysed, Brexit isn’t happening a week on Friday. Yet I’ll be honest and admit I don’t know what happens after that or even later this week when unpredictable events shape the country’s destiny for decades to come. Nobody does – including May and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, as well as our neighbours. The stumbling PM and Tory hardline Brextremists DUP reactionaries have gted the EU unprecedented momentary power over Britain.   We could be in Europe for another three months or two years. We might stay for ever or be shykamikazes crashing out without a deal. May is hoping sufficient revolting Tories, DUP fundamentalists and Labour faint-hearts swallow their pride and principles to finally endorse her twice-rejected plan tomorrow. Irrelevance and insularity for a poorer and weaker Britain, and other workers’ jobs, are a price these shycharlatans are shamefully prepared to pay for an easier le. My preference is for a People’s Vote to let us, the electorate, be judge and jury on the real choice after the lies of three years ago under a previous Prime Minister in an earlier Parliament.   Democracy is the answer to shyshyWestminster’s deadlock but Brextremists justiably suspect the poundmillion-a-week question in  would result in a decision to remain in Europe. Corbyn is supporting a another referendum – though keeping open the door to vote leave – as proposed by Labour MPs Phil Wilson and Peter Kyle. But the signs are the House of Commons doesn’t want a second poll. So Groundhog May is sticking to her mulish game of Brexit blackmail. National interest is buried by the self-interest of an enfeebled Tory leader determined it is her way or no way. When history is written, it will be harsh on May.

Eimear Tallon told how she couldnt breathe, was frightened, stressed and hysterically screaming as she became caught up in the incident in Cookstown, Northern Ireland.She recalled how it began with pushing and shoving but soon ended with bodies piled on top of each other. People were scratching, biting and grabbing anything they could to pull themselves up to breathe, Eimear said. I think that’s what really shows the seriousness of it all, people were literally fighting for their lives. Three young people - two boys and a girl - were killed in the incident at the Greenvale Hotel in County Tyrone last night. A teenage girl who died has been identied as Lauren Bullock. Euphoria Allstar Cheerleading group paid tribute to her saying they are absolutely devastated. Lauren, , was a student at St Patricks College in Dungannon and Principal Catherine McHugh described her as a beautul girl, a shining light in our school community. The tragedy struck as dozens of young people queued outside the venue and attempted to gain entry to the event. Unfortunately, a friend of mine who I had seen in the line and chatted to minutes beforehand has died, Eimear said.  Eimear, speaking out in a Facebook post that has been shared more than , times, said: It started with pushing and shoving but everyone was still laughing and having a good time. Then the literal crushing started. The people on the outside of this line were so determined to get in they felt the need to not only push us against the wall but push with all their strength. No matter how much we screamed and pushed back, there was no movement. She said two of her friends fell to the floor and there was no room for her to pull them back up. Although she screamed to try and alert people, there was no movement, as some still hadnt realised what had happened. Eimear said: At this point I thought my friends were going to die, I was standing up and I couldn’t breathe so I couldn’t imagine how they felt. I was hysterically screaming for people to move but it was only the people around me who knew the seriousness.   The partygoer said she then also fell, but there were people beneath her. Soon there were also bodies on top of her. She said: As I looked down I could see multiple bodies underneath me and as I looked up I could see multiple bodies on top of me. It was the most traumatic, frightening and stressful moment of my le. She said at one point she closed her eyes and accepted what was going to happen but she soon opened them when she felt an elbow to her throat. Eimear said that soon, even with her eyes open, she couldnt see. It felt like the incident lasted forever, she said, but eventually she could feel bodies being dragged out. She too was helped out by another youngster in the line.  Eimear said: I rang my parents to explain what had happened and let them know I was okay, I then tried to find my friends. I ran about frantically. I seen a young boy lying motionless trying to be resuscitated by the ambulance crew and I seen his friends screech as they found out he wasn’t going to make it. The Police Service of Northern Ireland said: Three people have now sadly died from injuries sustained during an incident at the Greenvale Hotel in Cookstown last night. The three teenagers who died are a -year-old girl, a -year-old boy and a -year-old boy. A -year-old girl is in a stable condition in hospital. A further two teenagers were treated for injuries they received during the incident. First and foremost our thoughts this morning are very much with the families of the three young people who passed away and those who were injured. It is heart-breaking that an event which should have been fun for these youngsters on St Patrick’s night should end in such a terrible tragedy.  Police said the investigation is at an early stage and the cause of the incident is currently unknown. The statement added: There are reports of a crush at the scene and initial enquiries indicate that a large group of young people were waiting to enter a disco. We also have reports of some fighting after the incident commenced and at least one person has reported that they were assaulted. We are continuing to interview people who were there to establish the full facts and would appeal to anyone who witnessed what happened to contact police on  ext .

Andrew Taylor, , and his friend Rhys Pepper, , were set upon by a group of  to  people as they drank at the Red Lion Pub in St Columb Major on Saturday February . Andrew was attacked with a kne and required stitches in two wounds to his ear and neck, which were just millimetres from his carotid artery.Rhys, a heavy plant operator from Plymouth, also needed surgery to rebuild his face following the brutal assault, CornwallLive reported .Andrew said: We just sat in the Red Lion pub and got a few drinks. No one was using the pool table so we played some pool. There were no problems right until about pm. We let other people play, there were no altercations. Then it was time for the pub to close. As we walked to the entrance, everyone  had vacated. Then, someone rugby tackled Rhys from inside the pub, out into the car park, and then they all descended on him. We reckon there were  to  people, it wasn’t just men, there were females there as well. I didn’t see any of this because I went to pick up my shopping. Then as I walked out the door, bang, someone tried to cut my ear off.  Andrew believes that they may have been attacked because the assailants did not realise that they were locals. On the night Rhys was in the toilet in the pub and someone asked where he was from, and he said Plymouth, he said. So they’ve assumed that we were two people not from the area. Andrew alleges that after the first blow, a member of staff closed the side door and locked it instead of trying to help. The Red Lion told Cornwall Live it did not wish to comment on the incident as there is an ongoing police investigation in place. Andrew added: I then knocked one guy out, and he’s dropped. More then descended to me away from Rhys. We managed to use the lane to run back outside the pub. I’ve managed to keep them all in front of me, but Rhys had them all around him. In the lane, I took a second kne strike. Then it started to really bleed out. Rhys was still scrapping, trying to fend for himself. All we were thinking about was trying to get out of there. Rhys managed to join me, and then they stopped. We think it’s because of the CCTV camera.    Andrew was bady hurt sustaining a swollen face and a large .cm cut on his ear and neck. One wound was about cm away from the main artery, he said. I was that close to dying. I think they wanted to cut my ear off as a trophy. They confirmed it was a kne at the hospital. Rhys had to have his face completely rebuilt and fixed, and he had a gash over one of his eyes. Andrew said that he called emergency services numerous times after the pair escaped from the scene. He said: They told us to ring , even though we were pouring out with blood. I tried phoning , and it just rang and rang. The police said they were going to look over the recording.    Andrew says he recognised some of the attackers and has given their names over to police. Rhys’ father, Mark, revealed that his son is autistic and says he has struggled to cope in the aftermath of the attack. Initially, he wouldn’t leave his flat, Mark said. I’ve popped round there a couple of times and told him that he can’t stay in all the time. He said he keeps looking over his shoulder and worrying. It knocked his confidence right back, and I think we are going to get him some counselling. He was in pieces for a while. It’s still affecting him now, he’s really angry about it and can’t understand why it happened. He wouldn’t be able to sense that there was something going in that pub that night, he just takes everyone at face value. He’s a vulnerable adult. He’s gradually starting to go out a bit more, but it’s basically just to work. He doesn’t even want to go out in Plymouth, he doesn’t feel confident enough. I don’t knowhe’ll ever go down thereagain.    We want justice for the two lads, he added. We complained that there was a total mishandling of the whole incident, not only on the night, but since. There’s a whole lack of communication, and no information being transmitted to us. We thought we were getting nowhere with police, so we wrote to the Home secretary and to Mr Sawyer , to our local MP and our local councillor. The following morning after the email to Mr Sawyer, we finally had a telephone call from an officer about coming out to the house. The injured men say they are unsatisfied with the police investigation - and Andrew claims he had had to wait up to two weeks before giving police his version of events.  He said: All I want is an officer to say, ‘weaposre dealing with it, weaposre doing something’. All it takes is a call to say this is where we are up to. Andrew said he is not hopeful about getting justice, and now fears going into St Columb, where the family has lived for  years. He said: If nothing gets done, am I safe to go to the Co-op  After it happened I walked around St Columb, and I was looking at every person, wonderingI might be attacked. You just don’t know. They all know me, but I don’t know all of them. There were just too many. Now I can’t go into my local town. The police already told me not to go back to that pub, but it’s not look I can go where, there’s nowhere around, Newquay is a £ taxi away. His father added: We don’t want this to be happening to anybody , certainly not in a local community like St Columb Major. Is it safe to go out for a drink in St Columb Major  Is it safe for the numbers for the numbers of visitors that come down  There are a couple of camp sites around St Columb Major, and those people come into the town for a drink.  Andrew’s mother is really nervous about going into St Columb now. The attack on the boys was so unprovoked, but certainly planned and premeditated, and we live in that community. Police have been appealing for witnesses to the incident, which happened on Saturday, February  between .pm and .pm, outside the Red Lion pub on Fore Street in the town, since March . A spokesman for Devon and Cornwall Police has confirmed that investigations are continuing and that no arrests have been made at this time.

After my lunch, I was getting quietly confident that this challenge wouldnt be as bad as I thought. My first evening meal was an unappealing concoction of pasta, chopped tomatoes and fried spam. I even had to wash out my frying pan and start again when I realised I shouldnt have used oil! The finished product looked bad and tasted worse, so I used up my rice pudding on my first night to take the taste away. I went to bed miserably awaiting my breakfast the next morning. Day Two   I almost considered skipping breakfast completely because I really wasnt looking forward to my second morning of oats and UHT milk. But I knew that without them, Id really struggle to get through my day at work. If Id had some sugar, le would have been a million times better. The only plus was, again, the glass of orange juice afterwards that washed away the taste of the oats. Day twos lunch consisted of a can of chicken and mushroom soup .  Youre probably noticing quite a lot of repetition already - and this was the hardest part of the challenge, not the low quality of the food. My body was craving something - anything - dferent. And by this point the sugar craving had really kicked in. I dont normally drink fizzy drinks but suddenly I had the biggest thirst for Coca-Cola. After yesterdays spam concoction, I wasnt in a rush to make my dinner - even though I was really hungry. But I soon gave in to the pangs and poured out my pasta. This time, I added some sweetcorn and corned beef and mixed away.   This was probably my lowest point of the whole challenge. Corned beef looks like dog food and although Ive never eaten pet food I imagine it tastes worse, especially when its all mushed up into a big pink goo. I also realised that Id nearly made it to the age of  without knowing what the little stick on the top of the corned beef tin is for . Day Three  One good thing about my disastrous dinner the night before was that I was actually quite looking forward to my bland, tasteless oats. Or I was until I realised I had about a tablespoon of UHT milk left. There was nothing to do but add water to the tiny amount of milk. This was not setting me up for a good final day of the challenge. By day three, Id already consumed my two cans of soup and two apples. What was I going to do for lunch  I still had pasta, so I decided to split that between lunch and dinner.  I added in a tin of beans, and the leftover spam I had thankfully saved from day one. It sounds awful, but it was actually my favourite meal of the challenge! Things were looking up... By now, I fear I was starting to look a bit like a piece of penne pasta. But when you have no choice, youre grateful for what youve got so I was quite happy to dig into the carbs again after a fairly successful lunch.  And then I started making dinner. Even though I had no meat left, after my corned beef disaster I wasnt going to add any anyway. So I used my tin of peas and some of the leftover chopped tomatoes to bulk out my pasta. I think looking back this would have been the better option throughout! The tinned meat probably would have been better cold and as a side dish. Overall The food might not have been exciting but I was so relieved I had something to come home to. I struggled with concentration even after my first day on my minimal diet and when I worked out my calories at around  a dayI wasnt surprisied. The foodbank parcel isnt meant to be a long-term solution and relies on the goodwill of the public - more than  per cent of donations come from you. Its more than a shame that we even have the need for them in this country but they do an amazing job of getting you through those dire moments. The parcel tries to include a range of the dferent vitamins and minerals you need, albeit in a simple way. A lot of people were surprised the package included biscuits, but there were just four a day to spread over the challenge and I think I genuinely might have cracked without a tiny bit of sugar - especially after a depressing dinner. Coventry Live paid for the food received."},{"url":null,"title":"best man loses two teeth","story":"NewsBest man loses two teeth after fainting and crashing to floor during weddingThe man is unable to stop his head slamming into the floor after losing consciousness at the ceremony in Washington, USAShareCommentsByKelly-Ann Mills:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news world-news video best-man-faints-wedding-knocks-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, combinedPrompt :true, subsets :[,,,,,],bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, combinedPrompt :true, subsets :[,,,,,],bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA best man had his teeth knocked out at a wedding when he fainted and crashed face first into the floor.

Recently she shocked diehard Potterheads with the revelation that Voldemortaposs beloved snake, Nagini, is actually a Maledictus - a secret sheaposd been keeping for  years. And now sheaposs done it again, letting slip in a feature on the new Fantastic Beasts DVD that Dumbledore and Grindelwald had an intense and sexual relationship.She said: Their relationship was incredibly intense. It was passionate, and it was a love relationship. But as happens in any relationship, gay or straight or whatever label we want to put on it, one never knows really what the other person is feeling. You canapost know, you can believe you know.    So Iaposm less interested in the sexual side – though I believe there is a sexual dimension to this relationship – than I am in the sense of the emotions they felt for each other, which ultimately is the most fascinating thing about all human relationships.Unsurprisingly people on Twitter had a lot of thoughts about her confession. Many began trolling the writer and a hilarious new meme was born, with people joking about Harry, Ron, Hermione, Hagrid, Dobby, Dumbledore, Draco and more having some rather unusual sexual preferences.   One person wrote: Dumbldore and Grindelwald actually met on an app called WizrD. Another posted: Dumbledoreaposs patronus is the Grindr logo. A third commented: Canapost wait for the J.K. Rowling E.L. James crossover,  Shades of Greyffindor, in which we learn that the greatest safeword is friendship.  Others compared J.K.aposs late revelations to fan fiction. Fanfiction writers walked so that J.K. Rowling could run. Semper Fi, tweeted a dferent user. However one person did very rightly remind everyone that J.K. Rowling created all of the characters so she can imagine all the weird and wonderful things she wants - whenever she wants. They said: I donapost know anything about Harry Potter, nor do I care. But here is a reminder for anyone who is upset with J.K. Rowling commenting on the sexuality of character she invented... THEY ARE HER CHARACTERS IN HER STORY THAT SHE IMAGINED OUT OF NOTHING. They will be what she wants.

Speaking to LADbible, the escort explained how his reputation as a ladies man inspired him to give his job a go.Ive always loved women and adventure, he told the publication. I was just online and thought: why dont I give it a try and meet some women. I put my picture and bio online and two weeks later had my first client. That was three years ago.   Since then hes gone on to meet around  dferent women, having sex with about  of them.The reason for the dference in these two numbers  Because his job isnt actually all about sex.Thats a common misconception, he says. The majority dont want you for sex, they want you to be their date for a party or a wedding.   He goes on to reveal how many of his regulars simply enjoy his company and will whisk him away to visit some of the most exciting places - including helicopter rides over the Grand Canyon and dinners in Michelin star restaurants, which makes him feel like a movie star. And lets not forget that the man gets paid to do all these things, with him claiming to bring home pound, in a good month and pound, at minimum. On top of this, he also has a regular job that hes paid for - which also stops his friends and family from finding out about his double le.   Women contact the escort through the website Gentlemenhire and they exchange messages and swap photos, discussing what they plan to do during the meet up. And to date hes had some pretty interesting requests.The strangest request that Ive gone through with was a high flying business woman who wanted me to go to her office dressed as a personal trainer. She wanted a  Shades of Grey experience in her office. That was really fun, he said. In total it lasted about three or four hours.But not every request is as fun as this. He admitted: One guy got in touch with me and said he wanted me to have sex with his we while he snfed my shoes and my feet. He insisted quite a few times but at the end I had to block him because I wasnt really into it.   And the worst part of doing what he does  Realising that someone wants more than he is able to give them. He claims women often become attached to him and offer extravagant gts such as cars in order to get him to quit the business and become their boyfriend. But hes yet to meet the right woman, or feel the need to quit. He added: I will do it for as long as I enjoy it, once I find it boring and it loses excitement I will quit. Its not happened so far, but it will one day.

My initial reaction was, “What the hell has happened ” But after working in anti-extremism since I was a victim of the   bombings, was I shocked  No. It was a long time coming. It’s been bubbling, waiting to happen. Attacks have been increasing, whether it be on the street or on the bus, be it physical or verbal abuse. I’ve had fellow Muslim women telling me they are scared to leave their house, or to send their kids to school because they are getting bullied for being Muslim. Just two weeks ago we had a threat of arson on our women’s centre in Haringey, North London. We were told we were “desert donkeys”, and to “go back to the desert”.   And since New Zealand, we’ve had messages from women saying they are scared to go to the mosque. My two daughters go to a weekend faith school, and I had to double check the security. We even had to issue advice on how people can go to the local shop safely. You can imagine the fear I have. And why  Because our government hasn’t taken a firm stance. I have lobbied the Government for years to take far-right extremism seriously, like they have taken Daesh extremism seriously. We have far-right groups out there radicalising young people, playing on their vulnerabilities. We need to take down the social media accounts of hate preachers – we’ve done it on the other side of the fence.   I have been through it two-fold: I survived at the hands of extremists on   who claimed to be from my religion. Then I’ve experienced far-right hate and death threats. This is  and we have hate groups from all angles that are growing and growing. We all need to get on in society, we need to be more accepting of each other. The mosque in Christchurch had their doors unlocked. They were unlocked for a reason – so you can reach out, and get to know the other, so to speak. Otherwisethis continues, my fear isn’t just that there will be more far-right attacks but that they will fuel groups like Daesh, and it will become a vicious circle.

Registered nurse Ellen Youlden and husband Tai chose to co-sleep with their children every day since they were born. Ellen, who herself co-slept with her siblings and parents from a very young age, always knew she wanted to co-sleep with her own children. The -year-old was so certain of co-sleeping that Sade, two, and Leonora, one, dont yet have their own rooms or beds. Ellen and Tai, , created a large family bed in their bedroom by pushing a queen bed and a king single bed together and merging the two bases to stop them from moving apart.   Ellen, from Melbourne, Australia, said: My siblings and I co-slept with our parents and I always knew I would do the same with my children. My eldest brother and I slept with my parents until my younger brother was born, when my brother was six and I was three, then we had our own beds. But we would still just swap and choose to sleep wherever we liked, whether that be together or back with our parents. Its natural and what has been the norm for many generations before. I feel that my daughters feel very safe and nurtured. They are respected and valued, and they can trust that we will always be there when they need us. I think that this is greatly reflected in their confidence, outgoing, social and happy personalities.   My children have never slept independently. My eldest once went and climbed into bed with my mother when she stayed over, by her own choice. But I think we sleep so much better when we co-sleep. I wake up numerous times throughout the night to check on them and make sure their blankets are pulled up and that theyre comfortable. Initially, Tai was a bit worried about co-sleeping in case he would roll on top of the girls in his sleep as hes such a deep sleeper, so we bought a snuggle bed which Sade slept in for the first few months until he was comfortable enough to have her in the bigger bed. Its amazing how aware and in tune you become when you have your babies lying next you. Your sleep becomes much lighter. I fall asleep listening to their breathing, knowing that theyre safe and happy. Not to mention the ease for breastfeeding. My little one has free range to feed whenever she likes throughout the night and I dont even need to wake. We can all get a great nights sleep and I can honestly say I wake up refreshed every morning, and I never feel tired or as though Ive had a broken sleep. Ellens parenting style is overwhelmingly inspired by her mother who also believed co-sleeping was a fundamental element in a childs development.   Although she doesnt have any plans to move the girls into their own beds or bedrooms any time soon, Ellen does appreciate that in a few years time the girls will choose when they are ready to sleep independently. Ellen added: I have lovely images of the girls one day choosing that they are ready to move into their own bed or bedroom. I think when that time comes we will get them a queen-size bed, so they can both sleep together, and that Tai or I can also fit in so we can continue to lay with them until they fall asleep each night. I think were very confident and comfortable in our parenting choices, so this doesnt really ever allow for any criticism from others to have a place. Co-sleeping has affected mine and Tais private le yes, but these years are so precious and fleeting, and were aware of that. We want to cherish these years of the girls lives while we can. We are definitely still intimate and were very affectionate towards each other. We kiss and cuddle whenever we can throughout the day as I think its important for the girls to see that theyre in a loving and affectionate home. To the point of sex, me and Tai sneak out of the room once the girls are asleep and climb back in to cuddle them whenever they stir or to feed.

I thought that was too much time added on but, having said that, it’s not the reason,” he said.“We had a great opportunity on the counter attack with two minutes to go and we’ve got to be better.“That’s the reason we are where we are because we’ve been going into so many good areas in each of the last few games and we’re not punishing teams.“We didn’t do what Celtic did. They were ruthless and that’s why we’ve not picked up enough points since I’ve come.“There has been plenty of positive play, plenty of areas we’ve got into but we need to be better in the final third.“It’s the only thing that’s going to get you out of the situation that you’re in – winning games.”Returning to Madden’s decision to play on for so long, Jim confirmed he had spoken to the referee to get his reasoning.“He said there were a couple of head knocks, so that was the reason why.

After facing off against Zlatan Ibrahimovic for Scotland in  and seemingly having the world at his feet, he now finds himself turning out for local junior side Lochee United.However, the big defender hopes to make his own history. vw, px\"  After winning the Scottish Cup with the Tangerines at Hampden in , Kenneth has designs on lting the junior version while, at the same time, go unbeaten over the course of the season with his team-mates at Thomson Park.The Dundonian was at the heart of the Bluebells’ defence as they won - at Troon in the quarter-final to set up a two-legged semi-final against holders Auchinleck Talbot – a repeat of last season’s semi.Kenneth spoke of his time away from the professional game and how he even came close to walking away from the sport.He said: “We want to go a step further this year and to get to the final and go on to win it.“I don’t think we should fear anyone – with the talent and the togetherness in the dressing-room we believe we can beat anyone.“There was a similar atmosphere in the Dundee United dressing-room when we won the cup, so I don’t see why Lochee can’t go all the way.“There’s no reason we shouldn’t be walking away with three or four trophies this year, we’re aiming to go unbeaten this season.“It would be nice to add a junior cup winner’s medal to the collection.“I’m not actually surea lot of people have done that before – winning both the pro one and the junior cup – so it would be really nice to get that.“We’re under no illusions here, we’ll just take it one step at a time but I’m ready for the challenge and looking forward to it.”Kenneth also added how grateful he is to Lochee for helping him rekindle his love for the game again after a dficult period which involved moves to Australia, Latvia and a spell at Brechin City.He admits he was close to walking away from the game in the summer.He continued: “I thought football was done for me after last season, I won’t lie about it.“It was really hard watching other guys getting chance after chance and you’re only getting the one, no matter how well you’re playing.“Sadly, that’s what happens in football and I’ve got no grudges about it and I’ve moved on from that.“In the summer I got a call from Lochee asking to come in and help out with a few friendlies and it’s kind of rolled on from there really. I’d played in the friendlies and was mixing with the boys really well. We’ve got a good bunch of lads here so that’s really helped at what already is a great club.“Sometimes it’s a risk taking a gamble on somebody who’s taken a bit of time out of the game.“I’m just happy to be back playing and training and, most importantly, I’m enjoying it again.“A break is needed sometimes, maybe so you can see how much you miss playing or even the buzz in and about the dressing-room and, most importantly, how much you love it.“When you’re playing full time and when you’re playing for so long, you kind of take it for granted.“You become immersed in it and you realise how dependent you are on the game as it’s always going to be there.“It’s when you take that step back it really hits home how much you need it in your le, that what’s happened in my case.“You just need to play for as long as you can and enjoy it for as long as you can, or until, unfortunately, your body gives up on you.“I’ve always been the type of person who wants to win every game and every duel –you’re playing football and you don’t want to play and win every game then you’re most likely in the wrong profession.“I’ve still got that hunger that I’ve took everywhere with me, it’s just the type of person I am.”"},{"url":null,"title":"sam stanton says dundee united need to block out doubt and focus again","story":"Dundee United need to ignore everything that’s happening around them and just concentrate on winning matches between now and the end of the regular season.As the Tangerines head for in-form Dunfermline today, that’s the view of midfielder Sam Stanton.On paper it looks a task that could prove easier said than done.Championship leaders Ross County are in action again tonight and,they come out on top in the Highland derby at Inverness Caley Thistle, their advantage over United will be stretched to a massive  points.With nine games to go, for many that would mean the race for automatic promotion was effectively over.Most in the Tannadice dressing-room don’t see things that way and, with two games against the Staggies still to come, for the time being at least, there’s no way boss Robbie Neilson and his players are conceding anything.Stanton, though, is happy to leave such discussion to others because he knowshis team are not winning on a regular basis, that alone will extinguish hopes of ato the Premiership this year.“Everyone can see it’s a big lead Ross County have over us now so, obviously, all we can do is try to put pressure on them and you do that by winning games,” he said.“But the big thing at this time of the season is to build momentum and that’s what we have to do, whether that’ll be to catch County or to go up through the play-offs.“And there is no point in looking at them, it’s completely on us and what we do.“We can narrow the gap because we play them twice. We can beat them in both of those games, we know we’re capable of that but we’d need to win all the other games as well.“What’s important is that we go on a winning run because that’s a massive thing going into the end of the season, whether you’re going for automatic promotion oryou are going to be in the play-offs.”The -year-old’s experience of the second tier tells him how dficult that’s going to be and,anything, he believes putting together a winning run this term is harder than it’s ever been.“I think when you look at the league right now you see that any time you’re playing, there is no guaranteed games you are going to win.“Everyone in the league has something to play for, whether it’s the teams up at the top or the ones down at the bottom.“I think this is one of the tightest seasons I’ve seen for a few years.”That view is backed up by the progress of today’s opponents.Until a five-game winning streak, the Pars were looking over their shoulders and worrying about being dragged into a relegation dogfight.Now they’re in a play-off spot and,they can make it six wins on the trot today, they’d be challenging United in the race for second place.That makes this game almost as vital as the looming clash with Ross County at Tannadice on Tuesday.Stanton knows he and his team-mates will have their work cut out today but stressed the aim is to maintain an unbeaten East End Park record that stretches back to .“As a club we’ve had a good record against Dunfermline and we want to keep that going.“They are on a good run right now but we believe we can go there and win.“If we do win this one we keep a gap to the teams below us.“That’s important but we just have to look to be winning games as often as possible.”"},{"url":null,"title":"scotland miss selfridge store slashes prices by up to 70 in closing down sale","story":"A popular fashion brand has slashed prices ahead of its Aberdeen store shutting.Staff at Miss Selfridge in the St Nicholas Centre were seen posting signs advertising price cuts of up to % as part of their closing down sale.Customers have been advised they will still be able to purchase items from the brand at Outfit in Union Square."},{"url":null,"title":"mcdonalds-launches-veggie-happy-meals-as-greggs-sells-vegan-sausage-rolls","story":"MCDONALDrsquoS restaurants across Glasgow have launched their first-ever vegetarian Happy Meal for children from today."},{"url":null,"title":"richard-madden-flashback-to-when-rising-actor-spoke-to-the-evening-times","story":"RENFREWSHIRE actor Richard Madden has picked up a Golden Globe for his role in gripping BBC drama Bodyguard."},{"url":null,"title":"hugh-jackman-in-glasgow-how-to-get-tickets-without-using-ticketmaster","story":"AS is usually the norm when big acts announce gigs, music fans have been unable to buy tickets to see Hugh Jackman in Glasgow through Ticketmaster, despite him having announced a staggering three-night run in May."},{"url":null,"title":"taking-your-car-abroad-after-brexit-looks-like-youll-be-needing-a-green-card","story":"THE prospect of a no-deal Brexit, meaning no transition period, will mean insurance lsquogreen cardsrsquo will be required for UK drivers venturing across the Channel or into the Republic of Ireland from March , ."},{"url":null,"title":"craigholme-school-glasgow-girls-school-to-close-over-dwindling-pupil-numbers","story":"A GLASGOW school ndash one of the last private girlsrsquo secondaries in Scotland ndash is set to close as a result of falling pupil numbers."},{"url":null,"title":"princes-street-evacuation-suspicious-package-found-day-after-glasgow-university-on-lockdown","story":"BREAKING:Glasgow Universityrsquos Dumfries campus evacuated after lsquosuspicious packagersquo found.

In my time here, we’ve had loads of games where we’ve not been at our best for whatever reason.“But we’ve had loads of - McGinn, - Rooneys.“To concede the type of goal we did from a free-kick so far out – it wasn’t a free-kick by the way, the referee’s got it badly wrong.“We should still see that offwe defend with the same authority and calmness we’ve been doing of late. But we gt it, we get sucked towards the ball, we don’t win the header and allow our man to work off us, and then they get the goal.”The draw was a missed chance to make up ground on second-placed Rangers – who also drew, - at home to Kilmarnock.McInnes said: “We knew with Rangers and Kilmarnock playing something had to give and we could’ve gained on both of them or one of them, but we haven’t.“We’ve come through a tough spell, wanted three points and the first goal should’ve been enough to get that.“We haven’t lost any ground, but it could’ve been a better day for us.”McInnes also revealed he’d been forced to tackle Livi with the walking wounded, including centre-back Scott McKenna – who now looks set to miss Scotland’s first Euro  qualier against Kazakhstan on Thursday with a thigh problem.He had planned to speak to Dark Blues boss Alex McLeish saying: “I’m not a medical expert, but having spoken to the physios and doctors, they would have a real concern for him being fit for Thursday.“I think he’ll be fit for the Sunday game .“We’ll need to make a decision between us and Scotland whether he travelsor stays behind for treatment so he’s more fit for the second game.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/02/MPU-offers.jpg ","title":"aberdeens miss selfridge launches massive closing down sale","story":"A

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks. Why have we in Argyll after nine years, four dferent Transport Ministers and £m spent and still have no guaranteed safe passage   on The Rest and Be Thankful Follow the Argyll Advertiser#s campaign #Invest in the Rest#. Transport Minister Michael Matheson, Transport Scotland and our Government must abandon their obsession with mitigation measures and fund a permanent solution. We demand no less.Sir,Calls for assurances that the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A will be improved to resist future landslides were made during a session of Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity questions in the Scottish Parliament.I quizzed transport secretary Michael Matheson, about what was discussed at the last meeting of the A Taskforce in November , and asked what assurances the Cabinet Secretary could give to local residents and businesses who rely on the A being open at all times.The Rest and Be Thankful was closed off for nine days in October  following the largest landslide in a decade, forcing road users to either take a major ersion, or to use the Old Military Road during certain hours of the day.A number of petitions were created during the period of the incident, including one by myself, calling for a permanent solution to the Rest and Be Thankful.The transport secretary said that the meeting was #full and frank#, and that there would be a #review of the potential for additional landslide mitigation measures at the Rest and Be Thankful#, and that this would be discussed at the next A Taskforce meeting in March .There was also a commitment that Argyll and Bute would be #prioritised# in the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.I welcome the assurances by the transport secretary that there will be a review of any additional measures for the Rest and Be Thankful, and that Argyll and Bute will receive priority at the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.Donald Cameron, MSPReserve forcesSir,Last issue#sletter raising concerns about the UK government’s proposed use of the army’s reserve force in the event of a no-deal Brexit is timely.In case anyone out there still thinks a no-deal Brexit is a good idea it’s worth noting that the legal authorityof Reserve Forces Act  allowing the Secretary of State to take this step requires him to establish that it is necessary #for the alleviation of distress or the preservation of le or property in time of disaster or apprehended disaster#.Enough said.Frances Roberts, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"honours even for red star in argyll derby","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Ropework played host to this keenly contested local derby which was watched by a healthy crowd on Saturday February .And for the second time this season, Red Star and Campbeltown Pupils shared the points in a match both sides will feel they could have won.Both sides were struggling for fluency in the opening stages but Red Star settled first and grabbed the opening goal after  minutes. A long ball to the right hand side was met by Ryan Caskie who cut the ball back to Stuart McLean. The youngster took a touch before slotting past the Pupils# goalkeeper to give Star a - lead.Star continued to press and doubled their lead when Coll McCallum robbed the Pupils# defender on the edge of the box before cutting the ball across goal. The unfortunate Pupils# defender could only ert the ball into the empty net, with McLean waiting on a tap in. The game continued at a frantic pace, however, there was no further scoring in the first half and Star went in with a - advantage.Pupils came out with purpose in the second half as they looked to force themselves back into the game, however, it was a howler from Red Star which allowed them back into the match.A square ball across the back resulted in a mix-up between Star keeper Luke Kalache and defender Ben Forbes which allowed Donald McCallum to prod the ball home from just inside the box and Pupils were back in the game at - with eight second half minutes gone.The home side didn’t recover from this and you could sense a nervousness that gave the visitors plenty encouragement. The equaliser arrived with  minutes remaining when good play from Pupils down the right by Soudan saw him get a low cross in which was met by the on-rushing run of Ryan Deans and he finished well to level the score at -.This set up a frantic finish and both sides could have nicked it towards the end. Pupils went close with a headed effort which was clawed to safety while at the other end there was a goalmouth scramble which Star couldn’t convert and both sides had to settle for a draw in the end as referee Jimmy Litster blew for full time.Red Star were dealt a blow as it emerged that captain Aaron Moore suffered a dislocated shoulder.

There will be a purpose-built ,ftsup aerospace and space innovation centre for research and business development in partnership with universities. A visitor centre promoting science around space and aviation is also included in the bid. And up to to ,ftsup of industrial manufacturing space is to be developed. Publicly-owned Glasgow Prestwick Airport has made a loss in the past. A transport assessment is taking place to weigh up the impact of expansion on rail and road links. The airport vision was revealed on Friday when the Ayrshire Growth Deal heads of terms agreement was signed by politicians. Secretary of State for Scotland David Mundell said: “From a UK perspective Prestwick is one of the most important sites for aerospace and a potential spaceport.” Transport secretary Michael Matheson said the plans would see the public and private sector join forces with academia to grow the aerospace and space sector. The deal sees pound million invested by the UK Government, pound million by the Scottish Government and pound million from South Ayrshire Council in the airport. South Ayrshire Council leader Douglas Campbell said the deal overall ensured Ayrshire “punches well above its weight in terms of what we contribute to the economy”. He described the signing of the heads of agreement as a “truly historic occasion” and the “pinnacle of more than three years of hard work.” Councillor Brian McGinley, local economy and culture chief, said: “To make the most of this investment we are determined that the benefits are shared by all, bringing quality training and jobs that will pay good wages.” Overall the pound. million Ayrshire Growth Deal aims to generate  jobs. The investment will be delivered over  years.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level.

Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":null,"title":"ayrshire primary school blasted hm","story":"NewsAyrshire primary school blasted in HM Inspectors report cardAdditional support is needed to help schoolShareByAyrshire Post:,  MAR NewsShared campus of Patna and St. Xaviers primary schools.\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA primary school has been slated in an HM Inspectors report card. Panta Primary School, which also incorporates an Early Childhood and Support Learning Centre, was rated “weak” across two quality indicators following a recent visit. A team of HM Inspectors visited the school, which shares a campus with St Xavier’s PS, in December, but their findings were only made public last week. The school was deemed to have fallen short under the ‘Learning, teaching and assessment’ quality indicators- with the report stating that, in the majority of lessons, children were “slow to engage in their work” and “required encouragement” to start tasks. Inspectors said that children’s “curiosity and engagement” was “not being developed well enough” and they mentioned an “important weakness” in children’s learning. In another body blow, the school was rated “weak” when it came to raising attainment in literacy and numeracy. The report states: “Overall attainment in literacy and numeracy is weak. As a result, HM Inspector, Carol Copstick, said that the school needed “additional support” in to make “necessary improvements.” HM Inspectors willto the school within a year to ensure that progress is being made. St. Xavier’s Primary School, which is based in the same campus, was deemed to be “very good” and “good” across two key indicators during a  inspection. SNP Doon Valley councillor John Bell, said he was initially shocked by the report and said the school had dedicated, conscientious staff and fantastic, hard-working children.” On a positive note the school was praised for its “caring ethos” and the “positive relationships” fostered by the nursery team. Linda McAulay-Grfiths, East Ayrshire Council’s head of education said: “It’s important to remember that a school inspection report is a snapshot in time and many of the recommendations contained in the Inspector’s report are being implemented, or are already in place.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnEast Ayrshire CouncilScottish National PartyEducationSchoolsAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"end era popular ayr music","story":"NewsEnd of era as popular Ayr music shop shuts downBig Sparra Vinyl in Ayr has announced its closure following a recent flood at the New Bridge Street store.ShareByAbi Smillie:,  MAR NewsIan Wallace of Big Sparra Vinyl \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIt’s the end of an era for a much-loved record store which has touched the hearts- and ears- of many across the country.

The application got the go-ahead at the South Ayrshire Council Regulatory Panel last week. Discount store Home Bargains sells budget toys, household and beauty and gardening products. The Food Warehouse has a bigger grocery choice than Iceland as well as bulk buys. Ayr Central operators MG Real Estate lodged an objection to the plan. Representing them, Planner Kathryn Donnelly told the meeting: “We believe the proposals could be incorporated into the town centre.” She added: “There is an urgent need to protect Ayr town centre.” Ms Donnelly, of GL Hern, told councillors: “We need to entice national retailers.”   She said Ayr Central supports  local jobs. Ediston representative Alex Mitchell said Food Warehouse would take up , square feet. Mr Mitchell, of Zander Planning, said: “No units like that are available in the town centre.” Claiming it could bolster the town in general, he said: “Retail parks can draw people in from surrounding areas.” A document said the empty Homebase premises were too big for just one shop. Councillors approved requests to allow planning unit to be ided into two shops, and permit homeware goods and food to be sold from it. Councillor Peter Convery said: “There isn’t one of us here who doesn’t want the town centre to be vibrant again.” Expressing his support for the High Street and Heathfield,  chair Councillor Brian Connolly said: “We want them all to be successful.” But Councillor Andy Campbell said: “This has been an opportunity to attract outlets to the town centre.

And they called for better conditions for workers and customers. It is understood Ayr railway station will never operate from the abandoned building again. Now there are plans for Scotrail workers to move into other portable cabins at the bottom of the car park on Station Road. South Ayrshire Council was forced to take control of the privately owned Station Hotel last year when its dilapidated state made it a danger to the public. Station staff were moved to portable cabins beside the building. Mick Hogg, regional organiser for the RMT union in Scotland, said staff working conditions are unacceptable. He said: “We need a facility that is fit for purpose. “We would rather see the building demolished. We want to start from scratch to ensure our members are working in a safe environment.” He added: “Our members and the travelling public should not be subjected to any health and safety risk as a result of this shambles at Ayr Station. The shambles has been created by the refusal of Network Rail and other stakeholders to take ownership of a building that was falling to bits.” Union representatives want workers moved to the better portacable cabins on the other side of the railway tracks as soon as possible. Health and safety rep Willie Harper said: “It has been very challenging.” Gerry McCann, an RMT official from Ayr, said: “The staff are crammed into a portable cabins. There is no fresh running water.” He said facilities were not good enough for rail passengers. People waiting for trains to Glasgow or bus links to the ferries at Cairnryan have no shelter. He said: “People have to stand out in the rain. We want action.” An exclusion zone is in place around parts of the hotel to keep people away from the structure while work proceeds to make it safe. MSP Colin Smyth met the union and Scotrail to make the case for improvements last week. He said: “While staff had to be moved quickly out of offices which were part of the same building as the Station Hotel due to safety fears, the temporary arrangements put in place don’t deliver for staff o.” The council are in discussions with Transport Scotland, Network Rail and Scotrail about the future of the building. A Scotrail spokesman said: “We are committed to providing the best possible working environment for our people.

Fortunately, blood tests showed she was regenerating her own blood cells.After a tense  hours following surgery, to make sure she recovered, Teal was allowed home.Jim added: ldquoNot only did the owner react very quickly, but the whole team at Border Vets pulled together and stayed behind long after their working day had finished to ensure the best possible outcome for Teal.ldquoIrsquom over the moon with her recovery as she looks great and I canrsquot praise the fantastic teamwork by everyone at the practice enough.Teal lives with Jackie, her husband and their three sons, at their home in Galashiels.Jackie said: ldquoShe is an obedient dog but I think she misheard the command while we were waiting to cross the road.\"Irsquove never been in such a panic in all my le. Although there wasnrsquot a mark on her, she appeared fine for a short while however very quickly she deteriorated and became very poorly and couldnrsquot move very well.ldquoI couldnrsquot see a positive coming out of this situation and was worried about having to tell the children she had been put to sleep because she is part of the family.\"But I knew she was in the right place at Border Vets.

how does a small childs cross pose a risk to anyone \"And from what we were told, they were going to inform familiesa stone required work to make it safe.\"There are now broken gravestones lying all over our cemetery - this wasnt a safety inspection.\"Scottish Borders Council is responsible for  cemeteries across the region.And they have health and safety obligations for all employees, contractors and visitors to each of the graveyards.Although headstones are the responsibility of the lair-holder, due to the age of many graves tracing families is dficult.A five-year rolling programme of safety checks began in September with  cemeteries earmarked for the initial checks.But for several families the heavy-handed testing regime - which has left many memorials broken - has come as a shock.One daughter, who we agreed not to name, said: \"My parents grave is neither old nor what you would describe as large, yet it has been taken from its base.\"I have been really upset by this -I or any of my family had known the stone was loose we would have had it repaired.\"Nobody has been in touch with me or my brother.\"According to the Scottish Borders Councils own guidelines on the testing procedures, an initial sight test would be followed,required, by a gentle hand push.All memorials were to be classed as either stable, slight movement or unsafe.And only memorials found to be in a dangerous condition will be cordoned off and or made safe.The guidance also states that they will ensure the work is undertaken with due respect and only when absolutely necessary.Scottish Borders Council has defended the testing procedures by the contracted company.A spokesman for the authority told us: \"The council took the decision to test all the headstones in the old section of Peebles Cemetery, regardless of size and age, following a risk assessment.\"This is part of a phased approach to testing which sees sections of cemeteries categorised based on estimated footfall, age, location and size of the memorials.\"So far the majority of unstable memorials tested across the Borders have been made safe by socketing, which means keeping the headstone upright with the majority of the inscription still visible for families and visitors to read.\"This is a recognised approach which balances the cultural importance associated with these historic memorials and the need to keep our cemeteries safe for the public to visit.\"Socketing is the preferred technique compared to other alternative methods such as lying flat, staking, banding or full repair, all of which carry signicant consequences to the future stability of the memorials or signicant costs.\"A total of  headstones were tested in Peebles Cemetery with  deemed unsafe.Council bosses have admitted they will discuss issues over stones being broken during the inspection.The spokesman added: \"We accept that during this signicant safety programme, and considering the nature of the memorials that we are dealing with, there will be occasions where a memorial can become damaged while being made safe.\"If anyone notices a memorial which they have a legal interest in and which they believe has been damaged during the process of making it safe, they can contact the council to discuss the matter further.\"Other graveyards which are included in the initial phase of inspections are Innerleithen, Wairds , Shawfield , Ashkirk, Earlston, Heriot, Lilliesleaf, Kelsoand Kelso , Ancrum, Denholm, Wellogateand Wilton , Ayton, Duns, Lennel and Eyemouth.Babies graves, war graves and many brokenWhere a memorial is classied as unsafe and there is an immediate safety concern, thememorial will be made safe.

The objectors also presented evidence to the committee showing how their own planning policies were being ignored by their officials.Peebles Community Council and many residents objected to the land at South Parks site being earmarked for development in the Local Development Plan back in .Mr Turnbull said: ldquoWhat makes objectors particularly annoyed is the notion that once building sites have been included in Local Development Plans, their inclusion cannot be questioned.\"Their views then were ignored just as their views have been totally ignored now. One of the questions that needs to be asked is, why Mr Turnbull said the conduct of the planning committee with the housing application was ldquoappalling and added that the system is loaded in favour of developers.He added: ldquoWell over  dferent objectors submitted some very detailed evidence to planners who ignored it.\"This has brought many objectors to question the validity of the planning process. It would appear that this process is designed to allow developers to build as and when they want and they can appealtheir application is refused.ldquoObjectors on the other hand have no right of appeal given that they have no right of appeal it is surely essential that they are given a fair hearing where evidence is properly considered.ldquoIn the South Parks case, Councillor Fullarton made comments regarding the Caledonian Road being wide and safe, based on his knowledge of over  years ago - no one challenged him.ldquoWhat has caused so much anger was that not a single councillor on the committee knew enough about Peebles to question Councillor Fullartonrsquos assertion. It may be that the planning committee has insufficient time to deal properly with these more complicated and contentious applicationsthat is the case then something has to change.ldquoThey simply failed to understand the issues before them nor the tremendous amount of anger within our community.\"The Scottish Government has launched an initiative called Democracy Matters, which aims to improve the level of involvement of local communities.Mr Turnbull continued: ldquoWhat is the pointplanning officers can write what they want, ignore government guidance and legislation, which is then allowed to stand by councillors who either do not have the knowledge to challenge them or the will to do so. For democracy to matter the peoplesrsquo voice needs to be heard.The community leader says the democratic deficit will be brought into sharp focus with the next Local Development plan, and heeded a warning to elected councillors to be prepared to answer why Peebles is mooted for major development when Scottish Borders Council is not prepared to develop infrastructure first.Scottish Borders Council strongly refutes the claims that councillors and officials ignored the views of the community.A spokesperson said: ldquoAll planning decisions require the delicate balancing of a range of policy objectives and other material factors, including the views expressed by the Community Council.\"The two recent planning applications in Peebles highlighted how dficult that can be and the complexity of the decision making process. Both proposals were subject to detailed analysis, which was reflected in the presentation of the cases by officers and the y debate members had on these applications.ldquoIt is clear that a considerable amount of time was spent considering the points and issues made both for and against the proposed developments. Indeed, both applications were revised to take into consideration the views expressed by local residents and the Community Council.ldquoUltimately, and after considering all of the evidence before them, the Committee came to the view that it could support one of the applications, which was the development at South Parks.

pound for each offence - and there is still a pound bill outstanding for the  original parking offences between April and July last year.Humphries of Bourtree Place, Hawick, pleaded guilty at Selkirk JP Court to a total of  charges.Procurator fiscal Graham Fraser told the court that there was no CCTV in the car park showing who had come to collect the car on the days of the offences and Humphries had never informed the council of the identity of the driver despite the repeated requests.But he pointed out Humphries worked in the Iceland store which is right beside the High Street car park.Mr Fraser also said that failing to reveal the identity of the driver carried a maximum penalty of pound, for each offence.He explained that the council had to go through the laborious process of establishing who the regular keeper of the vehicle was and to find out who the driver was for the penalty to be paid.Mr Fraser said:\"In relation to all these charges he ignored the correct parking penalty which was not paid.\"There were other people who could have used this car parkspace but have not been able to do so.\"The accuseds vehicle repeatedly committed the offences of being parked overtime.\"Who did that we do not know as the accused did not bother to communicate with the council and say who the driver was which is a legal requirement.\"Not guilty pleas to nine other charges relating to the parking offences were accepted by the Crown.Defence lawyer Colin Severin said his client was negotiating with the council about the outstanding parking fines.He added: \"He got to the point where he was bogged down with the volume of letters coming through and did not know how to react.\"Andrew Bramhall JP told Humphries that ulging the identity of the identity of the driver when an offence is committed was an important part of the Road Traffic Act legislation.He said: \"The onus was on you and it has mounted up considerably.\"Mr Bramhall said he would have fined Humphries pound for each offence but restricted the fine to pound due to the guilty plea.As there were  offences, the fine totalled pound -

cut in youth and adult learning, a cut in environmental warden services, which means a focus on more fines but less time for fly tipping and dog fouling and a cut to music tuition in schools.There

Lauder, it is said, was the first place he stopped after fleeing from the Battle of Prestonpans.ldquoI suppose we kind of followed in his footsteps, said my friend, ldquoalthough in a very dferent way and totally dferent circumstances of course. Folk round here donrsquot really know the story, but coming from the Pans it gave us an immediate connection.The actual house on Lauder High Street that Johnnie Cope arrived at is now gone, replaced over  years ago. But Lauder must look much as it did on that fateful day when Cope arrived, with his horse close to collapse with exhaustion.Johnnie Cope was the general commanding the British Army at Prestonpans on that fateful day, September , . The battle was a major victory for the Jacobites. Cope fled the scene of battle, but only when it was clearly lost. He eventually arrived at Berwick-upon-Tweed to give news of his own defeat. Ever since, popular tradition has mocked Cope for running away and not standing his ground and dying lsquohonourablyrsquo, as Colonel Gardiner of Bankton House did.This ridicule was encapsulated in a traditional popular song, and the chorus remains well-known:Hey, Johnnie Cope, are ye wauking yet Or are your drums a-beating yet If ye were wauking I wad waitTae gang to the coals irsquo the morning.The song pokes fun at Cope and concludes with a harsh indictment:Now Johnnie, troth, ye were na blateTae come wirsquo news orsquo your ain defeat,And leave your men in sic a straitSae early in the morning.There are earlier versions with slightly dferent words, but the sentiment remains the same: Johnnie Cope ran away and should be ashamed of himself for leaving his men. However, he was later found to have done his duty, and this reputation deemed unfair. But mud sticks, especially when a catchy tune is added to it.This popular song is believed to have been written by Adam Skirving, a farmer at Garleton in East Lothian. There is a story that he visited the battle site a few hours after the fighting. Perhaps he spoke to some eyewitnesses who saw Cope flee up the road to Birsley Brae, and therefore got the idea for the song. The road Cope took as he fled from the battle has ever after been called Johnnie Copersquos Road.Lauder is a short journey from Prestonpansgoing by car. It had been a while since I had last ventured over Soutra Hill and into the border country and I enjoyed the drive despite the wild weather, or perhaps partly because of it.But what was Copersquos journey like as he galloped over Soutra Hill with some of his dragoons  He must have paused at the summit and cast a glance at the view over East Lothian and screwed his eyes to find Prestonpans. The panic and terror by this time would have given way to dferent feelings, I suspect.He rode more or less the same way I took to Lauder but it would have taken him much longer with very dferent emotions. His arrival in the town would have been a bewildering spectacle for the locals. He later continued his flight to Coldstream, which he reached by nightfall.All this was in my head as we headed home to Prestonpans from Lauder the next day. I could almost see the ghosts of Cope and his dragoons gallop past us as we ventured over Soutra.As we drove, I re-told the story to my kids and we sang the song in the car. They know the story and the chorus well, as we have many times ventured along Johnnie Cope Road on the way to the rail station.By the road is Bankton House, once the home of Colonel Gardiner, who did not run but stood his ground, and paid the ultimate price with brutal death.There is a small doorsquocot by the house, and inside you will find a free but almost secret visitor centre created with the support of the Battle of Prestonpans Heritage Trust.The doorsquocot can only be reached via a walkway through the wood from the rail station during the day, and inside lsquoAuld Archiersquo tells the tale of the battle, and the le and death of Colonel Gardiner. On the wall is a model map of how the area looked at the time of the battle, with the route taken by Johnnie Cope clearly marked.Itrsquos all fascinating stuff which had been unexpectedly brought to my mind by the visit to Lauder to see old friends.But it was the emotions rather than the events that I reflected on most. The hatred caused by this civil war , the loss, suffering and misery of conflict which is so often hidden by a cloak of romanticism.Adam Watters, a Panner who lives and breathes local history, and re-enacts it for children and visitors alike, is clear on this. It is a fascinating period to study, and to have the history on our doorstep brings it alive. But as Adam has said, letrsquos enjoy that sense of history on our doorstep and have fun with it, but let us not glory battle, rather learn from it.I think Johnnie Cope, even though he was a military man, may well have agreed with Adam."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-council-cockenzie-revised-plan","story":"Inch Cape Offshore Ltd has been given approval to site the building ndash which will bring energy ashore from an offshore wind farm ndash on land at the former Cockenzie Power Station by Scottish Ministers.A planning application was initially lodged with East Lothian Council but was called in by the Scottish Government before a decision was made.That decision sparked anger after it was announced as First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was on an official visit to China, where she met representatives of Chinese state owned Red Rock, which owns Inch Cape.Now the company has presented a revised plan of the space it intends to use to Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council.The community council posted the new design on social media and revealed plans were under way for Inch Cape to host workshops in the local communities in the coming months.The image shows the substation on about a third of the original .-hectare footprint applied for.One of the biggest concerns raised by communities and the local authority, which owns the land, was that a substation dominating the old power station site would make it a no-go area for other developments.The new plans were welcomed by many on the community councilrsquos Facebook page, with one person saying: ldquoGood news, less sterilisation of the site.Ian Johnson, Inch Capersquos project manager, said: ldquoWe are continuing to engage with East Lothian Council and local community councils on options to signicantly reduce the footprint of the onshore transmission works and moving this to the west of the site.ldquoWhile this detailed design plan is subject to further technical assessments, consultation and approval from the council, we are taking steps to ensure remaining land is available for other developments."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-school-pupils-to-take-part-in-strike-against-climate-change","story":"The NBHS Eco Committee have encouraged students to travel by public transport to attend the rally campaigning for stronger government action to combat climate change.The Edinburgh protest is one of many around the world that are happening tomorrow morning, where school children are walking out of classes to protest climate change.The protest starts at am outside the Scottish Parliament.An East Lothian Council spokesperson said: ldquoWe want to support our young people as global citizens to have their voice and to be able to express their views on important matters such as climate change.\"The safety and wellbeing of our young people is of paramount importance to us.

Still, mixing metaphors and managers, in the words of Ally MacLeod in , itrsquoll be fine once we get to the World Cup. It might well bethe final  minutes in west London was anything to pin your hopes on.With France beating Italy and Wales clinching the Grand Slam against the Irish, it effectively turned the Twickenham game in to a dead rubber. Just pride and some old forged rupees to play for. A chance for some exhibition stuff, surely  Yes, but no-one could possibly have predicted the twists and turns that would fill match time.Yesterday began with the match ball being delivered, after a bike run from Stirling to Twickers, by former Scotland captain Rob Wainwright, round the world biker Mark Beaumont, endurance cyclist Russell Ky and a few other on their latest Doddie Gump, on behalf of the My Namersquo Doddie Foundation. A worthy cause, but as England were running in tries for fun during the opening exchanges at the rate of a point per minute, a well-intentioned wrong turning somewhere in the Midlands may have been a better idea. No ball, no game.The day started badly for the Scots and deteriorated. Irsquom not a fan of the tune, but who dictates Flower of Scotland should be played in waltz-time  Take your partners for a St Bernardrsquos.For Scottish football fans, lsquorsquo means so much. Yesterday that was all it took, in seconds, for England to score. Cue lsquoSweet Chariot.rsquo Unfortunately, it was supercharged and had four-wheel drive and rumbled over the Scots in those early battles. Around this time I received a text from a mate. ldquoHeading back in to Richmond and the Orange Tree. Cannae watch this. I hope they had a telly.For when all appeared lost, from somewhere, Scotland managed to pull out a fightback of epic proportions. Guys who had looked lost, suddenly became world -beaters McInally, Maitland, Graham, Russell, Johnson and others, all of them really. We knew Scotland could play like that. We had seen it before. But given how their self-belief must have been steamrollered in that opening quarter, this effort will be written in to Scots rugby,not sporting folklore. But let us not forget how close wersquod come to an absolute disaster yesterday before salvaging self-respect and some much-needed championship points. But what, ultimately, have we achieved this far in to  Before a ball was kicked, passed or dropped in anger, I had upset one or two with my prediction that, at best, Scotland might finish fourth in this yearrsquos Six Nations. My guesstimate actually had a bit of logic behind it. Italy was a given, but we donrsquot win on the road that often, especially in Paris or London, while Ireland and Wales are quitedecent teams, but at Murrayfield, we just might ndash with a decent wind - shade it against one of them.We didnrsquot and fourth became fth, accompanied by a catalogue of excuses not turning pressure in to points, not being accurate or clinical enough, and, not having any luck when it comes to losing key personnel. Letrsquos take that point firstThere has been a steady progression at international level whereby Scotland has built strength and experience in depth, something that on reflection, really wasnrsquot there a decade back, no matter how much we may kid ourselves. However, unlike England and perhaps the French, Scotland still donrsquot have the cover or resource to accommodate a casualty count running in to double figures,not dozens.Even for the layman, the attrition rate during this championship has not gone unnoticed. Five test matches in seven weeks, particularly given the intensity of the international game today, is enough to break bodies. Good job no-one has ever been daft enough to think out loud that five successive weekend Tests could be an option in the future.However, much of Scotlandrsquos woes have been self-imposed. Compared to  months ago, when we looked to score on any play, from any position, over the last few weeks we have collectively just ran up too many blind alleys. Yes, it all fell in to place latterly against England, but be honest, on another day wersquod have been crushed and left humiliated.Instead we werenrsquot, instead we left with a touch of optimism, and instead of pain, we left with that ancient silver pot, the Calcutta Cup.Moving pictures of Scotlandrsquos last victory at Twickenham are not quite in monochrome, more a slightly washed-out colour. The video tape should last a few more years before it breaks down to dust, through age. However, after our near- disintegration yesterday, we still live with the prospect of that historic recording decaying before we win again.Better teams than the one eventually selected by Gregor Townsend have biennially headed south, more in hope than honest belief in search of that illusive victory.

She never gives up. She hung around to clear up the Brexit mess left by her awful predecessor. Only a hard heart could disagree with this analysis.Theresa May also deserves a degree of sympathy for her decision to push for a general election in . Almost every commentator, it should be recalled, believed she would rout Jeremy Corbyn and lay the path for a Brexit deal. The fault lay in the hapless campaign she led, not in the triggering of an election.Nearly two years later, May is the central character in a Westminster horror story. No matter how she rolls the dice, no majority appears to exist for any form of Brexit. She is bringing back her draft withdrawal agreement this week, but she is in need of a political miracle.This is where personal sympathy ends and political blame can rightly be aimed in her direction. May, and nobody , is the architect of a Brexit impasse that could see the UK crash out of the European Union without a deal. MPs ldquovoted against this outcome last week, but only EU member states can grant an extension to Article . The EU can name its price.Mayrsquos historic blunder was in laying out a series of Brexit ldquored lines at her partyrsquos conference in . Showing off in front of the Tory faithful, she ruled out the UK staying in either the customs union or the single market, which at a stroke necessitated the creation of the hated Northern Ireland backstop. Withdrawing the UK from the scope of the European Court of Justice - a May obsession from her days at the Home Office - was also written in blood.Her rigid approach may have drawn applause from hundreds of elderly Tories in the conference hall, but the red lines made it impossible for Labour, the SNP or the Lib Dems to support her Brexit plan. She put herself at the mercy of right-wing colleagues in European Research Group and the Democratic Unionist Party. The ideologues were given a veto.Mayrsquos mistake was in forgetting her partyrsquos history. In , John Major was challenged for the leadership by Cabinet colleague John Redwood, whose campaign was motivated by hostility to the EU. A photograph of his supporters from that period is a historical curiosity. It shows a small band of hardliners - people like the late Teddy Taylor and Teresa Gorman - who could not compromise on their loathing of the EU. This grouplet is now a large faction and is blocking Mayrsquos deal. She has allowed herself to be captured by the ERG and held hostage.Brexit is consuming the nation, but the UKrsquos departure from the EU is a tragic plot line in a Tory soap opera. David Cameron committed his party to a referendum in a bid to appease his right wing and stop the rise of UKIP. He refrained from ldquoblue on blue attacks during the campaign for fear of splitting the Conservatives. From beginning to end, Cameron was concerned about party management. May has copied this insular strategy.Her flawed approach brings two options into focus this week. The first is for her ERG tormentors to back her deal, which would be followed by a short extension to Article . Few people expect the militants to turn into eleventh-hour pragmatists. The second option is, on the back of her deal being rejected for a third time, to ask the EU for a much ier delay.Such an outcome would present a huge opportunity for a Prime Minister who was concerned with bringing the country together, rather than healing her partyrsquos wounds. With a yearrsquos breathing room, she could ditch her red lines and hurl the ERG into obscurity. If May backed either a soft Brexit, or a confirmatory vote on her deal, a majority of MPs would follow her.The last thirty years suggest that May will look inwards, not outwards. Europe brought down Thatcher, Major and Cameron. Expect the same obsession to claim a fourth scalp."},{"url":null,"title":"snp-government-sympathetic-to-fresh-round-of-european-elections","story":"Prime Minister Theresa May warned MPs last week that a y delay would ldquoundoubtedly require voters going to the polls to elect MEPs.However, in a statement to this newspaper, Nicola Sturgeonrsquos Government said it was ldquoconfident elections could be delivered in Scotland and such an outcome is ldquopreferable to Mayrsquos Brexit plan.The Prime Minister faces a pivotal week in the House of Commons as she tries to persuade MPs for the third time to support the draft withdrawal agreement she negotiated with the EU.Her plan has been rejected twice, but Tory sources believe progress has been made in winning over doubters in the Conservatives and in Northern Irelandrsquos Democratic Unionist party.However,the deal is declined, a much ier delay would likely be sought, which could ultimately lead to a softer Brexit or a second referendum.Another complication is that a delay could overlap with the European elections, which are scheduled for May.The UK was expected to leave the EU at the end of this month, and thus no longer have to send MEPs to Brussels, but an Article  extension could necessitate UK-wide participation.Pro-Brexit Tories do not want to have to contest another election for the Brussels parliament, and May last week used this prospect as leverage with Conservative MPs who oppose her plan:ldquoSuch an extension would undoubtedly require the United Kingdom to hold European Parliament elections in May . I do not think that that would be the right outcome, but the House needs to face up to the consequences of the decisions that it has taken.The SNP Government, however, which supports a so-called Peoplersquos Vote, is sympathetic to the European elections taking place.A Scottish Government spokesperson said: ldquoThe Scottish Government is calling for the Article  EU withdrawal process to be extended for as long as it takes to enable a second referendum on EU membership to be held.ldquoIn those circumstances, discussions would have to take place with the EU regarding elections for the European Parliament taking place in the UK ndash and we are confident this could be delivered across Scotland.ldquoHolding an election,that was necessary, would clearly be preferable to Scotland being forced out of the EU under the damaging terms of the Prime Ministerrsquos deal or the catastrophe of a lsquono dealrsquo outcome.An SNP insider said the party would contest any poll on an anti-Brexit  and reflect the views of the majority of people north of the border.It is understood the SNPrsquos governing national executive committee has taken steps present a list of candidates, should an election take place.Keith Brown, the SNPrsquos depute leader, said: \"Theresa May has made such a hash of Brexit, we started preparations in January. So wersquore all fired up, ready to go.\"The Scottish Liberal Democrats, another anti-Brexit party, are also in a position to pick candidatesan election arises.Scottish Labour are waiting to seeArticle  is extended before making a decision, while a spokesperson for the Scottish Tories said their ldquoexpectation is that Mayrsquos deal will pass, and so no preparations are being made.Documents circulating among EU ambassadors state the bloc would terminate the UKs membership on July stit has not taken part in European Parliament elections.The draft paper makes clear Britain has to take part in the electionsit wants an extension of more than three months.Meanwhile, May is continuing her efforts to salvage her Brexit deal amid further signs of pressure on her position.Further talks are expected over the coming days with the DUP in the hope that persuading the  Northern Irish MPs to back the deal will help sway scores of Tory Eurosceptics to fall into line.DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds said y talks on Friday with senior ministers including Chancellor Philip Hammond were \"constructive\" and there was a \"renewed focus\" from the Government on addressing their concerns.Dodds said: \"We have had a constructive dialogue. Those discussions will continue over the coming period of time.\"Former Cabinet minister Esther McVey suggested fellow Brexiteers could back Mays \"rubbish\" deal next week to make sure the UK leaves the EU.She told the BBC: \"The element now is that people will have to take a bad deal rather than no deal.\"It has also emerged that senior Tory MP Nick Boles has quit his local Conservative Association in the face of efforts to deselect him as the candidate for the next election amid rows over Brexit.The former minister, who supports a soft Brexit, told members of Grantham and Stamford Conservative Association he was resigning \"with immediate effect\" but will continue to \"take the Conservative whip at Westminsterit is offered \"on acceptable terms\", according to a letter.Councillor Martin Hill, vice president of the Grantham and Stamford Conservative Association, told members: \"As you are all aware, Nick has been at odds with the local party and the Prime Minister for some time, so this announcement does not come as a complete surprise, but the timing does leave at lot to be desired.Chief Whip Julian Smith said Mr Boles \"is a valued member of the Conservative Parliamentary party which I hope will continue to benefit from his ideas and drive\"."},{"url":null,"title":"destination-detox-13-of-scotlands-coolest-spas","story":"Wersquove put together our list of  coolest spas, so you can choose just where to treat your mum, yourself, or anyone  in need of a proper unwind.

Shersquos blissfully unaware of the conversation her parents are having at the kitchen table.The dresser behind Jamie and Victoria McCallum is filled with dozens of birthday cards from Rosiersquos classmates. Shersquos just turned six - but the couple are discussing what le would have been liketheyrsquod terminated the pregnancy. Rosie was born with Downrsquos Syndrome.The McCallums didnrsquot have to confront the idea of termination, however, while Victoria was pregnant. They didnrsquot take any tests. It was only when Rosie was born that they realised she had Downrsquos Syndrome. Victoria wouldnrsquot have terminated, eventests had come back positive. Jamie, though, knowing nothing about the condition then, might have thought dferently.lsquoWe wouldrsquove had a hell of a debate on our hands,rsquo he says. Victoria wonders aloud lsquowhether our relationship would have survivedrsquo. Itrsquos impossible to quanty the joy theyrsquod have lostthere was no Rosie in their lives. Today, knowing the facts about Downrsquos Syndrome, termination would never cross Jamiersquos mind.The McCallums have grown from a family devastated by Downrsquos Syndrome to one enriched by the condition. Jamie, , runs his own management consultancy, and Victoria, , worked in marketing but now raises their children at home. Theyrsquore among the most prominent advocates in Scotlandrsquos Downrsquos Syndrome community, and Rosie is something of a superstar within that world, a child who can count Michael Bubleacute, the singer Christina Perri, and Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby among her admirers.Those birthday cards on the dresser - from  children across their home town, Prestwick - tell the story of the changing nature of Downrsquos Syndrome within society. Years ago, there would have been no cards from friends.Every family touched by the condition shudders when they think of the past - of times like the s when children were locked away in institutions, their le chances little more than zero. Today, children with Downrsquos Syndrome are increasingly embraced by society, they look forward to a future where they go to mainstream school, get a job, live independently and fall in love. There are young people with Downrsquos Syndrome embarking on careers in theatre and sport Karen Gaffney, one of the worldrsquos best known people with Downrsquos Syndrome, swam the channel, earned an honorary doctorate, and gave a Ted talk.On Thursday itrsquos the McCallums th wedding anniversary . lsquoClearly le had a path for us,rsquo says Victoria. The family have a message to share, on this week which means so much to them. They fear that just as people with Downrsquos Syndrome are becoming accepted by mainstream society, that they may - in Jamiersquos words - soon be lsquoeradicatedrsquo.Until now, accurate testing for Downrsquos Syndrome centred on an amniocentesis, where a needle draws fluid from the uterus for analysis. Some parents are reluctant to take the test, fearing miscarriage. Now, a new blood test is to be rolled out which can accurately check for Downrsquos Syndrome without risk. The take up is expected to be huge, and the resulting terminations equally high. At the moment, the abortion rate is around  per cent. Scotland has a population of , with  births a year.lsquoIceland rolled [the new testing] out and there hasnrsquot been a Downrsquos Syndrome birth since,rsquo says Jamie. lsquoItrsquos like a government-funded eugenics programme.rsquoThe thought of a world without Rosies horries the McCallums. Both admit to being completely uninformed when Rosie - the middle of their three children - was born. Itrsquos impossible to make an informed choice about termination when all parents know are the long-standing myths - that children wonrsquot be able to dress themselves, or go to the toilet that theyrsquoll be le-long lsquoburdensrsquo, or incapable of learning.Jamie says his view of Downrsquos Syndrome when he was growing up was lsquoa form of prejudice - and prejudice comes from ignorancersquo. He would have seen lsquosomeone who canrsquot possibly be happy as they donrsquot have the faculties of the rest of us, and thatrsquos why itrsquos such a shake-up to your value system when you realise wersquove made all that stuff uprsquo.Victoria is brutally honest but even she struggles to admit that when she was growing up she probably saw people with Downrsquos Syndrome as lsquoretardedrsquo. lsquoThatrsquos a really awful thing to say,rsquo she adds. lsquoI remember feeling sorry for them. They werenrsquot accepted, they always stood on the periphery hellip When I fell pregnant one of my biggest fears was Downrsquos Syndrome.rsquoNevertheless, like many parents, they didnrsquot opt for an amniocentesis as they werenrsquot high risk. It wasnrsquot until moments after Rosiersquos birth that they realised she had Downrsquos Syndrome.lsquoI was shit scared,rsquo says Victoria. She looked at her babyrsquos eyes and lsquojust knewrsquo. Jamie was oblivious. He was holding Rosie - lsquoproud as punchrsquo - and had no idea anything was wrong until Victoria askedhe thought she had Downrsquos Syndrome. Jamie put Rosie down, took his phone to the bathroom and looked for lsquobabies with Downrsquos Syndromersquo on Google images.lsquoI knew at that point,rsquo Jamie says, but his words falter as tears overcome him. Victoria becomes upset at Jamiersquos distress and explains: lsquoItrsquos a post traumatic stress thing. It was a brutal experience.rsquoJamie continues: lsquoI just put her down and I didnrsquot pick her up again for quite some time.rsquo Victoria adds: lsquoI shut off and went into automatic mother mode. I just went lsquoI canrsquot cope with this so what I need to do is look after this babyrsquo - and Irsquod basically say lsquothis thingrsquo as at that time thatrsquos how I felt. Itrsquos brutal but itrsquos true.rsquolsquoYoursquove this path in your mind,rsquo says Jamie, lsquoand all of a sudden your entire future gets reformed - and then pour in all your prejudice, ignorance and misconceptions.rsquoVictoria was so traumatised after the birth that she couldnrsquot go to a maternity ward to visit her best friend and baby. Jamie went but lsquoa feeling of dread descended on me. You see things, like the number on the door, and itrsquos like flashbacksrsquo.The McCallums kept each other afloat those first few months - when one was down, the other was up. Victoria recalls crying as she breastfed Rosie and wonderingshe was in the middle of a lsquogrief cyclersquo and lsquoletting go of the child I expected to haversquo.She spent lsquothe first eight weeks of Rosiersquos le trying to figure outI wanted to keep herrsquo. Victoriarsquos voice falters and her eyes fill as she talks about how her sisters find that hard to believe because she was so protective of Rosie lsquofrom the moment she was bornrsquo.At one point, Jamie tried to rationalise what had happened by thinking of Rosie as a pet. Theyrsquore both shocked at the thoughts which went through their minds.Unlike many children with Downrsquos Syndrome, Rosie had no severe health problems, such as a congenital heart condition, so there was little dference raising Rosie to any other baby.Slowly, the couple began to think lsquowait a minute, why is this meant to be so bad rsquo. There was lsquono Hollywood momentrsquo, says Jamie, when things went from dark to light, but he recalls feeding Rosie one day when she was six months and apologising to her aloud. lsquoAt that point I believed it would be okay,rsquo he says, lsquoand thatrsquos a major hurdlersquo.Things changed for Victoria when she thought about adoption, but couldnrsquot imagine anyone caring for Rosie the way she could. She recalls going to a Downrsquos Syndrome meeting and realising lsquoI just want to be her mumrsquo.The mundane reality is that le with Downrsquos Syndrome just takes a little bit longer. Children will learn to read, walk, talk, go to the toilet, feed themselves - just like any other child - but theyrsquoll always be a little slower. Rosie is probably a year behind other children.Children with Downrsquos Syndrome learn dferently too. Theyrsquore more perceptive of emotions, and visual learners, says Jamie, so they identy the physical shapes of words quicker than sounds - thatrsquos why their house is plastered with stickers on furniture and appliances marked lsquoovenrsquo, lsquotable, lsquochairrsquo. They also use sign language to speed up Rosiersquos acquisition of speech.Rosie is in pre-school and about to go into Primary One. Children like her in mainstream education help eliminate prejudice. Unlike their parents, the children in Rosiersquos class have grown up with a friend with Downrsquos Syndrome and are basically blind to her condition. lsquoI can see the positive effects of Rosie on other people,rsquo says Jamie.Hersquos jealous of Rosiersquos classmates. lsquoWersquove created a society that values material things - cars, money - and these kids will grow up with someone who isnrsquot driven by that, and lives in the now, all the time, and her driving force is to be happy.rsquoVictoria adds: lsquoPeople say itrsquos changed their way of thinking, just being part of her le. She teaches us more than we could ever teach her. She teaches us to be far, far better human beings, and just be happier people.rsquoRosie and a bunch of other children with Downrsquos Syndrome touched the world this time last year when a viral video of the kids and their mums lip-synching and hand-signing a carpool karaoke version of Christina Perrirsquos lsquoA Thousand Yearsrsquo clocked  million views. Perri contacted them saying shersquod cried over the film - her song ed to the top five. It made national news in  countries, and Victoria and other mums appeared on This Morning. Michael Bubleacute got involved when the children covered lsquoAll I want for Christmasrsquo. The McCallums started the charity lsquoWouldnrsquot Change A Thingrsquo, celebrating children like Rosie, and aimed at correcting those misconceptions which caused them so much grief when she was born.Jamie says in the past hersquos told people that Downrsquos Syndrome lsquoisnrsquot as bad as you think, but now Irsquove actually come to believe that therersquos serious benefits to this - like the effect on others, like the positive effect on your own values. It makes you a better personrsquo.lsquoThe paradox is,rsquo adds Jamie, lsquothat therersquos been this major progress in understanding how they learn, major medical progress too, and thatrsquos happening simultaneously with the progress in screening and termination to the point of almost eradication. So just as yoursquove kind of cracked it on one side, therersquoll be none of them left.rsquoThe idea of there one day being no more people with Downrsquos Syndrome chills them, thinking of what would be lost. lsquoYou see beyond peoplersquos disabilities to the soul behind that, you see the person,rsquo says Victoria. lsquoThatrsquos what Rosie has taught me.rsquoJamie and Victoria treat Rosie no dferently to their other children, Abigail and Gregor - and she can get in just as much trouble as them. The McCallums expect a full le for Rosie - job, travel, love.lsquoWhen we first had Rosie,rsquo says Victoria, lsquoI was very scared that wersquod have her for the rest of our lives, but actually Rosiersquos biggest problem about leaving this house is going to be me not wanting her to go. I think the first child out the door will be her - shersquos the most independent. Irsquom not scared for her future now in any way whatsoever.rsquoWHEN WORDS CUT AS DEEP AS WOUNDSWHILE so much has changed for the better in society when it comes to the lives of people with Downrsquos Syndrome, language is still a blight. Words hurt.Jo Hughes helps run the charity Downrsquos Syndrome Scotland . It may surprise some, she says, but lsquoyou still hear people with Downrsquos Syndrome referred to as mongolsrsquo.Mistakes are also made by people not meaning to be cruel. Often the terms lsquoDownrsquos Syndrome personrsquo or a lsquoDownrsquos personrsquo is used - thatrsquos putting the disability before the human being. DSS has started a new lsquoMind Your Languagersquo campaign for Downrsquos Syndrome Week to let people know that the accepted term is lsquoa person with Downrsquos Syndromersquo.While years ago, negative misconceptions hurt, today seemingly positive misconceptions can do damage too. lsquoTherersquos a huge misconception out there that all people with Downrsquos Syndrome are forever smiley and happy,rsquo says Hughes, who worries about this lsquochildlikersquo image being thrust on the entire community. lsquoThey have the same range of emotions and feelings as every other human being.rsquo They go through puberty just like other teenagers, and can be stroppy adolescents.For Hughes, the struggle to change language is personal. Her son Jack, , has Downrsquos Syndrome and she wants him to enjoy lsquothe best le he can haversquo.Changing language, changes how people are seen, she says. lsquoFor every person who we can change how they think and talk about Downrsquos Syndrome, thatrsquos another day thatrsquos been worth going to work.rsquoSTUDENT AND SWIMMING CHAMP - JUST AN AVERAGE GIRL FROM AYRCERYS McCrindle is the future.

One case Chinese visitor is said to have set aside pound. million for a three-day tour of the Highlands.While that is at the extreme end of the scale, insiders say itrsquos not unusual for ldquoaverage visitors to spend pound, per person for a week, while others can easily spend double that on a single shopping spree at the House of Bruar.One luxury tour operator said: ldquoThe sky is the limit. A lot of whatrsquos going on is very discreet ndash most people donrsquot realise the amount of money flowing through the country.In many cases the millionaire tourist is looking to pay top dollar to share a dram with a whisky expert, play golf on a remote Hebridean course that most Scots have never heard of, or join scallop ers and fishermen off the west coast, rather than rub shoulders with the hoi polloi at the usual tourist haunts.According to a report from Allied Market Research, the global luxury market is projected to be the fastest-growing area of the tourism sector, expected to be worth ,bn by .A key element is said to be demand from high-end travellers to gain deeper experiences of the places they visit, avoiding tourist hotspots in favour of highly-personalised trips.VisitScotland has suggested income from ldquohigh-net-worth iniduals is forecast to rise by around % a year. Chief executive Malcolm Roughead said: ldquoIt is important that we encourage the tourism industry to provide world-class service, facilities, events and attractions to keep up with ever-changing consumer demands and ensure visitors continue to have memorable experiences.While luxury tour operators have always had a place in Scotlandrsquos tourist sector, there are signs of a growing response to rising demand, from hotels offering bespoke packages, to firms specialising in personalised itineraries and road trip specialists who send tourists off in Aston Martins to tackle the North Coast  ndash at around pound, a pop.Last week, five-star Edinburgh hotel The Glasshouse became the latest to join the luxury ldquoexperience market with a two-night Elite Whisky Experience ndash costing pound, a head.That buys two nights for two people at the hotelrsquos lavish Islay Suite overlooking Calton Hill, meals ndash including a seven-course whisky tasting dinner ndash guided tour of a distillery and the chance to explore the hotelrsquos selection of  whiskies with its whisky ambassador on hand to help with selections.One company, Bravo Whisky Golf, which specialises in tailor-made golf packages which whisk visitors from course to course by chartered plane, is offering three nights in an Islay hotel and chartered plane to watch this yearrsquos Open at Royal Portrush, plus a distillery tour and a round at Machrie Golf Links ndash for around pound,.ldquoTypically, clients will spend , to , per head for golf, accommodation, flights, meals and drinks, said Neil Scott Johnson, who co-founded Bravo Whisky Golf with his friend Paul Geddes. ldquoThese people have done Carnoustie, St Andrews and Turnberry and are looking for new experiences.

The debts have been repeatedly triggered in the plumbing scheme due to the high number of employers that have used it over the years.ldquoUnfortunately employer debt legislation is a case of well-intentioned legislation having unintended consequences because the sums of money employers are being asked to pay are quite large, she said.ldquoWe have a staggering amount of orphan liabilities, which relate to employers who are no longer contributing - about , employers in total have used the scheme.ldquoA debt is triggered when an employer winds up, goes insolvent or when their last employee leaves the scheme, but some that have triggered a debt may still be contributing to the scheme.ldquoA number of employers are very small and might only have one or two plumbers. They might have someone leave and then have a gap before someone  joins them - that gap would trigger a debt.Up until now the scheme has not collected any of these debts, with Ms Yates noting that its trustees, who had lobbied the Government for a change in the law, previously feltthe cost of doing so would be disproportionately high. They are looking to collect the debts now because the scheme, which has , members in Scotland and , in the rest of the UK, is expected to close to future accruals later this year.Fiona Hodgson, chief executive of the Scottish and Northern Ireland Plumbing Employersrsquo Federation , said the move has ldquonaturally raised serious concerns for our members.:Making a clear position on pensions.ldquoThe impact of Section  has the potential to be devastating for local businesses and the wider community, with the possibility of huge Section  debts looming over businesses who were simply trying to be good employers by providing a pension for their employees, she said.Affected businesses will start receiving demand letters between now and the end of June, although Ms Yates said that the scheme does not intend to collect every debt it issues a notice for.

Neither blinked and neither budged until, in the tradition of all pointless arguments between men, a woman intervened to break it up. Not only was it delightfully mad, it was a pretty good metaphor for the Brexit process: immovable, irrational, ridiculous, and a little bit childish.

Over the weekend, we heard Nicola Sturgeon saythat the chaos of Brexit makes Scottish independence more likely. Her deputy Keith Brown also said the mess of Brexit might be the point at which momentum for independence becomes unstoppable. In other words, the SNP is hoping, still, that the Brexit chaos will drive voters into their arms.However, I wonderwe have really, properly looked for the clues in the chaos, the little signs to be found in the rubble, and asked what we can learn from them. The SNP keep arguing that the more people hate Brexit, the more they will love independence some unionists, on the other hand, argue Brexit is a clue to how hard negotiating Scottish independence will be. But letrsquos leave Mr Self and Mr Francois staring at each other for a minute shall we and take a look at the actual parallels between leaving the EU and leaving the UK. The picture is more mixed that you might think.Read more: Nicola Sturgeon signals Indyref push before For a start, the UK is not the same as the EU, although the dferences between them provide useful pointers. For instance ndash dficult as Brexit is ndash the fact that the UK is a sovereign state means it can leave the EU without having to make dficult decisions about what currency it uses for example it also doesnrsquot have to apply to join other international organisations or sort out its foreign or defence policies. All those questions have already been answered.Obviously, the same does not apply to Scotland ndash after voting for independence, it would be leaving a state rather than an organisation made up of states and would therefore have to make a lot of choices from scratch that the UK isnrsquot facing with Brexit. Scotland and rest of the UK also have shared assetsin a way that the UK and the EU donrsquot. All of this means, by definition, that Scotland leaving the UK would be more complicated than the UK leaving the EU, which, by extension, means the negotiations on independence could be even more hideous and confrontational than those on Brexit.Except in one happy respect: the dferences between the UK and the EU mean that there would, definitely, thankfully, be no equivalent to the backstop crisisScotland became independent because there isnrsquot a part of Scotland that would need to be treated dferently in the way Northern Ireland does. Scotland, geographically and politically, would be leaving the UK as a single whole country. Therefore, no Scottish backstop required, to the considerable relief of everyone.However, the absence of a backstop is not the same as an invisible border with England. Assuming Brexit goes ahead, the UK would be out of the single market and could restrict immigration from the EU. Equally, assuming Scotland joins the EU as an independent state, it would be following the four freedoms, including freedom of movement - therefore there would have to be checks at the Scottish border. Which leads to another of the lessons amid the chaos of Brexit: putting up barriers at borders is bad for the economy and the same would apply to Scotland.The other clues from the Brexit process are just as troubling, particularly on how the negotiations might go. Part of the problem for Theresa May has been that the EU is bigger and more powerful than the UK so the EU states have been able to dominate the negotiations and the same could apply to Scottish independence ndash the UK would be the bigger party and could end up imposing a deal thatrsquos bad for Scotland.Read more: Former Yes chief: Indyref coming down the trackAnd thatrsquos before we come to the political isions within Scotland itself. With Brexit, wersquove seen a minority government led by Mrs May thatrsquos paralysed by the split between hard and soft Brexiters and is reliant on a small party, the DUP, to get a deal through. But Nicola Sturgeon could find herself in a similar situation, except that the isions in her case would be between hard and soft nationalists arguing over how close to stay to the UK.Itrsquos also likely that, in trying to get any deal through Holyrood, the SNP would be reliant on a small party just as Mrs May is with the DUP, except that Mrs Sturgeon would be reliant on winning over hard nationalists in the Green party. The extreme Brexiters may have been the gremlins in the electrics of Brexit, but you can bet that,the SNP ever won a referendum on independence, there would be a similar type of hard Scottish nationalist pushing for an absolute form of separation. And the ldquoJacob Rees-Mogg in this situation, the ring-leader of the hard separatists, could be the leader of the Greens Patrick Harvie .All of these clues point to a dficult time after a vote for Scottish independence, quite apart from the fact that the dferences between the UK and the EU make another referendum dubious anyway ndash whatever Nicola Sturgeon and Keith Brown may have been hinting at over the weekend, the UK does not need permission to leave the EU, whereas Scotland has to get consent to leave the UK.Brexit has also taught us what happens when referendums are won by a slim margin. The argument goes on. Therersquos bitterness and chaos. The losers in the referendum keep pushing for another vote. The isions become deeper, and the wounds ooze more poison. This is precisely what has happened in the last two years over Brexit but take a close look at the chaos and you can see that itrsquos also what could happen to Scottish independence."},{"url":null,"title":"richard-leonard-targets-free-bus-travel-for-all-across-scotland","story":"The Scottish Labour leader reiterated his partys pledge ahead of a debate on the issue in Holyrood this Wednesday.:Blow for Richard Leonard as leak reveals , Labour membership slump across ScotlandAnalysis of Transport Scotland statistics suggested % of people who have taken a bus journey in the day before being questioned were on an annual income of less than pound,.Only % earned more than pound,.Mr Leonard hailed the introduction of free bus travel for over s, however only % of the surveys respondents had a concessionary travel pass.Mr Leonard said: \"Free bus travel for the over s, introduced by the last Labour government, has been one of the finest achievements of the Scottish Parliament.\"That is one reason why Labour wants to establish free bus travel for all, starting with extending the free bus pass to under s.:Why should travelling by bus be beneath those using Glasgow Airport \"This move would overwhelmingly benefit the poorest in our society, and make a real dference to the economy.\"Every pound spent on concessionary bus travel generates almost pound in benefits to those bus users and to the wider economy.\"Thats why we are bringing a debate on our policy to the Scottish Parliament this week.\""},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9584069.jpg?type=article-full","title":"the-mystery-of-the-meteorite-that-struck-the-isle-of-lewis","story":"Rugged, remote and largely uninhabited, apart from the hunting-shooting set who descend on the exclusive Morsgail Estate Lodge and a handful of other holiday homes, there is little to disrupt the Hebridean peace and quiet.But it is also the scene of perhaps one of the most bizarre puzzles that islanders ndash and many others far beyond the shores ndash haveencountered.After all, itrsquos not every day that the area is gripped by reports that a mystery object ndash thought to be a meteorite, and for a while simply branded as ldquoThe Thing from Space ndash had plunged to earth.:Scientist believes first meteorite to hit British Isles landed in ScotlandOr, for that matter, that an entire loch suddenly disappears. It was  years ago this November when locals had noted the abundance of shooting stars and the aurora danced almost every night. While the wind blew hard there were occasional days bathed in winter sunshine and near-cloudless skies.At Aird Uig, the RAF early warning radar station, senior aircraftman James Watt had just lit a cigarette. He was off duty and yanked open the window of his billet to clear the smoke just in time.ldquoIt was a very strange incident, he reflects. ldquoAs far as I was able to tell at the time, I was the only person that saw it from beginning to end. It was fascinating.The jury is still out ndash even after six decades ndash as to what exactly happened. Events of the next few minutes would perplex even the brightest expert minds, lure the most revered stargazer of his age, Sir Patrick Moore, on a bone-rattling journey from his home to the Western Isles, and spark a still inconclusive debate as to what on earth caused a massive crater and a whole loch to be drained of every ounce of water.Mr Watt, , originally from Dundee and now living in North Lincolnshire, is convinced of what he saw and heard. ldquoIt was a lovely sunny morning, he begins.ldquoFirst off, it was asit was a dot, or a full stop in the sky. ldquoI thought lsquowhat on earth is that rsquo As I kept looking at it, this lsquofull stoprsquo got larger and larger. It was a large sphere or a ball that was black or dark grey with a trail of smoke behind it.The object shot past the camp, roaring loudly as it went, he adds.ldquoIt was travelling at an angle of deg to deg and passed around  yards from my billet and no more than ft above my head, then carried on over the horizon. I noticed a number of sparks coming from it and there was a heck of a roar, like an express train.It was so loud, the camprsquos commanding officer stopped in mid-shave, towel wrapped around his neck, and came outside to see what had happened.Mr Watt later described what hersquod seen as a ldquoburning ball of hell,not a meteorite then some strange ball of gas, which screamed beyond the camp in the direction of two nearby lochans that were popular fishing spots for his RAF colleagues.A reconnaissance party was gathered ndash Mr Watt included ndash to head towards the two lochans where the mystery object was thought to have landed.What they found was not entirely what they expected. He said: ldquoThe north lochan was nearest to the camp, and below that was another small lochan. We walked through the peat bog to where the top lochan should have been, but all we saw was mud and a gorge in the land where it had been. The north lochan was completely drained of water.The two lochans ndash Loch nam Learga to the north and Loch Mor Sheacuteilabridh to the south ndash were around  yards apart, but the team that scoured the site found no meteorite fragments, no signs of scorching and, strangely for Mr Watt, no dead fish.:Evidence of biggest meteorite to hit Britain found in ScotlandldquoWe walked around this mud patch and couldnrsquot see a single dead fish, there was no smell either, he adds. It took several days for news of the incident to find its way  miles north to Stornoway after a chance remark by a local postman who came across the drained lochan, large swathes of churned up bogland, and, he claimed, a whf of burning.According to reports at the time, the higher lochan ndash  yards long and around  yards wide, around  yards uphill from its neighbour ndash appeared to have a hole torn in its south bank, while the water seemed to have drained with such force that the land around looked asit had been subjected to an earthquake, with channels ft deep carved into the peat.The curious incident sparked lively speculation. Some thought a meteorite, others a lightning strike, a few suggested it could be a Russian rocket targeting the radar camp, while others plumped for flood damaged lochan banks suddenly giving way. Some newspaper reports even hinted at space travellers.To help solve the mystery, an astrophysicist from the Royal Observatory of Edinburgh visited the site on the Uig moor, while newspapers chartered planes to fly overhead, snapping pictures to send around the world. But even the expert was unsure of what he was looking at.ldquoThe possibility that the island of Lewis was hit by the biggest meteorite to land in Britain in living memory grew slimmer after a visit to the site by an astrophysicist from the Royal observatory, reported The Herald of December , .ldquoThe scientist, Dr Hugh E Butler, thought heavy rain was the likely cause of the upheaval, it continued, before adding that even he wasnrsquot sure. ldquoDr Butler reached no firm conclusion.He said: lsquoSomething  may have triggered it off. A meteorite cannot be ruled out but unless any fragments are found I donrsquot think for that investigation is justied.rsquoThe area between Morsgail Lodge and the hamlet of Kinreasort five miles away, was under increasing media interest. Reports of the incident soon reached America and Africa, and the East Grinstead home of Sir Patrick Moore.After a day travelling north to Inverness, Sir Patrick caught a flight to Stornoway and then travelled by road to Morsgail Lodge and on to the site. Reports of meteorites were, he suggested, science fiction. Instead, Sir Patrick plumped for the missing loch as being a case of serious subsidence with the possibility of a methane explosion which may have thrown rocks high into the air.A bog burst ndash when peat becomes so saturated that a landslide occurs ndash seemed to many to be the logical answer.Mr Watt, however, is among those who remain convinced that there was something more to the odd events of late November .Did whatever it was simply sink deep into the peat, hidden from view  And why was there not a single dead fish to be seen ldquoYou donrsquot forget something like that, he says. ldquoIt was exciting, unusual.

Meanwhile, a doctorrsquos costume will have a picture of a boy in a white coat with a stethoscope. Children are influenced by these stereotypes.:Gender bias against menMr Morrison, a former middleweight boxer who represented Scotland in boxing tournaments around the world, including the  Commonwealth Games, and who continues to work as a Boxing Scotland referee and judge, faced challenges when he was considering nursing as a career.ldquoI was helping to care for my gran, who had dementia, and after leaving school I worked in a hospital pharmacy, where I became interested in nursing. My supervisor encouraged me into the profession, but I never told any of my friends when I was applying for my diploma.ldquoMy best friend was also interested in a career in nursing and we used to talk about it in secret as there was such prejudice against men going into the profession.The father-of-four who has been in nursing for  years, added: ldquoNursing is a fantastic career with plenty of iety, flexibility and opportunities to progress ndash and Irsquod like more boys and men to know what a broad and deep profession it is. I believe nursing can become more attractive to men and that perceptions can change.ldquoWhen I was a child, you hardly saw any female police officers or firefighters. That has changed and both those professions are the better for being more erse ndash just as nursing will benefit from a workforce that better reflects our society.The social media campaign is backed by MSP John Mason, Vice Convener of the Economy, Energy and Fair Work Committee, who described the universityrsquos new drive as a ldquobrilliant idea. ldquoThe Scottish Parliament is very interested in the gender pay gap and how we can change the idea that men are going into one profession traditionally and women into another.Gordon Hill, a senior nursing lecturer at GCU, said: ldquoThe employment opportunities are there in nursing and there are also opportunities for career progression. Itrsquos a ied career that can see a nurse going from intensive care to research to community and clinical nursing.\"We have an ageing population and need more nurses and more of them should be men.

For instance, a very unexpected discovery was the presence of Roman activity at Milltimber, likely dating from around   AD. Ninety bread ovens were uncovered, which were probably constructed by the Roman army at a time of invasion led by the Roman General Agricola. However, no evidence of an associated camp was found, which is unusual for these types of features. We can only speculate as to why the ovens were in this location.“Going back to the very earliest finds, there was also evidence of stone tool production dating between about , and , BC at Milltimber, a near unprecedented body of evidence which pushes back our understanding of human activity in north east Scotland by several thousand years.”Bruce continued:“Bronze Age activity was identied from Nether Beanshill in the form of a roundhouse and contemporary cremation complex dating from around , to , BC. The burial comprised of an urn in which the cremated remains of an inidual in their s had been placed.

It secures steady employment for our specialist e teams, increases opportunities for one of our larger vessels operating in Orkney waters and, in turn, will bring additional onward spend in our local communities.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

If cattle react aggressively, release your dog and take the shortest, safest route out of the field.The Scottish Outdoor Access Code website provides more information, including online video tutorials covering everything from teaching a dog to be relaxed around livestock through to dog walker etiquette and legal responsibilities.Dog behaviourist and trainer Natalie Light said: “These videos are packed full of great tips that will give dog owners the information and skills to have fun and safe walks in Scotland’s outdoors as well as understand their rights and responsibilities under the Scottish Outdoor Access Code.“I hope they encourage everyone to get involved and have the confidence to enjoy getting out and about with their pets this spring.”Farmers and other land managers are also encouraged to support responsible access with dogs by following the guidance in the Scottish Outdoor Access Code, for example by avoiding putting sheep close to lambing in fields with well-used routes, or indicating reasonable alternatives. If necessary, local access officers can also provide advice.More information is available on the Scottish Outdoor Access Code website.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

At this busy time of year, the union is urging applicants to start filling out their SAF and is reminding them that, as things stand, it#s business as usual for all CAP schemes.The union has also said the online application process has seen signicant improvements in recent years and the clear majority of applications are now made online.

Iniduals can also go to their Local Area Office where staff will be on hand to assist those completing their form online.NFU Scotland president Andrew McCornick said: “Brexit chaos and confusion are dominating the headlines and generating uncertainty. The crucial thing for all farmers and crofters to bear in mind is that, as things stand, it is business as usual for all CAP schemes and that includes completing this year’s SAF.“The SAF window, which will run from  March to  May, will be punctured by Brexit headlines but we don’t want anyone to inadvertently be distracted from this important process. SAF forms are the most important forms that Scottish farmers fill out every year and I would encourage all members to begin working on their forms as soon as possible to ensure they meet the  May deadline.“For the second year, paper forms will not be automatically sent out by post, with the Scottish Government continuing to encourage claimants to complete their SAF online. Whether you are happy to switch to online or are sticking to paper, the important thing is to take plenty of time and not leave it to the last-minute. Remember, it is the most important day’s work in any farmer’s year.”• Online applications can be submitted via the Scottish Government#s rural payments and services website, at www.ruralpayments.org.A paper copy of the Single Application Form can be picked up at the Scottish Government#s office, in the Government Buildings, on Junction Road, Kirkwall.

No amount of fiddling about works, switch them off and on and often the problem is solved.This is where we are now with Brexit. If it is ever to be delivered at all the process needs to be rebooted.This week there is likely to be a third opportunity for MPs to pass the Prime Minister’s Withdrawal Agreement so she can claim we are leaving the EU after all,only at the end of June rather than the end of March as she personally “guaranteed”. Those MPs that believe Brexit is desirable and wish to achieve it should vote it down again – and they should vote it down at each and every opportunity it is presented for endorsement.I know there are a growing number of MPs that have voted against the Withdrawal Agreement in the past who are now changing their minds and reluctantlysupporting it in the hope they can deal with its problems afterwards. They just want to get over the line and “leave” on th March, intending to claim they have met their promises on Brexit. I believe they are well meaning but through desperation are naively being taken in or are fooling themselves.Theresa May’s agreement is so bad it is actually worse than remaining an EU member under current membership terms. We will not be able to leave the agreement without EU approval Northern Ireland will be treated dferently from the rest of the UK the jurisdiction of European Courts shall remain superior regulations and restrictions of the EU’s single market and customs union will continue our fishing grounds will be included in negotiations again – and we’ll continue to pay billions into the EU on top of the £bn no court of arbitration would recommend we pay.If the Withdrawal Agreement is passed it shall then be presented as an example of brilliant leadership by the prime minister against all odds. We shall never stop hearing of her resilience, fortitude, dedication and perseverance in praise of her premiership. She will believe she should carry on and, believe me, there will be figures that will push for her to stay, as it shall be advantageous to them. Fortunately the truth will out. If she is allowed to stay and run the next negotiations they shall be just as disastrous. Nor will it take long for the agreement to unravel. I suspect most of the public is unaware that the Withdrawal Agreement is not a final “deal” but provides only a transition period for leaving. Its twenty-one month trade talks will be worse than the past two years since Article  was invoked. Having paid over our billions and accepted the unnecessary Irish backstop we shall have little negotiating leverage to protect our industries and our interests. The bullying and scare stories shall heighten economic uncertainty and eat into business confidence.Old and new kites shall be flown to wrong foot our negotiators about access to our fisheries unless another trade-off is given Gibraltar will be raised with malevolent intent to keep us in our place, while the threat of taxes on our financial servicescan become a reality. The backstop will not be solved for it is ​insoluble without EU agreement. The point is there is no repairing the Withdrawal Agreement. The only way to break the cycle, to clear the frozen screen before us is to refuse to agree to any deal.The legal position is thatan exit agreement acceptable to the EU cannot be signed-off by parliament the UK must leave the EU on Friday  March without one. We shall then have to use the many mini deals already in place for aviation, visa-free travel, nuclear power, haulage licences and all the rest.It is unlikely the EU will grant a short extension of Article  until the end of June because it is not intent on negotiating any more, it has no incentive to do so because the UK leaving without an agreement has been taken off the table. It will undoubtedly offer a long extension of around two years, possibly infor us providing a referendum, and certainly at great financial cost. It will mean fighting the European Parliament elections, which shall undoubtedly deliver carnage upon the Tory party and revive the career of Nigel Farage.Only voting the Withdrawal Agreement down can reset the negotiations. What is there to lose by rejecting it again and waiting to see what extension is offered and what the EUs price is  Agreeing to “the Deal” will not deliver Brexit, but rejecting it can.Some MPs might find the price of extension too high and can conclude it is better to leave on the th, ending the uncertainty and resetting the negotiations from outside the EU but in a much more favourable position. Alternativelya long delay in leaving is forced upon pro-Brexit MPsthen what was once worth fighting for before must surely be worth fighting for again too  That the challenge has become a longer game should not put people off from achieving the best result.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"leader comment the internet needs urgent regulation","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...If anyone still harboured the slightest doubt about the need for tighter regulation of the internet, the live-streaming of the murders of Muslim worshippers in New Zealand on Friday surely removed it.The worldwide web may have brought people together, it may have made the sharing of ideas and information easier than ever, and it may be here to stay but we should never simply accept the bad that comes with the good the net brings. Even as social media companies deleted footage of the horric scenes in Christchurch, internet users uploaded it again. Anyone browsing popular websites would have had no dficulty tracking down the graphic video stream showing the cold-blooded killings.We understand it is not easy for internet companies to comprehensively police their s but that is no reason not to require them to do so. When sites like Twitter and Facebook are used to share distressing images and footage, they must be held to account. And so we support MPs on the cross-party group on Social Media and Young People’s Mental Health and Wellbeing who have called for internet s to adhere to a statutory code of conduct.Members of the parliamentary group say addiction to social media should be classied as a disease and that tougher regulations are needed to protect children from firms operating in an “online Wild West”. The move comes after MSPs urged the Scottish Government to commission research into whether use of these internet s was linked to “signicant increases” in the numbers of children and teenagers suffering mental health problems.It is true each generation of parents finds a new innovation about which to be concerned. Whether it was the birth of rock “n” roll in the s, the rise of the home computer game console in the s or the explosion in violent movies during the s, the “next big thing” has always prompted fears about its impact on impressionable young people.Often, these concerns have been unfounded, fuelled by ignorance rather than information. But when it comes to the material available online - from violent pornography, to live footage of the murders of Muslim worshippers - fears about the impact on consumers are entirely justied.We need new rules - in the shape both of laws and a code of conduct - to regulate the internet and we need them now.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"brexit john bercow rules out third vote on deal without changes","story":"Commons Speaker John Bercow has dealt a serious blow to the government by ruling out further votes on Theresa May#s Brexit unless it undergoes changes.Mr Bercow said parliamentary rules dating back to  made clear that a government could not bring back the same or similar motion “ad infinitum” even though MPs keep rejecting it.The ruling means that without changes to the Brexit deal, a further vote cannot be held until a new parliamentary session begins - not due until after the summer - or unless the government asks the Queen to prorogue parliament, effectively suspending it for a short period.: Nicola Sturgeon accuses Theresa May of undermining Holyrood over DUP Brexit deal“What the government cannot legitimately do is to submit to the House the same proposition or substantially the same proposition as that of last week which was rejected,” Mr Bercow told MPs.There was no immediate response from Downing Street to Mr Bercows statement.The Prime Ministers official spokesman said: \"The Speaker did not warn us of the contents of the statement or indeed the fact that he was making one.\"Eurosceptic Conservative Sir Bill Cash, chairman of the European Scrutiny Committee, said Mr Bercows statement seems \"to make an enormous amount of sense\" given that the Brexit deal has been defeated twice and there would need to be a \"substantial dference\" to allow a third vote.SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford, raising a further point of order in the Commons, said there is a \"constitutional crisis\" and he suggested Prime Minister Theresa May should \"immediately\" call a meeting of opposition leaders.: Brexit: Jacob Rees-Mogg hints at backing dealConservative Jacob Rees-Mogg, chairman of the European Research Group, added he was \"delighted\" Mr Bercow had decided to follow precedent.He also said: \"Would I be right in thinking that a new session after a prorogation would allow the motion to be ed to the House \"Mr Bercow said his point about a new session of parliament after prorogation was \"self-evidently valid\", adding he was not advocating this.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"jeremy corbyn to hold talks on brexit solution as may faces calls to go","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Jeremy Corbyn will meet leaders of Westminster parties to try to break the Brexit deadlock this week # although he will not attend a joint cross-party summit due to be held today.In a major sht, the Labour leader wrote to his Westminster counterparts in the SNP, Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru and the Green Party calling for urgent meetings to find a solution to Theresa May’s “failed” Brexit negotiations.In his letter, he said he was keen to find common ground with supporters of other plans. And yesterday Mr Corbyn said: “I look forward to more meetings this week so that we can do what the government should have started two years ago – namely reach out, engage and listen to dferent views and find a consensus on Brexit which helps bring our country back together.”However, it seems that Mr Corbyn will hold talks only on his own terms and will not attend a joint cross-party meeting today. Ian Blackford, Vince Cable, Liz Saville Roberts and Caroline Lucas are all believed to have accepted Mr Corbyn’s invitation for separate meetings, but sources say he will not attend their joint meeting today to discuss moving forward with a second EU referendum, with Remain on the ballot paper. Mr Blackford said Mr Corbyn had declined invitations to talk for the past two years. The SNP’s Westminster leader said: “It is now clear beyond doubt that there is no such thing as a good Brexit and Westminster remains deeply ided.“The best and most democratic way forward is to put the decision back to the people in a second EU referendum, with Remain on the ballot paper.“I look forward to continuing discussions with the other Westminster party leaders on holding a second EU referendum, with the option to remain.“I hope Jeremy Corbyn will now join us.”The meeting on a second EU vote comes as Parliament awaits a potential third vote on Mrs May’s deal, with the embattled Prime Minister again facing calls for her to go. However, she could still duck another showdown on her withdrawal agreement, after Cabinet ministers said another vote would not be held unless Mrs May was confident of overturning last week’s overwhelming defeat.Unless the -vote humiliation can be reversed, she would be forced to seek a long extension to the Article  process, with the UK required to elect MEPs in May, Chancellor Philip Hammond said.The possibility of Brexit being delayed or overturned in a second referendum is swinging some Eurosceptics reluctantly behind the deal before the third vote on the package. But so far the number of Tories publicly switching positions has amounted to a trickle rather than the flood the Prime Minister needs as she seeks  more votes for her deal.Despite the threat, former Cabinet minister Esther McVey said it was time the Prime Minister made a “dignied departure” – and even suggested she would stand as the next Conservative leader “ there were enough people who supported me”.The Conservative MP for Dover, Charlie Elphicke, said there needed to be “a change of leadership” for him to support the deal. He added: “We need a new face and a new team to take us forward to the future relationship.” As part of the effort to put pressure on Tory hardliners and the DUP to sht its position and support the deal, both Mr Hammond and International Trade Secretary Liam Fox made clear there might not be a third voteit looked likely to fail again.However, the Government’s emphasis on talks with the DUP has led to First Minister Nicola Sturgeon claiming “ten DUP MPs currently have more influence over the future of Scotland than our own national Parliament”.

I value all public sector workers and I thank them for the work that they do.“On the police pay award - that is the best award for police officers anywhere in the UK and the Scottish Police Federation said it was the best award in  years.”She added: “If the member thinks . per cent is not good enough... then I wonder what he makes of the two per cent that has been awarded to police officers in England by his Tory colleagues in the Westminster government, I think described by the head of the Met as a punch in the nose for police officers ”Later, Mr Simpson said the First Minister should apologise for her remarks in Holyrood.He said: “Nicola Sturgeon should be taking the concerns of a serving police officer extremely seriously. Instead, in front of Scotland’s parliament, she branded him a disgrace.“It’s no wonder officers are losing faith in this SNP government with that kind of attitude. These brave and hardworking police officers should not be discriminated against because they don’t threaten to go on strike.“The First Minister needs to apologise for being so dismissive of his concerns.”In the letter, the anonymous officer said: “Why has such a massive importance been placed on the pay rise for school teachers when other public service staff are not being awarded nearly as much as a pay rise “Does the Scottish Government place the value of police officers as only half that of school teachers  Is it that the Government know that because police officers cannot strike or take any real industrial action that they are an easy target ”A spokesman for the First Minister later said that she would not apologise as her \"disgraceful\" comment was not directed at the police officer but at Graham Simpson.During First Ministers Questions, Mr Simpson was booed by SNP backbenchers as he read out the letter, and asked what Nicola Sturgeon would say to the officer and “thousands of others” like him.Ms Sturgeon went on to say: “In terms of our NHS workers many get higher pay in Scotland than they do in England because of the value we attach to the work that they do.“In terms of teachers they have now been offered an exceptionally good pay deal and I think that is recognition of the good work that they do and I hope that is now accepted.“But I value all public sector workers and I thinkyou look at any group of public sector workers you will find that the value attached to them by the Scottish Government is much much greater than the value attached to their counterparts in England by the Tory government at Westminster.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"spend trident money on more public sector workers argues snp","story":"Scotland#s share of the annual cost of the Trident nuclear deterrent could pay for the training of almost , new public sector workers, it has been claimed.According to analysis by the SNP, Scotland’s notional share of the bill for renewing and maintaining the Faslane naval base – around £ million – could pay for training the equivalent of almost  nurses,  police officers, , teachers and  doctors.The claim comes as the SNP prepares to debate Trident at its spring conference next month. A resolution by the party’s Glasgow Maryhill and Springburn branch calls for a “clear timetable for the removal of nuclear weapons from Scottish soil and waters”.Trident consists of four Vanguard-class submarines, which can carry up to  \u2028ballistic missiles, each armed with up to eight nuclear warheads.Nuclear weapons have been sited at Faslane for more than  years and cost the UK around £. billion a year –  per cent of the defence budget – with Scotland’s share of that cost reaching £m. According to the SNP, the cost of training a nurse is £, a year, a police officer £,, while a teacher’s training cost is £, and a GP £, a year.Bill Kidd MSP, co-president of the Parliamentarians for Nuclear Non-proleration and Disarmament group in Scotland, said the new figures backed the SNP’s opposition to Trident. He said: “The millions of pounds in taxpayer money that is being wasted by Westminster could go towards making sure our public services come first building hospitals, training public sector workers, improving schools and lting people out of Tory-inflicted poverty. “Instead of investing in our vital services, the Scottish Government is being forced to mitigate for cuts, wasted funds and unprecedented damage caused to our economy by the Tories and Labour’s sorry lack of opposition.“The SNP has always been clear on the fact that we want to see a nuclear weapons-free Scotland.”However, Glasgow Tory MSP Adam Tomkins said: “The SNP’s objection to Trident is nothing to do with cost and everything to do with their outdated ideology.“The SNP’s blueprint for independence would subject Scotland to years of punishing public service cuts. If the SNP really wanted to put Scottish public services first, it would abandon its obsession with independence and start improving the health service.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"royal mile treasure trove of mary queen of scots documents found","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...A treasure trove of documents signed by Mary Queen of Scots and revealing the #everyday reality of ruling the country# in the th century has been unearthed in a council storage facility on the Royal Mile.A haul of handwritten papers is said to show the doomed monarch “carefully managing the busy commercial le of Edinburgh”, as well as authorising the building of new defences for the city in Leith.The documents, which are set to be the centrepiece of a new exhibition in Edinburgh on Mary’s short-lived rule, have already been conserved and digitised to allow them to be viewed publicly on the council’s online archive. They were discovered by staff in a store at the Museum of Edinburgh, just a few hundred yards away from the Palace of Holyroodhouse, where Mary ruled for six years after ing from France in . The  documents, which are inidually dated, numbered and signed, relate to the rights of deacons and tradesmen in the city, the selling of meat at the Tolbooth and the making of salt in Newhaven.Early conservation work on the documents, which were recently discovered in the Museum of Edinburgh’s own storage facility off the Canongate, has revealed watermarks – one of a goat and another of a flower – which can only been seen when held up to light.It is thought the papers entered the archives of the local authority in the s, but were then “lost” before being rediscovered nearly a century later during conservation work. Intriguingly, some of the documents signed by Mary date from when she was still in France.Experts in the council’s museums and galleries service, which is responsible for the official archives of the city, said the recently unearthed documents revealed an “often overlooked “ aspect of her le.History curator Vicky Garrington said: “Together, the documents shed light on a key part of Scotland’s past. We all know the tragic story of Mary Queen of Scots, her eventful le and eventual execution in , but in these documents we see a dferent side to Mary.“Here, she can be seen carefully managing the everyday affairs of Edinburgh, both from France and Scotland. It’s fascinating to think of her reading through these official papers before carefully applying her signature.“They are staying in storage at the museum for now. But we hope to have them assessed by a conservator and for further research to be done on them by experts on Mary, after which we hope to exhibit them, which will be hugely exciting.”Museums and galleries manager Frank Little said: “We’re constantly reviewing, caring for and researching our collections, and look forward to sharing more of the city’s rich heritage with residents and visitors through our programme of exhibitions and online activities.” Council culture convener Donald Wilson said: “Our museums and galleries hold thousands of historic treasures, many of which are on display in our venues. However, some items such as these documents are too fragile to be on long-term display, so putting them online is a great way to showcase them.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"first look at the jarls squad","story":"Plenty of onlookers were already on the streets as the squad made its first procession of the day from Islesburgh Community Centre, past the galley shed on St Sunniva Street and on to the Toll Clock Shopping Centre.In the gloom, the ranks of the Jarl#s Squad looked the part wearing emerald green kirtles with dragon mots underneath simple brown leather breastplates embossed with the same mot.

They then went on to highlight some of the key tenets underpinning the debate such as trade agreements, law and immigration, before making their concluding statements.In the opening gambit for the pro-Brexit team, S pupil Abbi Morgan argued that leaving the EU #would be a hugely positive thing for the UK# and would allow the country to #take control of borders and create worldwide trade agreements#.She went on to add that it would put the UK in a position to #take back its sovereignty# and make its own decisions on important matters. She stated that as a net contributor to the EU, the UK would be better off by £. billion.In the opening address for the pro-EU team, Lois Langlandssaid that #history and past experience as a member of the EU# gave the UK a more secure position for the future and that, in leaving the European Union, the UK would #enter the unknown# and #walk into the future blindfolded#.She said that outside the EU the UK was a #small fish in a big pond# and asked why any country would be interested in providing a free trade agreement with the UK.#The EU as an organisation is extremely wasteful#, he said. #Every  days the European Parliament moves from Brussels to Strasbourg, where it sits for four days # this is estimated to cost nearly £ million a year.#Touching on the issues of freedom of movement as part of the remain team, Chiara MacLeansaid: #Once the UK leaves the EU, British citizens will become third-party nationals, with no automatic right of admission.# She added that, through the new European travel information and authorisation system, all UK nationals over  years of age #would have to pay money to go somewhere they had a free right to go now#.Seth Bennettook up the reins for the pro-Brexit side, arguing that in terms of laws and immigration the EU could pass any laws they wanted and in by doing so #strip Britain of its sovereignty# # which he described as #one of its driving forces#.He believed that Brexit would offer the UK the chance to #increase its spending in education and housing# which could perhaps lead to a #revival of the nation#s once-thriving industries#.Speaking for the pro-EU team, Gracie Buchan said that leaving the European Union would lead to a trade deficit and result in a shortage of daily supplies such as fruit and vegetables.#Keeping food shop shelves full and prices down will be one of the biggest challenges when Brexit comes around,# she said. #Failure to reach some sort of an agreement could see retailers face an average increase of  per cent, particularly in dairy, meat, veg, and fruit.#Closing for the Brexit side, S pupil Joseph Moller said the EU favoured its own agenda and that in terms of per head of population Maltese citizens had  times more representation than UK nationals.He added that, rather than the , jobs that were cited as potentially being lost due to Brexit, the level of employment had in fact risen by one per cent since the referendum and unemployment was at its lowest level since the s.Summing up for remain, S pupil Innes MacNeil said: #Latest reports suggest that deals have been struck with just seven out of  countries, we have gained a lot more than we have spent on the EU, and multinational companies are threatening to relocate overseas, affecting jobs and investments.#Exiting in less than  days# time without any sound withdrawal agreement and just a few trade relationships will result in uncertainty and chaos.#The judges said they were impressed by how confident and informed the pupils were.

Since then emergency repairs have been undertaken as the building had been unoccupied for a number of years following the deaths of Jim and Sally Gillen, Gracehill’s last postmasters. Happily, a full scheme of restoration is now underway. The first phase will see the building of new chimneys, the replacement of the roof and rainwater goods and repairs to the windows. The building is historically very signicant as it was a purpose built shop constructed for the Settlement in . It is two storey with attics and basement and the layout is much as it was when originally constructed. The central shop area still contains many original features including shelving built into the walls, counters and a large wooden winch wheel for drawing stores up to the attic. Speaking about the restoration David Johnston, chairman of the Trust said: The aim is to restore this unique building so visitors can once again experience what le might have been like in the nineteenth century. “Holiday accommodation with a period theme will also be provided and a tea room will complete the scheme to ensure the future of this wonderful and historic building and hopefully the roof will be good for another  years!

It honours the UK’s solemn commitments in the Belfast Good Friday Agreement.“If we ever have to use that insurance policy, it cannot become a permanent arrangement and it is not a template for our future relationship.“The deal that MPs voted on in January was not strong enough in making that clear and legally-binding changes were needed to set that right. We have now agreed them.“The EU cannot act with the intent of applying the backstop indefinitely which can be challenged.“Now it is time to come together and back this improved deal.” Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said the new agreements were an “unambiguous statement” of both sides’ “good faith and intentions” but also made it clear they did not undermine the principle of the backstop.“We have insisted that the Withdrawal Agreement could not be rewritten, and that the backstop arrangement, while intended to be temporary, must continue to apply unless and until it is replaced by future arrangements that can achieve the same objective, namely no hard border,” he said.“However, we have also said that we were prepared to offer guarantees and further reassurances and to the UK of our good faith and intentions – indeed we have offered such reassurances on many occasions.“The Instrument agreed yesterday puts those assurances on a legal footing and represents an unambiguous statement by both parties of what has been agreed. “It does not reopen the Withdrawal Agreement, or undermine the backstop or its application. “It says that we will work together, in good faith, in pursuit of a future relationship that ensures that the objectives of the Protocol, particularly the need to avoid a hard border, are met. “The documents agreed yesterday reiterate our wish to establish a future partnership with the UK that is as close as possible, and marks our commitment to ensure that negotiations on that future relationship can begin as soon as the UK leaves. “The instrument agreed sets out how we will go about this important work. “In many ways, Brexit has been a dark cloud over us for many months, and particularly the threat of no deal. A positive vote tonight can remove that cloud and restore confidence and optimism in Britain, Ireland and across the European Union. “We now need to see the Withdrawal Agreement ratied by Westminster and by the European Parliament without further delay, so that we can get on with the important work of building the closest possible relationship between the EU and the UK, and between the UK and Ireland, post Brexit. “I know feel that for the remains of the day, we need to give MPs in Westminster the time and space to consider what#s now on the table.” All eyes now turn to UK Attorney General Geoffrey Cox who will later today give his considered assessment of whether what Mrs May has secured is legally binding. His response is expected to be key in deciding what way Brexit hardliners – notably Jacob Rees-Mogg’s ERG and the DUP – will vote this evening.

But now, it seems the only paths are to see a catastrophic no deal outcome, the Government working across the House of Commons to find a softer version of Brexit, or reconsidering Brexit in its entirety,# she said.“In the short run, taking a no deal off the table must be the immediate priority. In itself and without a clear plan, this resolves nothing. The House of Commons is good at saying what it is against, but can’t manage to give a clear answer on what it is for. But the UK is too close to the clf-edge and every day of uncertainty sees more and more economic and social damage.“The clearest, most coherent and most democratic route through this impasse lies with a People’s Vote, including both the Prime Minister’s deal and the Remain option. This needs to be tested in Parliament as a matter of urgency.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"sentence overturned for man carrying flag","story":"AN IRSP activist who was convicted for carrying a flag during a Falls Road Easter commemoration has had his sentence overturned.In December last year, West Belfast man Sean Carlin was given a four-month suspended sentence for carrying a historical replica of an INLA Belfast Battalion flag during the commemoration in .The parade had been themed to honour local members who had lost their lives during attacks on the organisation following a  split. However, in what is believed to be the first case of its kind, Sean was subsequently arrested and convicted under the Terrorism Act  for carrying the flag in circumstances that state authorities deemed to arouse suspicion that he is a member or supporter of a proscribed organisation.This week, Sean revealed that his suspended sentence had been quashed with a £ fine issued in its stead following a court appeal against the earlier ruling.Speaking to the Andersonstown News, Sean said: “From the start of this I was of the opinion that no matter what the outcome of the case was that I was going to be fighting it. If I was convicted, and eventually was convicted, then the benchmark was set and would have big repercussions for republicans right across the board. The point we made was that this was a commemorative event. It was advertised as a commemorative event so we were trying to unravel the agenda of the PPS and the cops.“We’ve been of the opinion that, this is all because we didn’t buy into the Fresh Start Agreement,” he added.“The IRSP has been getting hounded since then. This flag issue was just another signicant push in relation to criminalising the IRSP. On a personal level, I couldn’t accept carrying a flag to commemorate your dead being a criminal offence – it’s unheard of.”Sean’s solicitor, Michael Brentnall, said that while the case has “set the benchmark” in terms of sentencing, the legislation surrounding the conviction stands to be challenged.“I think it’s signicant, particularly the judges remarks at the end, who stated that no person in Ireland should go to jail for carrying a flag in Ireland. That’s signicant in itself and it has set the benchmark for how these matters be dealt with. We’re now seeking senior council’s opinion on whether there is a point of law that can be taken to the court of appeal on the basis of the conviction alone rather than just the sentence.” He continued: “Each case is facts specic, but in Sean’s case it was said during proceedings that every case of somebody carrying a similar flag to a commemoration could be criminalised. Sean was the only person this had been enforced against – there’s an issue with that in itself, but then Sean’s barrister made the point that this was a clear breach of freedom of expression and the sanction was entirely excessive in relation to the context of what had happened.”He added: “Another point that we still have to explore is that the legislation is very vague. The legislation says that you can be a supporter or a member of a proscribed organisation. If this is a means of circumventing membership charges and having somebody landed with a charge then that’s a dferent fight.”"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37925662.ece/b9249/AUTOCROP/w620h342/BT_06385.jpg","title":"cookstown hotel crush horror people were scratching biting and grabbing anything they could to pull themselves up to breath says witness","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The peers also said there was an acknowledgement that there are circumstances in which the backstop could \"undercut\" the Good Friday Agreement rather than protect it. Former Ulster Unionist leader Lord Trimble, now a Tory peer, won the Nobel Peace Prize for his role in securing the Agreement. MPs rejected the revised package by  votes last week, but the peers said the changes secured with the EU had improved its chances of getting through Parliament, in part because of \"widespread war weariness on all sides\". In a paper for the centre-right Policy Exchange think tank they said: \"Not a word of MrsMays withdrawal agreement of November , so heavily defeated twice in Parliament, has been changed. \"But we are now closer to acceptance of the same agreement. \"A widespread war weariness on all sides is a signicant factor. \"But the Government has succeeded in securing substantive changes that will affect and limit the impact of the Irish backstop,it is ever put in place at the end of the transitional period. \"The chances of the Prime Minister getting the deal through Parliament have improved.\"Earlier, Philip Hammond rejected claims the Government is offering extra cash to Northern Ireland to get the DUP to back Mays Brexit deal. The Chancellor said \"thats not where the discussion has been at all\", although he acknowledged funding issues would come up in the forthcoming spending review. Mr Hammond, who was involved in talks with DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds on Friday, said the discussions had focused on preventing a regulatory border in the Irish Sea. Persuading the  DUP MPs to back the deal is viewed as crucial by ministers as they believe allaying their concerns about the backstop will help swing Tory Eurosceptics behind the Prime Minister. One option being considered is a \"Stormont lock\" written into law so that any new regulations imposed on Northern Ireland would either be adopted by the entire UK or not at all, the Sunday Times reported. Mr Dodds is also reportedly looking for a cut in air passenger duty, which is lower in the Republic than Northern Ireland. The Government may also have to find another £bn to secure a further two years to the confidence and supply arrangement which underpins Mrs Mays minority administration in the Commons. On BBCs Andrew Marr Show, Mr Hammond said: \"I regard it as crucially important that we do not allow dferences to grow up between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.\"And were looking for ways in which the Government can reassure Northern Irish politicians about our clear intention to make sure that there are no such dferences as we go forward,the backstop ever had to come into force.\" He added: \"This isnt about money. Its about a political assurance - well, look, we are coming up to a spending review and we will have to look at all budgets, including devolved block-grant budgets, in that spending review, of course we will.\"In a statement on Saturday, the DUP said: \"We are in discussions with the Government to ensure Northern Ireland is not separated out from the rest of the United Kingdom as we leave the European Union. \"Contrary to some reports, we are not discussing cash. \"There are still issues to be addressed in our discussions.\""},{"url":null,"title":"gb v germany how does a football rivalry translate to the special olympics","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

As coach Liam Dwyer told the Press Association of the game: “Yeah, it has some signicant history doesn’t it ”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  “Everyone at home likes to beat the Germans because of the World Cup!” said midfielder and forward Tom Ward from St Albans.Meanwhile for Reece Johnson, a midfielder, the chance to get involved in the rivalry in a competition fixture was welcome.“Whenever England play Germany it’s always a big game,” he said. “So it felt good to have a good competitive game against them.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Meanwhile the quality of both teams means that comparisons between the international scene and the Special Olympic arena are valid – while this GB team are one of the favourites for gold, Germany represent one of their trickiest challenges.“I knew the game was going to be tough because Germany are quite a good team, quite tough, so it was a physical game,” said Derek Taylor.Indeed, a - result full of big tackles and a late flurry of chances confirmed how evenly matched these sides were in the seven-a-side arena.“I’m very happy with the draw,” said goalkeeper Sean McCulloch. “This was the hardest gameI would think at the moment.”Game  of the group @SOGreatBritain - SO Germany. Two very organised teams that cancelled each other out. If we don’t lose our next game we will be playing for gold! Aussies are up next!— Bobby ColtmanMarch , But while plenty of the rivalry seems to translate to this World Games fixture, the Special Olympics movement gives it its own flavour, combining a will to win with respect and the forging of new relationships.“We showed respect for them, handshakes at the end of the match,” said McCulloch, who swapped one of his World Games badges with an opponent at full time.“It doesn’t matter what rivalry it is. As long as everybody’s together.”Meanwhile, those sentiments were reflected in the crowd of friends, family and fans who were sat together watching from the stand.“In the crowd the German supporters and the British supporters were all having a laugh together, chanting together and all sorts,” said Ward’s father Steve. “There was no animosity. It was just a friendly atmosphere and it’s the same with the players. They all came off together – not as two teams, but together.”And while building new friendships doesn’t necessarily take priority over victories, make no mistake: there is more than one way to leave this tournament a winner.“I think we’ve got a very good chance of winning gold,” said Johnson. “But evenwe don’t, we’ve made new friends and that’s what matters.”"},{"url":null,"title":"social media users reveal best sleeptalk they have overheard","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

There are also proposals to reduce the the tree line in Donard Forest on the slopes of the Mournes.A so-called lsquogreen travel networkrsquo which would allow visitors to hire bicycles and electric bikes to make their way round ious attractions is also suggested.The ious proposals form the core of the so-called Mourne Mountains Gateway Study and have already been discussed with the National Trust, Forest Service and Environment Agency.Before anything happens, numerous planning and environmental approvals will be required, alongside the compilation of feasibility studies and business cases.The overarching vision of the gateway project is to provide game-changing, world-class, international tourist attractions which develop sustainable enhancement of access from Newcastle to the Mournes and its foothills and forests, while also broadening recreational provision..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Coney Island singer Jayne looking for support to produce new album  ","story":"FROM Coney Island, to Nashville and on to Vancouver, musician Jayne Trimble has travelled many miles to get to where she is today.The folk musician is heading to Los Angeles next month to record her third album mdash that isshe can raise at least , Canadian dollars mdash thatrsquos pound, mdash to cover initial production costs.The former Down High student is asking local people, and women in particular, to support her Kickstarter campaign to record the album Your Mother Was A Peacock.While Jaynersquos vocals are hauntingly soft, she describes her latest music as ldquovisceral and epic.She is recording the new album, which will be produced by Damien Jurado, under the name Oxlip mdash which is an Irish wildflower.ldquoItrsquos my most ambitious and exciting album to date, explained the  year-old. ldquoItrsquos a collection of songs based on the lives of women throughout history who have either been scapegoated, or were just plain tragic.

There is also concern about the surface of the existing car park which is particularly uneven and the absence of adequate parking for visitors with young families.The access from the car park to the beach for families pushing prams is described as ldquounsuitable with the financial spend approved at Mondayrsquos meeting designed to improve the overall visitor experience, create a better first impression, improve the car park surface and the number of available spaces.New directional signs are also proposed, with council officials warning failure to address the issues could result in the loss of blue flag status, result in a negative visitor experience, reduced visitor numbers and income.To progress the improvement work, council officials have agreed to appoint a contractor to design a scheme.The planned investment has been welcomed by Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran.He said he was pleased local authority officials have recognise the need to improve Tyrella to ensure it continues to attract a high number of visitors, particularly from April and September.ldquoTyrella is an extremely popular beach, he said. ldquoIt is highly regarded as one of Northern Irelandrsquos top beaches and it is vital it retains its blue flag status. We rely heavily upon tourism in our area and we need to ensure our beaches are up to standard.Cllr Curran says he has no doubt that investing in Tyrella is not only ldquogood news for the district and visitors to the area, but will produce an economic idend through increased use.He continued: ldquoWe are fortunate to have stunning beaches like Tyrella, Kilclief and Ballyhornan on our doorstep. Those who work to keep our bathing waters clean and, more importantly, up to an internationally recognised standard so they are safe to use, do a terric job.Cllr Curran said picturesque beaches helped make up the ldquounique fabric of Lecale and the surrounding area and were a vital tourism resource.He added: ldquoThe planned investment at Tyrella is a good news story and I am pleased that the local authority is not content to sit back on its laurels but recognises the importance of continuing investment in a wealth of tourism assets right across the entire district.ldquoDown District is lucky to be blessed with such priceless resources which can make a valuable contribution to the health and well-being of our local communities and visitors alike.

I donrsquot know when it will be on as the producers didnrsquot tell me and I really wasnrsquot allowed to say anything public about it until now.ldquoBut once the word got out that they will filming here in October, everybody suddenly lived in Ballyhornan in an effort to try to get down to get a look. The place was absolutely packed out with cars.Brendan is a relative newcomer to Ballyhornan but is evangelical about the beauty of the beach and its potential to attract more visitors.He took over the shop last May and calls it the CSI shop, so-called after the coffee, slushie snacks and ice-cream it serves.ldquoIrsquom obviously hoping that when people see the Wee Shop on the programme, they will come out to visit it, said Brendan.ldquoIn fact, I have already had some families call in for a coffee or ice-cream and then to get their pictures taken here as a momento.ldquoBut I think that the Derry Girls connection will really help put Ballyhornan on the map as the beach and walk are gorgeous and I hope that others can see that for themselves.He described how the programmersquos art department changed what was a neutral space into something that looked totally authentic.ldquoI had plans to do up that half of the shop anyway so it was just a matter of delaying that. They came in and created a stud wall and painted the walls brown on the bottom and cream on the top and then distressed it to make it look as it had years of smoke on it.ldquoWith the ious props and bits and pieces, it really looked the part, he added.Brendan revealed that it was pure fate that led to the producers to ask to film there.He also insisted that the programme retained the shoprsquos name.ldquoA couple of guys were just out and about scouting around and thought that my shop was just what they were after for that scene, he explained.ldquoWhen they came in to discuss the matter, it turned out that one of the worked for me when I was a bar manager years ago up north.ldquoThey reimbursed me for two days of business and I felt that was fine because Irsquom hoping that there may be a spin-off for me with new customers once the programme airs.bull Episode three of Derry Girls airs on Tuesday at .pm on Channel ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Designer meets with Duchess again during Empire Bar visit  ","story":"SAINTFIELD fashion designer Meabh Mageean has the ear mdash and the eye mdash of Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge.The  year-old was lucky to meet the Duchess for the second time when she visited Belfast with her husband recently.It was natural that their chat turned to weddings and clothes, given that one is regarded as the best-dressed Royal in the world and the other is an up and coming fashion designer.Meabh had been asked to meet the Duchess at an celebration of achievement of young people at the Empire bar.She had previously met with her last February at a fashion event in Buckhingham Palace.ldquoI was asked to meet and talk to the Duchess about that event and my own work, explained Meabh.ldquoShe was interested to know what I brought back from last yearrsquos event andit enhanced my business.

No one thought this was going to happen.Mrs Trainor believes the Downe is capable of accommodating both ENT day surgery and the proposed cataract service, given that it is relatively modern hospital, boasting a range of high tech, diagnostic equipment and theatres.She added: ldquoIt simply beggars belief that we are to lose a key day surgery for people with ear, nose and throat problems. The loss is compounded by the fact that local hospital campaigners were not informed this was happening or asked for their views.Last week, a South Eastern Trust spokeswoman confirmed there were no plans to reduce the number of ENT sessions delivered at the Downpatrick hospital.She added: ldquoThe Trust is planning to increase ENT clinics at the Downe and to relocate an ENT day surgery session from Downpatrick to the Lagan Valley Hospital to facilitate the cataract elective care centre prototype work..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Farmers opposed to geopark plans  ","story":"PLANS to secure world renowned tourism branding for an area stretching from Strangford Lough to South Armagh have been dealt a major blow this week.As Newry, Mourne and Down Council prepares to submit a bid to secure prestigious UNESCO geopark status for an area taking in the Mournes, Ring of Gullion and the Strangford and Lecale Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, the Ulster Farmersrsquo Union has labelled the proposal a ldquonon starter.Consultants have been working on the councilrsquos bid for geopark status ahead of a formal application being made this November.Supporters of the ambitious plan insist that securing geopark status is primarily about environmental sustainability and trying to increase economic revenue in a part of the world already revered for its stunning beauty.Geopark branding is one of the key planks of the local authorityrsquos tourism strategy with those involved in the process confident it has the potential to increase the number of international visitors to the area.However, the Ulster Farmersrsquo Union mdash whose representatives met recently with local authority officials and representatives from Geological Survey NI mdash says farmers are ldquounanimously opposed to the geopark.While it has been suggested that securing geopark branding could potentially be worth in the region of poundm for local tourism, the farmersrsquo union says it is ldquofar from impressed at the assertion that the designation will bring increased recreational opportunities and promote social inclusion.UFU deputy president Victor Chestnutt said farmers in the Newry, Mourne and Down area were were ldquofar from impressed with promises made by officials they met recently.The UFU official continued: ldquoI would like to remind these officials that farmers have been the custodians of the land for hundreds of years. Imposing a designation on this area will affect their livelihoods which will have a knock-on effect on all ratepayers in the area.ldquoCouncil officials believe and are promoting that this designation will not restrict the operations of any farmer. This is unrealistic and their approach is disappointing.ldquoWe are % opposed to these plans and I would urge the council to meet our members, listen to their concerns and reconsider their plans to progress with such an application.Mr Chestnutt is encouraging local authority officials to provide figures to UFU members to support claims that geopark branding will help grow farm businesses, confirming that until farmers see the figures in black and white, they will continue to dispute any such claims.The UFU vice-president said with local government elections fastapproaching, the organisation believes the time is right to review any proposed geopark application.He continued: ldquoThe UFU has made contact with each of the parties and all independent councillors who currently hold seats on Newry, Mourne and Down Council and it is disappointing that only a very small number have taken the time to listen and engage with us. We have many members residing and working in the area and some councillors have missed a genuine opportunity to engage with their constituents.The senior union official said the ldquostigma around the Mournes national park debate a number of years ago is still very much at the forefront of farmersrsquo minds, explaining that at the time, UFU members were united in their opposition to the proposals.Mr Chestnutt said the UFU believed that farmers who live and work in the area should decide whether or not an area is suitable for national park or global geopark status.He said the council had put nothing on the table to reassure members and encourage them to reverse their position.With tourism one of the key drivers behind the geopark branding, Mr Chestnutt said Tourism NI was ldquovisibly absent from any discussions.He said farmers believed tourism in the area could be developed without the need to introduce a special designation.ldquoThe funding and resources the council has earmarked for the development and operation of the proposed new geopark should be redirected to the general promotion of tourism and infrastructure development. We are in favour of economic development but securing geopark status is not the way to do it, he declared.Mr Chestnutt added: ldquoOur message is simple and direct ndash farmers in the area are strongly opposed to the geopark proposal and I would urge all councillors, council officials and the Geological Survey of NI to fully and meaningfully engage with us.ldquoThe best course of action would be to rethink the geopark proposal and focus tourism investment into wider promotion of our beautul countryside.A spokesman for Newry, Mourne and Down Council said the geopark had the potential to make a ldquosignicant contribution to local communities and tourism in the Mourne, Ring of Gullion and Strangford and Lecale areas.ldquoIt is important to understand that a geopark is not a legislative designation and will therefore not place any restrictions on economic activity within the proposed areas, including on any farming practices, he said.ldquoThe introduction of a geopark will not introduce additional planning restrictions and instead will simply provide an globally recognised accreditation.ldquoThe geopark will only include sites which already have public access and the geopark will not promote any access to private land, unless the landowner in question wants to work with the geopark.The spokesman added: ldquoThe process to achieve geopark designation is ongoing and it is not until  that an accreditation would be confirmed as part of this ongoing process.ldquoIn the meantime, the council will continue to deliver events and activities to increase awareness of what the project represents and how it can grow our tourism offering and support our local communities..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C March 13%2C 1979  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH mdash THE Earl of Clanwilliamrsquos th century mansion and -acre estate at Montalto, Ballynahinch, officially goes on sale today.

Almost immediately the perfect skull complete with teeth was removed to prevent damage and a process of dating the skeleton began.The farmer wishes to keep his identity and the location of the field unknown in an effort to prevent vandalism and damage to nearby fields which have been planted with early potatoes.This was the first time that the field had been ploughed in recent years and this, combined with the severe frosts and natural erosion, contributed to the moving of the skeleton closer to the surface.The site of the finding is referred to a history of Killyleagh written in  which states that human bones had been found in the area before and that there were others known to lie there.According to the history the tradition is that they are the bones of Protestants who during the rebellion of  were chased by the native Irish and were massacred.BALLYGOWAN mdash Five year-old Tara Rhodes, who has several relatives in Ballygowan, has flown to America with her father in a frantic bid for emergency treatment.Tara, who has a brain tumour which has already left her blind mdash is preparing to undergo treatment which will cost about pound,.The money has been collected through a special fund which was set up last November by Tararsquos mother, Sara, who was told by doctors that her daughter had only six months to live.Despite the claims of medical experts, Tararsquoa anguished parents launched a UK-wide appeal campaign, which included a special charity dance in Ballygowan.DRUMAGHLIS mdash Plans to shut down Drumaghlis Primary School, near Crossgar, have been ditched by the Department of Education.The small country school, which is  years old and caters for  children, has escaped the threat of closure and is expected to undergo a modernisation programme soon.Earlier this year the Department suggested that the school should be closed, but pressure from the schoolrsquos management committee has led to a reversal of plans.The Department thought that it may be better to close the school because it lacked many facilities and was not up to modern day standard.The Rev Dr W D Bailie, chairman of the management committee, protested bitterly and called on the support of the South Eastern Education and Library Board.Dr Bailie said: ldquoWe are delighted that the Department has responded to our plea to permit the school to continue to cater for the educational needs of this area.CROSSGAR mdash Preparations are well under way for the big Easter fair to be held in Crossgar War Memorial Hall on April .

These will be considered in accordance with the relevant legislation and guidance, part of which specically relates to the need for an Environmental Impact Assessment.ldquoShould a planning application follow, it will be considered in exactly the same way as any other of its type. In order to gain approval, among other factors, it will need to satisfy national and local policies, including those contained in the LDP, while members of the public will also have the opportunity to express their views before any decision is taken.Welsh Government and the architects have been contacted for comment. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

The event ran from Saturday March  to Tuesday March .The Vale brewery Tomos and Lilford produced a special beer called ldquoCarnival - Penarth Pale Ale.Meanwhile the two Penarth butchers, Thompson Family Butchers and David Lush Butchers, both created their own special Penarth carnival sausages.The organisers estimated that more than  people took part in costume in the walk through town on Saturday, which saw the coronation of the lsquoFirst Foolrsquo at am. The procession marched from Sully Terrace through town.At .am in Penarth Library, there was a presentation of the head of Bendigeidfran, from The Mabinogion. The head was made by children from Cogan and Penygarth schools.The lsquoFirst Foolrsquo was then sent by train to the Tower of London to bring news of the Carnival to the traditional resting place of the head of Bendigeidfran, where he met the Raven Master.Long distance cyclist Dave Hann was due to cycle to Harlech, north Wales to raise money for the RNLI Penarth, and bring news to Harlech that Carnival had broken out in Penarth.Unfortunately Mr Hann only got as far as Cardigan before Storm Freya made it too dangerous to continue. Organisers have one barrel of carnival ale left and will take it to Harlech by train in the next few weeks to share it and the storybook of the carnival.On Sunday, two rugby teams took part in a ldquotug-o-sausage to decide which butcherrsquos sausage was better. Congratulations were extended to the winners, Team Thompson.Congratulations were also extended to the traders Ener-chi and Lilypad by the organisers, for having the best-dressed shop windows. Particular praise was singled out for the carnival flowers at Holm House Hotel created by Lilypad.Further nights of partying, songs and dancing were spotted in the Albion, St Faganrsquos Castle, and other pubs, bars and venues across Penarth. There were also celebrations on the Penarth Pier on Tuesday night following a Pancake Day event, while wandering bands of musicians like Wonderbrass kept spirits high.The festival culminated in a grand Mardis Gras party on Tuesday, which saw crowds of costumed residents dance the night away.Richard Parry, one of the carnival organisers, said: ldquoToday is Ash Wednesday, the beginning of Lent. Carnival finished last night on Mardi Gras.ldquoThanks to everyone who took part, contributed, encouraged, sponsored, smiled and partied, especially those people who took a carnival Bank Holiday Monday.ldquoIt was fabulous to hear your Carnival Bank Holiday stories, and to all those people who have had little private carnival moments of joy over the festival, thatrsquos what it has all been about.ldquoAnd some people have already said, lsquosee you next year!rsquoldquoThere were lots of people laughing and smiling on the sidelines, telling me they wanted to take part next year ndash just with a little more notice next time. But now itrsquos established, wersquoll be back next year and ready for even more people to join in the fun! article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Wersquore creating work which is not really necessary.If we want to improve the gateway there are other ways of doing it.ldquoIt really doesnrsquot begin to tackle the active travel . I do feel this is about spending the money before next February.Councillors were told the widened roundabout was one part of a wider strategy for transport improvements in Penarth.Charlotte Pugh, senior planner for the council, said the new scheme would transform the area.She said: ldquoThis whole are is going to be completely transformed. At the moment it is not very welcoming to pedestrians.ldquoI think it will go some way to transforming this gateway into Penarth and make it a safer environment.Previous plans to make part of Plassey Street one-way to incoming traffic, and removing the roundabout altogether, were dropped following opposition from the public.The committee agreed to endorse the transport scheme but requested regular updates on the wider transport plans for Penarth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This fantastic choir is run by The Aloud Charity, which is based here in the constituency, and is doing incredible work all around Wales, involving young people in music and teamwork and giving them the confidence to not only succeed in music but in their lives more generally.It was a real honour to host them in Parliament, where they sang for the Speaker, for MPs, and during the St Davidrsquos Day Service in the Chapel, before heading to the Public Gallery of the Commons to watch the St Davidrsquos Day debate.This annual debate is an important one for Wales, allowing MPs to talk about all sorts of issues. I spoke about transport and train services ndash a long running campaign of mine as you will know.I then spoke in the crucial debate on climate change. Believe it or not, itrsquos been far too long since wersquove had a debate on this issue in Parliament, and I spoke about the importance of our investments and pensions going into renewable sources, not into fossil fuels.I also pointed out my support for the young people across the UK who went on a climate strike the week before.

The PM was forced into a corner, forced to concede that she might have to rule out No Deal and extend Article , and the Labour Party came out decisively for putting this issue back to the people.And this week we saw the Government attempt to win over MPs with a fund it claims will boost less well-off towns after Brexit ndash but in another shambolic aspect to this hapless attempt to bribe MPs into voting for Theresa Mayrsquos so-called deal, there is no cash for Welsh towns.Another example of the Tories letting Wales down, and yet further reason to support the push for a final say on Brexit for the public through a Peoplersquos Vote. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Last month I met with constituents over disruption to local rail services. I know that many of you will have experienced delays and cancellations to services in the weeks following the handover of the Wales Rail Franchise. I understand and share the frustration that these delays have caused. There has been a shortage of rolling stock as a result of a large maintenance backlog following the handover of the franchise together with planned changes to rail services. This has led to a signicant reduction in services and replacement bus services. I have been in contact with the Minister for Transport and Transport for Wales to raise the concerns of constituents. I have been assured that service levels are now back to normal and they do not anticipate any restrictions to services in the coming year. I will of course maintain my interest to see that those assurances are kept. I will update residents again on future plans to deliver improved station facilities, trains and more regular services.As many of you are aware Cardf Bus has recently announced changes to bus services across Cardf and the Vale. A number of bus routes are at risk as part of these changes. The removal of bus links for work, social links and public services, including hospital routes, would have a signicant impact on my constituents.Cardf Bus are not acting to deliberately hurt our communities. Far from being an uncaring organisation Cardf Bus are stuck with a legal framework that stops them from operating on the same basis as commercial competitors. Competitors can cherry pick and target single profitable routes that undermine the wider social propose that most of us want from local bus services. Cardf Councilrsquos Labour leadership has committed to supporting at risk bus services for  years. Unless the Conservative leadership of the Vale Council agrees to Labour councillors amendments to the budget and protects local bus services in the Vale then bus routes will go. The Vale Council leadership could and should act. If they donrsquot then my constituents will suffer.In future, the regulation of buses is the answer. London was the only part of the UK that was allowed to keep a regulated bus service. It is no mistake that it has the best and most coherent service. We now have the legislative powers to regulate bus services here in Wales. The Welsh Government is currently consulting on proposals to reform bus and taxi services in Wales. More information on the consultation can be found at: https:beta.gov.wales improving-public-transport. The consultation closes on th March ndash please do get in touch and take part. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The seniors school can be found on Hickman Road, the juniors and nursery a short distance on in Victoria Road.School facilities include a full gym, a library, an IT suite, a sports hall, science laboratories, and nearby access to local sports facilities including athletics track, Penarth RFCrsquos rugby pitch and the International Sports Village in Cardf Bay.Traditionally the school was strictly boys only. However, in the mid s the decision was taken to also accept girls and become a coeducational school.Westbourne was first established in Penarth in  as Westbourne House Preparatory School for Boys, and has kept the choice for children to board.A number of international students attend the school, and they often board with families from the area ndash usually Westbourne alumni themselves. More than  dferent nationalities take the opportunity to board in the area.Westbourne are rightly proud of this international aspect.ldquoEveryone here mixes in together, said Marie de Tito Mount, the schoolrsquos director of marketing. ldquoWe have children studying from Russia, China, the US, Poland, India, and theyrsquore all friends.ldquoTherersquos no cliques or groups, and wersquore proud of the international aspect this is giving our children.ldquoWe feel like wersquore making them citizens of the world.Ranked st in Wales by The Sunday Times Schools Guide and st in the UK by The DailyLeague Tables,  per cent of Westbourne graduates go to Russell Group universities or equivalently elite international institutions.The school points to two factors for this ndash the small number of pupils, and the highly trained staff.With a class size of just eight students per teacher on average, every student gets full and unided attention.The children clearly thrive from this, building confidence and passion for their work.In reception, there was a palpable excitement to show off their handmade vegetable dolls.A Year Five jumped at the chance to read out her ndash impressively well-written ndash poem.In the senior school, a young man attacked a maths problem on a board with gusto. He was animated and passionate, and had clearly forged a close bond with his teacher.The head of Westbourne Prep School, Joanne Chinnock, said: ldquoOur school is a happy place, and wersquove long held the philosophy happy children learn well.       ,params: .pushldquoOur lsquosecretrsquo is the very close bond between the children, from Nursery and Reception classes all the way to the top of the school and the staff, who know each child very well indeed.There are a huge number of after school clubs on offer. Children have the opportunity to learn a wide range of instruments, including the harp, trumpet, piano, violin, drums, guitar and organ.A large set of sports clubs stake full advantage of the the Welsh coast, with frequent use of Penarth Pier, the beach and natural beauty spot Cosmeston Lakes. Sports on offer include swimming, yoga, basketball, touch rugby, dodge ball, gymnastics, cross country, and football.There are even more opportunities to excel in other areas, with offerings including Young Journalists, Nature Club, Art Club, Chess and ldquoMad Science.Westbourne offers the InternationalDiploma Programme in sixth form and GCSEs and IGCSEs for its secondary pupils.Their IB average is - points, high enough to qualy for Oxford University, with two-thirds of all Higher Level grades being s and s, and two-thirds of students receiving a Bilingual Diploma.The GCSE results are equally impressive with  per cent of all grades being s and s per cent the new, harder, grade  and a further  per cent grade s. This is up to five times the UK average.The academic rigour extends to the staff too. More than  per cent of teachers at Westbourne have a PhD or masters and more than  per cent have taught internationally.Westbourne School has cultivated a warm and highly supportive culture one in which students and teachers truly support each other.For more information, visit:https:www.westbourneschool Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Then to handler Gerry Cosgrave to get the horse ready for his first point to point race.Thrills abounded when his black and red colours were chosen and on April , , Battleoverdoyen won his first race at Loughanmore with jockey Mark O’Hare.Michael recalls his phone never stopped on the way home and the next day the cream of racing were looking to buy the winner.He decided to go to the prestigious Tattersalls sales in Cheltenham the following week and the horse, was set at a reserve for £,.After a buzzing sales ring it sold to the powerhouse Gigginstown stud, owned by the O’Leary’s of Ryanair fame, for a whopping £,.Michael recalls it wasn’t about the money. He has been a punter all his le and dreamed of owning a superstar.For him it was about seeing a stud which could develop his horse into a future star.Describing Battleoverdoyen’s style, Michael believes it is all in his stride. He recalled the thoroughbred, who is  hands tall, at a point to point. “He was third last and they thought that was it. But that is his style of running.

Over the years Goal Line has worked with young people who have had a wide range of disabilities including Autism, Asperger’s Syndrome, ADHD , Down’s Syndrome, developmental delays, speech and other problems.In order to benefit from the PHA CLEAR Grant, Goal Line opted for a number of self-initiatives based around art and creative therapies, and several physical activity programmes that tested the young people in the sports hall in a iety of activities and team challenges.The young people benefitted from, and thoroughly enjoyed, a wide range of activities which saw personal development and well-being very much to the fore.Youth Support Worker Maxine Chambers said: “For the young people, being able to work in a group and develop their confidence and then to be able to voice their opinions and their own interpretation of things has been fantastic through Jason’s workshops. Through Trevor’s ceramic flower work it was a chance for them to deal with sensory issues, overcome issues with messy clay and that sort of thing.“Some of them were afraid to get their hands dirty or put them into the clay but when they saw people doing it they knew that it was ok. And when it came to painting the flowers it was brilliant, they loved all that – the outcome was superb and they were delighted to see what actually came at the end of the project with the flowers forever, flowers for their parents and the parents were amazed that the children had made those.“The fitness sessions were great in getting them into the sports hall and getting them involved in activities that they may not have tried before or at all – the New Age curling and boccia were good examples and it was good to see them having great fun indoors in something they can all do.”The grant also enabled Goal Line to facilitate a talk about strategies for dealing with dficult behaviours in young people. The talk was given by Dr Kate Kirk, a psychodrama psychotherapist from the Isle of Man. It was well attended by family, principals of primary schools, teachers, Special Educational Needs Co-ordinators, social workers, doctors and youth workers.

How did you get started in the industry  When we first opened Asia Supermarket in , it was the family’s ambition to bring a taste of home to Belfast. We brought the Chinese culture to the local community through cuisine and provided authentic and tasty ingredients for the hospitality trade here. We branched out due to demand to also provide Indian, Korean, Philippine, Thai and Middle Eastern food and are always looking for opportunities to extend our range. Typically, who are your clients or customers  Our customers would be both wholesale and retail to include restaurants all over Northern Ireland, as well as consumers who want to create some unique dishes in their home kitchens. Do you enjoy what you do, and what in particular  Yes, and in particular having just completed the new build we have enjoyed being involved in the day-to-day aspects, given the bespoke nature of the project, coupled with the hustle and bustle of the day to day challenges of satisfying our customer needs. What is the most dficult part of your job  One of the most dficult parts of the job is sourcing good quality produce at competitive prices and enhancing the range of products available. However, we’re very proud of our new supermarket and warehouse which provides even more quality and choice for our customers. What are the challenges facing your sector, and the economy in general  One of the biggest challenges facing our sector is the cost of goods from our suppliers, particularly those procured in foreign currencies which in turn has a knock-on effect on what we charge our wholesale and retail customers. To maintain our share of the market we constantly endeavour to get the best prices from our suppliers so that we can pass on competitive prices to our customers to maintain and grow our market share. With Brexit looming it will bring a major impact on imports costs and supplier prices which will present a major challenge for our business.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/cleaver_1.jpg","title":"is the future bright for the ni energy market","story":"Posted on Tuesday  February  by Ulster Business It is clear that there are a number of signicant challenges facing the energy sector in Northern Ireland but where there are challenges, there are also opportunities, according to law firm Cleaver Fulton Rankin.The ExecutiveNorthern Ireland has just completed its second year without a ing local government and in the words of David Sterling, head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service, the Civil Service is “… doing everything we can in the prevailing circumstances…but civil servants cannot take the place of ministers when it comes to strategic policy development or in taking transformative decisions”.  This is very much the case with regard to energy policy. The Department of the Economy’s Strategic Energy Framework, which was endorsed by the Executive in , has over the last nine years, led to some very positive changes to the energy generation and supply mix, particularly from renewable sources.However the  year framework is nearing its end and needs to be replaced. The Department is making such preparations as it can on a draft Strategic Energy Framework across the areas of heat, electricity, transport and energy efficiency which it aims to make public some time in the spring. Whether or not this region has its Assembly back to adopt such a framework will remain to be seen, but in the meantime it will ensure the subject remains live and high on the agenda.Brexit and I-SEMThe new wholesale electricity market known as the Integrated Single Electricity Marketwent live on October , . It is designed to deliver increased levels of competition which, it is hoped, will help put downward pressure on prices as well as encouraging greater levels of security of supply and transparency. While the island of Ireland is now integrated more closely with European markets, there is a risk that Brexit could halt this integration. British and Irish business groups and energy trade associations such as the CBI, IBEC, Electricity Association of Ireland, RenewableUK, British Irish Chamber of Commerce and EnergyUK all refer to the delivery of I-SEM, or to the UK’s continued access to the IEM, as post-Brexit priorities for security of supply and or consumer protection. I-SEM is clearly a priority that must be preserved.While Brexit may present challenges and continuing uncertainty, there are certainly opportunities for investment and acquisition in the electricity market as more complex, specialist expertise will be required to effectively trade power on the I-SEM. Policy barriers or inaction cannot be allowed to prevent I-SEM from realising its potential of fully integrating the market by efficiently moving energy from producer to demand.Renewable incentive schemesDespite being on track to hit its target of % of electricity generation from renewables, Northern Ireland risks being left behind. The lack of a replacement for the development support mechanism, Renewables Obligations Certicateafter its closure in April , means Northern Ireland is lagging behind Great Britain which has established the Contract for Dference regime and Ireland, which has started work on its Renewable Electricity Support Scheme . While neither scheme is perfect, doing nothing is not an option. The devolution of energy presented Northern Ireland with the opportunity to shape its own policy but without a government, will the sector and the infrastructure be able to remain fit for purpose GasWith its development over the last  years, the gas network in Northern Ireland, with its low population density, must be seen as a success story. Consumers and businesses have been offered greater choice in terms of price and security of supply. Nevertheless there are certainly further opportunities for gas distributors and suppliers to expand the natural gas network, particularly in the west of the country and east Co Down. So despite the apparent obstacles and challenges, there is opportunity for development and progress in Northern Ireland’s energy sector. The benefits for Northern Ireland will be in terms of security of supply, price and environmental sustainability. Cleaver Fulton Rankin,  Bedford Street, Belfast BT FW.

The proposal for the work to Broadcasting House on Ormeau Avenue in Belfast was approved last March by the BBC board, with the announcement made to staff by the BBCs director general Lord Tony Hall. Now, the plans – which include the redevelopment of the exisiting BBC Broadcasting House building, including the refurbishment and extension of the buildings – will be put to the public, as part of a necessary pre-application event before planning can be submitted. It includes a new extension to the rear, including a landscaped plaza opening onto Linenhall Street. A spokesman for BBC Northern Ireland told Ulster Business: \"As part of the pre-planning application process, public consultation events will take place this month before we can move on to the next phase. The investment to BBC Broadcasting House in Belfast, announced in March last year, will transform the iconic building, its technology and facilities, highlighting the BBC’s commitment to audiences in Northern Ireland. We will share more detail in due course.\" Money invested will go towards structural work on the -year-old building to ensure its long-term sustainability, addressing what the state broadcaster has said are \"critical deficiencies\". Before the announcement last year that the BBC was to stay put and develop its existing building, it was understood the broadcaster had been eyeing up other city centre locations, or could create a new media hub in the Titanic Quarter. The event will take place at the Clayton Hotel on March , between pm and pm, and March  between pm and .pm.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20190201_0983.jpg","title":"pwc investing in people purpose and belfast","story":"Posted on Wednesday March  by Ulster Business Almost  years after it moved  staff and , paper files into Waterfront Plaza, PwC will move again – this time taking around , people and some very smart technology to Merchant Square in the heart of Belfast Just  months after being appointed to PwC’s national management board as head of UK regions, Paul Terrington, PwC’s NI regional chair, has no plans to reduce his commitment to keep growing the business locally.“This is an incredibly exciting time to be part of PwC. Since I took on the Northern Ireland role six years ago, we’ve doubled the workforce, become the fastest-growing UK region and are now the biggest office outside London with just over , people,” he says. “Our strategy was to be the leading provider of professional services in the Northern Ireland market but there’s no way we’d be the size we are now had we only focused on that.”Instead Paul built on the legacy of his predecessors and accelerated growth in new, technology solutions, while retaining the traditional accounting, tax and consulting services. Today PwC remains the leading provider of advisory services to the region’s family-owned and owner-managed businesses and multinationals, but has also built an impressive portfolio of cutting-edge technologies, opened the door to signicant export markets and is tackling some of society’s most challenging issues. “We’ve grown in many new areas – blockchain, cyber, cloud-based accounting services – but the single biggest impact has come from developing our distinctive ‘Operate’ ision,” Paul says. ”Operate is our service delivery business, which supports and delivers technology and people solutions to large, often regulated organisations. So instead of just advising clients how to solve their problems, we now do the heavy lting for them.”Run by Ian McConnell, a partner who’s been with the firm for  years, Operate is already attracting global attention. “Clients increasingly don’t want a consulting firm just to tell them what to do: they want a problem-solving partnership.” he says. “In its first year of operation, Operate earned over £m, now has , people and is still growing.”Reinforcing Paul’s confidence to invest in Northern Ireland as a strategic location is a  forecast from TheCityUK that it could become the second fastest-growing financial services region outside London by , helping deliver £bn of additional gross value-addedto the UK economy. But that depends on the ability to recruit the right talent, and he says the challenge now is finding and retaining the skills.That’s an issue that particularly concerns Paul as he looks ahead at the economic picture with Brexit and lack of an Assembly to the fore.“The business community wants clarity and certainty. Ideally we want to see a Brexit withdrawal agreement that then gives the scope for a trade deal that offers Northern Ireland the capacity to trade both with the EU and as part of the UK. The potential competitive advantages and ability to attract investment would be terric and the kind of economic accelerator which we have sought for years, but never managed to gain.“However I do worry about the impact of political stalemate on our long term future. Failure to invest, particularly in education and skills, will impair our competitiveness and make this a less attractive place for business.The decreasing effectiveness of health, environment and infrastructure will mean that talented people will opt to make choices to live their lives where.“In my national role, I see other parts of the country fusing partnerships in innovative and exciting ways between business,education and government. Compared to that, we are already getting left behind. We should be moving forward.”Which brings us to Merchant Square, the £m, , sq ft office development which PwC takes over in . “We have great people and one reason why we’re moving to the city centre is because that’s where they want to be. By the time we’re ready to relocate towards the end of , we will have at least , people moving in to the heart of Belfast.“That makes it important for Belfast too and not just because it’s the city’s biggest-ever private sector office deal. As we were making our decision, the whole Bank Buildings issue was at its height, and we wanted to show our support for the city and its future.” The Merchant Square relocation project is led by Kieragh Nelson, a director who joined the firm in . “We’ve got serious ambitions for Merchant Square,” she says. ”There’s a sense of ‘OK, we’ve just opened flagship offices in London, and Manchester – what more can we do in Belfast how can we make it even better ’ And the vast majority of decisions on how it will look, feel and work are made by the team here. Our goal is to create the most technologically-advanced, innovative and collaborative space for ourselves, our clients, and also for the communities around us.”Doing the right thing is a maxim often repeated in PwC, but it gets backed up. On the morning of our interview, a large group of people from the firm, including Paul, took part in one of their regular ‘Darkness Into Light’ walks to raise awareness of mental health. The firm’s commitment to social mobility has seen a number of employment programmes launched, notably the UK’s first technology degree apprenticeships, with Queen’s University one of five universities selected to run the programme. And it’s expanding its Hive Academy programme, which delivers free technology education to primary and secondary schools, to the Channel Islands.This year the firm challenged itself and created a unique charity partnership – the PwC Challenge – to create innovative suicide prevention programmes.“Our purpose is to build trust in society and solve important problems, and it really does feature in how we look at what we do. We strive to celebrate and share our knowledge widely and unselfishly with our people and communities and not be afraid to take a stand and do the right thing. And we put it at the heart of what we do every day. “Take the PwC Challenge: more people in Northern Ireland have died by suicide since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement than from the violence in the years before. This is a crisis, and it’s one which affects our people, and our communities. So we asked local charities in north and west Belfast, the worst affected areas in the UK, to collaborate and devise really innovative approaches programmes to give opportunities to young people and their families through education, technology, sports, and mental health coaching.“As well as the clubs in PwC which fundraise every year for the challenge, our own people are volunteering every week in ious projects – particularly with our Hive Academy. We want to ensure that people, who are high achievers in many dferent fields, are supported to play their fullest part in society.” For Paul, it’s all about the people. Last year PwC invested around £m on staff development here, and this year, a number of people have begun the first Masters in Operation service delivery, run by Ulster University. “It’s important to support people to develop their careers in ways they mightn’t have considered when they joined. That’s a key building block of our purpose – it drives social mobility, equality and ersity.“It’s true thatsomeone decides they want to head off and join PwC Australia or New York, they can. That’s the beauty of working for a global firm – those opportunities are there. But what I really want to make sure is that you don’t have to leave:you want to live and work in Belfast, and have global clients, work with cutting-edge technology and be part of a firm that’s engaged in society, you can do that too.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/eopen_1.jpg","title":"the open its the biggest thing since sliced bread","story":"Posted on Wednesday March  by Ulster Business With just  weeks until Northern Ireland hosts the biggest sporting event in its history, John Mulgrew speaks to the bosses tasked with organising the legendary Open Championship We’ve come a long way in just a short few years. Despite its huge golfing credentials, especially in the modern game, it had been more than  years since Northern Ireland played host to the Irish Open.That all changed in , when it ed north to Royal Portrush. And that, buoyed on a refreshed and renewed interest in both the tournament, and the sport itself.Now, in  weeks, that same links course will see more than , people flock to arguably the world’s greatest golf tournament and the largest sporting event ever hosted on these shores – The Open – transforming a small Co Antrim town for a handful of summer days.“There is a buzz with everyone at the RA,” Johnnie Cole-Hamilton tells Ulster Business. He’s executive director of championships at the RA – the ruling authority of golf throughout the world, aside from areas such as the US, and organisation responsible for organising The Open.“This will be my th Open Championship, and one reason I continue to be involved is that it’s a challenge every time.”It will see Irish golfing greats, including Open winners Rory McIlroy and Darren Clarke, Graeme McDowelland Padraig Harrington – among others – join the biggest name in sport, Tiger Woods.“One of big drivers to ing to Royal Portrush was the success of the Northern Irish and Irish golfers. They have raised the profile of golf immeasurably. “We are absolutely delighted with the response so far – % of tickets sold in  hours, and sold out within a record-breaking eight weeks.”Johnnie says the decision to choose Portrush, bringing it back to the course after a  year hiatus, was the correct one – buoyed by the support from the community, agencies and organisations. The th Open will be held at Royal Portrush from July -.“In my career, we had a similar scenario, ing to Liverpool for the first time in  years, and we had a very similar response. It ed in , and now Royal Liverpool is firmly on the rota, and I hope that Royal Portrush is similar.”Of course, aside from the golf, both the short-term and long-term economic benefits will trickle down and benefit, not on the surrounding areas, but prop Northern Ireland up on yet another global .According to Tourism NI chief executive John McGrillen that longer-term benefit could be worth up to £m for the wider economy.“There will be , tickets sold for championship days, and % of those sold to people out of state, outside Northern Ireland,” he tells Ulster Business.“It allows us to present an extremely positive image for Northern Ireland, and into key markets across the globe. We will never have experienced the opportunity to provide such a positive image of Northern Ireland. Despite what we might think, there are perception issues.“Northern Ireland has a normalised society and some of the most dramatic golf courses, scenery and landscape to see.“More specically, the fact that the Open will have been here, as one of the world’s top golf courses, will drive up the amount of spend, especially from golf tourism.”That alone makes up around % of Northern Ireland’s tourism intake. John says he wants that to grow to £m by . He says golfing visitors spend around four times that of an average tourist.Johnnie says all signs so far suggest that the Open in Portrush is “going to be an enormous” success. But the process hasn’t come without its challenges – namely theIrish Sea.“This is the first Open Championship we have hosted in my time, in which we have a body of water between our base and our contractor base. There’s getting things across water, and an enormous amount of work on the golf course – new holes, a new road system around the course and a tunnel for the players from one of the new greens to tee. You can’t do that without support from the golf club“The members have been hugely supportive, turning the course upside down, but maintaining integrity and enhancing .”He said, along with the blue light services, local authorities, council and tourism groups, the community in and around Portrush “understands that this will bring great benefits” to the area and Northern Ireland as a whole. “You can overcome dficulties with support,” he says.“Royal Portrush has never had more than , people drive to it, or get the train to it, at the same time. It’s a challenge to make sure we deliver a wonderful Open Championship and a spectator experience.”John McGrillen says the triumph in landing the Open itself was down to the success of the Irish Open in the last few years. “You had more than , people turning out at Portrush… visitor numbers had been dwindling.“That allows us to demonstrate that the course can deal with that many people. Everyoneworked very well, collectively, and that gave confidence to the RA that we would have the capacity to deliver it. The risk factors they had were eliminated because of the success of the Irish Open, and that was very critical.”As for boosting many of the hundreds of businesses in and around the area, John said: “It will do, as it’s showing off Northern Ireland… we have seen a big boost in the number of Americans playing golf. We don’t have to wait until after the event. “The visibility the Irish Open has given us. We have Royal County Down, Royal Portrush and Portstewart – that’s increased signicantly. It’s not just those courses which are benefiting – it’s being spread. People will typically stay in Belfast and travel around.”For John, the best outcome is, of course, an Irish winner. Oh, and clear skies. “A local winner would be phenomenal. It would be fantastic to see Rory win, or Tiger Woods.“If Tiger Woods won the Open in Portrush, that would remain in peoples’ memories forever. While we would love Rory or other locals to win, I would not be disappointed in Tiger winning it.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/pwc_1221.jpg","title":"pwc ni to crack  staff by ","story":"Posted on Thursday March  by Ulster Business PwC is set crack the , staff mark by the end of next year as it moves into its new £m offices in the heart of Belfast city centre, Ulster Business can reveal.Just  months after being appointed to PwC’s national management board as head of UK regions, Paul Terrington, PwC’s NI regional chair, has no plans to reduce his commitment to keep growing the business here.“This is an incredibly exciting time to be part of PwC. Since I took on the Northern Ireland role six years ago, we’ve doubled the workforce, become the fastest-growing UK region and are now the biggest office outside London with just over , people,” he says. “Our strategy was to be the leading provider of professional services in the Northern Ireland market but there’s no way we’d be the size we are now had we only focused on that.”Speaking about the move to its new headquarters in Merchant Square – a £m, , sq ft office – Mr Terrington said:“We have great people and one reason why we’re moving to the city centre is because that’s where they want to be. By the time we’re ready to relocate towards the end of , we will have at least , people moving in to the heart of Belfast.”On the current political uncertainty, he says: “The business community wants clarity and certainty. Ideally we want to see a Brexit withdrawal agreement that then gives the scope for a trade deal that offers Northern Ireland the capacity to trade both with the EU and as part of the UK. The potential competitive advantages and ability to attract investment would be terric and the kind of economic accelerator which we have sought for years, but never managed to gain.”Meanwhile, lettings in Belfast are expected to remain buoyant this year despite the uncertain political climate, according to a report from Lambert Smith Hampton.

As Theresa May is due to bring her withdrawal deal back to Parliament next week, with less than a month to go before the March  deadline, a letter from the CBI, signed by  firms, calls on MPs to unite behind a way forward that avoids a hard border and protects peace and economic progress in Northern Ireland.  It says that “local businesses believe that the failure to approve a deal with Europe on the UK’s withdrawal from the EU will have signicant repercussions for the local economy\". “Such a scenario will both hinder indigenous and foreign direct investment, it would result in signicant job losses and will stle opportunities for the next generation across Northern Ireland.  “We therefore urge MPs across the UK to consider the damaging impact on Northern Ireland’s economy and political stability in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  “The peace and economic progress that flowed from the Belfast  Good Friday Agreement cannot be overlooked at this critical time in the UK’s history. All Members of Parliament must consider the burden of responsibility that they now carry for this region’s future.” Those putting their names to the open letter include aerospace giant Bombardier, which employs around , staff here, Danske Bank and First Trust, along with agribusinesses such as Devenish Nutrition, Fane Valley and Linden Foods.
