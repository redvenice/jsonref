But late author James Pope-Hennessy, who interviewed members of the Royal Family, former courtiers and ladies-in-waiting, omitted some of the juiciest — and funniest — material, knowing it would never get past the royal censors.Here, in this extract from his newly-published private jottings, is an extraordinarily detailed account of the few days he spent in 1957 with the Duke and Duchess of Windsor at the converted mill house they had just bought near Paris. It was 21 years since the Duke — Queen Mary’s eldest son — had, as Edward VIII, abdicated the throne in order to marry Wallis Simpson, a orced American socialite.At 12.30, I was at the Gare du Nord (in Paris), where the long blue station wagon (Cadillac) of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor was waiting, with a plump pigeon-shaped English chauffeur, dressed in discreet black with a black rosette in his cap.We drove out through jammed streets to Le Moulin de la Tuilerie, which the Duchess has converted into her Petit Trianon. The car hooted at the wooden door in the gatehouse, and this was opened. We drove to the front door where the liveried butler (French) and an English footman were waiting.I was directed to walk across the sunny courtyard to the French windows of the Duke’s study, a colossal room made from a barn, with great log fires smouldering either end, French windows in the middle, maps of his world tours on the walls, souvenirs and uniform buckles everywhere.

Welsh property developer, 35, lives...Share this article‘This room,’ the Duchess told me, ‘represents the Dook’s life.’The floor is covered with a curious tufted carpet in three shades of green, very fresh and pretty: ‘What a pretty carpet, Duchess I’ve never seen one like it before.’‘Ah call it mah lawn.’The Duke of Windsor is, on first sight, much less small than I had been led to believe he is not at all a manikin, but a well-proportioned human being. Just then his hair was blown out in tufts on either side of his head, and he was looking crumple-faced and wild.          The Duke and Duchess of Windsor standing on stone stepsHe has his father’s eyes, and some, I fancy, of his mannerisms. He was drinking milk for what the Duchess calls ‘that lil’ old ulcer’. I should say she is on the whole a stupid woman, with a small petty brain, immense goodwill and a stern power of concentration.Like her house, she is tremendously American, and specifically Southern — it was like being back in Montgomery, Alabama, without the tree moss.I should therefore be tempted to classify her simply as An American Woman par excellence, were it not for the suspicion that the Duchess is not a woman at all. She is one of the very oddest women I have ever seen.She is flat and angular, and could have been designed for a medieval playing card. The shoulders are small and high the head very, very large, almost monumental the expression is either anticipatory (signalling, ‘I know this is going to be loads of fun, don’t yew?’) or appreciative — the great gig-lamp smile, the wide, wide open eyes, which are so very large and pale and veined, the painted lips and the cannibal teeth.There is one further facial contortion, reserved for speaking of the Queen Mother, which is very unpleasant to behold, and seemed to me akin to frenzy.Her high smooth flat forehead is cloven by a deep vertical line of concentration. Her neck makes her age (61) apparent — a tendency to wattles. Her jawbone is alarming, and from the back you can plainly see it jutting beyond the neck on each side.          James Pope-Hennessy (pictured above) had interviewed many members of the royal household          The couple had visited the Bahamas in 1942 - the Duke of Windsor had served as the Governor there She is wildly good-natured and friendly but with both of them one somehow feels that so much enthusiasm might suddenly gel up and one would be in the limbo reserved for the many, many people who have treated them badly or turned out a disappointment. I like having my jokes laughed at but there’s no need to make the mill-beams rock with appreciation of them.The house itself is full of very pretty colours and ideas and objects. Every conceivable creature comfort is conscripted, to produce a perfection of sybaritic living. They are like people after a cataclysm or a revolution, valiantly making the best of infinite luxury.It is, of course, intensely American, but I would think consciously aimed. The Queen Mother at Clarence House is leading a lodging-house existence compared to this.  James Pope-Hennessy said the couple (pictured above) were not what he had expected them to beMy room in the stables was very pretty and convenient, and prepared or planned by a perfectionist there was nothing on earth that you might conceivably want that wasn’t there — every kind of writing paper, nail file, brush, fruit, ice-water the bathroom loaded with scent bottles like a counter at a bazaar.After pottering in my bedroom, I wandered up the hill past the millstream, attracted by a stream of German oaths. Round the corner of the house I found the Duke, wearing a cerise felt baseball cap. He was jumping about rather wildly, and shouting ‘Jawohl, Jawohl’ and other military German expressions to a troop of French gardeners who were lugging the stone base of a sundial on to its mount.The Duchess, flat against the inside of the drawing room window, was looking on in a disinterested angular way, one hand on the window pane.‘Are the gardeners German?’ I inquired. ‘Well, no — one is Alsatian and one is Spanish, and that lil’ boy is only 14.‘But as the Dook’s German is sort of better than his French, he likes to talk German with them.‘Now I hope you’ll get in your talk with the Dook this afternoon,’ she continued. ‘You must catch him but you’ll find the Dook is kind of a slow starter’ — said with a great wide smile.          The Duke and Duchess of Windsor, sitting in the drawing room of their Paris home, with their four Pug dogs at their feeAbout 3.30pm the Duke came in, sitting on the sofa opposite my chair to talk. The pugs gambolled about — Disraeli, Trooper and Davy Crockett.‘We did have a fourth, called Peter Townsend (the orced Battle of Britain pilot whom Princess Margaret had wanted to marry),’ the Duchess explained with her least nice grin. ‘But we gave the Group Captain away.’ The whole atmosphere was intensely unstrained and unshy, owing, I should say, to the Duchess and the job she has done on the Duke. He talked with complete freedom, even of the delicate subject to which he obliquely refers as ‘1936’.‘My mother (Queen Mary) loathed the country,’ he said. ‘She used to say to me: “I was born in Kensington and I am a Londoner.” She hated Sandringham Balmoral was a bit better but we were always there too long. Sandringham was dreadful.’He added: ‘Off the record, my father (George V) had a most horrible temper. He was foully rude to my mother.‘Why, I’ve often seen her leave the table because he was so rude to her, and we children would all follow her out not when the staff were present, of course, but when we were alone.’I remarked that I was puzzled by the shutting down of his mother’s high spirits after marriage.          King George V with the his Consort, Queen Mary pictured on a visit to Liverpool‘Well, you’re right there, I think. My father was a very repressive influence. I well remember when he used to go banging away for a week or two at some shoot in the Midlands we used to have the most lovely time with her alone — always laughing and joking.‘She was a different human being away from him.’He said suddenly: ‘You realise there are only three completely royal persons alive now? My sister, my brother and myself.’          The Dowager Queen Mary with her son Edward, who abdicated as King in order to marry Wallis Simpson, an American orceeTea was a serious, perfectionist meal, with the Duchess struggling manfully with the teapot (she evidently hates tea, and looks very out of place pouring it out but the Duke drinks, she assured me, cup after cup all day ‘He leaves haff the cup, too, so it gets cold,’ she added.When we got to the drawing room again, the Duchess settled herself on a low wide day-bed, her legs tucked up she does not curl up but somehow dismantles herself, so that she looks like a puppet lying in the wings of a toy theatre.Duchess: ‘We-e-ell, and has the Dook been much help?’          This photo taken in 1937 shows King George VI and Queen Elizabeth with Queen Mary and at the front their children Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret on the balcony at Buckingham Palace, after the Coronation ceremony at Westminster Abbey‘Oh, a tremendous help, Duchess I can’t tell you.’Duchess: ‘He was pretty close to his mother, you know. I suppose you’ve had to see everybody about yah book?’ ‘Oh yes,’ I said. ‘The Duke’s sister has been very helpful, and the Queen Mother.’Duchess (in a slightly steely tone): ‘I don’t think the Queen Mother would know about Queen Mary.’ She went on: ‘Just everything happens to me. When I was over in England last, I wanted a new maid so I intervood one who told me she had been five years with the Queen Mother!‘Well, I brought her over here but I had to get rid of her.‘I had a Balenciaga dress with a crinoline. Well, Irene ironed that crinoline so that you couldn’t see what it was by the time she’d finished. I took it back, but even Mr Balenciaga himself couldn’t decide just what she had done to that crinoline.‘And she just burned up five more of my dresses. Well, that surprised me, because I thought that, after all those years with the Queen Mother, if she hadn’t learnt to iron a crinoline, what had she learned?’  Official portrait of Queen Mary (left) in 1935 and another from 1912 (right)‘And, you know, whenever I see pictures of those poor girls (Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret) with their suits all screwed up under the arms, I think of Irene. I’d like to take those girls’ clothes apart and loosen them up.’Before dinner, having had my bath and changed, I was standing by the fireplace in the hall, when the front door flew open and the Duke scampered in, making a yelping noise on seeing me he was wearing red trousers, a fur coat, and a peaked flying cap with fur ear-flaps. He was followed by the valet carrying some clothes.He dashed upstairs. When he came down again, very spick and  in a Balmoral tartan kilt, he smiled with great charm: ‘I say, you saw a pretty quaint apparition just now? Whatever did you think, I wonder? Why they put me into red pants I can’t imagine.’Presently, a tapping of high heels and the creak of stiff silk announced the Duchess, who wound her way down the staircase sheathed in a red-orange very tight, almost hobbled, dress. After dinner, the Duke lugged me off for a preliminary look at his papers, which were in a spare bedroom.A tall white tin filing cabinet, with five or six drawers, stood on a groundsheet at the foot of a green chintz bed. He unlocked it and we sat down side by side on the bed.‘There’s a lot of valuable stuff here, you know,’ he said. ‘Unlike the Duchess, I am very well documented. But I keep them all under years, not under people. Let’s take a look now at 1936.’          The Duke and Duchess of Windsor look lovingly at one another He seized one of the two 1936 files and showed me various letters — until we reached one from Queen Mary, begging him not to broadcast (his abdication speech).‘Surely you might spare yourself this strain and emotion,’ he read out. A look of real disgust crossed over his face.‘She even tried that! Well, I ask you...if I hadn’t done that...’We began to talk about the abdication. ‘People can say what they like for it or against it, I don’t care but one thing is certain: I acted in good faith. And I was treated bloody shabbily.’  Wallis Simpson (left) poses wearing her wedding ring. Queen Mary (right) in an official portrait One random example of this treatment, with which I strongly sympathised, was the fact (attested by receipted bills) that he had produced £4,000 of the £8,000 for the St George’s Chapel monument for his father, Queen Mary paying the other half, and he had not even been invited to the dedication of it nor had it ever been published anywhere that he had contributed.I said: ‘I think one of Queen Mary’s chief difficulties in understanding your dilemma was the fact that she had never been in love herself.’‘No, I don’t think she had,’ he said. ‘You’re right. My mother was a cold woman, a cold woman. And I, you see, I suppose I had never really been in love before. No, I hadn’t. I thought I had, but I hadn’t ever been in love.’  The Duchess of Windsor  (left) pictured at the villa she shares with her husband the Duke of Windsor in 1951. They are pictured together (right) in 1939 after returning from France Before we went back to the drawing room, he said with tired charm: ‘Well, I did my best, you know. I tried to bring the monarchy into touch.’But didn’t George V and Queen Mary start that, with their industrial tours in 1913 and so on?‘In a way they did, but not really. And think of my grandfather (Edward VII).’ His face lit up mischievously and boyishly: ‘Why, look at my grandfather. He’d just sit in an open landau, receive an address, snip a ribbon and declare something open, returning to dine with his girlfriends.

Among its many themes, the play explores racism, an interracial relationship and a move to a new country.

Royal insiders believe Meghan’s career as an actress makes her a ‘natural fit’ for patron of the National TheatreThe Duchess, who has been outspoken about the racism her mother Doria experienced, is said to have bonded with Mr Norris. She has taken a great interest in the arts since moving to Britain. Meghan and Harry attended a benefit performance of the hit musical Hamilton to support Harry’s charity Sentebale. Before Christmas, she made a visit to Brinsworth House which supports former artists and entertainers at a residential home. She also attended the Royal Variety Performance in November.Royal sources said Meghan has been holding various private meetings with organisations that tie in with her charitable and humanitarian interests. She is expected to begin work with these groups before taking leave to give birth to her first child later this year.Cate Blanchett is due to star at the National this year in the opening of When We Have Sufficiently Tortured Each Other and next year the theatre will debut Lenny Henry in a one-man play about Richard Pryor.Both the National and the Palace declined to comment."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/03/15/0025D62A00000258-0-image-m-76_1538576582298.jpg","title":"Horrors WWII brought life series colourised images","story":"    In this fascinating photo showing the brutal reality of the Second World War, American troops are seen walking down a recently ravaged street in Messina, Sicily, with weapons in their hands.

He hit the right side of his head on a rock, splitting open his helmet when he fell while skiing.Schumacher was rushed to hospital where he underwent several life-saving surgeries and spent the next six months in a coma.In April 2014, he woke up and was taken from the hospital in Grenoble to a private location, believed to be his house near Lake Geneva, where he is being cared for.          The Keep Fighting Foundation have now released the official Michael Schumacher app           The German Formula 1 great (pictured with his wife, Corinna) suffered life-changing head injuries in a ski accident in December 2013It is thought that Michael is being tended to by a team of 15 physicians who provide round-the-clock care at a cost of £115,000-per-week.At the time of his release from hospital, his wife Corinna issued a statement asking for support in \u0027our joint fight alongside Michael\u0027, but said she would not be speaking further and asked for privacy.The couple married in 1995 after meeting at a Ferrari party, and have two children together: Gina-Maria, 21, and Mick, 19, who races Formula Three.Mick won the Formula Three championship with a race to spare in 2018, and will now make the move to Formula Two with Italian team, Prema this year. "},{"url":null,"title":"Twitter mocks BBC presenter Andrew Marr asks PM watched Daniel Craig","story":"    Andrew Marr was today mocked after he asked the Prime Minister if she had seen \u0027I Daniel Craig\u0027 - accidentally mixing up the James Bond actor with a film about welfare benefit cuts (pictured, today\u0027s interview on the BBC)Tories take a six-point lead over Labour despite the Brexit...MPs plan to mount a Donald Trump-style shutdown of the...Share this articleOne viewer known as Jenifer wrote on Twitter: \u0027Just imagining I, Daniel Craig - So Mr Bond, what\u0027s your NI number?- 007- And what kind of work are you looking for?- Well I am licensed to kill, so...\u0027 Ken Armstrong also imagined what the script would be like.He wrote: \u0027I Daniel Craig - So, you expect me to die.

Miss Cooper said: ‘Time is running out and this is too serious for brinkmanship. Parliament needs to make sure there are opportunities to stop the country reaching the cliff edge by accident.

Well, they better make up their minds.’Asked about her own future, Mrs May refused to put a timescale on her departure, adding: ‘I was clear before Christmas with my colleagues on two things – one, I’m not going to call a snap election, and, secondly, I’ m not going to be leading the party into the 2022 general election.’ Theresa May is urged to delay crunch vote on her Brexit deal AGAIN until she wins enough concessions from Brussels to win over rebel MPsTheresa May is being urged to delay the crunch Commons vote on her Brexit deal a second time until she has secured enough concessions from Brussels to win over her mutinous MPs.Yesterday, the Prime Minister insisted the vote would go ahead next week after it was axed at the last minute in December.But with dozens of Eurosceptic Tories and her DUP governing partners threatening to join forces with Labour to vote it down, several ministers are expected to use tomorrow’s Cabinet meeting to urge her to delay again.One said: ‘It was a mistake last month to name the date for a new vote before knowing we had the concessions needed to win it.

It means they never earn enough to repay much of their student loans, and after 30 years the debt is wiped – with the taxpayer picking up the bill.The report comes amid questions over whether the Treasury should be taking the hit for people doing ‘Mickey Mouse’ courses which are unlikely to lead to rewarding professional jobs. Some courses even produce graduates who earn less than they would be expected to bring in had they not gone to university at all.This year, the Government is due to publish the results of a review of the higher education sector, with a specific focus on fees and value-for-money.Adorable kitten accidentally turns on police siren after cop...Party in the USA! A soaking wet Ball Drop in NYC, a light...Share this articleWill Tanner, director of Onward, said: ‘Britain’s student loans system is based on the premise that graduates will always earn more than people who do not go to university.‘But the Government’s own earnings data now clearly shows this is a false promise for up to a quarter of graduates. In the six years since tuition fees rose, at least a million students have graduated from courses who would have been better off doing a technical degree or starting work instead – meaning their loans will have to be written off by the taxpayer in years to come.’ Students are able to borrow money from Whitehall to pay for the £9,250-a-year tuition fees, and in some cases, living costs.Once a graduate begins earning more than £25,000 a year, they pay 9 per cent of their earnings above this threshold for 30 years – or until the loan has been repaid. Onward’s report found that a graduate would have to earn around £120,000 extra over their lifetime to generate a level of repayments and increased tax payments equal to the investment made by the Government.  The report comes amid questions over whether the Treasury should be taking the hit for people doing ‘Mickey Mouse’ courses which are unlikely to lead to rewarding professional jobs (stock image)This takes into account the maximum £50,000 loan for tuition and maintenance fees as well as interest accrued on the debt – adjusted for inflation. A quarter of those going to university do not earn this scale of premium – meaning there is a negative return for the government.The report was co-authored by Neil O’Brien MP and Mr Tanner, who is former deputy head of policy to Theresa May.It found that while on the whole graduates earn more than non-graduates, in 2015-16, 40 per cent of graduates were enrolled in courses which led to median earnings of less than the student loan repayment threshold of £25,000 after five years. In addition, 10 per cent of students were enrolled in courses with median earnings of less than £25,000 ten years after they have graduated –equating to 134,000 students each year.The most popular degree subject area is creative arts, with 126,000 students in 201617, but the median earning of a graduate is just £23,200 ten years after leaving. By contrast, graduates of economics degrees earned on average £48,000 ten years after graduation, but just 24,000 studied it last year.The report authors suggested courses should only be allowed to charge full fees if they produce a good graduate premium.Data suggests 83 per cent of all student loans will never be repaid – with expected write-offs in 2049-2050 of £28.8billion.The Government said its review of post-18 education and funding would ensure value for money for both students and taxpayers."},{"url":null,"title":"Egypt pressures CBS spike 60 Minutes interview President el Sissi","story":"    Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi is seen above during an interview with CBS News\u0027 60 Minutes. The interview was conducted in SeptemberIt did not say which part of the president’s comments the Cairo government objected to, but the cooperation with Israel, with whom Egypt has a 1979 peace treaty, appears to be the most contentious part.El-Sissi gave the interview in New York about three months ago, when the Egyptian leader was there attending the U.N. General Assembly, but CBS did not say why it was not aired earlier.Egypt’s foreign ministry spokesman could not be reached for comment.Egypt’s military last year denied press reports that Egypt and Israel were cooperating against the militants in northern Sinai, a rugged region of mountains and desert bordering Israel and the Gaza Strip where Egyptian security forces have for years battled the extremists, now led by the Islamic State group.According to the excerpts, el-Sissi was asked if his country’s cooperation with Israel was the closest ever between the two countries.  Sissi told CBS that his country and Israel, with whom it fought four wars, are cooperating against Islamic militants in the Sinai Peninsula. Egyptian soldiers are seen above in the Sinai in this 2013 file photo‘That is correct. … We have a wide range of cooperation with the Israelis,’ he responded.The excerpts did not provide the complete question on bilateral cooperation or specifically mention the Sinai militants.REVEALED: Black suspect in the murder of seven year-old...Former IBM employee, 57, accuses company of firing her due...Share this articleIsraeli officials have publicly praised security cooperation with el-Sissi’s Egypt, which has successfully secured Israel’s permission to deploy troops, armor and helicopter gunships close to the Israeli border to fight the militants, contravening the peace treaty’s limitations on the number or troops and type of weapons Egypt can have in the region.El-Sissi has since taking office in 2014 met at least twice with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.          Egypt under el-Sissi has imposed brutal crackdowns on political opponents, according to human rights groups. A Muslim Brotherhood supporter is seen above firing fireworks at police in Cairo in August 2013Their meetings have received little media attention in Egypt, a country where most people still view their neighbor as their sworn enemy and where trade unions and most political parties are vehemently opposed to ‘normalization’ of relations with Israel.In the interview, el-Sissi questioned a recent Human Rights Watch report that said Egypt was detaining 60,000 political prisoners.‘I don’t know where they got that figure. I said there are no political prisoners in Egypt. Whenever there is a minority trying to impose their extremist ideology we have to intervene regardless of their numbers,’ he told CBS, according to the excerpts.El-Sissi has in the past claimed that everyone in detention is facing legal proceedings for a specific crime committed, but rights activists complain of long detentions without charges - as long as two years or more in some cases.They say that the trials that don’t follow proper judicial processes and are more concerned with ‘protecting the state’ - a cornerstone of el-Sissi’s rule - than enforcing the law.The detentions are part of a large crackdown on dissent that includes tight control of the media, placing draconian restrictions on rights groups and reversing most of the freedoms gained by a 2011 uprising against autocrat Hosni Mubarak.El-Sissi also won a second, four-year term in office last year after running virtually unopposed. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/09/03/4E0C52C800000578-0-image-a-50_1531103042589.jpg","title":"Bars soap make comeback sales rise nearly 3 cent","story":"Family enjoying their vacation on a boat rescues a DEER from...Driver who flashed his lights to warn a passing motorist...Share this articleAnalysts said families are shunning products which come in plastic bottles due to an increased awareness of pollution in the environment.The Daily Mail has highlighted how plastics are polluting the sea with its Turn The Tide On Plastic campaign.Emma Priestland, of Friends of the Earth, said the rise of solid soaps was ‘great to see’, adding: ‘If more and more of us do it, it’ll put the pressure on those companies who continue to use unnecessary plastic packaging.’      "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/09/03/4E0C52C800000578-0-image-a-50_1531103042589.jpg","title":"Not dumb Blonds complex DNA study says","story":"Family enjoying their vacation on a boat rescues a DEER from...Driver who flashed his lights to warn a passing motorist...Share this articleIt was assumed that blonde hair had a basic genetic structure but the finding may explain why truly blonde people are rarer than other colours. Only 12.7 per cent of women have pure blonde hair, and 9.9 per cent of men. One theory is that blonde hair evolved at the end of the Ice Age, when females outnumbered males.

Published in 2017, the book has been on the New York Times young adult bestseller list for 96 weeks and has won many awards, including children’s book of the year at the British book awards, and the Waterstones children’s book prize for 2018. Writer Nikesh Shukla described it as “one of the most important books of 2017” and it has also recently been made into a successful film.Thomas grew up in Jackson, Mississippi, and she was the first black student to graduate in creative writing from the city’s Belhaven University.

We are expected to be ambitious to want to be wealthy, successful and well educated to get married, be monogamous and have kids. These social narratives can make our lives easier, by providing guidelines for behaviour, and they might sometimes make us happier, too. But they are, at their heart, stories – and ones that may not have originated with present-day people in mind. As such, many of these stories end up creating a kind of social dissonance whereby, perversely, they cause more harm than good.Since we’re talking about stories, let’s start with an experience of mine. It’s about a working-class kid who becomes a university professor and who is expected to change his behaviour in accordance with a (harmful) narrative about how academics ought to behave. A couple of years ago, I took part in an interesting panel discussion on “emotion versus reason” at the HowTheLightGetsIn festival in Hay-on-Wye. Walking across the field to get some food, I was approached by a man in his 50s. Our interaction started with him saying how much he liked my first book, Happiness By Design. Then he asked, pointedly: “But why do you have to play the working-class hero? You do it in your book and, look at you, you’re doing it now.”Ordinarily, I would embrace being a hero of any kind but, in this context, I was made to feel like an arsehole. The man proceeded to lecture me on how “when you reach a certain level you have to modify your behaviour”. He told me that I should not swear: apparently I used the word “fuck” twice in an hour-long panel discussion. Why shouldn’t I swear? Perhaps because it is a sign of a poor vocabulary andor low intelligence, and yet no such correlations have ever been found. Swearing is only ever harmful when it is used in an aggressive or abusive way, and not when used as a means of conveying excitement and emphasis. In these circumstances, the evidence shows that it does more good than harm, so the idea that swearing is bad is a fucking stupid one.But I digress. This man was insistent that, in my role as a professor at the London School of Economics and Political Science, I ought to be setting a “better” example to those who looked up to me. In doing so, he was appealing to a social narrative that places the burden on me to act in a particular way based upon my middle-class profession.This social narrative and others like it have withstood generations of change. They have been shaped by power structures, cultures, laws, families, the media, historical practice and even evolutionary advantage. As well as satisfying some of our innate desires, such narratives have developed rules of thought and action that help to make a complicated world easier to navigate. By looking to the narrative for clues about how to live, we are provided with a coherent path to follow. Not only do we want to fit in, but we can also, like my festival friend, get angry with those who do not.His behaviour and his reaction to me demonstrate just one way in which these stories can harm us and the people around us. They become what I refer to as narrative traps, which together form the myth of the perfect life.The stories around wealth and success, in particular, are social narratives that we can’t seem to get enough of. Now, it should be obvious that the absence of either of these two things can cause anxiety and misery. I will not suggest otherwise. The narratives suggest, however, that no matter how much we have of each, we are expected to be reaching for more. The assumption is that ever more happiness is achieved with ever more money and more markers of success. The trap comes from the fact that the happiness hit from adherence to these narratives gets ever smaller the further up the ladder you go and, eventually, can become reversed. To be happier we need to move from a culture of “more please” to one of “just enough”.Likewise, the most recent American Time Use Survey (ATUS), which allows analysts to estimate levels of happiness associated with a range of daily activities, showed that happiness goes up with increases in income at the lower end of the scale, but then it falls with higher incomes. Contrary to what most of us might predict, those earning over $100K are no happier than those with incomes of less than $25K. Those with the highest incomes report the least sense of purpose in their experiences. Perhaps “having it all” makes what we do feel less meaningful.Data suggest that being rich can lead to time and attention being directed towards activities that fuel the attainment of more wealth, such as longer working hours and longer commutes, and away from activities that generate more happiness, such as time outside and time with family and friends. This discrepancy between the big effect on happiness that we imagine increased wealth should bring and the small effect we experience goes a long way towards explaining the narrative trap of reaching for wealth. But most people, including those on incomes above £50,000, truly believe misery would continue to fall with higher income above this point. And most people, irrespective of income, would continue to reach for more long after they have earned their 50 grand. This is the addiction problem.If you are not struggling to make ends meet, I propose that you rein in the social narrative that encourages you to endlessly pursue more money. Invest your time and effort into doing all you can to ensure that those who are struggling are provided with the living conditions, wages and financial support that will help them to cover the costs of their living expenses. (Helping other people is great for our own happiness.)A just-enough approach to wealth is not made any easier by the demands placed on us by family commitments, especially as your family grows, and social expectations. Social media, in particular, facilitate showing off beyond our wildest dreams. Even without the constant bombardment to reach for more wealth, “just enough” can still sound like a weak counter-narrative to “keep striving for more”. But even if it appears boring to accept that you (may) have enough wealth already, it can also be tremendously liberating. Once you have enough money to afford the basic things you want in life, you can stop constantly worrying.Attending to being wealthy also means that we harshly judge others for being happy with what they have – we might call them unambitious or lazy – thus preserving the status quo and making it more likely that more people will be miserable with what they have. So we need to stop judging others as lazy, uninspiring or unambitious when they report being happy as they are. The narrative of reaching for wealth stigmatises those who do not want more money. Let’s instead celebrate those who choose to devote their time and effort to causes of social worth rather than question them for not accumulating more personal wealth.The desire for wealth has truly far-reaching consequences. It usually means the overconsumption of goods, resulting in global greenhouse gas emissions and unnecessary land, material and water use. Repeated spending on items that are easily replaced means more production and excess waste, both of which have serious environmental consequences.If you are a parent, reinforcing the narrative at home that some money can be enough will help children learn from an early age that the relentless pursuit of money is not inevitable. If you are a policy-maker, perhaps you could start by publishing lists of the top taxpayers, rather than the top earners. When I searched for “the world’s richest person” on Google, the answer came up immediately (Jeff Bezos was giving Bill Gates a run for his money when I last looked). But when I looked up “the world’s highest tax- payer”, the search returned lots of information on which countries had the highest tax rates. If we know that we are hardwired to compete and to compare, then let’s use this to write social narratives that we can all benefit from.When it comes to the success narrative, the first box to tick is to be employed. But beyond having a job – any job – one of the most widely used measures of success is having a good job, and doing well in your career. In Happiness By Design, I told this story: A few weeks ago, I went out for dinner with one of my best friends, whom I have known for a long time. She works for a prestigious media company and basically spent the whole evening describing how miserable she was at work she variously moaned about her boss, her colleagues, and her commute. At the end of dinner, and without a hint of irony, she said: “Of course, I love working at MediaLand.”This story highlights the very common inner conflict between the social narrative of success, which values status and recognition in a job, and personal experiences of happiness in the job. My friend was experiencing pain and pointlessness at work, but the narrative she told about her job was totally unrelated. A job that makes us miserable is not a good job, but we can convince ourselves it is if it has high status. MediaLand is somewhere my friend had always wanted to work, her parents were proud of her, and her friends were a little bit jealous. So the narrative she created for herself comes from the broader social narrative of status.More recent data also suggests that the most conventionally “successful” occupations are not ones where the happiest workers are to be found. In 2014, the Legatum Institute published a report that looked to see which occupational groups were paid the most and which ones had the highest average life satisfaction. Predictably, chief executives and other senior officials were the highest paid, but they were no more satisfied than their secretaries, who were obviously paid much less. Some other professions whose members were happier than their bank accounts might suggest were the clergy, farmers and fitness instructors.It could well be that those who choose careers like floristry or fitness might be happier to begin with than those who choose to go into law. We need good longitudinal studies (which follow the same people over time) to find out more. We might expect that many of those choosing careers as lawyers care more about what others think of them than those who choose careers analogous to being “just a florist”. However, there are aspects of jobs like floristry that make them more likely to generate happiness than working in a law firm. These include working with nature, regularly seeing the fruits of your labour, generally being around people who want to be with you, and feeling as though you have control over your workload. More than four out of five florists say that they are able to hone their skills every day, which makes them feel happy. Focusing on the likely daily experiences of the jobs we choose to take can help us avoid the unnecessary pain and pointlessness that often accompany adherence to the narrative of what a “good” job looks like.The success narrative not only applies to what jobs we have but also to how long we spend working. It suggests that we should work longer and longer hours so that we can be wealthier and more “successful”. As incomes rise, it seems that we pay more attention to the income forgone from not working and so we work more to capitalise on the increased value of our time. Time is money. Moreover, paying attention to time as money has been shown to diminish the pleasure experienced from leisure activities. Little wonder, then, that daily happiness in the US is actually lower for those on high incomes compared to those on middling ones. There is no time for enjoyment when you are using all of your time reaching to be rich.When we look again at the ATUS, happiness and sense of purpose are both at their highest among people working between 21 and 30 hours a week, and misery increases in tandem with the number of hours worked thereafter. The results are consistent across genders. Many people do also choose to work long hours. Some people love their work so much that they want to spend as much time working as possible. I have felt like that at times in my career, and most of all when I have been working on my books, and I know many of my colleagues and collaborators have, too. But this is a quite rare and extremely fortunate position to be in.Many more people “choose” to work long hours because the social narrative of long work hours is so persuasive. Most unpaid overtime (and perhaps some paid overtime, too) is undertaken out of a desire to progress at work and not from any underlying pleasure or purpose from working those hours. The expectation of prolonged working hours permeates a number of different professions, from banking, advertising and law to education and other public services, as well as poorly paid positions in the arts. There is huge pressure on staff to be the first one in and the last to leave, so everyone comes in earlier and leaves later.Last year, I was involved in a TV series called Make Or Break? for Channel 5. A typical filming day lasted about 16 hours, from leaving the hotel to returning, and this was for six days out of seven, over a period of four weeks. Now, I’m not asking you to feel sorry for me, because being a TV presenter is hardly the worst job in the world (although the four-hour daily round trip in a van across dirt tracks to sit around in the heat of the Mexican summer waiting to film was about as bad as it gets for an impatient git who melts in temperatures above 20°C). The long days were justified on the grounds that this is “just how TV is”, as if historical precedent and industry expectations were explanation enough for overworking people. Long hours in TV are seen as a badge of honour, when instead they adversely affect happiness and, I suspect, productivity too.As for the social narratives surrounding love and marriage, the narrative traps are everywhere. Think back on your bedtime stories as a child and I bet these words are lodged somewhere in your brain: “ …and they fell in love, got married, and lived happily ever after.” These imagined happy endings stick with us as adults. An overwhelming majority of us report considering marriage as part of our ideal lifestyle and we often project this preference on to others, too. An unmarried 40-year-old is “unlucky” or has yet to meet “the one”: as if being married is something for all of us, and that there is some one – one person – out there for every one of us.This is wilfully overoptimistic. Any given relationship is much more likely to end than it is to result in living happily ever after. Two in five marriages in the UK end in orce. We have to come to terms with those odds. We expect passionate love to be nothing but pleasurable (when, in fact, it can be quite damaging, just like any other compulsion) and to last for ever (when, for the vast majority of us, the high dies after about a year), and our spouse to satisfy all of our needs (which no one human being ever can). Against this background, as Esther Perel, a psychotherapist who has written a lot about marriage, has asked: “Is it any wonder that so many relationships crumble under the weight of it all?”When a relationship ends, particularly a long-term one, so many people are heard to say “what a shame” or “such a waste”. But if for the most part during that relationship both partners were happy, how can it be a shame or a waste of time? A breakup is most likely to be in the best long-term interests of both parties. How many of you are knowingly with someone now who is worse than a previous partner? We are highly adaptive creatures who are very good at moving on. So, if in doubt, best get out. Don’t let the narrative fool you into staying past the point it would be better for you to leave.Divorce hurts the children of couples who separate, though, right? Well, yes, to a degree. Researchers from the University of Virginia have shown that children of orced parents do experience negative emotions, including anxiety, shock and anger, in the short run however, for the vast majority of kids, these feelings have dissipated within a couple of years of their parents’ orce. Those born into high-conflict relationships report greater happiness as adults if their parents split up compared to those whose parents stayed together. So, on balance, it’s probably better to be the child of orced parents than to be the child of parents who stayed together and who argue a lot. The social story of staying together for the sake of the children potentially harms the children more than accepting when a relationship has gone wrong and walking away from it in a way that preserves the kids’ happiness. We should perhaps start using the word “congratulations” for orce, as well as for marriage.There are many decision-makers who could start to tackle the narrative traps of love and marriage. Parents could warn their children about the dangerous fairytale narrative that love always means living happily ever after. This would then result in less psychological, financial and health-related support being required for the eventual fallout from a less than perfect marriage. Schools could do more to provide teenagers with the basic facts on love: that you can expect the passion to diminish would be a good place to start. This will help youngsters to see through the fog of social narratives so that they can make more informed choices.The legal system also needs to rethink how it deals with marriage and orce, and the welfare of children affected by both. There are good libertarian and egalitarian grounds for the state to stop incentivising marriage (eg, by removing the tax breaks for married people that are not available to single people). It can, instead, allow for a range of different contracts between two or more iniduals, so that people can specify the rights and responsibilities in the relationship that best suit their unique set of circumstances. Where the state does intervene in family matters, it should focus directly on strengthening the relationships that each parent has with their children. In this way, governments can focus on what really matters – strong parenthood to the benefit of children – without having to interfere in the relationship between the parents.Going against the grain of social narratives can be challenging. As I said earlier, it is likely that the task is being made harder by the powerful role played by social media, which, overall, have made visible, and consequently magnified, the importance of having achieved according to the main narratives.It seems glib yet still important to say that social media are not the problem, it’s just that we don’t know how to control our consumption. And it’s not all doom and gloom: social media might also lead to the formation and reinforcement of groups that are anti-narrative. You can find Becoming Minimalist, a group with more than 800,000 members, which actively celebrates spending less money with an emphasis on sustainable living. And then there’s The Childfree Choice group on Facebook with a following of more than 20,000, which allows people who decide against having kids to share experiences and promote the benefits. This can act as a nice counterbalance to the prevailing narratives.Returning to the guy who accosted me at that festival at Hay-on-Wye, he was very clear that I had a duty to act in a certain way. As far as he was concerned, I was “playing the working-class hero” in a distasteful way. Judging by some of the comments that have been written about me online, he is not alone. One of my favourites, for what it’s worth, was “Maybe happiness can be found in the wearing of unpleasant spectacles? And chavvy watches” in response to a photo of me in the gym, wearing my white specs and a sports watch, for a piece I wrote for the .When I stated publicly a while ago that I do not like to read fiction, I was judged very harshly for this by other academics as well as in the press. So not only am I expected to conform to stories about how LSE professors ought to behave when I am working, I am expected to use my leisure time in ways that conform with the stereotype, too. I have often felt obliged to rein in who I am because I do not conform to what is expected of me in my career. It rarely feels pleasurable to go against the grain, but it often feels purposeful. But it shouldn’t always feel so bloody hard.I would like those of you who feel more of an obligation to fit in, at work or elsewhere, to not be chastised if you really would like to behave in ways that are not consistent with the prevailing social stories. Ultimately, insofar as we have any choice over such matters, each of us has to decide for ourselves when we conform and the circumstances under which we want to stand out. We can each live our lives in ways that reduce our own misery as much as possible, properly accounting for the impact that our actions have on other people.We can make decisions on behalf of others according to the same misery-minimising rules. We should have more respect than we currently do for those who forsake social narratives that simply aren’t for them.

He is an expert on the measurement of happiness and acts as a wellbeing adviser to the government and a number of NGOs. His first book, Happiness By Design (2014), which argued that finding a sense of purpose as well as pleasure in life makes us happier, became a bestseller January, looks at how social narratives – “the stories about how we ought to to live our lives” – can hurt us as much as they may help.Born in 1968, Dolan was raised in east London and Essex and was the first person in his family to go to university. He studied economics at Swansea before moving into the field of behavioural science at the University of York. A former visiting scholar with Professor Daniel Kahneman, the bestselling author of Thinking, Fast and Slow, at Princeton university, Dolan held posts at the universities of York, Newcastle, Sheffield and Imperial College London before joining the LSE.When asked in 2014 what makes him happy, he said: “Happiness is situated in what we do and who we spend time with. It does not reside in some story we tell ourselves about what we think should make us happy.”Dolan says he finds happiness in his work, going to the gym, evenings out with friends, having new experiences, talking to taxi drivers… What makes him unhappy? Other people’s weddings, reading novels and overlong family holidays, he says. He concludes: “I am a very lucky man: not because I have a great job and family and all that stuff but because I have a sunny disposition. Now that makes me happy.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ee669e172928c828cd0c9f711575591ae6a4b13/0_189_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=99240c9befcac8968a6e72423525cbd7","title":"us and china resume trade talks both eager for compromise","story":"Asian shares rise as fresh round of negotiations begins amid concerns about a slowdown in the Chinese economyUS officials arrived in China for the first face-to-face negotiations since a 90-day truce was declared in a trade war between Washington and Beijing, in the hope of ending a bruising confrontation between the world’s two largest economies.Hopes that the sixth round of negotiations between the two sides could yield a breakthrough helped Asian shares rise on Monday, combined with optimism about the state of the global economy on the back of strong US jobs figures on Friday. Trump said on Sunday that China was under pressure to do a deal amid signs of a slowdown in its economy. “I think China wants to get it resolved. Their economy’s not doing well. I think that gives them a great incentive to negotiate,” he said.Analysts believe the talks were unlikely to produce a major breakthrough but will lay important groundwork for an agreement that both sides appear increasingly eager to reach.“The situation now is that both sides are facing some economic problems. China is facing an export pressure and a likely economic downturn. The US is facing a falling stock market. Thus, both sides are willing to talk and are expecting a deal,” said Shi Yinhong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing. “I think it’s possible to reach a deal before March if both sides talk and move fast,” he said.China’s leaders in particular are under pressure to end a trade war that is exacerbating an already slowing Chinese economy in which exports, factory output, and consumer confidence have all declined.“China’s slowdown is occurring across the board, affecting almost every industry and region,” said Scott Kennedy, a trade expert focused on China at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “Resolving the trade war or at least finding some common ground with Washington will be needed to fully restore confidence,” he said.The delegation, led by the US deputy trade representative, Jeffrey Gerrish, does not include any top US officials from the administration, a sign the talks will be a precursor to higher-level meetings.China’s economic tsar, the vice-premier Liu He, may travel to Washington in February and Trump may meet the Chinese vice-president, Wang Qishan, at the World Economic Forum in Davos near the end of this month, according to reports.The US delegation includes officials from the Treasury, and energy and agriculture departments, as well as the State Department and the White House, according to the Office of the United States Trade Representative.“It promises to be the first time that the core of the agenda will centre around the problems caused by Chinese industrial policy and the need to marketise China’s economy,” said Kennedy.“If they can make sufficient progress on identifying the key issues and narrowing in on the possible solutions, that will pave the way for Chinese vice-premier Liu He to visit Washington in the coming weeks,” he added.Key US exports including soya beans, corn and pork, as well as liquefied natural gas, are currently subject to retaliatory tariffs from China. China’s industrial policy, “Made in China 2025”, which the US argues violates World Trade Organization rules, is likely to be a topic of discussion.China is likely to raise the issue of the telecoms firm Huawei, whose global ambitions have been thwarted by a US ban on its products. The arrest in Canada of a senior Huawei official, Meng Wanzhou, at the request of the US has spiralled into a diplomatic incident, which includes two Canadians still detained in China.Gerrish, the head of the US delegation, is likely to follow the lead of the US trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, one of the most hawkish members of the Trump administration. Gerrish has previously described Lighthizer as one of his “incredible mentors”.Observers say that beyond reaching an agreement, a major sticking point will be over how to confirm that both sides uphold it. Chinese officials have reportedly indicated a willingness to establish such a mechanism.“The big issue is not just that an agreement is reached, but verifiability – that China is living up to their end of the bargain,” said Christopher Balding, a former associate professor of business and economics at the HSBC business school in Shenzhen, who writes about the Chinese economy.In recent weeks, Beijing has made some conciliatory gestures, including drafting new rules that would ban forced technology transfers. China has promised to buy more US goods as well as cut tariffs, and improve market access for foreign companies in China. Still, these concessions and economic pressures both sides face may not be enough to bring both sides to a deal.“The US is very wary of Chinese changes as simply being paper reforms that change little on the ground. That perception will be very difficult to overcome,” said Roland Rajah, the director of the international economy programme at the Lowy Institute in Sydney. He said that any agreement is likely to be framed as part of ongoing negotiations, with the threat of tariffs kept in place.He said: “The broader relationship has been deteriorating quite rapidly, meaning neither side want to cave in too much on the substantive issues as they see it as part of a broader and longer term strategic battle.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/35a529eeba86eac481af45773b890fada0a21c72/0_13_4434_2661/master/4434.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=beb2639cc2a1aadba6b9eb0b72346606","title":"the guardian view on the orthodox schism theology and low politics","story":"The Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, who reigns in Constantinople, has a magnificent title which corresponds to almost nothing on earth. Although he represents an unbroken tradition of almost 2,000 years of Christianity, Constantinople has been the Muslim city of Istanbul since 1453 and there are now fewer than 3,000 Orthodox Christians living there. Although his title is a claim to universal authority in the church, this has been has been obviously false since the papacy broke away and took with it western Christianity in the 11th century. Adding insult to injury, the patriarchs of Moscow regard themselves as his successors in “the Third Rome”. Yet still he matters. His decision last year to recognise the Ukrainian Orthodox church as a body separate from Moscow was celebrated  in his cathedral in Istanbul today. It came in the teeth of Russian opposition, and the political rift between Ukraine and Russia is now paralleled by a rift on the spiritual plane between Moscow and Constantinople and the declaration of a formal schism.This may all seem like shadow play. But religions matter. It is obvious that they reflect political and even economic tensions. But they also help shape and form them. Religious allegiance has been a very important part of how nations imagine themselves into being, and so of how they define who is and is not a member. This may not be obvious in England, where the near collapse of the state church has run in parallel with a more general crisis of legitimacy. But in countries such as Poland and Ireland, religion and nationalism were inseparable for most of the 20th century. Even some forms of secularism can serve the same function of crystallising the idea of a nation, as the doctrine of laïcité does in France, or the separation of church and state does in the US. In all these cases, there is an underlying idea that only those people who share in a particular doctrine can truly be part of the nation. And in Ukraine, where President Petro Poroshenko is campaigning for re-election using the slogan “army, language, faith”, the connection could hardly be more stark.Should the schism succeed – and the church in Ukraine is thoroughly ided – the Moscow patriarchate will lose believers, authority and money. Today it represents about half of the world’s 300 million Orthodox believers about a third of these are in Ukraine and might be lost to the new church. Although the Moscow patriarchate is widely regarded as a creature of the ruling oligarchy, the church in Ukraine is hardly free of political links and interference either. Control of its property will be a prize for both sides in the coming struggle. The sacred and the secular are inextricably entwined here, as they were in Henry VIII’s break with Rome. The conflict is partly about who blesses the guns of which army, but since that is a question that affects a soldier’s willingness to fight, and die, it matters to millions who have no interest in theology."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/258e9ddb517b81f142bc7853cba6851b76bb7888/0_0_5200_3122/master/5200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0d8d714b2f67960bc0c2d7f47789d084","title":"how i fell in love with romance novels","story":"I know I match an unkind stereotype and that to say I like romance is to invite people to dismiss me as frivolous and sillyJournalism is a good career for the perpetually anxious. It doesn’t allow time to dwell on failures and expands to fill all available space, meaning you can ignore everything that isn’t work. This is quite relaxing until suddenly it isn’t.I have a number of techniques for dealing with the frittering restlessness that follows. Watching four seasons of a television show in a week. Listening to Good Omens on audiobook while lying on the floor. Watching every available episode of QI so there’s always someone talking, even when I am sleeping or in the shower.But the thing that works best is reading romance novels.I discovered this by way of another anxiety remedy: podcasts. Not the fashionable true crime podcasts, but gentle discussions of books and pop culture such as may murmer away in the background.A few years ago I listened to the entire back catalogue of the BookRiot podcast and for several episodes in a row of one of the hosts, Rebecca Schinsky, raved about how she had read her first romance novel. Like most people who considered themselves serious readers, she said, she had been prejudiced against the genre and dismissed it as badly-written mush. And, like most people who consider themselves serious readers, she was wrong.The book Schinsky recommended was A Rogue By Any Other Name, by Sarah MacLean. I didn’t really like it. The male protagonist was a jerk in a way I was supposed to find sexy but didn’t and I got hung up on the sex scenes, which seemed to involve an inordinate amount of growling and use of the word “pleasure” and once, “milking”.But it was well written and the dialogue skipped along and the female protagonist was interesting and funny and, more importantly, it was the first thing with a plot that I had seen through to the end in months. So I downloaded the next book in the series, and then the next.Five years later, I have 500 romance novels. I read them as e-books, partly because it is surprisingly difficult to find romance novels in regular bookshops despite the popularity of the genre, but mostly because I tend to binge and instantly buy the next instalment, even, or especially, if it’s 3am and my alarm is set for 6am.I wandered into contemporary romance novels for a bit, which was nice because the female characters weren’t all blushing virgins but frustrating because they still tended to get married and knocked up within six weeks. Popular romance tropes of forced proximity or marriages of convenience or extremely overbearingly alpha men can make sense in a historical setting but are frankly baffling in modern-day San Francisco. Women who have political and economic agency of their own should not marry men they just met, no matter how unrealistically sculpted their abs.My most comforting stories – and this is comfort food in its purest form, nourishing but unchallenging – are set in the late 18th and early 19th centuries in England, usually involving the British aristocracy.This is in direct conflict to everything I care about in real life but that is the appeal of romance novels. They do not concern real life. They are not, except for specific and very narrow examples, concerned with politics or the fact that their self-made men, who return from years overseas, have been plundering colonised cultures in order to show their father, who believed they spent too much time a-whoring, that they are not a useless fribble after all. (The father, naturally, shuns them for engaging in trade.)The female characters in these stories are interesting and smart. The writing is good. The male character may be a chauvinist on page one but is reformed by the end. The setting is historical but the sensibilities are not: homophobia, racism, and old-fashioned beliefs in the superiority of penetrative sex are all absent. Bodice-rippers may have launched the modern romance genre but they no longer define it.Once the two point-of-view characters have been introduced, it’s fairly clear what’s going to happen. You read along to see if it’s done well. If it’s not, you can abandon that author and find another. The number and variety of stories is infinite.There are historicals, contemporaries, paranormals, and erotica. The majority still depict white, monogamous, heterosexual pairings but the number of LGBT, polyamorous, and non-white stories and authors is large and growing.Every category sprouts a dozen sub-categories, allowing readers to narrow in on exactly the story they want to read. The blog Smart Bitches, Trashy Books provides weekly recommendations to people who write in with a genre and a trope. Snowed in plus second chance? Simply Unforgettable by Mary Balogh. Friends to lovers historical set outside the Regency period? Let it Shine by Alyssa Cole. Hygge in a novel? Anything by Tessa Dare, staring with The Duchess Deal.There are few things I have worked so hard to conceal as my love of romance novels. As an overweight single woman who lives alone with a cat, I know I match an unkind stereotype and that to say I like romance is to invite people to dismiss me as frivolous and silly. That is what we have done to women who write stories for and about women, or read stories for, about, and by women, since the days of the Minerva Press.But that stereotype is wrong, both about me and about the novels. Many of them are genuinely good. Not just good romance novels: good books. And it’s time to break my silence publicly, if only to better be able to enthusiastically recommend my favourites to people I barely know and receive their recommendations in return.I’ll start: the Girl Meets Duke series by Tessa Dare, The Worth Saga series by Courtney Milan, and the A Season For Scandal series by Kelly Bowen.Now tell me who you love."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/626f9f64766c136f8ee017934ba73910d2d5a6a1/0_95_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f009a52a7b7d20171addf9c00b621b94","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of healthy","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘healthy’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘healthy’.Share your photos of what healthy means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 9 January at 10am.

Consistently named as one of the most scenic drives in the world, this route from Calgary to Edmonton through the Rockies is hard to beatWith a flourishing bar and dining scene, and a number of erse and arty neighbourhoods, cosmopolitan, multicultural Calgary is much more than just the gateway to the Rockies. Direct flights from London (daily from Heathrow, and multiple times a week from Gatwick) also make it a convenient starting point. Load-up and learn, with a food tour of the historic Inglewood neighbourhood. The tour stops at the high-end Rouge, in what’s now a heritage site, as well as taking in Alberta’s First Nations arts and food culture.Style-up and get your cowboy threads sorted year-round at the Alberta Boot Company, or head to Smithbilt for the distinctive white hats that have become a symbol of the city – so that when the Calgary Stampede rodeo comes to town in July, you look the part.Head for the hills to start your roadtrip. Banff national park – Canada’s oldest – is an easy hour-and-a-half drive from Calgary. But don’t skip the picturesque and vibrant mountain town of Canmore, just outside the park’s boundary, where the peaks of the Rockies provide the backdrop to numerous music and arts festivals throughout the year.For a town with a population of just under 14,000 people, the town is overflowing with dining and drinking destinations. And it also claims the honour of being home to the largest number of Olympians per capita in Canada, who use the altitude to train. (If you can’t beat ‘em, join ‘em.)In the summer, hit the bike trails. A 13-mile trail connects to Banff, with an additional 50 miles of other pathways to follow. In winter, try out one of the newest crazes in these parts: fat biking. Extra-large tyres will take you across otherwise inaccessible snow-covered trails. Don’t fret, there are hand-warmers too. Afterwards, head on to Banff to warm-up at the thermal waters of the Upper Hot Springs.It’s impossible to be bored in Banff with the myriad activities on offer. If you want action and adventure, try white-water rafting, rock climbing and horse riding. If you want to take it easy, just find a patio, order a coffee and sit and watch the clouds move over the mountains that hug the town. If you want something in between, how about a round of golf? Banff has some of the most beautiful courses in the world. You certainly can’t skip town without a fondue from the unironically kitsch Grizzly House.Put simply, Lake Louise doesn’t look real. Its searing blue waters reflect back the towering glacier that created the lake 10,000 years ago. While in the winter the lake freezes over and becomes a fairy-tale setting for ice skaters and sleigh rides, in the summer it’s populated by canoes with travellers keen to glimpse the ice close-up. When you get tired of taking in the views from the genteel-surrounds of the Fairmont Chateau Lake Louise – if such a thing is possible – take the steep 2-mile (3.5-km) hike from the hotel to the Disney-esque Lake Agnes Tea House. First built by the Canadian Pacific Railway in 1901 as a shelter for hikers, this lakeshore log cabin sits in a valley of its own, and has been serving tea since 1905.The spectacularly scenic Icefields Parkway hugs hillsides and traces its way past more than 100 ancient glaciers on its 146-mile (235-km) route from Lake Louise to Jasper national park.With dramatic waterfalls and sweeping lakes at nearly every turn, you’re going to want to stop often. Head to the highest point of the parkway to stop at the viewpoint for the glowing turquoise waters of Peyto Lake. And leave time to explore the Columbia Icefield, the largest ice field in the Rocky Mountains. You can tour it in a massive all-terrain vehicle or, if you fancy a bird’s eye view, by helicopter. And at the Glacier Discovery Centre, tours will take you to walk on the up-to-300m thick ice of the Athabasca Glacier.Sweet little Jasper – home to just 4,500 people – has charm. Surrounded by natural beauty, it’s an adventure sports hub, and a key stop for the iconic Rocky Mountaineer train. You’ll be spoiled for choice for places to eat. Papa George’s – a family-run Jasper institution since 1925, offers comfort food, such as fluffy buttermilk pancakes, in a homely environment. Head out of town for one of the great Rocky Mountain experiences – a cruise across Maligne Lake. Here, you’ll find the stunning Spirit Island – its tiny grouping of trees, surrounded by crystal blue water, has made it one of the world’s most photographed beauty spots.Head east from the mountains to the metropolis. Nicknamed “festival city”, Edmonton always has something going on – from music festivals to fringe theatre, to farmers’ markets. Make sure you check out the atmosphere of the historic Old Strathcona, which has plenty of quirky, independent shopping, restaurants and bars. Encompassing more than 90 miles (150km) of multi-use trails and over 20 major city parks, the lush Edmonton River valley is the largest expanse of urban parkland in North America. Head down with a picnic during the summer, or save those aching legs and hire a Segway.Discover more adventures throughout the year in Alberta with Canadian Affair"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/279d27d61dd9d51b785a58cf6ad0691fd98d9a64/0_195_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=62da578265ac89aad085646aa397d84e","title":"jellyfish sting more than 5000 holidaymakers on queenslands coast","story":"An invasion of bluebottles on Queensland’s Gold and Sunshine coasts led to thousands being treatedMore than 5,000 people were stung by bluebottles on Queensland’s Gold and Sunshine coasts over the weekend as weather drove a wall of jellyfish onto the shore.Conditions eased on Monday but remnants of the bluebottle armada (the correct term for a bunch of bluebottles) still dot the beaches and more than 200 people were treated for stings, mostly at the Sunshine Coast.The latest figure for the weekend is almost double initial estimates released by Surf Life Saving Queensland and includes people treated by council lifeguards.Across Queensland, but mostly in the south-east, 22,282 people sought treatment for bluebottle stings between 1 December and 7 January compared with 6,831 in the same period last year.That was a “hell of a lot” of people stung, Australian Marine Stinger Advisory Service director Lisa-ann Gershwin said.“That is unusual,” she said. “The numbers I have seen published are 25,000 to 45,000 per year for the whole of Australia.“Those figures, the 22,282, are for about five weeks and that’s just one teeny tiny smidgin of Australia, so that is a lot.”Thousands were treated by lifesavers and several people reportedly suffered anaphylactic shock and were treated by paramedics.In a matter of hours on Sunday, 476 bluebottle stings were treated on the Gold Coast and 461 on the Sunshine Coast. Unusually strong north-easterly swell conditions pushed the bluebottles onshore.Gershwin said the striking blue jellyfish lived in armadas in the middle of the ocean and had trailing tentacles and a keel-like crest that acts like a sail.“When you look at a bluebottle, and you see the bubble and the blue fringes and the long blue tentacles, that is actually a colony, that is not an inidual,” she said. “Those colonies also live in these armadas – sort of a population of the colonies – in the middle of the open ocean.“Bluebottles have definitely been fairly active lately, pretty much throughout south-east Queensland.“They get picked up by the wind and blown as long as the wind keeps going or until they hit land and strand on the beaches“Some of the bluebottle sails are right-handed and some are left-handed, across the body, so when the wind comes up it only grabs the ones with the sail going the right way for that particular breeze.“It’s nature’s way of making sure the population never becomes extinct.”Surf Life Saving Queensland said that, if stung, people should remove stingers, take a very hot shower and apply ice."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ddd25fbedba06c6038476a0a891924597a131a09/0_28_1920_1152/master/1920.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc3837c4db5c74b0217a658ba3977bb2","title":"david beckhams menswear label doffs cap peaky blinders kent curwen","story":"Ex-footballer’s family join him for launch of Kent \u0026amp Curwen’s collaboration with TV showKent \u0026amp Curwen, the London brand part-owned by David Beckham, has unveiled its latest collection – including a collaboration with the BBC drama Peaky Blinders.The ex-footballer watched Sunday’s show alongside his wife, Victoria, son Brooklyn and mother, Sandra. The designs included frock coats, tailoring and that Peaky Blinders staple, the flat cap. The chef Gordon Ramsay and the Dior Homme designer, Kim Jones, were also in attendance, and both Beckham men wore the TV-show inspired headgear.After the show, David Beckham – dressed in a camel coat and cosy knit - said he was excited by the Peaky Blinders collaboration because he was “a big fan of the show and our brand has always been about the look. It keeps that authenticity.” As for the family show of support, he said: “I always think these days are celebrations everyone can be part of … It makes them very proud to have them here.”He said the flat cap had a family connection. “I got that from my grandad. I wore his from a very young age. Brooklyn has taken it on as well.”The show was the brand’s second at London fashion week men’s, the capital’s biannual menswear showcase. The collection, designed by the brand’s creative director, Daniel Kearns, continued on the theme of British classics.It was strong – and had a pre-war influence without straying into the costume department. This is a well-pitched balance that works for young men of Brooklyn’s generation, who like their retro references in Insta-friendly bites. The rugby shirts, Crombie coats, argyle sweaters and striped mod-like skinny suits, all in a prep school palette of forest green, ivory and claret, could form wardrobe staples. The bright red socks, a tribute to the brand’s founder, Eric Kent, brought the required touch of irreverence.As well as working with Kent \u0026amp Curwen, Beckham has also been the ambassadorial president of the British Fashion Council since last May. “I’m really proud of my involvement,” he said. “It’s so inspiring to see these talented young designers. My role has been even more enjoyable than I expected it to be.”Kent \u0026amp Curwen was founded in 1926 by Kent and Dorothy Curwen, who were Savile Row tailors. It has been in the fashion spotlight since 2015, when Beckham became majority owner. Its previous collaborations have included the photographer Perry Ogden and rock band the Stone Roses.Other highlights from the men’s shows on Sunday included Chalayan, Cottweiler and new talent at Fashion East. LFW men’s continues on Monday with shows including Craig Green and A-Cold-Wall*."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/62ef8082bdc524ea8a042ddba58135af94fecefb/0_86_1525_915/master/1525.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=82afa2e67dc86b4252361b5172f77a63","title":"disney spent 100m making the new mary poppins in the uk","story":"Sequel has already grossed £30m, bring some Christmas cheer to Britain’s box officesDisney has revealed it spent nearly £100m making Mary Poppins Returns, the sequel to the 1964 classic starring Julie Andrews, in Britain.The film, with Emily Blunt playing the eponymous nanny, brought some Christmas cheer to the British box office grossing £30m since it was released two weeks ago. London is also a star in the film, with some of the capital’s most famous landmarks used as backdrops for key scenes. The exterior of the Bank of England was used for the offices of the villainous banker, played by Colin Firth, and the finale of the movie takes place on the Big Ben clock tower.It was made at Shepperton Studios in Surrey last year and Disney has shone a spotlight on its finances. Movie budgets are usually a closely guarded secret as the studios don’t have to report the budgets for them. However, the costs of movies filmed in Britain are consolidated in single companies which file publicly available accounts.The production companies usually have code names to stop them raising attention when filing for permits to film off-site. Mary Poppins Returns was made by the Cherry Tree Lane Productions – named after the address where Poppins works – which is ultimately owned by Disney. Its accounts for the 17 months to the end of June 2017 show that it had total costs of £98.6m and state that “the estimated final cost was forecast to be in excess of the budget”.Key costs include equipment hire, travel and props makers. Film-making also drives employment and the accounts show that it spent £9.6m on staff. The average number of employees was 158, not including the self-employed staff who make up the vast majority of personnel on a film shoot.Several other high-profile updates to Disney’s classic catalogue of movies have been made in Britain. Guy Ritchie filmed an upcoming live-action remake of Aladdin at Longcross Studios in Surrey and Tim Burton used Pinewood in Buckinghamshire as a base for Dumbo, which is also due next year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2611d0d52d40b7d7b2bab960ad7c799ee2541201/0_128_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a414992c4f3b280339f8dc48991edf5f","title":"golden globes 2019 bohemian rhapsody green book","story":"The Queen biopic and the road trip comedy won the major film awards while Olivia Colman and Christian Bale led a strong night for British talentThe Freddie Mercury biopic Bohemian Rhapsody and the fact-based comedy Green Book won major film awards at the 76th annual Golden Globes in a night that also saw a strong showing for British talent.Though his Spanish-language epic wasn’t eligible for inclusion in either main category, Alfonso Cuarón’s Roma was awarded best foreign language film, while the director-writer-cinematographer bested Bradley Cooper and Spike Lee to take home the prize for best director.It was a victorious evening for British entertainers, with the stars of The Favourite, Vice, The Bodyguard, and A Very English Scandal recognized for their achievements in film and television. With wins for Roma, The Bodyguard, and the Michael Douglas-helmed comedy The Kominsky Method, Netflix will also be pleased with its haul.But as the dead sprint to the Oscars heats up, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association’s decision to honor Green Book and Bohemian Rhapsody with the evening’s two pre-eminent awards is sure to earn derision, both films having been accused by audiences and critics alike of handling subjects like race and sexuality in a reductive and regressive manner. Before he was fired during production, the latter film was partially directed by Bryan Singer, who has been accused of sexual assault.Held at the Beverly Hilton and hosted by Andy Samberg and Sandra Oh, the 2019 Globes proved a somewhat less rousing affair than last year’s ceremony, when Oprah Winfrey gave an affecting speech that set off rumors of a potential 2020 run for the presidency, and celebrities wore all black and Time’s Up pins to honor the victims of sexual abuse.But in the absence of Oprah and, for the most part, overt references to the president or contemporary hot-button issues, Oh and Samberg approached their co-hosting duties with a certain tongue-in-cheek wit, calling out various celebrities not for their alleged indiscretions but for their good looks or awards season spoils: “You’re hot,” they told Bradley Cooper “Jacked AF”, they said of Black Panther’s Michael B Jordan, while Oh told the twice-nominated (and twice-losing) Amy Adams to “save some for the rest of us”.Oh, however, would get her due, taking home the competitive award for best actress in a drama series for her stellar work in the cat-and-mouse thriller Killing Eve. The host triumphed over a murderer’s row of gifted contenders, including Julia Roberts, nominated for Homecoming Elisabeth Moss, for The Handmaid’s Tale and Keri Russell, for The Americans.While Samberg and Oh emceed the ceremony with a refreshing dose of levity, the Killing Eve star did take a moment to acknowledge the considerable ersity amongst the show’s nominees. “I wanted to be here to look out into this audience and witness this moment of change,” she said, noting lucrative box office returns for minority-led films like Black Panther and Crazy Rich Asians. “I’m not fooling myself. Next year could be different and probably will be. But this moment is real, because I see you.”The Americans earned a surprising and indisputably well-deserved win in best drama series, a category for which the Soviet spy drama, which just completed its six-season run, had never before been nominated despite deep and consistent reserves of love among television critics. Along with Russell, the show’s lead Matthew Rhys was nominated for best actor in a drama series but lost out to Richard Madden of The Bodyguard, the smash hit six-part BBC series that notched the network its highest viewing figures in a decade.In the drama acting categories, Glenn Close beat out Lady Gaga, Nicole Kidman, Melissa McCarthy, and Rosamund Pike for her powerful turn in The Wife, an adaptation of the Meg Wolitzer novel of the same name. Close’s speech, a galvanizing and heartfelt ode to women following their dreams, drew the night’s biggest applause, with the 13-time Globe nominee drawing parallels to her character’s struggle for recognition and fulfillment vis-à-vis her Nobel Prize-winning husband .“It was called The Wife … that’s why it took 14 years to get made,” said Close, who’s now well-positioned to win her first Oscar at next month’s Academy awards. “We are women and nurturers, we have our children, and our husband’s if we are lucky enough, our partners, whoever. But we have to find personal fulfillment. We have to follow our dreams.”Meanwhile, Bohemian Rhapsody’s Rami Malek upset Bradley Cooper to win best actor in a drama, making sure the star and director of A Star is Born, which was nominated for five awards on the evening and won one (best original song), went home with few spoils.Christian Bale, undoubtedly buoyed by the headline-making physical metamorphosis he underwent for his role as Dick Cheney in Vice, won best actor in a comedy ormusical, cheekily thanking Satan for providing him with inspiration for the role of the former US vice president. Olivia Colman won best actress in a comedy or musical for her tragicomic turn in Yorgos Lanthimos’ period piece The Favourite, whose supporting players Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz were nominated for best supporting actress. Another British success came for Ben Whishaw for his portrayal of Norman Scott in A Very British Scandal.Stone and Weisz, though, were beat out by Regina King, who won best supporting actress for her role in Barry Jenkins’ James Baldwin adaptation If Beale Street Could Talk. King defied the ceremony’s orchestral exit music to make an appeal for gender equality in Hollywood.The Marvelous Mrs Maisel, a breakout hit for Amazon and the darling of last year’s Globes, was upset by The Kominsky Method in the category of best comedy series, although Maisel’s star Rachel Brosnahan did notch her second consecutive win for best lead actress in a comedy series, beating out Alison Brie and Debra Messing. “Thank you to our incredible village it takes to make this show,” said Brosnahan, also an Emmy award winner in 2018. “And our village is a matriarchy.” Other television victors included a pair of Patricias: Arquette, for her lead actress work in the limited series Escape at Dannemora, and Clarkson, for her supporting work in Sharp Objects.Michael Douglas, who plays the titular Sandy Kominsky in the Chuck Lorre-created Netflix series, won best actor in a comedy series, adding a fourth Golden Globe to his well-decorated mantle, which includes the Cecile B DeMille lifetime achievement award given to him in 2004. This year, that honor was bestowed upon Jeff Bridges, who took the stage in full “the Dude” mode, channeling Lebowski with a series of free-associative wise-cracks about his prolific film career, punctuating his sentences with the character’s famous addendum: “man”.Spider-Man: Into the Spider-verse won the award for best animated feature film, beating out Ralph Breaks the Internet and Wes Anderson’s Isle of Dogs. Elsewhere, the Neil Armstrong space odyssey First Man was honored for its Justin Hurwitz-composed score The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story for best limited series and Mahershala Ali for best supporting actor for his portrayal of the pianist Don Shirley in Green Book, the true story of an unlikely friendship between a black and a white man in the 1960s American South, which also won best screenplay.This year’s awards also marked the debut of a non-competitive honor for career achievement in television, named for Carol Burnett, also the award’s inaugural recipient. Burnett, whose visionary variety show The Carol Burnett Show won eight Golden Globe and 25 Emmy Awards over its 11-season run, was introduced by Steve Carell, who called her “one of the most revered, respected, and well-liked people in show business”.Burnett was greeted with rapturous applause by the Globes audience. “I’m really gobsmacked by this,” said the comic pioneer, who dedicated the award “to all those who share the love I have for television”, capping her speech with her celebrated ear-tug gesture, a nod to the grandmother who raised her."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2b399df1e9024bb81ad27cbcbad02704e2ce917b/0_303_5342_3205/master/5342.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bda280772d219cdbe4f7f0bcdb734491","title":"golden globes 2019 live latest news red carpet winners list speeches","story":"The Queen biopic and the road trip comedy took top prizes while Olivia Colman, Christian Bale and Richard Madden made it a strong night for British talentBefore the night had began, many predicted that the 76th Golden Globes ceremony would be dominated by a film about a singer with ambitious dreams. Now, as the night ends, no one expected it would be Bohemian Rhapsody.The Lady GagaBradley Cooper remake of A Star is Born is by no means a film that deserved to win big tonight but it seemed so suited for the Globes and ultimately it was handed the best original song award while losing out on best drama to the critically savaged Queen biopic.It was a shock finale to a night that offered a number of surprises. While it wasn’t that shocking to see crowd-pleasing yet problematic comedy Green Book win big, no one expected quite so much from Netflix comedy The Kominsky Method or that Richard Madden and Patricia Arquette would win in categories stuffed with big name talent.Brits did well across the board and going into the Oscars it’s looking like Olivia Colman will be facing off against Glenn Close for best actress while Rami Malek could provide another upset. Will the Bryan Singer controversy finally catch up with the film? Nominations will be out soon but it’s another wild and unpredictable Oscar race, as hard to call as who will host the damn thing. For now, that’s all from us but there will be further analysis in the AM.Here’s a full wrap of tonight’s madness:And we interviewed Globe winner Glenn Close at the very start of The Wife’s rollout back in 2017Here’s a bit more background on Green Book, which picked up three major awards tonight, including best motion picture - musical or comedySomething to look forward to...While Jeff Bridges’ speech was one of the night’s barmiest:And in case you haven’t seen it yet, Olivia Colman’s speech was one of the night’s most genuine moments:It’s going to be an interesting obstacle course for those involved with both Green Book and Bohemian Rhapsody from now until the Oscars with both facing very different controversies.In the press room, Green Book producer Octavia Spencer was asked about the response from the real Don Shirley’s familyDid it happen again?While many are upset with Green Book and Bohemian Rhapsody winning best picture, comedy and drama respectively, it’s worth remembering that the Globes often rewards films that don’t end up winning the best picture Oscar.Last year saw Three Billboards and Lady Bird win while The Shape of Water won at the Oscars and while Moonlight might have won both the year before, 2016 saw The Revenant and The Martian coming out on top only for Spotlight to win an Oscar. So in other words, there’s still hope.In case you want to relive this harrowing night then here’s the full list of winners.Finally, a Bird Box joke that works.There are some thoughts about a Bryan Singer movie winning top honours tonight.Huh? The Queen drama that was mostly, and rightfully, loathed by critics has won the night’s biggest award in a shock finale. Quite how it beat out A Star is Born, which seemed destined to win, is a head-scratcher – and the far more deserving Black Panther as well. This is a real surprise and they’re hard to come by in this season. Noticeably no reference to Bryan Singer in the speech yet again ...Beating out Bradley Cooper, who many thought would win, is Rami Malek, who was undoubtedly the best thing about the rather underwhelming Queen biopic.Malek is an intense speech-giver and interestingly, reassuringly after thanking everyone involved in the film, he decided not to thank the director, Bryan Singer, who has been accused of sexual assault. And now for the big one ...And now this picture means even moreHere’s the moment that Maya Rudolph propsed to Amy Poehler in case you haven’t seen it yetIt felt like Lady Gaga might scoop in here and win, especially given how much the Globes loves her, but a nice semi-surprise to see Glenn Close win for her powerful performance in The Wife.It’s a small film and Close’s speech is easily the night’s most effective. She talks about women needing to find personal fulfillment outside of what they achieve in the home or in a marriage, referencing her mother who gave so much of herself to her husband without looking out for herself. It’s tearful and rousing and it would take a bullet train to derail her chances of winning the Oscar as well."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c0ef65a86d2d0138f92cf4723520995268bac15/0_337_4900_2939/master/4900.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a3725c0f2792a50a5f51a2fbabf80c00","title":"nigel slater pie recipes beef cauliflower","story":"Whether it’s topped with mash, pastry or crisped roast veg, nothing pleases like digging deep into a pie to reveal its hidden treasureIt has been a full week since the New Year’s resolutions, so I think it’s safe to talk about pie. The crust, be it pastry, mashed vegetables or toasted breadcrumbs, is there to protect the filling from scorching in the oven and to provide substance. The crust is also there to hold a secret. Dig down through the depths of potato, parsnip or pastry and you will find treasure to savour – pieces of lamb with root vegetables and thyme minced beef with soft onions and red wine, or perhaps golden smoked haddock with mussels and prawns. I chose to top the one I made this week, a rather nostalgic filling of beef, celery and thyme with frills of tight young kale leaves, with a 50:50 mash of Maris Pipers and Jersusalem artichokes.Later in the week I capped a smooth purée of roast cauliflower, rosemary and cream with more florets of toasted cauli. The crust this time was on the bottom, a crisp pastry case with pecorino. The topping of golden cauliflower curds allowed it to (just) sneak in under the title of pie. I am not sure whether it matters if your crust is as crisp as puff pastry or as soft as a roasted brassica, what matters is that you have your filling hidden. A delicious surprise as you dig in.I know I go on about it, but preheating a baking sheet is a thoroughly sound idea, allowing the base of your pastry case to cook crisply.Serves 6For the pastry:plain flour 150gbutter 75gpecorino 35g, gratedegg yolk 1iced water a little For the filling:cauliflowers 2, largerosemary 6 sprigsolive oil 8 tbspdouble cream 250mlYou will also need a 22cm diameter tart tin with a removable baseMake the pastry first. Put the flour and butter in a food processor and reduce to fine crumbs. Add the pecorino and egg yolk and blend briefly, then introduce enough water (about 2-3 tbsp) to bring to a soft rollable dough. With lightly floured hands, pat the dough into a ball then cover and chill in the fridge for 30 minutes.Set the oven at 200Cgas mark 6 and place a metal sheet on the middle shelf.Trim the leaves from the cauliflowers. Remove the florets, slicing the crown from each (leave about a centimetre of stalk on each), and put them in a mixing bowl. Reserve all the trimmings, you will use them in the filling.Roughly chop the stalks and trimmings and put them in a bowl. Pull the needles from the rosemary stems and ide equally between each bowl. Pour half of the oil into each bowl, season with salt and black pepper and toss gently to coat the florets and trimmings.Tip the trimmings into a small roasting tin, the florets into another and roast both for about 45 minutes, until tender and lightly toasted. Remove and set aside. Blend the stalks and trimmings in a food processor or blender until smooth.Remove the pastry from the fridge, roll out and line the tart tin. Fill with foil and baking beans, place on the heated baking sheet and cook in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Lift out the baking beans and foil, then return the tart case to the oven for 5-7 minutes until dry to the touch.Lower the oven to 180Cgas mark 4. Fill the tart with the creamed cauliflower trimmings, then scatter the roasted florets over the surface, brushing them with any oil form the roasting tins. Bake for a further 10 minutes then serve.It is worth dotting some bits of butter on top of the mash, or even furrowing it with a fork, like a ploughed field, if you want to create a crisp outer crust.Serves 4For the filling:olive oil 3 tbspbeef 500g, dicedonions 3, mediumcelery 2 sticksplain flour 2 heaped tbsp bay leaves 3thyme 6 bushy sprigsbeef stock 1 litre, hot kale 75g, picked from its stalksFor the mash:floury potatoes 500gJerusalem artichokes 450gbutter 25gWarm the oil in a deep casserole over a moderately high heat, add the cubes of beef and let them brown evenly, turning them over in the pan as necessary. While the meat browns, peel and roughly chop the onions. Transfer the meat to a dish, then add the onions to the pan.Roughly chop the celery. When the onions are golden, add to the celery and continue cooking for 3 or 4 minutes without letting the celery brown. Stir in the flour, and brown lightly, then the bay leaves and thyme sprigs, pour in the hot stock and bring to the boil.Lower the heat so the liquid simmers gently. Partially cover with a lid and then leave for an hour, stirring occasionally.For the mash, peel and boil the potatoes in deep, lightly salted water, then do the same with the artichokes. Don’t be tempted to cook them in the same pan.Boil another pan of water, add the kale leaves, remove after 2 minutes and refresh in a bowl of iced water.Drain the potatoes and artichokes as each becomes tender, add one to the other then crush with a vegetable masher.

Without research and development, the coffee sector will need up to 180m more bags of coffee in 2050 than we are likely to have.”To address this, the organisation is undertaking the international multi-location variety trial, testing 35 coffee types across 23 countries to measure performance in different climates – including in regions not typically associated with coffee production, such as Australia.In what could be Australia’s most significant contribution to coffee since the flat white, scientists at Southern Cross University will be testing 20 “climate-resistant” varieties.Prof Graham King, the director of plant science at SCU, says that in January up to 900 plants will be planted at the tropical fruit research station in Alstonville, northern New South Wales. According to King, climate change is expected to devastate the world’s major coffee-growing regions through extreme weather and by increasing attacks by crop pests and diseases.“Many current mountainous tropical production areas of the world are likely to become untenable for coffee as climate change progresses,” he says. “Within Australia we currently have the benefit of no coffee rust or cherry borer, or other major pests and disease. This is quite unique compared with most production areas of the world.”Droughts and frequent storms have led to Costa Rican farmers giving up coffee for orange plantations. Outside Latin America, the coffee berry borer (Hypothenemus hampei) – which used to only appear at a maximum altitude of 1,500 metres above sea level – is being found above this limit, thanks to unseasonably hot conditions and higher rainfall on plantations from Tanzania to Indonesia. On Mount Kilimanjaro plantations, the beetle is now found 300 metres higher than last century.Not only is Australia free of these blights, says King, but climate change could open up more Australian regions for growing coffee cherries owing to reduced frost damage in winter.King warns that the trial will need at least five years to reap results, but funding from the federal government-funded AgriFutures Australia runs out in May. He says it has offered “pretty poor engagement” on the issue.AgriFutures’ business development manager, Duncan Farquhar, says the coffee sector has been provided with funding for developing new varieties since 2014. “Emerging industries, including the coffee industry” have been invited to compete for a new round of funding, he says.An agronomist and coffee industry adviser, David Peasley, says rising temperatures could hurt coffee growing in north Queensland but agrees that in subtropical coffee growing regions they could help. He cautions that climate change could leave Australian plantations more vulnerable to pests and diseases and that extreme weather events will present a challenge.Indeed, without hardier varieties, Australian growers may find climate change brings more challenges than benefits. A grower, Zeta Grealy, says conditions have become increasingly difficult since she created her Zeta’s Coffee plantation on the border of NSW and Queensland in 1994.“Our crop actually didn’t happen this time, we had overripe cherries and completely green cherries, flowers on the tree – not what we want. So we decided to strip the trees and get them ready for next year.”The crop was down to 19kg from a typical year of about a tonne. Grealy is hopeful that the trials lead to access to varieties that can cope with lower rainfall.World Coffee Research is encouraging the industry to do its bit to safeguard the crop’s global future by contributing to its Checkoff program, in which roasters can donate up to 0.20 cents a kilogram of green coffee from participating suppliers to help fund initiatives such as the global trial.Supporters include Single O’s director of coffee, Wendy De Jong, whose company will be the first roaster to import a full container of “future-friendly” coffees to Australia.Fairtrade Australia’s chief executive, Molly Harriss Olson, welcomes research into hardier varieties, noting that by 2080 wild coffee – a vital bedrock of genetic ersity for developing new varieties – could become extinct. She notes that expanding Australian plantations won’t prevent climate change’s impact on coffee growers in other countries.“More frequent and severe drought is associated with a deep and disturbing sense of failure, loss, powerlessness, heightened anxiety, stress, depression and an increased suicide rate among farmers,” she says.Harriss Olson urged coffee consumers to educate themselves about the challenges facing growers, seek out brands that are both carbon-neutral and help producers to adapt to a changing climate, and urge businesses and governments to pursue a carbon-neutral economy.“It’s crucial that we all take action now,” she says. “Because the future of coffee, one of the world’s favourite commodities, and the livelihood and wellbeing of millions of coffee farmers, workers and their families is at stake.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/515c1c2a9134545fc990f97d1ba1c2e57e0b215d/0_157_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0a85aff319bc689746390ed593ff08a5","title":"fa cup third round serves up shocks as barnet oldham newport shine","story":"Darren Currie, the Barnet caretaker manager, praised the fearlessness of his side after they provided the biggest shock of the day in the FA Cup to reach the fourth round by beating Sheffield United at Bramall Lane.The National League side will be the lowest-ranked team in Monday’s draw after a famous 1-0 victory thanks to a first-half penalty by Shaquile Coulthirst and will be joined by Oldham Athletic and Newport County in the hat after both overcame Premier League opposition in the form of Fulham and Leicester respectively, with the Welsh club recording a victory over top-flight opposition for the first time since 1964.But for Currie, the nephew of the former England midfielder, Tony, who is now a director at the Championship club, it was a day to remember after he was handed the manager’s job on a temporary basis only last month.“I’ve been fortunate to have this tie and have it personal to me and now I hope the boys get something they feel is a suitable reward for their efforts,” Currie said. “As soon as I went in the changing room the boys decided to cover me with a bucket of water. I’m so proud they’ve been brilliant for me the way they performed. I was proud of them in the two previous games but this takes it to a whole new level.”Oldham, who faced opponents who were 59 places ahead of them in the league pyramid, came from behind to defeat Fulham thanks to Callum Lang’s late winner. “It means a lot to me and my family. We’re all Oldham people,” said the caretaker manager, Pete Wild. “We’re from a small town overshadowed by big neighbours and I’m so proud to give something back.”Sheffield United came unstuck after making 10 changes for the third-round tie, while Currie named the same team that drew with Boreham Wood on New Year’s Day. “I don’t really buy into all that resting, if they are tired, they can go to bed early,” Currie added. “I’m absolutely thrilled with the result but I don’t want to get too carried away. We will become the favourite when we host Dorchester next week in the FA Trophy so it’s straight back down to earth.”A seething Chris Wilder ripped into his players after defeat, accusing them of complacency. “I’ve just said to the boys: ‘Don’t go out through the main entrance, you don’t deserve to go out of the main entrance. Try and find a door to sneak out of.’ Because that’s what the performance was. It was one of arrogance it was off-plan, doing what they wanted to.“The support that our fans gave to the Barnet players was first-class and fully deserved, but they should have booed our own players louder. I knew Barnet would bring their A game to the table, we told the players they would be up for it and raise their game. I should imagine the Barnet players are getting back on the coach are possibly saying: ‘How the hell are they third in the ision?’ And what I will say, well, we are third because none of those players that played today are going to force their way into the first team.”The Newport manager, Michael Flynn, added: “It’s almost Roy of the Rovers stuff, I can’t believe it. It’s the first time I’ve beaten a Premier League club as a manager so it’s one I’ll never forget. I’ll have a few drinks with the wife tonight. It’s about being with the people who support you and are with you when times are bad as well, and my wife does that for me.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83650305c8acd0779973f58fde3cd27ea7fa24a2/0_212_5100_3059/master/5100.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=85eb47b5b6c5d2ae9374ca1660a4ec9f","title":"newport county leicester city fa cup match report","story":"The magic of the FA Cup is alive and well in this corner of south Wales. Newport County, 74 places below Leicester City on the league ladder, served up a giantkilling that will be talked about for years to come in these parts as Jamille Matt and Pádraig Amond scored the goals that inflicted a humiliating defeat on Claude Puel’s side.There were wild scenes at the final whistle as Newport celebrated their first victory over top-flight opposition in the FA Cup since 1964. Michael Flynn, the Newport manager, was walking around the pitch with his son on his shoulders come the end and there was a mixture of jubilation and disbelief among the home supporters as they departed with a spring in their step.Rachid Ghezzal had threatened to spoil the party when he equalised with eight minutes remaining – the same point Harry Kane scored here last season to earn Tottenham Hotspur a 1-1 draw in the fourth round – but Newport were determined that history would not repeat itself on this occasion.Marc Albrighton gave the League Two club a helping hand in more ways than one. The Leicester winger raised his arm, presumably to protect himself, when Vashon Neufville crossed from the left and the referee, Chris Kavanagh, immediately pointed to the spot. Amond, Newport’s leading scorer, was the calmest man in the stadium as he coolly dispatched his penalty past Danny Ward.What a chastening experience for Leicester and in particular Puel, who seems to be forever taking one step forward and two back. His decision to field an understrength team in the Carabao Cup against Manchester City last month went down badly and the Frenchman left himself open to further criticism by making seven changes here. Jamie Vardy was nowhere to be seen and seasoned watchers will not be surprised to learn that Leicester looked toothless up front without him.At the same time Puel was entitled to believe there was more than enough talent on the pitch to overcome a side currently sitting 13th in League Two. “I think we had a good team, with eight who had won the title with Leicester and a lot of experienced players and quality on the pitch,” Leicester’s manager said. “I don’t want to look for excuses about this.Flynn, not surprisingly, was beaming. “It hasn’t really sunk in yet. I feel extremely proud, it’s huge for me, the football club, the community, all the fans and the players. We’ve beaten a very good Premier League team. We couldn’t beat Stevenage who had 10 men on New Year’s Day. It’s crazy how the players can raise their levels and keep concentrating for 95 minutes against a team that is seventh in the Premier League.”This was classic third-round territory in so many ways. Rodney Parade was packed to the rafters, there were rugby markings on a pitch that looked a little bare in places, and the atmosphere crackled under the lights as the home supporters greeted every header, block and tackle with huge cheers. Throw a weakened Leicester team into the mix and an early Newport goal, and all the ingredients were there for an upset.Matt’s opener was a terrific goal. Robbie Willmott was the architect with a lovely piece of wing play as he skipped past Christian Fuchs before delivering a deep cross that Matt met with a towering header after losing Wes Morgan. Shinji Okazaki squandered a golden chance to level when he headed wide from inside the six-yard box and Albrighton saw a goalbound shot deflected over the bar after some brilliant last-ditch defending, but Leicester generally looked ragged and flat in the opening 45 minutes. Indeed, Matt, stretching to reach Amond’s cross, came close to doubling Newport’s lead.The pattern of the game changed in the second half as Puel introduced James Maddison and Leicester pinned Newport back. Albrighton clipped the top of the crossbar, Kelechi Iheanacho, who was hugely disappointing, saw his header saved and later thrashed a volley wide. Newport’s brave resistance was finally broken when Ghezzal thumped a wonderful 20-yard shot into the top corner.The real drama was still to come, however, as Amond stroked home from the spot to send Newport into the fourth round. “I want Liverpool home or away,” Flynn added."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cebd92361aec55b24ed38b612fd6d1a8bd170b96/133_0_4235_2541/master/4235.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e025b3b22a3891f12e2d6d5d033918b5","title":"seven ways to dodge a cold or recover faster","story":"Blocked nose, watering eyes, a sore throat – the signs of a cold are all too familiar. Here are seven ways to dodge the lurgy, or shrug it off soonerStudies have suggested that being active can help prevent respiratory infections, but cutting out smoking, reducing alcohol intake and keeping to a healthy diet also help. “Plenty of exercise, good nutrition – keep yourself fit and healthy – and that will keep your immune system strong,” says Peter Barlow, associate professor of immunology and infection at Edinburgh Napier University.Sleep is critical for health, says Aric Prather, associate professor in psychiatry at University of California, San Francisco. In a study published in 2013, Prather and colleagues provided 164 iniduals with sleep trackers and sleep diaries, exposed them to the common cold and then quarantined them in a hotel for monitoring. After taking into account factors including age, sex, smoking habits and alcohol consumption, the team found that sleep was a factor in who fell ill. “We found that people who get less than six hours of sleep on average are about four times more likely to get the cold than people who sleep more than seven hours,” says Prather.There are about 160 types of rhinovirus, which are behind the majority of common colds, says Barlow: “Anything you can do to avoid exposing yourself to that virus will reduce your chances of catching it.” He says many health agencies advise people to wash hands frequently with soap and water, to avoid touching nose, eyes and mouth with dirty hands, and to stay away from people who are sick.Prof Mieke van Driel, head of primary care and general practice at the University of Queensland, says children get several colds a year because their immune systems are still developing – and they tend to pass the colds on. “Parents of young children are at higher risk than people who don’t get in touch with children a lot, and so staying away from them is probably a good thing.”Presenteeism is on the rise – but if you are oozing snot you may want to consider having a duvet day. “If you are constantly coughing and sneezing, it is probably a good idea not to be around other people, spreading the cold,” says Van Driel.In a recent study, Van Driel and colleagues looked at whether there are any remedies that help with nasal symptoms. For many treatments, the results were inconclusive, but decongestants – either on their own, or with painkillers or antihistamines – appear to help adults. (For young children, nasal irrigation is better.) However, there is little evidence that many popular remedies, such as echinacea and vitamin C, can prevent or treat a cold – plus they can be expensive. “You might as well just take a hot toddy, or a hot lemon and a bit of honey,” says Van Driel. One medicine to avoid, she adds, are antibiotics, which “really don’t work”. Unnecessary prescription is one of the factors fuelling the current antibiotic-resistance crisis.“The immune system in a healthy person is perfectly capable of dealing with colds and most viruses,” says Van Driel. “The cold virus is a benign, self-limiting disease. It is annoying, but it is self-limiting.” She adds that we should have confidence in our bodies to manage pathogens – in the vast majority of cases, even if we do nothing, we will get better."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4dde86cbffe41f076b268eada55715279aa68626/0_316_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e4f8127656b2b71133dd9428bf8cd05","title":"uk must have second eu referendum chris patten tory","story":"Declaration will make him latest Tory grandee to emerge as supporter of People’s VoteChris Patten, the former Conservative party chairman, is to declare support for a second referendum on the UK’s membership of the EU.The last British governor of Hong Kong will declare that a new public vote may be the only and the best way to prevent an act of “national self-harm” in the growing crisis over Brexit.The declaration makes him the latest Tory grandee to emerge as a supporter of the People’s Vote campaign.Patten, who masterminded John Major’s general election victory in 1992, has previously opposed referendums as “fundamentally undemocratic”.On Monday, he will tell an audience at a neighbourhood centre in south London that he has changed his mind since David Cameron’s historic decision to hold the EU referendum in 2016.“The whole sorry shambles began with a decision to call a referendum in order to try to manage the English nationalist right wing of the Conservative party.“It may be that we can only end this isive and impoverishing argument by holding another referendum. That may prove to be the only and the best way for Britain to avoid an act of self-harm that would betray the aspirations of so many – not least the younger citizens of this country,” he said.Speaking alongside Sam Gyimah, who resigned as universities minister last month over the government’s Brexit plan, Lord Patten will say that the government’s threat of a no-deal Brexit if it cannot get its way is an empty one.He will say: “I don’t believe that the prime minister or many members of her cabinet think that this would be remotely responsible. It would be very damaging. These are similar to the tactics made famous by Dr Strangelove: if you threaten that something crazy will happen, your opponents will back down.”Patten will say that further efforts to seek a compromise on the Irish backstop are unlikely to succeed. “No amount of verbal guff can deal with the real issue of the backstop. It is meant to be temporary. However you define that word, its temporary nature can only end when the 27 members of the EU agree this with the United Kingdom.“In other words, the EU has the decisive say on what happens: that is called ‘taking back control’.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f8f12c0c6cc532b91981c4b956ce56acea4b6590/0_0_5000_2878/master/5000.jpg?width=660\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6cab99a1a94ebccd253086ef77af06e5 660w","title":"caroline lucas mp peoples vote brexit green party","story":"In the pre-Christmas parliamentary shambles of pantomime refrains, bluster and obfuscation over Brexit, a handful of politicians stood out for crisp and persuasive performances.Along with Labour’s David Lammy and the Conservatives’ Anna Soubry, they included the sole MP from the Green party, Caroline Lucas, who won plaudits for highlighting the ways in which Theresa May had “turned faith-breaking into a new art form”.And, to cheers and applause during Channel 4’s television debate last month, the Brighton MP pithily articulated the case for a people’s vote on the realities of Brexit. “I would always prefer to back a @UKLabour voice over anyone else but have to say @CarolineLucas absolutely owned the #c4brexit debate,” tweeted Alastair Campbell.However, the praise is small comfort for Lucas. “Parliament has made itself a laughing stock, frankly,” she told the Observer. “Those scenes before Christmas were deeply depressing. We have a political leadership that’s chronically unable to lead. And, sadly, we’ve probably got to rock bottom in terms of the external perception of parliament’s ability to navigate a way through this – which is another reason to go back to the people.”Lucas, 58, is a leading advocate for a second referendum and will be a key speaker at The Convention, a gathering to consider the complex issues surrounding a potential second referendum, in central London on Friday. Its organisers say it will draw on new voices and new thinking, and will be run by, and for, young people.In an interview in a crowded cafe in Brighton, Lucas said: “There is a big vacuum left by the Labour leadership, which I think is incredibly disappointing. On many issues, Jeremy Corbyn and I are in agreement. But on this, I think he’s got it wrong, he’s letting people down and he’s letting his own party down.”“It’s the option that is garnering more and more support in parliament, literally by the day, with an increasing number of Conservatives coming out for it as well. But unless the Labour frontbench swings behind it, it won’t get a majority – and that’s what makes Corbyn’s position so absolutely critical.”Some young people who had deserted the Greens “to flock to Corbyn with real hope for a different kind of politics” were now returning to her party’s fold, she said. “Some are now coming back to us because they’ve been so disappointed that there’s no political leadership coming from Corbyn on what is pretty much a national emergency.”The depth of the crisis meant politicians should put the country’s interest above party politics. “The only responsible thing to do is to work with others around shared objectives. It doesn’t mean I’m close to Anna Soubry on 100 other issues, such as the environment or social justice, but on this one issue I think we’d be letting down the people of this country if we didn’t try to work together for the common good.“I think that’s one of the few positives that have come out of this – actually recognising that it is possible to work on particular issues cross-party, and that doesn’t mean that you’ve sold out any of your policies, it just means you recognise the overwhelming threat facing this country, and you put that first.”But, she insists, she and others in the People’s Vote campaign were not trying to re-run the 2016 referendum, but to offer voters a chance to review their choice in the light of information that was not available last time around.“There’s a carpentry saying, ‘measure twice, cut once’. When you’re going to do something that’s very difficult to reverse, just double-check. The idea of crashing out of the EU with no deal was never discussed in the referendum campaign, and every single Brexit option will make the country poorer.“So it’s very hard for MPs to vote without double-checking on a set of policies that will make their constituents worse off. Many MPs in some of those northern constituencies, like Anna Turley in Redcar, are supporting a people’s vote on the grounds that it’s right for their constituents to have the opportunity to look at new information and check they’re happy. And, if they are, then Brexit goes ahead.”Lucas has been travelling around the country, visiting pro-Brexit areas. “People who voted to leave did us all a service, in a sense, by giving the establishment a bloody good kicking. To the extent that many of them voted to leave because they felt the status quo in this country is intolerable, they were absolutely right.“These are communities that have proud histories but which have been hollowed out by de-industrialisation, decades of neglect, compounded by ideologically driven assaults on national and local public services in the name of austerity.“But the tragedy of this was that Brexit was sold as a way of addressing those very real grievances and yet everything we have learned since has reinforced the sense that Brexit would actually make all that worse.“I’m not interested in simply trying to reverse the vote in a way that doesn’t tackle the causes of Brexit.”If there were a second referendum, the campaign in favour of staying in the EU should be run by young people rather than establishment figures, she said.“That’s one of the positive things that have happened in the past year or 18 months: the emergence of young people running campaigns such as Our Future Our Choice. They are going to be absolutely crucial.“A new campaign around a second referendum has to be about a different kind of future – a hopeful, positive vision of how EU membership is crucial for environmental protection, human rights, labour standards and how we can extend the EU project to answer some of the challenges we face today. It’s not about preserving an economic status quo.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e2122806ba475dda0f8747ea96dad2db964f596/0_0_3240_1944/master/3240.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=abbe986e1948790857c43f3b71f53742","title":"theresa may pleads for eu to give ground brexit deal","story":"Downing Street insists new compromises can be won from Europe to ensure passage of PM’s planTheresa May is preparing to make another desperate plea to EU leaders to offer a concession on the Irish backstop as she attempts to win over Brexiters who have vowed to vote down the government’s deal.The prime minister on Sunday promised to hold the meaningful vote in parliament in the week beginning 14 January despite growing opposition from Conservative backbenchers and the Democratic Unionist party, whose votes are required to push the deal through parliament.As MPs prepare to return to Westminster with the crucial Commons vote looming on the withdrawal agreement, Downing Street insisted that new compromises could still be won from Europe that would ensure the safe passage of May’s plan.The hope of new developments came as opposition to the prime minister’s deal hardened. The hurdles facing May include:• Brexiters say the government faces a disaster if it fails to ditch the current deal, with DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds describing the Irish backstop as “toxic”.• EU sources say talks to be held in Dublin on Tuesday between Leo Varadkar and Germany’s foreign minister, Heiko Maas, will not seek to reopen negotiations over the 585-page withdrawal agreement.• Senior MPs including Yvette Cooper and Nicky Morgan are launching a parliamentary campaign to rewrite government legislation to block a no-deal Brexit.• Chris Patten, the former Conservative Party chairman, called for a second referendum on the UK’s decision to leave the EU.• More than 200 MPs have signed a letter calling for Theresa May to rule out a no-deal Brexit. Tory ex-minister Dame Caroline Spelman, who organised the letter with Labour’s Jack Dromey, said the group had been invited to see the prime minister on Tuesday.In an interview on Sunday, May said the vote, which was due to be held last month and postponed, would go ahead next week, as she sought further clarification from the EU to address MPs’ concerns.She also said she would look at giving parliament a greater say in how the UK’s future relationship would be negotiated, but refused to say exactly what that might be.Asked if there had been any changes she could offer to backbenchers who were expected to vote down her deal, she told BBC1’s Andrew Marr Show: “What we will be setting out over the next few days are assurances in three areas: first are measures specific to Northern Ireland the second is a greater role for parliament as we take these negotiations forward into the next stage for our future relationship and third – and we are still working on this – is further assurances from the European Union to address the issues that have been raised.”Whitehall sources insisted that a compromise could still be found with the EU and that further planned announcements will be made this week that would win over MPs opposed to the deal. “We will be working flat out. There will be further contacts with the EU leaders. The issue of the backstop is not yet over,” the source said.In the interview, May repeatedly sidestepped questions about whether she would keep putting the deal back to MPs if it got rejected, instead saying: “If the deal is not voted on, this vote that is coming up, then actually we are going to be in uncharted territory. I don’t think anybody can say exactly what will happen in terms of the reaction we will see in parliament.”Mark Francois, the vice-chair of the hardline-Brexit European Research Group, said May’s intervention on Marr showed that the government and the EU have little to offer their critics.“As the prime minister herself once said, nothing has changed. No Conservative backbencher that I am aware of who was declared as against the deal has publicly recanted.“The PM made very clear on Marr that the vote will go ahead at this time and that is good, because if they were to pull it a second time, as well as not being in power they would effectively no longer be in office.”Conservative sources claim there are between 55 and 71 MPs who plan to vote against the deal.The DUP, whose 10 MPs are required by May to force through the deal, remain opposed. Dodds said the government must stand firm and set out a “resolute red line” to Brussels. “The coming days will show if this government is made of the right stuff,” he said.The government is also facing a serious challenge from a cross-party group of MPs seeking to block it from implementing no-deal measures without the explicit consent of parliament.Amendments tabled by Labour former cabinet minister Cooper and Tory education secretary Morgan would restrict the government’s freedom to make Brexit-related tax changes without parliamentary safeguards.The measure also has the support of Tories Sir Oliver Letwin, Nick Boles and Sarah Wollaston.The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March. May agreed her deal on the terms of the UK’s orce and the framework of future relations with the EU but it needs to pass a vote by MPs.

Play was eventually abandoned, without a ball being bowled, at 2:30pm on day five of the fourth Test.The final inspection proved a low-key end to India’s maiden Test series win in Australia, arguably the greatest achievement of Virat Kohli’s captaincy.It was the third consecutive day in Sydney that was affected by either bad light or rain but that didn’t stop a loud group of India’s fans cheering, dancing, waving flags and singing in the rain for much of the morning session.Kohli and teammates celebrated by thanking supporters who had stuck around despite the showers.Australia, asked to follow on after conceding a first innings lead of 322 runs on day four, finished 6-0 in their second innings.India, having failed to win a Test series in Australia in 11 previous attempts, ended a slump that dates back to when they were crushed by Don Bradman’s side in 1948.The tourists, led by magnificent series from batting rock Cheteshwar Pujara and superb slinger Jasprit Bumrah, achieved it in clinical fashion to expose the immense void left by Steve Smith and David Warner’s suspensions and raise questions about the potency of Australia’s attack.Kohli’s team banked wins in Adelaide and Melbourne to take an unassailable 2-1 series lead and retain the Border-Gavaskar trophy, while they took control of the final Test by amassing 622-7 declared after winning the toss.“We’ve been outplayed in some areas,” Tim Paine conceded prior to the start of play on Monday. “It’s been a hard-fought series and they deserve to take home the trophy. We’ve got to try and look at the positives.”Australia’s misfiring top six hit an unprecedented low, with Marcus Harris’s 79 in Sydney the highest score that any of them have managed in this series.Until Monday, Australia had not completed a four-Test series at home without at least one player reaching three figures."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2916ae03eae9018671cdfd62c6133eb36f80ca5d/0_203_5410_3246/master/5410.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fa8fa75a5e08508cf742eec38084b33b","title":"australia v india fourth test day five live","story":"With that, I best be off to the press conferences so I’ll leave the OBO here. Thank you so much for your company and kind words over the four Tests. We’ve had a great time bringing it to you. We’ll see you again for the ODIs next week. Bye for now from the SCG.The way the bowlers have dictated terms and dominated in the series is something I have never seen happy in Indian cricket before, especially with just four bowlers, so hats off to them the way they prepared themselves and fitness levels and mindset. They don’t look at a pitch and say there is nothing for us, they look at ways to take wickets and they dictate plans for me. it is a revelation for Indian cricket and learning for all the bowlers back home to get into that mindset early in their career. They are going to be looked up to for a long, long time at hoe. This is just a stepping stone for us. It is a young side. The most important thing for us is belief. Now we have the results to back that belief. It is just the stepping stone for greater things in the future.Firstly, I want to say I have never been more proud to be part of a team than this one right here. I think the culture we have been able to build over the last twelve months, the transition began here four years ago, we could never have thought we could be standing here winning a series here for the first time in this country. I only have one word to say that I am proud, firstly as a part of the team and to lead these players, which is an honour. They make a captain look good. It has been outstanding to see and we definitely deserve to enjoy this moment. By far (his best moment), it has to be at the top of the pile. When we won the World Cup I was the youngest member of the side so I didn’t really feel what they felt (when they were emotional) but realising what we have done here we have never done before we can really be proud of. I feel this win will give our side a different identity and can inspire a lot of kids to do the same. I want to give a special mention to Pujara. He has been outstanding in this series. He is always a guy who is willing to accept things and work on his game and he is the nicest guy around. And a special mention for Mayank Agarwal who came into the side and batted like a champion. You have to tip your hat to India. We know how hard it is to win overseas so congratulations to Virat and Ravi and their team, it is the first team they have ever done it (here) so well done to those guys. We had our chances to win the Test in Adelaide but India outplayed us in the big moment. In Perth, we played a pretty good game of cricket but in Melbourne and Sydney, we were outplayed in all departments so they deserved tow in the series. We have some talent in this team but also some talent outside the side, so we’re going to learn a hell of a lot from that. Any games you can get into guys at international level where they can learn is positive even if at the moment it is probably hard for the guys to see. The message is to keep scoring runs and that’s the currency in cricket. We know as a playing group here we have to get better and we have people outside the team putting on pressure and some guys not far from coming back. So form this gloom and doom we have some positives and a series coming up in a couple of weeks. We know cricket is a funny game and it can turn quickly. Cheteshwar Pujara is player of the match and series. And said (roughly!):It is a great feeling for all of us. We have been working really hard to win a series in this country. It has never been easy so we are really proud of the team and the way I have contributed. For me, the first hundred was special in Adelaide going one-nil up was something we were all aiming for so it was really special. As a batsman, you need to get used to pace and bounce and (playing around the world) has helped. I was very well prepared. This is definitely the best Indian team I’ve been part of. We have been playing with four bowlers and it’s never easy to do that and take 20 wickets so all credit goes to them. They’ve been remarkable. It has taken 71 years for India to win here. This is a wonderful triumph for Kohli’s men. The teams are shaking hands and then we’ll have the presentation. Stick with the OBO for comments from the captains and man of the match. Sorry that I won’t be able to get to any more emails but thanks for your notes throughout the day. Back shortly with words from Kohli, Paine and Pujara as India lift the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.The game has been officially called off and the Indians are all smiles, the small group of fans out the front of the rooms going wild in response. Fantastic stuff. The word from the broadcasters is that the game will be called off. That is  not confirmed, but is firming as the most likely outcome of the meeting five minutes from now.An email from Geoff’s dad! Andrew Lemon is a renowned historian, so I’m not surprised that he has a nugget for us on his son’s earlier topic. “Press report from July 1893: ‘During an excursion made by the Australian cricketers up the Thames, a boatman fell overboard and was rescued by Coningham, the Australian cricketer, who had a narrow escape from drowning.’Let’s give it up for Arthur Coningham! This is an extract from his Cricinfo profile:But he was undoubtedly one of the game’s more colourful figures and was once described as having “the audacity and cunning of an ape and the modesty of a phallic symbol.” His sole Test was memorable as he was no-balled, and in anger he deliberately hurled the next ball at AE Stoddart, England’s captain. On his tour to England, during which he was awarded a medal after saving a boy from drowning in the Thames, he reportedly started a fire in the outfield during one match “to keep warm”. A chemist by profession, he was made bankrupt, but once discharged became a bookmaker, carrying a satchel embossed with “Coningham the Cricketer”.But perhaps his most famous moments came in 1900 when he conducted his own (unsuccessful) defence in a orce case when he accused the private secretary of Cardinal Moran, head of the Australian Catholic Church, of adultery with his wife. The trial and retrial enthralled the public, and although Coningham lost, the priest, Francis O’Haran, was guilty. Coningham’s wife subsequently admitted that the couple’s third child was O’Haran’s. The couple emigrated to New Zealand where Coningham worked as a book salesman until being sentenced to six months in prison for fraudulent conversion. In 1912 his wife orced him after he committed adultery in a beach shed. He returned to Australia and died in a mental institution. That’s 15 minutes from now. Given the rain is so soft, I don’t reckon they will be in a position to call it off, as it would only take an hour to get back on. And I don’t believe the skippers are permitted to shake hands until 4:30pm. Interesting. We’ll see.Anyway, back to our conversations for now... “Lovely shout out to Dan Lucas there,” begins Robert McLiam Wilson, the OBO’s mighty Paris correspondent. “Running with your email cue, I just looked back at several dinks, smashes and lobs he sent over my virtual net, including this from the long-lost pre-Trump days of 2016. I had osbcenely belaboured (and perhaps vituperatively praised) him for describing a batsman as ‘coming over a bit Northern Bavaria circa 1934 there’. Dan replied with quizzical patience. ‘I’m touched someone appreciated that. Sometimes, I get the feeling I’m a couple of rehashed Simpsons jokes and a rain-affected draw away from real spiritual breakthrough.’ Epic comedy stylings.”He was so bloody smart. And I’m glad this email included a bit of his Simpsons’ fandom.Back on our previous topic with Geoff. “I am not sure if Lee Henderson is still online,” says Gervase Greene, “but the other interesting aspect of that Trumper knock was that back then when you hit a Five (what we’d now call a 6) you had to change ends. I think it was Clem Hill who recalled Trumper used to hit them at the end of the over so as to retain the strike. Which was very clever.”How is it possible that I never knew about the fivesix thing? Thanks for this! Speaking of early internet days in our newer topic (crude segue), the place where I first found likeminded cricket nerds on the net was called the Victor Trumper Cricket Board. Are there any old VTCB alumni reading on here today? There’s usually one or two of you. “Rain is good and bad,” emails Mahendra Killedar. “It saves this game but also means centuryless series for the Aussies!!” In relation to the underperforming Australian batting line-up, I can report some news from the ground: the squad for the two Sri Lanka Tests will be named on Wednesday with Justin Langer answering questions from the media after the announcement.“I am going to Vietnam in a few days,” says David Blackah. “If I am asked about sport in Australia I will say well, there is this game we play where all the players sit in a shed all day looking out the window at non-existent rain.” Yes, this might be the first time today that a brolly is actually required out there. I can understand why punters and pundits alike have been fairly frustrated, especially about the bad light situation yesterday. I spent most of last night arguing for a new way to deal with this problem, which includes the pink ball. Have a read and see what you think. Strangely, for something a touch left-field, I’m getting a fairly positive response. This is my all-time favourite Ric Finlay factoid, which he gives a run every year. Remember that the SCG Trust have been campaigning for a second Test a summer at this ground, at the expense of one of the smaller Australian cities. Nup.“My first ever email address was marlon_samuels@hotmail,” emails Barnaby Lever, “after I saw him make a 50 on debut at the MCG and being a massive West Indies fan, mistakenly took for a resurgence in their fortunes. In the age of MSN messenger I used to get lots of friend requests and chats from the Caribbean who were always disappointed it was a 15 year old from Newy rather than their hero.”This is outstanding. Just adopting the name - why not? One of the great regrets of my life relates to Marlon. On my first overseas tour covering the team in 2015, Marlon was in the Windies XI in Dominica. Sure enough, he was friendly and very chatty throughout the week. After the Test, he invited me and another colleague to his house in Jamaica for a party he was holding three days before the Second Test. Well, in short, we didn’t. Logistics, work and all the rest. Why does it hurt not having gone? Well, Marlon missed Jamaica Test with what was reported as a bout of conjunctivitis. Or so we were told. But I found out later, via the team doctor (one of our callers on radio that week) it was due to how written off he was... after his party. Sigh!It is raining harder at the SCG now. On SEN, they say the radar might clear in an hour or so, but I doubt it. To kill five minutes, I had a pop at this yesterday and, contrary to what Tom suggested, nailed 912 rather than running the table. Have a go. Don’t cheat. “Great by the whole OBO team the last few days.” I probably didn’t need to include that first line from Scott Jacobs, but here we are. “My first email was related to an obsession with Team America just after finishing high school. Myself and a friend or two had seen the movie and then went away rock climbing for nearly a month. That month was filled by constant and unending repetition of calling out quotes from the movie to each other, echoing around the rock faces and gullies of Mt Arapiles in the Wimmera. If any of your readers were there, they may have heard a teenager calling from the top of a cliff ‘Get out of the alley you f*@!ing bum!’ ringing around the gumtrees.”Not quite Garden State, but you’ve got me hooked. Please continue.“Shortly after getting home, I made my first email: getoutofthealley@etc. (I decided that I should keep the swears out of the email, given I would be using it for job applications - without really connecting that I wouldn’t want that email on job applications as a grown man). We also then went to the movies to see Team America again - and realised we’d been misquoting it the whole time as the actual line was ‘Get out of the street you...’. Ah well. It’s the thought that counts.”What a twist! Your first email is a Hold Me Closer, Tony Danza. Thanks or sharing. Speaking of the OBOing the rain. Whenever this happens, I think of the late and wonderful Dan Lucas. The first time that I went into  HQ to OBO the cricket, instead of doing it at the ground, he was on deck with me and we had a lovely old time. One of his little tricks was to go through all of the TV stations available on the internal directory and OBO about a minute of each when the rain came. On this occasion, it included soaps, panel shows, snooker, advertorials, parliament - the works. There was nothing that man could not find humour in. We sure do miss him in these parts. Hello world. I’m afraid the status update from the press box at the SCG is much as it was: mizzle... persistent mizzle. Plenty of people are on the ground looking around and none of them have umbrellas, but while this persists, the status quo will prevail.Thanks to Geoffers for a predictably entertaining rain OBO. That’s the third of those he has steered over the last two Tests, and as he says himself, it’s where he does his finest work. Stick with me over the next couple of hours and we’ll make our own fun, yeah?To begin, the formalities. We can email and we and tweet. I will give you my phone number if you want. My first email address related to the fact that I ran an Anna Kournikova fan site when I was a mid-teen. Have that too, if you ask nicely. In fact, why don’t we start there? This is always good at parties (read, nightclub balconies). What was your first email address? If you from the Gen Y side of the ide, I’m tipping it was an absolute shocker. Did it have a cricket bent? Many of my passwords still include “139” as a consequence of Mark Waugh’s debut. Reveal all to me. The covers are still on. It doesn’t look like it’s raining, but this rain is so fine that who even knows any more. But I have a lovely session with you all – so many interesting emails, so many discussion points, and everyone has been polite and curious and engaged. What a delight.That’s it for me this series, but hopefully you’ll join us again when Australia play Sri Lanka in the upcoming Tests, plus a couple of India ODIs. It’s always more fun when you lot get involved.Adam Collins will be in next, and we’ll be writing and podcasting after the Test as well, as always.In the meantime, I’ll leave you with this excellently random missive from Lee Henderson. “Uncovered wickets of course, and in a later innings for Paddo, Trumper whacked 189 not out with 15 fives and 22 fours. In successive scoring strokes he made 5, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 4, 5, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, and later 4, 4, 5, 4, 5, 5, 5, 4, 5.“Could you pass this onto to our batsmen as inspiration. 2.15pm till just before 6, we could still romp this in!”A couple of emails in on a related theme. From Nick Bron. “So much focus has been on the missing Australian batters, but not much has been said (correct me if I’m wrong) about the fact that Australia’s bowling attack, much vaunted in the lead up as the best in the world, have been unable to bowl India out for three innings in a row.”And from Nick Banks, headed “Oscillating not so wildly.”“Been thinking some more about the apparent lack of reverse swing found by the big Aussie quicks in this series. Adopting a Columbo-style stance and voice, here goes.“How is it that Australia’s supposedly ‘best bowling attack in the world’ has been so blunt and lifeless while India’s has found prodigious swing in each test? Could it be anything to do with South Africa? Has there been any data analysis done on how much reverse these bowlers found pre and post SA? Or is this all far too unseemly to even suggest? (I still don’t buy that a professional fast bowler wouldn’t be able to tell that something had been done to the ball).“It seems the share of criticism has been unfairly weighted to the batsmen. Yes they’ve been woeful, but so were England’s in good measure back in the English summer even while dismantling this supposedly world-beating Indian team. Principally that was because of some quality bowling in friendly conditions. Could a similar bowling display by Aus this series have produced a similar result?”A bit to unpack here. The best in the world thing is deeply parochial. South Africa - Steyn, Rabada, Philander. England - Broad, Anderson, Woakes, Curran, Stokes. India in this series, as they’ve showed. Even the Windies now have Holder and Gabriel firing. Pakistan - Mo Abbas, Hasan Ali, Mohammad Amir. There are some pretty good attacks going around, and 2018 was the best bowling year in decades.I would argue that it’s easier for a bowling attack to dominate in English conditions than on fairly flat Australian decks, especially like those in Sydney and Melbourne. In Adelaide, Australia’s bowlers did the job and the batsmen failed them. In Perth, the bowlers did the job and Australia won. And on the lifeless pitches, they’ve struggled. You could put that down to exhaustion or lack of quality depending on your perspective.As for reverse swing though, I’ve commissioned some data from CricViz (they’re sitting two seats to my left) and they say that India’s bowlers after the 40th over have not swung the ball much more than Australia’s. Very marginal. India have swung the new ball a bit more. That could have various facets too. Swing doesn’t mean much if it’s swinging a metre down leg side. And swing might not get good batsmen out, while it might get struggling batsmen out. Jay Rose is taking an analytical approach. “Are there any stats on post-GOAT teams and relative performance? Do national teams reliably go into a period of decline after X years of domination, with a higher than average losswin? Or do they go from a high win rate to an average win rate and the rest is myth?“I’m not sure it’d even be possible. Where do you draw the post-GOAT line? 50 per cent of the long-term players in a team have retired? In my cricket-watching time, I’ve seen the West Indies and Australia peak and fall demonstrably, but two is hardly a reliable N.”I think you’d track it with a combination of win-loss, batting averages, bowling averages, strike rates, etc, over a period of time. Then contrast those with subsequent eras. Like it’s notable that Australian in 2018 had the worst team-wide batting average per wicket since 1978. The list, folks, is for the worst batting average of all time. Currently Jasprit is leading all comers with a mark of 1.55. But he’s only played 15 innings, so he needs 20 to get to the cut-off for most batting statistics. Pommie Mbangwa with 2.00 and Jack Saunders with 2.29 lead the People’s Champion Chris Martin with 2.36 from 104 knocks.“The fact is Australians are no longer the outdoor, athletic bunch of people they were. Property prices have resulted in units or small backyards, kids don’t play as much, sticking to video games and phones. The quality of Australian athletes will only continue to diminish.” Email from Darius Rana. It’s a popular contention, of the sort you often hear being treated as self-evident. Like the idea that T20 cricket has ruined Test batsmen. It’s easy to assert but isn’t necessarily supported empirically. Like I’m not sure how athletic people were when they were malnourished during the Depression, or on rations during WWII. The fact other nations have caught up to Australia in sports funding, where previously we were an outlier in that regard, is another influence to be considered. “I completely agree with Nicholas Booth,” writes Mark Pickering. “In an age where aggressive bullies are being shamed in all aspects of life, for the past 10 years Aussie cricket has looked like an anachronism and a sport that is going to lose out in recruiting vs other sports. Moving from England to WA and playing club cricket in the 90s I was shocked at the overly aggressive sledging and bullying that went on in a relatively friendly match and I’m no shrinking violet. Probably why I’m now playing cricket in New Zealand!”The game here certainly has been out of step as other aspects of life clamp down on bullying. Which isn’t to say it’s not still rife, but there’s movement in the right direction. Certain heads of state aside.Here’s Robert Wilson. “Though there’s not a whisper of Test cricket about him, Samuel Beckett has got to get a shout as an interesting cricketer. A jug-eared geek when young, movie-star handsome when old, the bold Samuel managed to parlay once waiting a vexingly long time at a bus-stop in the Vaucluse and a vocabulary consisting of the words not, never, nowhere and nothing into an actual Nobel Prize. The first class average of 8.75 and zero zilch of his zip wickets explains, I think, quite a lot. No wonder he felt a touch glum.”If you think this is whimsy, Slammin’ Sam Beckett did in fact play two first-class games for Dublin University. If he’d ever made a good score he could have been Dublin his average as well. And no, he never did take a wicket. Those 138 lonely deliveries sent down for nothing.I can’t even tell if it’s raining any more. The covers are still down. I’m enjoying this non-session, though, with all your correspondence.Speaking of speaking to you all: if you’re an OBO reader in Melbourne, Adam Collins and I are doing a live version of our cricket podcast The Final Word next week. Thursday Jan 17th at the Commercial Club pub in Fitzroy. It’s a small venue, so you can book seats here.Here’s Olly. “Although I imagine the average age of us OBOers is probably above 40, such is the immediacy of modern times with access to online services and instant knowledge gratification I think we only remember the good times. In the history of Test cricket all countries have had their ups and downs and the beauty of it is, is that they don’t coincide. So right now India are brilliant and the Aussies are struggling. Roll on ten years and the picture may well be different. Or, as Plato put it better than me when he and his fellow philosophers were constructing the cradle of civilisation that was Ancient Greece: ‘Some days you’re the statue, and some days you’re the pigeon.’”Or as I similarly wrote in a poem not quite so long ago, “Some days you’re bowling, and some days you’re batting  and some days you’re Warnie, and some days you’re Gatting.”Lots of philosophy coming in about the state of Australian cricket, which is very nice to see. “Late 88, I recall coming home from school and being horrified at the performance of the Australian team that summer vs the Windies,” writes Daniel Guidone. “At the time, I wasn’t across what the problem was. I’ve looked at the scorecards, and like this series, the selectors seemed unsure of their best team, and were searching for answers in a home series against the greatest team of the time. Back then, the bowling attack in particular seemed unsettled. I was too young to understand if there was the same head-shaking about a selection policy that saw Tony Dodemaide and Chris Matthews picked for the first test, but I’m sure some questions were asked.“So maybe these things just go around in cycles? After that sad summer 30 years ago, Australia went to England and was able to find a winning identity, and a winning team to build on. On that tour, the uncertainty disappeared as bowlers like Hughes and batsmen like Taylor finally developed into world-class players. I don’t know if history will repeat itself this year specifically, but Paine is doing his part in developing a team identity, and I’m sure soon one of the young batsmen will find their feet and things will turn around.”Ray Murphy emails in. “While the Keith Miller Messerschmitt quote is one that is well known to cricket nuffies, so doesn’t qualify as obscure, still shows what an extraordinary bloke he was – not to mention being extraordinarily socially dapper. Cricket’s just a game, an absolutely beautiful and life enhancing one to play and follow, but just a game after all. Should be remembered when the Chicken Littles lament the state of the Australian game, players andor skills when we aren’t bullying and dominating the opposition. Sometimes you just play and get beaten by a better team. Well done to India for superb batting and bowling this summer, and well done to Tim Paine’s team for playing the beautiful game of cricket.”“Can’t say I agree with Shane George’s thesis - kids always want to emulate successful teams. The All Blacks never seem to run out of fresh young talent,” emails Bob Biddulph.“As for intriguing former cricketers, I always thought Bill Johnston was a man who never received the plaudits he deserved: grew up on a struggling dairy farm (you may guess my occupation as similar and you may be right), became an Invincible, bowling left-arm fast behind Lindwall and Miller, then would revert to left-arm tweak when the ball was old. Averaged 100 with the bat on an Ashes tour thanks to not outs, and won a Test against the West Indies with an improbable last wicket stand of 30-odd. Would be a handy addition to the current side.”“Can I nominate Jack Iverson as a truly remarkable cricketer, and subject of the brilliant book Mystery Spinner, by the peerless Gideon Haigh,” writes Brian Withington. “The book was recommended to me by one of the OBO brotherhood (Rob Smyth or Adam Collins I think) and it’s a masterly tale of an enigmatic riddle of a man who emerged from obscurity in his early 30s to rapidly achieve national acclaim via a Melbourne club 3rd team, and then at the peak of his amazing powers retired from international cricket and soon faded from view. Apparently Iverson developed his baffling repertoire of leg breaks, googlies and top spinners practicing with a table tennis ball in Papua New Guinea during WW2. Great read.”Table tennis. Responsible for so many twists on the tortured roads of fortune.“The world of cricket needs a bloodthirsty, arrogant, talented, brutal Oz team,” writes Fantie from London. “Spanking that team is much better than this one which seems more like a squeaky clean accountant. We need a feral thug on speed.”Yes, but then we have to put up with them over here all the rest of the time when they’re not playing your lot. Rather not, thanks.Covers update: still on. The forecast is for “light drizzle at times.” So far those times have not been a-changing. Also the Bureau has recorded 0.0 millimetres of rain today, which is another occurrence supporting the theory of the last couple of years that we’re all in the Matrix and it’s glitching.Jack Faine has a Fascination Vote: “Whilst he is not in the same heroic echelon as the war heroes, Ric Charlesworth AO is a remarkable cricketer. He opened the batting for WA for five or six years, played hockey in five Olympics captaining twice, coached the men’s and women’s hockey teams to world dominance. A genuine giant. I believe he also had ten years or so as a member of WA Parliament. Not quite sure how he found the time for any of it. Oh yes, Wikipedia has just reminded me that he also completed a medical degree at UWA. Ho hum.” Nicholas Booth has the first response to Shane. “It could that parents steered their kids towards other sports due to the struggles of the likes of Hayden, Langer, MacGill etc, but I think it’s more likely that the perception of the team as boorish bad winners did way more damage.”I’ve condensed a fairly lengthy Twitter thesis posed to me by Shane George. Not necessarily one I agree with but an interesting contention that I haven’t heard anyone argue before. Go on?“My contention is that the current uncompetitive Australia team is directly attributable to the excellence of their forebears for 20 years. The children of that era will have watched players like Stuart Law, Blewett, Love, Lehmann sit out. Langer and Hayden had a long time out and were forced to change styles, Martyn had to concede he was never going to be Mark Waugh. Gillespie \u0026amp MacGill would have been all-time greats in other teams. The kids will have seen the struggles of these excellent players to squeeze into 11 spots and determined that there were more rewarding athletic pursuits. Awesome teams are an active discouragement to children.” “Hello,” writes John Larmett. “After observing all summer, and having time spent in the UK, I hope Australia stick to their new policies and don’t revert to earlier ways. A brand new world awaits. It always was going to be a bit painful, but this country has got a massive part to play in Test cricket worldwide. Just be patient.” It’s 10:50am local time. The main covers are still down. There’s still very light misting precipitation floating around like Bonnie Tyler’s dress.John Goldstein has nominated Hedley Verity as his fascinating cricketer. Aside from taking a million first-class wickets and getting Bradman out in Tests more often than anyone, and being Jardine’s right-hand man during Bodyline, Verity then joined up during WWII, got posted to India and the Middle East, then got hit by shrapnel and captured by the Germans during the invasion of Sicily. He died in a hospital in Italy in 1943.Tibby Cotter is the next nomination, via Mark McGrath. “Slinging fast bowler from early last century. Took 89 test wickets at 28.64. Was the premier fast bowler of his time in Australia taking 442 first class wickets at 24.27. Participated in what was effectively a players’ strike against the Australian Cricket Board of Control in 1912 and never played for Australia again. Joined the AIF in 1915 at the age of 31. Killed in the light horse charge at Bersheeba in 1917.”Industrial action? Against a recalcitrant board? Thank goodness those days of mismanagement are a century behind us.“In answer to Andrew Benton’s question about extraordinary cricketers, may I offer up CB Fry,” writes Olly. “He played 26 Tests for England, played for Southampton in an FA Cup Final, won Blues for athletics at Oxford and turned down the chance of becoming the King of Albania. But he’s probably best remembered for his party trick of jumping backwards, from a standing position, onto a mantelpiece. Keep up the good work.”I guess that’s one way to do the dusting.Nick Jones has a novel solution for Australia. “Was thinking intra game substitutable squad members (including staff) might be a great idea. Out go Usman and Marsh. G Hick to open up followed by Langer at No3 today.” I reckon they’ll rely on the rain in the first instance. Which is still drizzling.Gareth Frith starts out as a global citizen and ends up as a partisan, a striking transition. “We’re down to the final day of the final test of a thoroughly absorbing series, one of those you’re a bit sad to see the back of. It’s played havoc with my sleeping pattern but it’s been worth it. For a neutral with no dog in the fight, it’s been gripping viewing, and also shows how fortunate andor skilful England were in key moments last year. “It’s been a pleasure reading you and the  OBO team, still the best cricket section on the whole bloody mastiff interweb. Some words on how Joe Burns and Glenn Maxwell may as well just concentrate on their Red Rose contracts and Cricket Australia would be better off looking elsewhere in the post mortem would be most appreciated.”Thanks from me and all the others. There wouldn’t be much of an OBO without the readers. There has to be something pleasant and friendly in the wilds of the internet, doesn’t there? I only wish I could be describing some cricket for you, rather than describing weather.God bless Andrew Benton. “Have any Test cricketers been kidnapped and held to ransom? Saved a sinking ship, stopped a runaway train, or rescued a drowning maiden? Or do they lead and have they led rather pedestrian lives in this regard? There must be some amazing facts out there. You wouldn’t believe it! Oh yes I would! And I do say it’ll be a draw, I do. I still do.”I’m reading that paragraph in a kind of breathless Vivian Leigh voice, I don’t know about you. Andrew did indeed predict the draw on the first day and I told him he was a fool, a damned fool. But from memory I did add the caveat that only the weather could create one. And here we are, perhaps (cue poor mental arithmetic) 68 overs lost and counting. The big covers are coming down now. If anyone can answer Andrew’s questions about exceptional lives, do so. There were plenty of cricketers who served in the World Wars and returned from daring exploits, it must be said. Any other great stories? Send them in.Tell you what, I don’t know why they even bother playing cricket in Australia, rah rah rah. The West Indies Test here a couple of years ago could better have been called the Wet Sydneys Test – the middle three days were washed out. God knows how we filled hours of airtime and metres of column space in that day and age. The rain is light but persistent. The big covers aren’t down, just the pitch cover.Play will – again – be delayed. We will not start at 10am local time. Because there’s drizzle and seven minutes to go. Arooooooo.Ed Cowan on the radio is firing a few good shots at the pitch. He’s saying don’t let the curators get away with having prepared a road, just because Australia’s poor batting means the result is possible, and just because rain will be a factor if there’s a draw.Brad Haddin is speaking with the ABC about the light policy yesterday, too. “I’m with you, and I think I’m with the crowd as well. From a cricket spectator point of view, I don’t think it was dangerous for the players.”Fair suggestion. You’d get a lot more run-outs from balls kicked onto the stumps.I regret to inform you that there is definitely a bit of drizzle around the northern inner suburbs, my sources say. Brad Stafford is also spotting enemy action from the crow’s nest. “Hi Geoff, really odd that the lights aren’t on yet – supposed to start in 25 minutes (although from my 43rd storey CBD window it looks very much like it did yesterday). “Speaking of which, I was there yesterday, and it seemed pretty poor form from the umpires to not get players out there earlier in the day. There’s no way players would go off in that level of intermittent drizzle, so why not start play in it?”I largely tend to agree. Light and rain are the two things that cruel cricket the most as a sport (aside from match-fixing and sandpaper stories and all the rest). To a degree, waiting around at a cricket ground for play to start is just part of the deal. But if we dig a bit deeper, should it be? Not to say they should play in thunderstorms, but surely we could be a bit more dynamic and trade a few millimetres of principle to get more action on the field?As always, tweet me your thoughts at @GeoffLemonSport, or email me at geoff.lemon@the.Good morrow. Today, the cricket equation is simple. Australia must bat a full innings for a full day to avoid defeat. India must take 10 wickets to win a match. The sky is cloudy but no rain is falling. And that is that. Easier said than done, in a season where Australia has been incapable of batting long periods of time. And on a final day pitch which is holding up well but still has a few signs of wear and some bounce keeping low. Of course, this result won’t affect the series result, because India already lead 1-2. So win or draw today, they’ll still win the series.The only way Australia could win this match and level the series would be to pile on perhaps 400 runs in two sessions, then pop India back in and rissole them within 30 overs. Theoretically possible, if time travellers brought together one of those Greatest XIs of All Time, but let’s call it improbable for now.Australia followed on yesterday, they’re no wicket for 6 runs today, and they’ll start in about 45 minutes’ time.

As a gay man of colour he didn’t fit the everyday indie rock frontman mould – he shattered it. As part of our Tales of the everyday extraordinary series, we look at his extraordinary influence. Images captured on the Google Pixel 3 by Laura McCluskeyNobody could accuse Kele Okereke of standing still. Following the release of his acclaimed 2017 solo effort, Fatherland, he’s spent the second half of this year on a sold-out international tour with his band Bloc Party, who are revisiting their beginnings by performing their seminal debut album, Silent Alarm, in its entirety. Meanwhile, he’s somehow found time to co-compose the score for the highly anticipated new musical Leave to Remain, which opens at the Lyric Hammersmith in January, with songwriter Matt Jones.And while his professional life continues to metamorphosise, his personal life has also taken on a new dimension as he, along with his partner, welcomed a baby girl into their lives. They called her Savannah. When I interviewed Okereke for Attitude magazine last year, I reminded him that he’d once proclaimed that his solo album came about because all his bandmates wanted to stop and have babies, but he wanted to wait until he was 35.“Did I say that? Wow!” he said. “I’ve always wanted to be a father, but as a gay man I didn’t know if it was possible.”While being a gay parent in the UK these days isn’t exactly a revolutionary act, back in the mid-noughties a queer black singer fronting an indie rock band was nothing short of extraordinary. This was a scene dominated by straight white men where a certain type of swaggering masculinity was the default, yet here was a softly spoken, soulful gay man whose band was leading the race.Even though Okereke himself didn’t formally come out until his solo career took off, during Bloc Party’s reign his queerness was hiding in plain sight. He was never a flamboyant performer in the Freddie Mercury mould, and he didn’t openly embrace his sexuality the way a new generation of queer singers including Olly Alexander, Troye Sivan and Hayley Kiyoko would come to do. But his tender masculinity and softly coded lyrics spoke volumes.As a young, gay, indie music fan myself, who was many years away from landing the job of deputy editor of Attitude, I can attest to the importance of seeing someone like Okereke up on stage back then. And even though he might have been deliberately singing ambiguously, when Okereke launched into I Still Remember, from sophomore album A Weekend In The City, the queer intent was clear. The song is about two teenage lovers, both too afraid to make a move (“You should have asked me for itI would have been brave”). Here was someone who saw the world differently, here was someone like me.Fast forward 11 years and there’s nothing coded about Okereke now, or the songs he sings. On Fatherland he duets with Years \u0026amp Years’s Olly Alexander, on a track called Grounds for Resentment. “It’s the first time I’ve ever sung a romantic duet with another boy, and that’s important,” he says. “I feel, as a gay singer, you can fall into the trap of thinking we’re not really allowed to express desire. That as a gay man singing about love and desire, everything has to be coded.”That trap has opened wide now and Okereke can proudly count himself among a legion of queer musicians whose sexuality is everyday, yet still extraordinary.Okereke’s boundless musical curiosity has since seen him move into theatre as he scores a highly anticipated new play, out early 2019. Leave to Remain tells the story of a gay couple whose marriage forces two very different families to come together.While it’s clear that Okereke’s not short of projects to give his attention to, his primary focus for the foreseeable future is his own family. When I asked him if he has any doubts about raising his daughter as a gay parent he’s firm in his response: “We’re going to do all that we can to make sure she has the strength to stand in her own convictions,” he says. “That’s how I’ve lived my life. I’ve had to go out and be myself in spite of what everyone was telling me.”Find out more about the Google Pixel 3 here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19e52fb7454f217de6cb8f78ec5885bb8692b6e8/0_69_2071_1243/master/2071.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0e259990db7ea7c4dc19ebf87fa8d328","title":"tell us about a great retreat experience for the chance to win a 200 hotel voucher","story":"Whether it was yoga or mindfulness, painting or running, we’d love to hear about retreats worldwide that have soothed, inspired or made you thinkMaybe you rebooted your mind with a meditation holiday, kickstarted an exercise campaign or spent a week immersed in learning a new skill.

Please do not read on if you are not up to date.Well that was emotional. Ride like the wind, Jean Valjean and save the (probably-actually-not-all-that) innocent man in Arras. Feel the searing pain of the hot coin of shame in your palm. Behold the memory of your giant beard of sorrow. Defend your honour.This was an episode that was initially uneven and then suddenly soared to majestic heights, both of comedy and tragedy, showcasing some extraordinary, award-worthy performances from Dominic West (Valjean) and David Oyelowo (Javert), plus a jaw-dropping cameo from Ron Cook as a never-to-be-forgotten “hair and teeth dealer”. (That is his actual cast listing.)There is a theory about great novels: that they tell their story by building up important scenes in sequence. This is true of Les Misérables, which is perhaps why this adaptation, so faithful to the original, came into its own here. This week the story was told in several key scenes, starting with the moment Javert witnesses that the strangely-familiar mayor has such superhuman strength that he can lift a cart off a dying man.The chemistry between West and Oyelowo is incredible it’s worth watching for that alone. Neither of them overplay their roles. Instead, both try to inject suspense and subtlety into what could be extremely hammy parts. The humiliation in Javert’s face when his accusation against the mayor was questioned! The cat and mouse game between the two of them is simply electric.Back at the Queen Vic, sorry, Sergeant de Waterloo, the Thenardiers provided a comedic foil to the tension of the main storyline. You would happily leave your child with Olivia Colman, but perhaps not with her evil French ginger twin. On the other hand, seven francs a month for childcare seemed most appealing. Colman struck a brilliant balance between pathos and farce, managing to engineer some laughs while still leaving us shocked when her conman husband hit her. Similarly, Kathryn Hunter as Madame Victurnien (Fantine’s factory supervisor) managed to spin a small role into something spectacular, grimacing her disapproval at Fantine’s “secret”. For me, though, the entire series took flight when Fantine had her teeth pulled. Cook as the teeth-puller was just sublime. As was the camera panning across the “instruments”. The smile after “You’re allowed to change your mind, you know …” was genius. I was screaming, “NO, NOT THE TEETH,” as he grinned, “Help me hold her still, mother …” It was beautifully shot, acted with cruel brilliance and perfect in its depiction of the physical horror of poverty. This scene, coupled with the elegant moments of dialogue — the ones when we are reminded why we are following this story (“I have bought your soul … You belong to good” versus “Next time it will be for life … You can never win”) — elevated this series into something special. (Which was not initially evident to me last week, I have to say. Plus, there are still a lot of digressions, it must be admitted.)The appearance of the “ecrivan public” (Alan David as Letter Writer, AKA the Only Non-Illiterate in the Village) was fascinating too, although I couldn’t help blaming him for everything as he didn’t make it clear until it was too late that Fantine should become a prostitute before selling her teeth. Basic error. The main conclusions to be taken then? Suspense has been most satisfyingly ramped up for the battle between Javert and Valjean. Olivia Colman suits red hair. But most importantly this: the world would be a better place if more respectable property-owning citizens were attacked by semi-bald toothless women jumping on their backs and scratching their faces until they bled.Well, it wasn’t so much unconvincing as an interesting attempt to turn the tables. The brief scene between Fantine (Lily Collins) and the man who called her “baldy” was a memorable moment. There was this immortal exchange: “How much do you charge, baldy?” “If you don’t want business, do me a favour and move along.” For a second we were rooting for Fantine and hoping that she would recover her dignity and get her own back on someone. But, of course, this is impossible because it is 19th-century France and she is a young woman who has borne a child out of wedlock and sold her teeth. Still, I enjoyed the possibility.This ought to go to Fantine (Collins) for perfecting a tuberculosis cough and a realistic death rattle. But in fact I found myself more moved by the moral turmoil facing Valjean (West). There is something touching and real about what West is portraying: he really knows how to show what Valjean is wrestling with both externally (against Javert) and internally (against his own conscience), depicting this with very few lines of dialogue. What a gift of an actor he is, with or without giant beard and glimpses of buttock.• “Where’s hubby?” “He’s dead.” “Oh dear.” Olivia Colman’s sneer here was a wonder. I also enjoyed her singing a French song before bursting out in broad Cock-er-ney.• “A man steals because he is degenerate.” “There I have to tell you that we disagree … How we turn out depends on our circumstances and how we are treated.” And in those two lines, we have the entire plot.• “I wouldn’t mind spreading my wings in his bed.” Get in the queue.• “Maman, I’m tired.” Ah, Cosette, we are all tired. We are all so tired. At least we still have our two front teeth, though."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b45e08722ab682869abd908520c5917a5be3832f/0_225_4372_2624/master/4372.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef16137d9a565380f12e3954432d659b","title":"rebirth of britains canal network","story":"Some 3,000 miles of navigable waterways will be almost doubled in a bid to reawaken a historic national asset“When you’ve lived a busy life, it really is like stepping into another world,” said Fiona Wright, who moved off-grid with her daughter and five dogs when she traded in her Wiltshire home for a 45-foot narrowboat last summer.Wright’s love of the canals is shared by tens of thousands of people who are taking to the water, and the towpath, in ever greater numbers in a waterways renaissance.There are now 38,000 narrowboats – one quarter of them are homes – on 3,000 miles of navigable waterways, and the number of people enjoying barge holidays has doubled in recent years. Membership of the Friends of the Canal and River Trust (CRT), the waterways’ version of the National Trust, hit 28,000 this year. Towpaths are teeming with walkers, anglers and cyclists, and there are thousands of volunteers working on 98 canal restoration projects from Devon to West Sussex to Cumbria. The Inland Waterways Association (IWA), the charity that champions canal restoration, is working towards reopening 2,500 miles of “dead” canals which lie derelict.Wright’s 11-year-old daughter, Emma, who is home-educated, is an ardent advocate of barge life. Her YouTube channel, Narrowboat Girl, which documents their slow journey along the canals, stopping for a while here and there, has attracted more than 100,000 views. “It’s so cool,” said Emma. “I’m learning all the time on the water and the towpath, about birds, animals and plants.”Due to be published early this year, a report by the restoration hub of the IWA will emphasise the benefits of canal restoration in terms of economic regeneration, wildlife and plant ersity, architectural heritage, tourism and education. Putting freight back on the canals is also viable, which is why an inland port is being planned in Leeds.Mike Palmer, the report’s main author, said the canal network was “a huge linear national park – a leisure park, a vital wildlife sanctuary, an important industrial heritage site and an environment-friendly transport system all rolled into one”.While the report is being digested, the IWA volunteers will be hard at work on projects, which include:• De-silting work on an abandoned stretch of the Wey and Arun navigation near the Surrey-West Sussex border.• The completion of a two-year restoration of a hopelessly derelict lock on the Grantham canal in the east Midlands, bringing the Lincolnshire town a step closer to returning to the national network it left more than 80 years ago.• A redoubling of fundraising efforts by the Lichfield and Hatherton Canals Restoration Trust, which raised the money to build an aqueduct over the M6 toll road 16 years ago despite the fact that there is no canal there (there will be, eventually). Unless work on a tunnel under a railway and a new roundabout starts within a year or so costs will increase enormously. The trust must raise £1m by the end of this year in a campaign led by the actor and canals supporter David Suchet: it has just passed £530,000.• Taking the next step on one of the most daunting challenges faced by any of the nation’s restoration projects, the Missing Mile on the Cotswold canals, a stretch that was more or less obliterated when the M5 was built. Motorists on the A419 will see narrowboats crossing the middle of a roundabout there is also junction 13 of the M5 to deal with, plus a major gas pipeline and two more roundabouts. It should be finished by 2023, bringing Stroud back on to the national network.The IWA’s report aims to change the attitude of funders, politicians, government departments, local authorities, restoration groups and even health professionals. As well as the economic and environmental benefits of canals, it will stress the effects on health, a point made by Philippa Moreton, a retired doctor who advised many of her patients to take towpath walks in Wendover, Buckinghamshire, where she worked.Moreton said: “Regular exercise in a beautiful, peaceful natural environment with water has an added bonus. It gives a sense of wellbeing, reduces stress and helps depression. Walking beside a canal not only helps patients with diabetes, hypertension, lung disease and arthritis but also patients with mental health problems.”The report will recommend focusing on micro-projects rather than the entire length of a canal. Restoration should be seen by government agencies and volunteers as a national issue, rather than as a hotch-potch of local groups working in isolation. “There was a big gap in terms of looking at things strategically,” said Palmer, who chairs the waterways recovery group, the IWA’s volunteer taskforce.There are long-running disputes with road builders and planners in Swindon on the route of the abandoned Berkshire and Wiltshire canal on the new Bedford and Milton Keynes waterway and on the Lichfield and Hatherton canal.“Everybody is struggling with planning permission, with highway crossings, with water abstraction rights,” said Palmer. “This report will say to the government, to the Environment Agency, ‘you need to do better on this’. It’s quite likely that even the bosses of any ministry don’t actually understand that it’s a major issue. They just think it’s dozens of little local issues and don’t spot that they’re joined up.”Despite this lack of political will, Britain’s canals have had their advocates. In the 1960s, the Queen Mother and the transport minister, Barbara Castle, were among those who spoke up for canals at a time when the attitude of many, especially in local politics, was that they were dirty, dangerous and of no value.John Dodwell, who has been active in restoring the waterways since 1961 and who chairs the Montgomery Canal Partnership, said that a 1970 conference in Oxford on the urban future of canals “was instrumental in turning the tide with town planners and highway engineers”.He said: “We need something similar now, especially with road builders.” Dodwell welcomed the IWA report and pointed out that there were no national planning guidelines covering the restoration of canals.One of the best examples of a self-contained, landlocked restoration that has improved life is in Stroud. The Cotswold canals restoration, a big project that will eventually reconnect the Severn and the Thames, has been heavily supported for 10 years by Stroud district council.Several miles have been reopened, and the council has moved its offices to Ebley Mill, which was a moribund part of town a few years ago. David Marshall, the council’s canal project manager, said: “The canal used to be a place to avoid – rubbish, derelict, broken locks – and now it’s a place to come to. What we’ve done so far stands on its own two feet.”The Cotswold project has more than 7,000 members, more than any other canal trust. Palmer, whose main aim is to generate more externally-funded projects on the waterways, said: “We want more people to be involved in the waterways.“The purpose of our report is to show that you don’t need to fully restore a canal in order to gain all the benefits. If you start with a small piece of restoration and plan it well you will get the benefits right from day one. It might be restoring a kilometre here, restoring a canalside warehouse that becomes a community centre. A lot of people just want somewhere safe to walk, or a cycle path. And when people see one kilometre restored they want the next, and the next…”One day it will be possible, as it was 150 years ago, to travel by inland waterways from Littlehampton in West Sussex to the Lake District. By road, on a good day, that would take six hours. At the more sedate pace of the canals, where the speed limit is 4mph, it would take weeks.But what’s the rush? The yearning for a slower life, revealed to millions of television viewers by Timothy West and Prunella Scales in the nine series of Channel 4’s Great Canal Journeys, is one of the big attractions of the inland waterways.The most popular writer on canals was Tom Rolt, the godfather of canal restoration who helped found the IWA. In his hugely popular and still in-print 1944 book, Narrow Boat, he said that canal travel “seemed to me to fulfil in the fullest sense the meaning of travel as opposed to a mere blind hurrying from place to place”.He wrote: “To step down from some busy thoroughfare on to the quiet towpath of a canal, even in the heart of a town, is to step backward a hundred years or more and to see things in a different, and perhaps more balanced, perspective.”Fiona and Emma Wright could not agree more."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e31a7509ee7ff69585f9d39066d698ea54349565/0_48_3600_2161/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d5009960b1db69388802a4ee6777b816","title":"sultan muhammad v steps down as malaysias king","story":"Palace statement announces head of state’s abdication ending weeks of speculationMalaysia’s king has abdicated, royal officials have said, ending weeks of speculation about his future.The announcement on Sunday follows a leave of absence by the head of state and rumours he had married a former Russian beauty queen.Sultan Muhammad V’s decision marks the first time a king has abdicated in the Muslim-majority country since Malaysia gained independence from Britain in 1957.“The National Palace informs that his majesty has resigned as the 15th king effective January 6,” a statement from the palace said on Sunday.The palace did not give any reason for the 49-year-old royal’s move.There had been a question mark over the reign of the king, who ascended to the throne in December 2016, since he took a leave of absence for medical treatment in November.Reports then circulated online that the king had married a former Miss Moscow in Russia, although royal officials in Malaysia have so far not commented on the rumours.Malaysia is a constitutional monarchy, with a unique arrangement where the throne changes hands every five years between the rulers of the nine Malaysian states headed by centuries-old Islamic royalty.Speculation had intensified about Sultan Muhammad V’s future this week when the country’s other royals reportedly held a special meeting."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f187b25b7fea3940d6794de97bd2d6e00b220c2c/0_695_3279_1965/master/3279.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3a5f2b1038d03b67f4e21335d8563d2c","title":"go getter japanese girl nine becomes strategy games youngest professional","story":"Sumire Nakamura is the product of a special programme to promote the ancient pursuit and compete with Korean and Chinese playersA nine-year-old girl in Japan will become the youngest-ever professional player of the strategy board game go when she makes her debut later this year.Sumire Nakamura, who attends primary school in Osaka, started playing go at the age of three and will start her career at the lowest rank of shodan on 1 April, according to Japanese media.She will comfortably beat the record for the youngest professional held by Rina Fujisawa, who was aged 11 years and six months when she turned professional nine years ago.Nakamura, who was encouraged to play go by her father, Shinya, himself a ninth-degree professional player who won a national title in 1998, is the product of a special programme to nurture a new generation of top Japanese players who can compete with their Chinese and Korean counterparts in international tournaments.The primary school pupil honed her skills at tournaments involving other schoolchildren and recently sharpened her competitive edge in South Korea.Flanked by Japan Go Association officials and her parents, Sumire overcame her initial bashfulness to tell reporters at the weekend: “I’m happy when I win. I want to win a title while I’m at junior high school.”Go, which requires players to take control of territory on the board, is said to have originated in China more than 2,500 years ago and has an estimated 20 million active players, mainly in east Asia.Fans of go will be hoping that Nakamura’s extraordinary rise will boost interest the game, in the same way Sota Fujii did for shogi, a Japanese version of chess.Fujii set a record for consecutive victories in professional shogi in 2017, aged just 14, winning plaudits from the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, and sparking a surge of interest in the game.Last month, Fujii won his 100th official match, becoming the youngest professional player to reach the milestone.

Nageshwar Rao, vice chancellor at Andhra University, referring to a story from the Hindu epic Mahabharata.Rao, who was addressing school children and scientists at the event, also said a demon king from another centuries-old Hindu epic had two dozen aircraft and a network of landing strips in modern-day Sri Lanka.“Hindu Lord Vishnu used guided missiles known as ‘Vishnu Chakra’ and chased moving targets,” added the professor of inorganic chemistry.Event organisers tried to hose down the remarks, saying it was “unfortunate” the prestigious event had been derailed by controversy.“We don’t subscribe to their views and distance ourselves from their comments. This is unfortunate,” said Premendu P Mathur, general secretary of Indian Scientific Congress Association.“There is a serious concern about such kind of utterances by responsible people.”Another speaker, a scientist from a university in southern Tamil Nadu state, also raised eyebrows by questioning the breakthroughs of Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein.India is no stranger to prominent figures citing ancient Hindu texts like the Puranas and Vedas as ironclad evidence of the country’s technological prowess.India’s minister for higher education Satyapal Singh last year said Darwin’s theory of evolution was wrong, and vowed to change the national school curriculum to reflect that.The minister hails from the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which rules 17 of India’s 29 states and territories outright or through alliances.BJP leader and prime minister Narendra Modi in 2015 pointed to Hindu scriptures as proof that plastic surgery existed in ancient India.Science minister Harsh Vardhan last year said ancient Greeks took credit from India for early mathematical principles and misquoted Stephen Hawking as praising the Vedas for discoveries greater than Einstein’s theory of relativity.The Breakthrough Science Society, an Indian-based educational charity, said it was “astounded and even horrified” at the remarks made at an academic summit.“Such a hallowed assembly of scientists has been misused to make false and chauvinistic claims about ancient India.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca9e37a9ff26b12204a8d38cefe8ebc471571261/0_0_2117_1270/master/2117.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b51254c028311943e787816df477903f","title":"kevin spacey nantucket ","story":"Actor due in courtroom to be arraigned on felony charges for an alleged sexual assault against a busboy at a restaurant in 2016The tiny, fish-hook shaped island of Nantucket feels like a place separated from America by place and time. There are no traffic lights. You won’t find a McDonalds, CVS or any other chain store ubiquitous across the US. In its quiet and partially cobblestoned downtown, some leave their cars running while they go into shops. In winter, the silence is only broken by church bells and the sound of a foghorn.In the 1800s the island was the centre of the whaling industry but it has left its gritty past behind. It now attracts the richest of the rich, among them scions of business, owners of sports teams and faces familiar from TV: former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, Tommy Hilfiger, Chris Matthews, John Kerry, Charles Schwab and Ben Stiller come here, among many others. Among those who have everything and can go anywhere, many choose to live – or at least summer – here.The actor Kevin Spacey visited the island in recent years. On Monday, he is due in the island’s lone courtroom to be arraigned on felony charges for an alleged sexual assault against a busboy at a restaurant in 2016. If convicted, the actor could face five years in prison. He would also have to register as a sex offender.The saga has brought the #MeToo movement, and all the attention it generates, to an island where many go to get out of the spotlight.“Extremely wealthy people or famous people or high-level politicians are attracted to Nantucket for a variety of reasons,” said Bruce Percelay, publisher of Nantucket Magazine and the chairman and founder of the Mount Vernon Company, a New England real estate firm. “But one of them is that people don’t care. If a celebrity comes to Nantucket and is hoping to be fawned over, they will be very disappointed. This is not the kind of place where people go to genuflect over sightings of the rich and famous. We leave that kind of behaviour to the Hamptons.”There appears to be truth to this. On Friday evening Bill Belichick – coach of the New England Patriots football team, practically a deity to many in Massachusetts, particularly at playoff time – was having a quiet dinner in the corner of a dimly lit restaurant where this writer was enjoying a beer. Nobody appeared to be paying him much attention, save for perhaps this writer, who couldn’t help but steal glances at the man with five Super Bowl rings.“Enjoy your evening coach,” a hostess said casually as Belichick walked out into the cold winter night. “Good luck next Sunday!”“You could be sitting on a bench on Main Street next to a billionaire and you wouldn’t know it because everybody is just casual and in their happy place,” said Jeneane Life, owner of the Carlisle Inn. “Nantucket just gets in your blood. It’s just a peaceful, serene, beautiful place.”On Nantucket, Percelay said, the rich and famous “can be themselves. That is something increasingly difficult to find.“You can pick up the phone book and find the names of Fortune 100 CEOs and their home phone numbers.”For those who want to make a home here, the entry barrier is set forbiddingly high. According to the Inquirer and Mirror, the island’s weekly newspaper, the median home price on the island last year was $1.8m. The average price sat at $2.7m.“We like to jokingly say that this is where the millionaires have to mow the lawns for the billionaires,” said Renee Ceely, executive director of the Nantucket Housing Authority. “Because if you do own real estate, more than likely it’s worth more than a million dollars.”Even visiting the island is out of reach for many: during the summer, rooms at inns run to many hundreds of dollars a night. There is one hostel, but visitors won’t find any motels or popular chain hotels.The exclusivity of Nantucket is enhanced by its seclusion, 30 miles off the Massachusetts coast. The only way on or off is by ferry or plane, though both of those options can be delayed by poor weather.The island has about 10,000 year-round residents, but that number can go up more than five-fold in the summer. With most of the island zoned as conservation land and unavailable for development, land and housing stocks are limited. That means that finding housing for the workers who make the island tick – school teachers, postal workers, cops, restaurant and hotel staff – presents significant challenges.“Affordable housing affects everyone, even the wealthy,” Ceely said. “They get their meals, who takes care of them behind the register at the supermarket, who’s cleaning the floors at the hospital? Who’s your nurse?”On such an island, where invisibility and seclusion are main draws, the attention brought by the Spacey case is unwelcome, a breach of presumed safety and serenity.Spacey was an outsider, just visiting, when the sexual assault is alleged to have occurred. His accuser, however, is from a family with Nantucket ties. He is the son of Heather Unruh, a former Boston news anchor and a fixture on the island. In October 2017, as the #MeToo movement was born with sexual abuse allegations surfacing against film producer Harvey Weinstein, Unruh used Twitter.“The #weinsteinscandal has emboldened me – #truth time,” she wrote. “I was a Kevin Spacey fan until he assaulted a loved one. Time the dominoes fell.”Days later, actor Anthony Rapp came forward with allegations against Spacey, saying that when he was a 14-year-old child actor in New York, a 26-year-old Spacey tried to force himself on him. Spacey said he did not remember the alleged incident, but apologised for “deeply inappropriate drunken behaviour”.In November that year, Unruh held a press conference where she said her then 18-year-old son had been star-struck when Spacey showed up at the Club Car restaurant, where he worked. She alleged the actor bought her son alcohol and later stuck his hands in his pants, grabbing his genitals. She said her son fled the restaurant when Spacey excused himself to go to the bathroom.Spacey will plead not guilty. But to Percelay the alleged incident was a violation of what Nantucket is about.“This type of celebrity just doesn’t fit the ethos of Nantucket.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09d78274b4ef05e422ec1ca26411640a4db9f6db/0_89_4134_2480/master/4134.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=970eef0501bd53421fa06afd5370b363","title":"monday briefing pm begs for new year brexit resolution","story":"Theresa May makes another plea for concessions from EU … NHS plan to save 500,000 lives … Olivia Colman leads British successes at the Golden Globes Good morning briefers and a happy new year. I’m Martin Farrer and it’s my turn to bring you the best news from the  this Monday morning.It might be the new year, but it’s the same old problem for Theresa May as she makes yet another desperate plea to EU leaders for concessions to persuade rebellious MPs to back her deal in a vote which she has promised will take place next week. Without offering any details, the prime minister said on Sunday that she was seeking “further assurances” on the Irish border backstop and Britain’s future relationship with Europe. But as parliament prepares to debate the Brexit deal this week, the PM faces formidable obstacles, including vehement opposition by many of her backbenchers and the Democratic Unionists to the backstop plan, implacable EU opposition to reopening talks on the 535-page withdrawal agreement and a groundswell of bipartisan support in Westminster for a second referendum.It comes as Germany’s foreign affairs minister flies to Ireland tomorrow as the governments in Berlin and Dublin intensify their efforts to find a fix for the Irish border problem. Relations between the two countries have blossomed during the Brexit imbroglio, helped by the fact that the taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, speaks German. But one EU source warned any fix would be around the forthcoming “political agreement”, and not on the withdrawal package which was “locked”. To find out what might happen over the next two weeks, check out this explainer from our political editor, Heather Stewart.Oscar Favourite? – Olivia Colman seems set to go head-to-head with Glenn Close for an Oscar next month after they both won best actress awards at the Golden Globes in Los Angeles overnight. The British star triumphed in the musical or comedy category for her tragicomic turn as Queen Anne in The Favourite, while the veteran American won in the drama segment for The Wife. Other notable British successes were Ben Whishaw for his portrayal of Norman Scott in A Very British Scandal and Richard Madden for The Bodyguard. Christian Bale was also on the board for his role in Vice. The big surprise came at the end, however, when the critically unloved Queen biopic Bohemian Rhapsody scooped best drama and best dramatic actor for Rami Malek. Read how the awards unfolded at our live blog here and who won the battle of the red carpet.Health pledge – In a welcome ersion for Theresa May, the embattled prime minister will today announce a new long-term plan for the NHS detailing ambitious plans to use genomics, cutting-edge surgery and artificial intelligence to help save up to half a million lives over the next decade. Health chiefs hope the plan will dramatically reduce the number of people dying from common killers such as cancer, heart attacks and strokes. But some experts voiced concern that funding cuts and staff shortages could undermine the bold vision.Trump threat – Donald Trump has repeated his threat to declare a national emergency in order to override Congress and secure the $5.6bn funding he needs to build a wall along the border with Mexico. The US president raised the idea twice over the weekend as the government shutdown he triggered last month entered its 16th day. The newly installed House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, has refused to drop her opposition to the wall. Adam Schiff, a Democratic leader on Capitol Hill, said the idea that Trump could invoke the 1976 National Emergencies Act, which grants a president powers to take unilateral acts in times of crisis, was “a non-starter”.Teenager’s plea – A Saudi teenager who fled her family claiming physical and psychological abuse has barricaded herself in a hotel room in Bangkok after being refused onward passage to Australia. Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun, 18, has renounced Islam and fears she will be killed if she returns to Saudi Arabia. A friend close to her said the threats to her life were real. Thai immigration officials said they would force her to board a plane to Kuwait on Monday but it left without her. She is refusing to leave her room until she sees the United Nations high commissioner for refugees.The re-emergence of the disgraced doctor Andrew Wakefield has fuelled a resurgence of vaccine scepticism among rightwing populists. After a surge in measles outbreaks across the EU in 2018, Sarah Boseley looks back at how confidence in the MMR vaccine was dented after Wakefield’s discredited campaign against it.

With Theresa May fighting for her deal– and her career – the screening of Brexit: The Uncivil War has taken us back to where it all began. Stephen Moss has spoken to some of the protagonists depicted in James Graham’s film and most agree that it is brilliantly acted, with Benedict Cumberbatch outstanding as the leave strategist Dominic Cummings. Some quibble about the details though, with arch-leaver Daniel Hannan complaining that Michael Gove is portrayed as a “fool” and that it is written too much from a remain perspective. Peter Mandelson has the last word, however, saying that the film only makes you wonder: “What on earth was it all for? What has the country gained?”Darren Currie, Barnet’s caretaker manager, praised the fearlessness of his side after they provided the biggest shock of the day in the FA Cup to reach the fourth round by beating Sheffield United at Bramall Lane. England’s all-time-leading scorer, Wayne Rooney, was arrested in the US for being drunk and swearing in public at a Washington DC airport. The three-times Formula One world champion Niki Lauda has been admitted to hospital with flu five months after a lung transplant. The Football Association has launched an investigation after Tottenham Hostpur Ladies defender Renée Hector alleged monkey noises were directed at her by an opposition player during a game on Sunday. And former Spain and Barcelona star Andrés Iniesta has been criticised on social media for posting a photo showing him with a group of people, including two in blackface, as part of the Three Kings Day celebration in Spain.Away from the markets, a survey by the TUC warns that the UK’s household debt mountain has reached a new peak, with homes now owing an average of £15,385 to credit card firms, banks and other lenders. The figures do not include mortgage debt. The study says each household has added an average of £886 to their debt in the past year. On foreign exchanges, the pound is buying $1.275 and €1.115.The government’s 10-year NHS plan is published today and dominates coverage.

Photograph:  Bryan O’BrienJust one in 25 Leaving Cert students believe the exam is a fair and accurate assessment of their knowledge and skills, according to a new survey. The study also found a vast majority of students (76 per cent) support a move towards continuous assessment to help ease the pressure and stress linked to summer exams.However, the poll of students, parents and teachers shows very mixed views on whether the Leaving Cert system should be reformed.For example, students are the only group who would support a teacher correcting their own students’ assessment (51 per cent). These support levels drop significantly among parents (30 per cent) and principals, deputy principals and teachers (22 per cent).The findings are contained in a survey report, Senior Cycle Reform – What Do You Want?, commissioned by the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals (NAPD).It is based on responses from hundreds of students who completed the Leaving Cert in the past five years, as well as hundreds of principals, deputy principals and teachers.The finding comes at a time when policymakers are reviewing the senior cycle with a view to producing proposed reforms later this year.Overall, a tiny proportion of students (4 per cent) feel the Leaving Cert is fair and is an accurate assessment of what they have learned. A small minority of parents (15 per cent) and teachers (28 per cent) also feel it accurately assesses students.The vast majority of students believe the exam does not prepare them for third level (78 per cent) or for the world of work (93 per cent). There were similar, though less pronounced, trends among parents and teachers.A majority of teachers (60 per cent) felt the Leaving Cert did not prepare students for third level, while there was a more even split among parents (52 per cent).Clive Byrne, NAPD director, said that, initially, it was unsettling to see so few students, principals, deputy principals and teachers feel the Leaving Cert in its current format is fair and accurately assesses students. “However, and more importantly, what it also points to is a huge appetite for a change among all stakeholders,” he said. In response to the report’s findings, the NAPD has set out recommendations to support senior cycle reform. They include the establishment of a new citizens’ assembly on education bringing together all stakeholders to fast-track the senior cycle reform process.It also wants the inclusion of an additional practical component as part of the Leaving Cert exam assessment process.“These recommendations are realistic, achievable and, most importantly, will modernise our education system which has fallen behind the technological advancements in all other sectors,” Mr Byrne said.He said reform needed to be prioritised by the Minister for Education and policymakers involved in reviewing the senior cycle.“We have seen small changes over recent years . . . However, we need more than small steps. We in the NAPD want to lead the voice for change, and to ensure this critical conversation continues,” he said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3749463.1546809446!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"leo varadkar praises theresa may s significant  on border","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has praised British prime minister Theresa May’s latest comments on the Irish Border. File photograph: Tom HonanPA Wire Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said British prime minister Theresa May’s acceptance that ensuring a seamless Irish Border post-Brexit needed to involve more than warm words was helpful. The Taoiseach made the comments on Sunday, the first day of his week-long trip to Africa, after an interview Mrs May gave on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show.During the interview, the British prime minister stated that solid action was required to avoid a hard Border after the UK leaves the EU in March.Mr Varadkar described Mrs May’s comments as significant. “One thing the prime minister said today which I think is very valid, and I hope will be listened to, is avoiding a hard Border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland is not just the case of people saying they don’t want one,” said Mr Varadkar.“It is also necessary to give practical and legal effect to that. “That means agreeing the same customs rules and full regulatory alignment. That is what is required to avoid a hard Border. “We need more than good intent and warm words. We need a treaty that can give effect to the practical considerations.”Mrs May faces a crucial ballot this month in the House of Commons, when MPs vote on whether to accept the UK’s withdrawal agreement with the EU.Mr Varadkar on Sunday dismissed the idea of the Republic as having any role as a persuader in the debate preceding the vote. Mr Varadkar was speaking in Mali, where he met Irish troops who are currently serving with the EU training force in the country.

Photograph: Jeff OversBBCHandoutA formal exchange of letters between the EU and the UK, stipulating that the Northern Ireland backstop will be temporary and superseded by a comprehensive trade deal, is to be examined by officials as a way to break the Brexit impasse at Westminster.The moves, likely to be approved by the Government, come as British prime minister Theresa May steps up efforts to secure the backing of the House of Commons for the agreement reached with the EU on the UK’s withdrawal.Mrs May on Sunday insisted that the vote – postponed before Christmas – would go ahead next week, but the DUP, which props up her government, described the backstop as “the poison which makes any vote for the withdrawal agreement so toxic”.Mrs May was sticking firmly to her position that the backstop – a mechanism that aims to insure there is no hard Irish border should the UK not reach a deal – was a necessary part of the agreement. Her comments were welcomed by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, who was speaking on the first day to a trip to Mali.“One thing the prime minister said today which I think is very valid and I hope will be listened to is that avoiding a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland is not just the case of people saying they don’t want one,” he said.

Mrs May told the BBC she would work to secure further assurances from EU leaders on the backstop to assuage members of her Conservative Party and the DUP.DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds said that, following engagement between his party and Downing Street, “the fundamental problems which make this a bad deal appear not to have changed”. Mrs May cautioned that between Tory MPs seeking “a perfect Brexit” and Labour MPs seeking a second referendum, “the danger there is we end up with no Brexit at all”.Mrs May’s allies were continuing efforts to turn around huge opposition to the backstop among her MPs, with reports suggesting a variety of mechanisms, including consulting the EU Court of Justice on its temporary nature.Irish and EU sources were clear that anything which affected the legal text of the withdrawal agreement would not be possible. The exchange of letters setting out each side’s understanding of the intended temporary nature of the backstop is said to be more realistic. Some sources expressed scepticism that it would be sufficient to win over the DUP and Tory Brexiteers. EU leaders are keen to offer Mrs May help in her efforts to pass the treaty at Westminster but are wary that any concessions or guarantees to the British would be “banked” and that Mrs May would return to Brussels seeking further movement, perhaps after losing next week’s vote.Irish and EU sources believe that, even if she loses next week’s vote, Mrs May will continue to seek approval for her deal, returning to the House of Commons at a later date. Mrs May repeatedly refused to rule out such a move on Sunday.Mr Varadkar dismissed the idea of Ireland having any role as a persuader in the debate preceding the crucial vote in the House of Commons next Monday. “Ultimately the vote and decision by the British parliament at Westminster is a decision for them. You have to weigh up on the one hand our desire to see it ratified with the possibility that that could backfire if we were trying to tell another parliament, another country, how they should vote.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Nick BradshawThe leadership of a nurses’ union is to meet today to discuss a series of 24-hour strikes amid growing signs of hardening attitudes in Government towards their pay demands.The executive of the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation (INMO) is gathering over the next two days to discuss its plans for work stoppages in the coming weeks following an overwhelming vote in favour of strike action by its members before Christmas in support of their pay claim.However, speaking to journalists this weekend, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said the Government would not reopen the pay agreement it has with all public servants to give a special deal to the nurses.Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe, writing in the Sunday Business Post, said that acceding to the nurses’ pay demands would “take us back to the bad old days of unsustainable and unaffordable pay rises with disastrous consequences for the public finances and, ultimately, taxpayers”. Mr Varadkar said any extra money this year would be used to protect sectors where jobs are vulnerable because of Brexit. He said he understood the “depth of feeling” among nurses but stressed that the Government would not deviate from the pay deal in place with the public-sector unions.“They voted by a very large margin in favour of industrial action. It’s important that we engage with all three of the nursing unions – the INMO, the PNA and Siptu, which hasn’t balloted to strike. I’d like to see that happen. Perhaps we can avoid a strike in that way,” he said.Senior Government figures say that there is a strong feeling in Government Buildings that the administration will have to hang tough in the upcoming dispute with the nurses – not least because other unions would immediately follow with their own pay claims if the Government acceded to the nurses’ demands.It means that the Government is facing strikes by more than 40,000 nurses in the coming weeks. There are also potential industrial relations difficulties on the horizon involving teachers, healthcare assistants and other hospital staff. The leadership of the Psychiatric Nurses Association (PNA) will meet on Thursday to discuss their options for industrial action.Custom and practice in the health service would suggest any such stoppages would not take place before the beginning of February given the requirement to serve notice. Legally the unions could take industrial action seven days after making their decisions next week.The unions will have to decide on whether, for example, all nurses will strike on the same day or whether there should be rolling strikes in different parts of the country. As part of the strikes, INMO members would withdraw their labour but would continue to provide emergency and life-saving care.The INMO has sought pay parity with groups such as physiotherapists and speech and language therapists. They argue that their members are paid about €7,000 a year less than staff in therapy grades but work more hours.In September the Government proposed, on foot of recommendations from the Public Service Pay Commission, a €20 million package of measures to tackle recruitment and retention problems. This was decisively rejected by the INMO and PNA."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000140439032_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parliament accused conflict interest rejects nda debate","story":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, refused to allow Maria Miller to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerfulHouse of CommonsMaria Miller, the Tory MP, last night accused Parliament of a conflict of interest over Britain\u0027s MeToo scandal after it emerged she had been blocked from questioning the Government over it.The Daily  can reveal John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, yesterday refused to allow Ms Miller, who chairs the women \u0026amp equalities Commons select committee, to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerful, including the Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.Helen Jones, chairman of the petitions select committee, also rejected calls to allow a parliamentary debate on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after two separate petitions demanding a change to the law between them secured 250,000 signatures. It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

be allowed to use screens for an hour before bedtime, according to the first UK guidance for parents.The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health said there was no safe amount of total daily screen time, but urged parents to show “tough love” in setting age-appropriate limits.In particular, the advice says parents should take firm action if time on smartphones and videogames is “displacing” other activities - such as sleep, exercise and face-to-face socialising.And its experts urged parents to “practise what they preach” - and spend less time of their leisure time glued to tablets and phones.The guidance comes alongside a systematic review of the scientific evidence regarding the health impact of screen time, published on Friday in BMJ Open.It found moderately strong evidence for a link between greater screen time and depressive symptoms.Researchers said it appeared that the “displacement of positive activities” - in particular, lost sleep, as a result of time spent scrolling - was the most convincing explanation for the link.And they said the impact of blue light on screens on the ability to sleep was likely to be a factor.Dr Max Davie, from the RCPCH, said stopping access to all screens for at least an hour before sleep was a  “sensible rule of thumb”.“The process of going to sleep is a physiological process involving the secretion of melatonin and screens appear to interfere with that,” he said.Researchers said the review also found links between high levels of screen time and excess weight - perhaps because children were likely to consume more snacks while staring at a screen.The college also urged parents to negotiate “age appropriate” boundaries on screen time with children, with firm consequences if such limits were breached.Dr Davie said families needed to ensure that screen time was “under control” - for adults as well as children.“Children do learn from example rather than instruction. It\u0027s difficult to impose strict limits on your children\u0027s screen use if you are constantly on screens yourself. It\u0027s much better to be authoritative about screens if you practise what you preach,” he said.“We suggest that age appropriate boundaries are established, negotiated by parent and child that everyone in the family understands. When these boundaries are not respected, actions need to be put in place with parents making consequences clear.”Four ways to keep your child safe onlineProf Russell Viner, the college’s president, said: “If you are authoritative - tough love and giving clear boundaries and warmth, that works.”The chief medical officer is currently considering setting new recommendations on screen time for children. But the college shied away from recommending a daily screen time limit for all children, saying more research was needed, particularly on the use of social media.So far, many studies on screen time have focussed on television habits, failing to keep up pace with the advent of websites and smart phones.Next week the head of the NHS is expected to unveil plans to expand children\u0027s mental health services to deal with the fallout from an explosion of social media.Simon Stevens has said the NHS has been left “picking up the pieces” of an epidemic of mental illness fuelled by digital overload.It comes after The  launched a duty of care campaign calling for more stringent regulation of sites like Facebook and Instagram, in order to protect children from harm.The expansion of mental health services for children - and the rollout of a four week target for treatment - are expected to form part of a 10-year plan for the NHS.Comment: Jeremy Corbyn\u0026#39s Brexit position is not as contemptible as it might appearSpotify entrepreneur facing new legal row after brother claims his name was \u0026#39dragged through the mud\u0026#39Sergei and Yulia Skripal could still be in UK and even be working for security service, experts claimPrivate schools should \u0026#39phase out\u0026#39 merit based scholarships in favour of bursaries, a leading headmistress saysData now as important a commodity as oil, leading QC saysDonald Trump suggests steel border barrier in bid to break deadlock over Mexico wallUS and North Korea \u0026#39negotiating a location\u0026#39 for second summit, Trump revealsBig Issue magazine launches \u0026#39augmented reality\u0026#39 technology to share stories of homelessness in BritainMinisters should introduce new rules to bar students from \u0026#39poor value\u0026#39 university courses that offer little  economic benefit, says think tankDivorced women missing out on pensions wealth, says former ministerOffice culture needs to change to allow fathers to \u0026#39run off\u0026#39 when children are ill, ex-BBC host saysHalf a million lives will be saved over the next decade under plans for gene revolution in NHSComment: The main military operation to destroy Isil is near, but the war against extremist is far from overLes Misérables, episode 2 review: a dentistry scene worse than your nightmaresElderly are being treated like \u0026#39Amazon parcels\u0026#39 with only 15 minutes handling time by care staff, former pensions minister warnsTheresa May holds Brexit crisis meeting to decide whether Parliament must sit through weekends and holidaysTime for MPs to grasp the nettle and unite behind a \u0026#39Common Market 2.0\u0026#39 BrexitFormer Tory minister launches Norway-style Brexit plan saying freedom of movement can be controlledComment: The British people won\u0026#39t be scared into backing a woeful Brexit deal nobody voted forSurrey train stabbing: Man charged with murder after father killed in front of sonWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 6 january 2019","story":"The Haxey Hood, and Smoking the Fool The official story is that in the 14th century, Lady de Mowbray, wife of an Isle landowner, John De Mowbray, was out riding towards Westwoodside on the hill that separates it from Haxey. As she went over the hill her silk riding hood was blown away by the wind. Thirteen farm workers in the field rushed to help and chased the hood all over the field. It was finally caught by one of the farm workers, but being too shy to hand it back to the lady, he gave it to one of the others to hand back to her. She thanked the farm worker who had returned the hood and said that he had acted like a Lord, whereas the worker who had actually caught the hood was a Fool. So amused was she by this act of chivalry and the resulting chase, that she donated 13 acres of land on condition that the chase for the hood would be re-enacted each year.

The realisation that you can’t be careless with data is really coming to the fore, he said. Young people, whilst they are big users of Facebook and other social media platforms, generally understand that their data is actually important to them and people must not misuse it.It has got intrinsic value and it’s a major resource now. If you have someone data you can become that person. You can have their bank you can have control over their email address.Companies are the custodians of it and they must use it in a way that is proper.The warning comes in the wake of the scandal over the harvesting of data from Facebook which was used by Cambridge Analytica. New GDPR rules, which came into force in  earlier this year, also mean that companies face harshers penalties for misuse or breaches of personal data. Mr Armstrong said: The hive which most people have in their homes which allows for remote control of heating and lighting through the thermostat can collect and analyse data and it can compare that.Anything that you have in your house, if you have an Alexa that’s a device that collects and analyses data. You say play my favourite song and it knows what your favourite song is, it  knows your shopping habits  - it knows a lot more about you than you perhaps would want it to.Research has shown that experts could even determine with 90 per cent accuracy what TV programme a person is watching based on the electrical signals coming from the home. Mr Armstrong, a barrister with The 36 Group chambers,  said that any company involved with these devices would have to be very careful and make sure they have specific consent. He said: The consumer has to understand, as a company I have to explain what I am going to do with your data and why I need it.

Together, the trio produced such viral R\u0026ampB spoofs as “I’m On a Boat”, “I Just Had Sex” and “Dick in a Box”, the latter winning an Emmy in 2007, its title engraved on the statuette’s base, according to custom.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialKieron Passaway of Vice recently argued the group’s 2008 follow-up, “Jizz in My Pants”, simultaneously a parody of hyper-sexualised music videos and male anxiety,\u0026nbspmarked a turning point in internet\u0026nbsphistory, bringing YouTube to prominence as a venue for professionally-produced original content and a “new frontier for toilet humour”.While the playful vulgarity The Lonely Island often trade in is nothing new, owing a debt to the “gross-out” comedies of the Nineties perfected by the Farrelly\u0026nbspBrothers and the American Pie series, the group bring it off in surprisingly sweet-natured, inclusive style and their affection for and knowledge of the genre they\u0027re satirising\u0026nbspis\u0026nbspobvious.Everything you need to know about the Golden Globes 2019The production values of their videos are extraordinarily high, an asset Samberg attributes to Schaffer’s technological prowess, as is the calibre of guest stars appearing in cameos. Justin Timberlake is a frequent collaborator while the likes of T-Pain, Akon and\u0026nbspKendrick Lamar have all appeared to generously send-up lazy hip-hop tropes.Michael Bolton’s appearance as himself on “Jack Sparrow”, allowing his preoccupation with the Pirates of the Caribbean films to derail their track together, is one of their most inspired moments, while\u0026nbsp“Motherlover”, in which Samberg and Timberlake propose a novel solution to the problem of finding Mother’s Day gifts, features two very game supporting turns from veteran actresses Patricia Clarkson and Susan Sarandon.The popularity of those videos, produced as SNL Digital Shorts, gave rise to three albums – Incredibad (2009), Turtleneck \u0026amp Chain (2011) and The Wack Album (2013) – as well as\u0026nbspPopstar, effectively a Lonely Island movie, in which Samberg\u0026nbspstarred as the deluded and self-sabotaging Bieber-esque\u0026nbspConner4Real.Samberg, Andre Braugher and Melissa Fumero in Brooklyn Nine-NineBrooklyn Nine-Nine has been Samberg’s\u0026nbspbiggest project since 2013. The show was cancelled by Fox after five seasons last May before being picked up by NBC just one\u0026nbspday later following a public outcry. Its sixth series premieres on 10 January 2019.\u0026nbspSamberg\u0026nbspappears as Die Hard-obsessed detective Jake Peralta\u0026nbspalongside former elementary school classmate Chelsea Peretti\u0026nbspand a talented supporting cast\u0026nbspincluding Andre Braugher, Stephanie Beatriz, Melissa Fumero and Terry Crews. The result is a gently progressive and warm comedy loaded with slapstick and ludicrous escapades.As that show commenced, the\u0026nbspcomedian married his long-term girlfriend Joanna Newsom, the renowned\u0026nbspsinger-songwriter and harpist. This unlikely couple\u0026nbspwere introduced after one of her concerts in 2008 by Samberg’s\u0026nbspSNL colleague\u0026nbspFred Armisen.Samberg described himself as a “superfan” of her work in conversation with Marc Maron in 2013 and said he regularly attended her shows before they met.The couple have a baby daughter and live in California.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

When adjusted for inflation, credit card debt is fractionally below a peak reached in Early\u0026nbsp2010 as the country emerged from one of the deepest recessions in its history.People with low incomes or living in poverty were turning to credit cards because of their heavy marketing and easy availability, according to David Steele of The Money Charity.Credit card lending continues to rise as interest rate hike loomsWhen personal loans are added in, each UK household has almost £8,000 of outstanding consumer credit.The Money Advice Service (MAS) estimates that 8.3 million people in the UK are over-indebted, and that 22 per cent of UK adults have less than £100 in savings, making them highly vulnerable to a financial shock such as losing their job or incurring unexpected bills.The precarious position of so many household could pose a wider threat, according to the BoE which warned more than a year ago that banks were in danger of underestimating the risks they face from being too lax in lending to consumers.\u0026nbspIf the economy were to enter a new downturn, lenders could incur £30bn of losses on their lending on credit cards, personal loans and for car finance, the BoE said in July 2017.But consumer credit, which includes credit cards, store cards, car finance and other loans grew 7.1 per cent in the year to the end of November to £215.4bn.Despite ongoing fears about the future of the economy as the UK prepares to leave the EU Britons have increased their total amount of credit card debt in every month since July 2013 as wages have lagged behind the rising cost of living.Earnings growth picked up to the highest level for a decade in the final quarter of 2018 but this has done little to make up for 10\u0026nbspyears of wage stagnation that has left average inflation-adjusted earnings still languishing below their pre-crisis levels.Sue Anderson of StepChange, which provides free advice for those facing debt problems, said credit cards are the single most common issue the charity encounters.\u0026nbsp“More than two thirds of people we helped in the first six months of last year had credit card debt, with an average of around £7,600 on their outstanding borrowing on cards,” Ms Anderson said.\u0026nbspConsumer credit growth slows in DecemberConsumer credit growth hits new 11-year highMore than a third of single mothers in debt, research findsOil-hungry companies are contributing to huge debt problems in Africa“Credit cards can be useful and convenient, and when used as originally intended for short-term purposes, can be a helpful way of timing payments.\u0026nbsp“But if borrowing builds up without being paid back on a monthly basis, it can become expensive and increasingly difficult to pay off – which is why the regulator is now requiring firms to take steps to help their customers address persistent credit card debt. If you are struggling to manage, seek free advice from a reputable debt charity.”The figures highlight a ide in the UK between those able to borrow at close to record-low rates against the value of their homes and others pressured into taking out high-cost credit in order to make ends meet.While interest rates have remained close to historic lows as the economy continues to grow slowly, the average APR on credit card lending bearing interest was 18.5 per cent in October 2018, higher than the 15 per cent seen in 2006 before the financial crisis.What to do if you want to reduce your credit card debt“Don’t panic,” says David Steele of The Money Charity. “Don’t get pressured into doing something before you have had time to take advice. There are usually managed ways out.”Contact\u0026nbspStepChange\u0026nbspon 0800 138 1111. Their professional advice is completely free and the line is open between\u0026nbsp8am\u0026nbspand\u0026nbsp8pm\u0026nbspMonday to Friday, or\u0026nbsp8am\u0026nbspand\u0026nbsp4pm\u0026nbspon Saturday.Before you call, fill out\u0026nbspStepChange’s online budget form which helps their advisors understand your particular situation.The charity offers a number of options to help, including debt management plans which allow you to lower your monthly repayments.Other tips from the Money Charity:Pay off more than the minimum amount if you canSome credit cards let you transfer the balance from another card. Transferring a debt from a card with a high rate of interest to one with low or 0 per cent interest could help you pay off the debt faster.Make an assessment of all of your borrowing across cards, loans, overdrafts etc. Make sure you are paying off those with the highest interest rates and charges firstWhen charges are taken into account, overdrafts can sometimes be more expensiveHowever, remember that credit cards should not take priority over debts such as Council Tax, rent or utilities, where the consequences of not paying may be worseA January 2018 report from the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) found that one in four of the UK’s poorest households are in arrears with debts or are spending a quarter of their income or more on debt repayments.Borrowers could face a further squeeze with the BoE\u0026nbspexpected to raise its benchmark interest rate further this year, a move that will probably be passed on to consumers.However, millions of consumers do not pay any interest on their credit card debt, either because they clear their balance each month or because they have secured a 0 per cent deal. Just under 45 per cent of credit card balances pay no interest, according to UK Finance, an industry trade body.Those paying high interest rates may be able to transfer their balance to a cheaper card or consolidate their debts into one loan with a lower rate.The average APR for a £5,000 personal loan in October 2018 was 7.7 per cent while for a £10,000 loan it was 3.8 per cent.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

If you were a bored teenager in the late 20th century, there was always Woolworths to loiter in.An American import, Woolworths first arrived in the UK in Edwardian Liverpool. The inaugural “penny and sixpence store” opened its doors on 5 November 1909 with a ceremony featuring a live orchestra, circus performers and fireworks.Pennsylvanian entrepreneur Frank Winfield Woolworth soon had 40 British branches up and running, proving his doubters within the US head office wrong. They initially feared venturing across the Atlantic might lead them into a commercial “bear’s den”.By 1930, the 400th branch of Woolworth was opened in Southport, Lancashire. By the time the brand’s popularity peaked in the 1960s, the company had 1,141 branches around the country.\u0026nbspKirkby New Town, Lancashire, in 1967 (George W HalesFox PhotosGetty)Woolworths began to run into trouble in the 1980s and responded by pulling out of the Irish market and abandoning its out-of-town hypermarket format stores as a failure. It also vacated its big city centre department store premises like Briggate in Leeds in favour of open single-storey shops.At the turn of the millennium, the company tried various means to stay afloat, attempting to rival Argos with a “Big Red Book” ordering scheme and hiring oddly matched celebrities like Jackie Chan and Kelly Osbourne for their advertising campaigns.\u0026nbspBy late 2008, administrators Deloitte had been called in and all remaining 807 stores were gradually closed, resulting in 27,000 job losses. Investor Theo Paphitis was among those interested in saving the day before abandoning the project as a lost cause.The last of the company\u0027s stock was being sold off at bargain prices.Asked about the closure, Brixton shopper Lucy Ferguson hit the nail on the head when she said: “The problem was, you never really knew what Woolworths sold.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The band appear reinvigorated, brimming with energy and self-assurance.Brent Cobb’s music is built around people and places. The country artist returns after the release of his acclaimed 2016 album Shine On Rainy Day with Providence Canyon a slice of blue-collar country offering fresh tales of Southern lifeThe Brighton metal band’s sublime second album is their most ambitious to date. Enlisting Adrian Bushby (Foo Fighters, Muse) on production was a master-stroke – with his help they offer up vast sonic landscapes that recall the drama of Darion Malakian’s Scars on Broadway record, DictatorOne moment opining the joys of leaving a party to pluck your eyebrows, the next raging over the gaslighting of assault survivors, Miya Folick’s debut album continues her habit of cracking the shiny veneer of pop, and unsettling the exceptions put upon a feminine voiceThough their themes remain in the gutter, Suede aspire to monuments, and The Blue Hour will stand as another sordid masterworkSix years after the release of her last LP Sun, Cat Power – whose struggles with alcoholism, addiction and mental health issues have been much publicised – demonstrates “both a newfound sense of calm, and strength” on her new albumHoly Hell offers up some of the best tracks of the band’s career, with a through-line that maintains Tom Searle\u0027s role as an integral part of Architects, particularly on “Doomsday”, while “Hereafter” feels like the song that launches the album’s momentum. Listening to vocalist Sam Carter scream: “I wasn’t braced for the fallout” is intensely cathartic – even non-metal fans will find it hard not to be moved by the band’s sincerity. (RO)Even in discarding such basic pop necessities as melody, Robyn has managed to create a masterpiece. With her first album in seven years, the Swedish singer delivers nine songs that glow and pulse with bittersweet sensuality, sung in a voice that sifts over the synths like icing sugar1040 31. Florence \u0026amp the Machine - High as HopeOn Florence \u0026amp The Machine’s latest album High As Hope, her voice is just as powerful when she holds back. She seems to attribute much of this calmness to her new-found sobriety – she quit alcohol a few years ago and looks back on her twenties with a mix of fondness and regret1140 30. Teyana Taylor - Keep that Same EnergyShe’s not restricted by genre constraints, and K.T.S.E. (Keep That Same Energy) is a pleasant surprise. Embellished with producer Kanye West’s keen ear for samples, it blends Eighties nostalgia with fresh rap and R\u0026ampB. At the core of the project is Taylor’s love of pleasing herself, her relationship with her husband, and being a mother1240 29. The 1975 – A Brief Inquiry into Online RelationshipsOn their third and best album, A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships, The 1975 have created what so many post-Radiohead bands couldn’t: a coherent pop statement with enough hope, radical honesty and genre-ning breadth to make sense across ided generations1340 28. Kamasi Washington - Heaven and EarthFor a new generation, Kamasi Washington is largely responsible for the revitalised interest in jazz in modern music, most notably with his work on Kendrick Lamar’s jazz-heavy masterpiece, To Pimp a Butterfly. On Heaven and Earth, the Los Angeles saxophonist and band leader splits his second record in two halves: the urgent Earth side explores reality while Heaven deals in dreamy opulenceThe 21-year-old south London MC Novelist’s debut album is a clear, concise look at the current social and political landscape of the UK, offering up astute observations on black masculinity and the music industry along the way.The German composer’s 10th solo album is a stirring, complex work that draws on the concept of connection a fluidity in the way the universe worksCamila Cabello\u0027s debut solo album is the first time fans have been able to see her clearlyOn Mitski\u0027s brilliant fifth album she is desperate and lonely one minute, hardened and withdrawn the next. Her music, which exists in a space between fierce, guitar-led walls of noise and soft, delicate balladry, feels like an open wound – and Be The Cowboy is no different. (AP)Frontman Olly Alexander is offering fans their own generational pop icon: a young man who has the courage to put all of that vibrant, dynamic character on full displayOn Tell Me How You Really Feel, Courtney Barnett turns her keen eye inwards, exploring anxiety and depression while coming to terms with her own emotional life. Written as her burgeoning stature and hectic touring schedule began to take their toll, these 10 songs are Barnett’s attempt to work through her vulnerability and sadnessFor Negro Swan, Blood Orange’s fourth album, the multi-instrumentalist has dreamed up a 16-song suite that weaves together impressionist psych-pop and interstellar funk, late-Seventies Marvin Gaye and early-Eighties Prince, with some tangled ballads and insomniac blues reminiscent of Elliott Smith and King Krule thrown into the pot2140 20. Cardi B - Invasion of PrivacyWhen she sings off the hook, it’s just another moment where Cardi B runs to her own rhythm: because nothing about Invasion of Privacy is formulaicWith producer SOPHIE on board (whose own album, also released this year, is well worth your time), they explore the anxieties and frustrations of being a teenage girl through clattering beats and Nokia samples. The result is exceptionalGhetts re-evaluates much of what he said on Ghetto Gospel, when he was frustrated and angry with the world. Now he looks more to the future, whether on “Next of Kin”, where he speaks from the perspective of a mother carrying her child’s coffin, or “Black Rose”, which addresses fears for his daughter in a society that places double standards on black women. It’s a reminder that grime is so much more than violence and threats. (RO)2440 17. Cypress Hill – Elephants on AcidElephants on Acid is a 21-track monster, loaded with twists and turns that take you as far as Egypt, where Muggs recorded much of “Band of Gypsies” – teaming up with artists on oud, sitar, keyboard and guitar, as well as some of its street musicians. Its lead hook harks back to the glitchy shrieks of “How I Could Just Kill a Man” from their eponymous 1991 debut.His brilliant fourth album Love Is Magic takes listeners on a similar thrill ride, dominated by swirling loops of grand, romantic melody, sly twists of sardonic wit and heart-stopping drops of sheer honestyHis third record, produced entirely by Kanye West, could easily have been an EP, coming in at just seven songs and 21 minutes. While many fans were disappointed by the erratic and self-indulgent nature of some of West’s other releases, including his own album ye, the beats on Daytona are sample-heavy and superb the instrumentation is sparse but all the more impactful for itSince her debut single – the AK Paul-featuring “So Good” – was released in 2014, London-based singer-songwriter NAO has hovered around a near-perfect brand of sultry, neo-soul-inflected R\u0026ampB. Four years later, and she seems to have mastered itThe third solo album from the US artist stars an overwhelming number of (uncredited) guest features, producers and co-writers, but, ultimately, it’s his own, most career-defining work to date. Bloom captures the A to Z’s of modern queer love with pinpoint precisionHoward’s music has always, above all, reflected the shifts and moods in nature, while he sings poetic lyrics in his signature low, warm murmur. On Noonday Dream, he expands on the Cornish landscape that impacted his earlier work and brings in sounds and instruments that spark the imagination for places further afield, in the most exquisite way3140 10. Shame – Songs of PraiseDistinguishing themselves from the hordes of other white, indie guitar bands that emerged around summer 2017, south London natives Shame manage to make raw, bleeding anger on their debut album sound articulate.Gaika broke new ground on the UK music scene and asserted himself as one of the most provocative and multitalented young artists of this generation with his debut album, Basic VolumeTamino’s music on his debut Amir draws on the old-world romance of his grandfather – a famous Arabic musician and actor ¬– but also embodies the genre-less quality of much modern pop. The musical heritage that is so essential to the 22-year-old’s sound comes to life in the dramatic, sweeping instrumentation on a song like “So It Goes” haunting, graceful violins, bold drum beats and the shimmer of a tambourine transport the listener entirely.Mac Miller turned his anguish into one of the year’s most disarming records3540 6. Colter Wall - Song of the PlainsWall’s songwriting is as stark as it comes: his plain-speaking manner is delivered in a slow, melancholy drawl that paints him as some lonely cowboy – the last man of the West, as he describes in the most matter-of-fact terms how a bullet ripped in to “poor Wild Bill”. There’s no fuss in the instrumentation, either, mostly just gentle picking or brisk, deep thrums on Wall’s acoustic guitar, which are bolstered by icy laps of pedal steel and the occasional harmonica. It’s effective in the simplest of ways – and allows the listener’s imagination to do the restKendrick Lamar co-executive produced the Black Panther soundtrack, has writing credits on its 14 tracks, and appears in various skits and features. But his most essential job on this album is that of the curator, as he brings in a staggering array of talent – from Anderson .Paak, SZA and Future to South African gqom (EDM) artist Babes Wodumo and alt-rapper Yungen Blakrok.Kacey Musgraves third album flips between wide-eyed country pop and disco-electronica. Aided by co-writers and producers Daniel Tashian and Ian Fitchuk – both Nashville stalwarts – Musgraves conjures up a feeling of lightness as she melds the traditional and futuristic.Dirty Computer is Monáe’s gift to the LGBT+ community, non-binary people, black men and women… anyone who faces stigma and abuse just for embracing their true selves. It’s a message of love and hope to anyone who fears what is different, but who has capacity to learn and know better. And it’s seemingly a gift to herself, as well. (RO)Tranquility Base Hotel \u0026amp Casino feels more like an interlude between AM and a seventh Arctic Monkeys album – a delve into the bizarre, where even the Steinway piano has its own character. On “The Ultracheese”, the descending piano chords symbolise a kind of final bow the last soliloquy of the night before the curtain closes. Few bands today are as brave as this.Letissier makes her vintage synths snap, crackle, pop, fizz, freeze, squelch, shimmer and soar. There’s even a shattered glass effect (on “Stranger”) to complete the Old Skool Electronica bingo card. Treble notes bounce from air-cushioned soles. Bass lines lasso your hips. Chiffon layers of Letissier’s Anglo-French vocals glide around your neck and shoulders and roll them back. It’s ridiculously danceable.Thom Yorke’s first ever soundtrack summons the darkness of horror, and the terror of blood and evil, over 25 tracks.Marauder is Interpol’s most experimental to date, blending everything from rough garage rock to Motown rhythms. The band appear reinvigorated, brimming with energy and self-assurance.Brent Cobb’s music is built around people and places. The country artist returns after the release of his acclaimed 2016 album Shine On Rainy Day with Providence Canyon a slice of blue-collar country offering fresh tales of Southern lifeThe Brighton metal band’s sublime second album is their most ambitious to date. Enlisting Adrian Bushby (Foo Fighters, Muse) on production was a master-stroke – with his help they offer up vast sonic landscapes that recall the drama of Darion Malakian’s Scars on Broadway record, DictatorOne moment opining the joys of leaving a party to pluck your eyebrows, the next raging over the gaslighting of assault survivors, Miya Folick’s debut album continues her habit of cracking the shiny veneer of pop, and unsettling the exceptions put upon a feminine voiceThough their themes remain in the gutter, Suede aspire to monuments, and The Blue Hour will stand as another sordid masterworkSix years after the release of her last LP Sun, Cat Power – whose struggles with alcoholism, addiction and mental health issues have been much publicised – demonstrates “both a newfound sense of calm, and strength” on her new albumHoly Hell offers up some of the best tracks of the band’s career, with a through-line that maintains Tom Searle\u0027s role as an integral part of Architects, particularly on “Doomsday”, while “Hereafter” feels like the song that launches the album’s momentum. Listening to vocalist Sam Carter scream: “I wasn’t braced for the fallout” is intensely cathartic – even non-metal fans will find it hard not to be moved by the band’s sincerity. (RO)Even in discarding such basic pop necessities as melody, Robyn has managed to create a masterpiece. With her first album in seven years, the Swedish singer delivers nine songs that glow and pulse with bittersweet sensuality, sung in a voice that sifts over the synths like icing sugar1040 31. Florence \u0026amp the Machine - High as HopeOn Florence \u0026amp The Machine’s latest album High As Hope, her voice is just as powerful when she holds back. She seems to attribute much of this calmness to her new-found sobriety – she quit alcohol a few years ago and looks back on her twenties with a mix of fondness and regret1140 30. Teyana Taylor - Keep that Same EnergyShe’s not restricted by genre constraints, and K.T.S.E. (Keep That Same Energy) is a pleasant surprise. Embellished with producer Kanye West’s keen ear for samples, it blends Eighties nostalgia with fresh rap and R\u0026ampB. At the core of the project is Taylor’s love of pleasing herself, her relationship with her husband, and being a mother1240 29. The 1975 – A Brief Inquiry into Online RelationshipsOn their third and best album, A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships, The 1975 have created what so many post-Radiohead bands couldn’t: a coherent pop statement with enough hope, radical honesty and genre-ning breadth to make sense across ided generations1340 28. Kamasi Washington - Heaven and EarthFor a new generation, Kamasi Washington is largely responsible for the revitalised interest in jazz in modern music, most notably with his work on Kendrick Lamar’s jazz-heavy masterpiece, To Pimp a Butterfly. On Heaven and Earth, the Los Angeles saxophonist and band leader splits his second record in two halves: the urgent Earth side explores reality while Heaven deals in dreamy opulenceThe 21-year-old south London MC Novelist’s debut album is a clear, concise look at the current social and political landscape of the UK, offering up astute observations on black masculinity and the music industry along the way.The German composer’s 10th solo album is a stirring, complex work that draws on the concept of connection a fluidity in the way the universe worksCamila Cabello\u0027s debut solo album is the first time fans have been able to see her clearlyOn Mitski\u0027s brilliant fifth album she is desperate and lonely one minute, hardened and withdrawn the next. Her music, which exists in a space between fierce, guitar-led walls of noise and soft, delicate balladry, feels like an open wound – and Be The Cowboy is no different. (AP)Frontman Olly Alexander is offering fans their own generational pop icon: a young man who has the courage to put all of that vibrant, dynamic character on full displayOn Tell Me How You Really Feel, Courtney Barnett turns her keen eye inwards, exploring anxiety and depression while coming to terms with her own emotional life. Written as her burgeoning stature and hectic touring schedule began to take their toll, these 10 songs are Barnett’s attempt to work through her vulnerability and sadnessFor Negro Swan, Blood Orange’s fourth album, the multi-instrumentalist has dreamed up a 16-song suite that weaves together impressionist psych-pop and interstellar funk, late-Seventies Marvin Gaye and early-Eighties Prince, with some tangled ballads and insomniac blues reminiscent of Elliott Smith and King Krule thrown into the pot2140 20. Cardi B - Invasion of PrivacyWhen she sings off the hook, it’s just another moment where Cardi B runs to her own rhythm: because nothing about Invasion of Privacy is formulaicWith producer SOPHIE on board (whose own album, also released this year, is well worth your time), they explore the anxieties and frustrations of being a teenage girl through clattering beats and Nokia samples. The result is exceptionalGhetts re-evaluates much of what he said on Ghetto Gospel, when he was frustrated and angry with the world. Now he looks more to the future, whether on “Next of Kin”, where he speaks from the perspective of a mother carrying her child’s coffin, or “Black Rose”, which addresses fears for his daughter in a society that places double standards on black women. It’s a reminder that grime is so much more than violence and threats. (RO)2440 17. Cypress Hill – Elephants on AcidElephants on Acid is a 21-track monster, loaded with twists and turns that take you as far as Egypt, where Muggs recorded much of “Band of Gypsies” – teaming up with artists on oud, sitar, keyboard and guitar, as well as some of its street musicians. Its lead hook harks back to the glitchy shrieks of “How I Could Just Kill a Man” from their eponymous 1991 debut.His brilliant fourth album Love Is Magic takes listeners on a similar thrill ride, dominated by swirling loops of grand, romantic melody, sly twists of sardonic wit and heart-stopping drops of sheer honestyHis third record, produced entirely by Kanye West, could easily have been an EP, coming in at just seven songs and 21 minutes. While many fans were disappointed by the erratic and self-indulgent nature of some of West’s other releases, including his own album ye, the beats on Daytona are sample-heavy and superb the instrumentation is sparse but all the more impactful for itSince her debut single – the AK Paul-featuring “So Good” – was released in 2014, London-based singer-songwriter NAO has hovered around a near-perfect brand of sultry, neo-soul-inflected R\u0026ampB. Four years later, and she seems to have mastered itThe third solo album from the US artist stars an overwhelming number of (uncredited) guest features, producers and co-writers, but, ultimately, it’s his own, most career-defining work to date. Bloom captures the A to Z’s of modern queer love with pinpoint precisionHoward’s music has always, above all, reflected the shifts and moods in nature, while he sings poetic lyrics in his signature low, warm murmur. On Noonday Dream, he expands on the Cornish landscape that impacted his earlier work and brings in sounds and instruments that spark the imagination for places further afield, in the most exquisite way3140 10. Shame – Songs of PraiseDistinguishing themselves from the hordes of other white, indie guitar bands that emerged around summer 2017, south London natives Shame manage to make raw, bleeding anger on their debut album sound articulate.Gaika broke new ground on the UK music scene and asserted himself as one of the most provocative and multitalented young artists of this generation with his debut album, Basic VolumeTamino’s music on his debut Amir draws on the old-world romance of his grandfather – a famous Arabic musician and actor ¬– but also embodies the genre-less quality of much modern pop. The musical heritage that is so essential to the 22-year-old’s sound comes to life in the dramatic, sweeping instrumentation on a song like “So It Goes” haunting, graceful violins, bold drum beats and the shimmer of a tambourine transport the listener entirely.Mac Miller turned his anguish into one of the year’s most disarming records3540 6. Colter Wall - Song of the PlainsWall’s songwriting is as stark as it comes: his plain-speaking manner is delivered in a slow, melancholy drawl that paints him as some lonely cowboy – the last man of the West, as he describes in the most matter-of-fact terms how a bullet ripped in to “poor Wild Bill”. There’s no fuss in the instrumentation, either, mostly just gentle picking or brisk, deep thrums on Wall’s acoustic guitar, which are bolstered by icy laps of pedal steel and the occasional harmonica. It’s effective in the simplest of ways – and allows the listener’s imagination to do the restKendrick Lamar co-executive produced the Black Panther soundtrack, has writing credits on its 14 tracks, and appears in various skits and features. But his most essential job on this album is that of the curator, as he brings in a staggering array of talent – from Anderson .Paak, SZA and Future to South African gqom (EDM) artist Babes Wodumo and alt-rapper Yungen Blakrok.Kacey Musgraves third album flips between wide-eyed country pop and disco-electronica. Aided by co-writers and producers Daniel Tashian and Ian Fitchuk – both Nashville stalwarts – Musgraves conjures up a feeling of lightness as she melds the traditional and futuristic.Dirty Computer is Monáe’s gift to the LGBT+ community, non-binary people, black men and women… anyone who faces stigma and abuse just for embracing their true selves. It’s a message of love and hope to anyone who fears what is different, but who has capacity to learn and know better. And it’s seemingly a gift to herself, as well. (RO)Tranquility Base Hotel \u0026amp Casino feels more like an interlude between AM and a seventh Arctic Monkeys album – a delve into the bizarre, where even the Steinway piano has its own character. On “The Ultracheese”, the descending piano chords symbolise a kind of final bow the last soliloquy of the night before the curtain closes. Few bands today are as brave as this.Letissier makes her vintage synths snap, crackle, pop, fizz, freeze, squelch, shimmer and soar. There’s even a shattered glass effect (on “Stranger”) to complete the Old Skool Electronica bingo card. Treble notes bounce from air-cushioned soles. Bass lines lasso your hips. Chiffon layers of Letissier’s Anglo-French vocals glide around your neck and shoulders and roll them back. It’s ridiculously danceable.Over the past two decades, Kelly has faced a number of accusations of sexual misconduct.

When adjusted for inflation, credit card debt is fractionally below a peak reached in Early\u0026nbsp2010 as the country emerged from one of the deepest recessions in its history.People with low incomes or living in poverty were turning to credit cards because of their heavy marketing and easy availability, according to David Steele of The Money Charity.Credit card lending continues to rise as interest rate hike loomsWhen personal loans are added in, each UK household has almost £8,000 of outstanding consumer credit.The Money Advice Service (MAS) estimates that 8.3 million people in the UK are over-indebted, and that 22 per cent of UK adults have less than £100 in savings, making them highly vulnerable to a financial shock such as losing their job or incurring unexpected bills.The precarious position of so many household could pose a wider threat, according to the BoE which warned more than a year ago that banks were in danger of underestimating the risks they face from being too lax in lending to consumers.\u0026nbspIf the economy were to enter a new downturn, lenders could incur £30bn of losses on their lending on credit cards, personal loans and for car finance, the BoE said in July 2017.But consumer credit, which includes credit cards, store cards, car finance and other loans grew 7.1 per cent in the year to the end of November to £215.4bn.Despite ongoing fears about the future of the economy as the UK prepares to leave the EU Britons have increased their total amount of credit card debt in every month since July 2013 as wages have lagged behind the rising cost of living.Earnings growth picked up to the highest level for a decade in the final quarter of 2018 but this has done little to make up for 10\u0026nbspyears of wage stagnation that has left average inflation-adjusted earnings still languishing below their pre-crisis levels.Sue Anderson of StepChange, which provides free advice for those facing debt problems, said credit cards are the single most common issue the charity encounters.\u0026nbsp“More than two thirds of people we helped in the first six months of last year had credit card debt, with an average of around £7,600 on their outstanding borrowing on cards,” Ms Anderson said.\u0026nbspConsumer credit growth slows in DecemberConsumer credit growth hits new 11-year highMore than a third of single mothers in debt, research findsOil-hungry companies are contributing to huge debt problems in Africa“Credit cards can be useful and convenient, and when used as originally intended for short-term purposes, can be a helpful way of timing payments.\u0026nbsp“But if borrowing builds up without being paid back on a monthly basis, it can become expensive and increasingly difficult to pay off – which is why the regulator is now requiring firms to take steps to help their customers address persistent credit card debt. If you are struggling to manage, seek free advice from a reputable debt charity.”The figures highlight a ide in the UK between those able to borrow at close to record-low rates against the value of their homes and others pressured into taking out high-cost credit in order to make ends meet.While interest rates have remained close to historic lows as the economy continues to grow slowly, the average APR on credit card lending bearing interest was 18.5 per cent in October 2018, higher than the 15 per cent seen in 2006 before the financial crisis.What to do if you want to reduce your credit card debt“Don’t panic,” says David Steele of The Money Charity. “Don’t get pressured into doing something before you have had time to take advice. There are usually managed ways out.”Contact\u0026nbspStepChange\u0026nbspon 0800 138 1111.

Transferring a debt from a card with a high rate of interest to one with low or 0 per cent interest could help you pay off the debt faster.Make an assessment of all of your borrowing across cards, loans, overdrafts etc. Make sure you are paying off those with the highest interest rates and charges firstWhen charges are taken into account, overdrafts can sometimes be more expensiveHowever, remember that credit cards should not take priority over debts such as Council Tax, rent or utilities, where the consequences of not paying may be worseA January 2018 report from the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) found that one in four of the UK’s poorest households are in arrears with debts or are spending a quarter of their income or more on debt repayments.Borrowers could face a further squeeze with the BoE\u0026nbspexpected to raise its benchmark interest rate further this year, a move that will probably be passed on to consumers.However, millions of consumers do not pay any interest on their credit card debt, either because they clear their balance each month or because they have secured a 0 per cent deal. Just under 45 per cent of credit card balances pay no interest, according to UK Finance, an industry trade body.Those paying high interest rates may be able to transfer their balance to a cheaper card or consolidate their debts into one loan with a lower rate.The average APR for a £5,000 personal loan in October 2018 was 7.7 per cent while for a £10,000 loan it was 3.8 per cent.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

For the next few hours, we will be posting our predictions for the night along with any news coming out of Hollywood.\u0026nbspFirst off, our predictions for Best Motion Picture – Drama.\u0026nbspThe nominees are:\u0026nbspBlack Panther,\u0026nbspBlacKkKlansman,\u0026nbspBohemian Rhapsody,\u0026nbspIf Beale Streat Could Talk and\u0026nbspA Star Is Born.\u0026nbspWill Win: A Star is BornShould Win: If Beale Street Could Talk\u0026nbspOur critic says:\u0026nbspA Star is Born\u0026nbspmay have its rougher, rawer edges, thanks to the intuitive style of Bradley Cooper – making his directorial debut –\u0026nbspbut the remake is also true to the tone of its three cinematic predecessors. In its telling of the love story between a rising star and her alcoholic mentor, it’s packed with all the big emotions and big drama of a true Hollywood fable – exactly the kind of film HFPA voters adore.\u0026nbspIf Beale Street Could Talk, meanwhile, may not have acquired the same buzz as Barry Jenkins’s directorial debut,\u0026nbspMoonlight, but it’d be refreshing to see an awards body recognise how quickly Jenkins is becoming a major force in modern cinema.\u0026nbspOur predictions for Best Performance by an Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama\u0026nbspNominees:\u0026nbspGlenn Close,\u0026nbspThe Wife,\u0026nbspLady Gaga,\u0026nbspA Star Is Born,\u0026nbspNicole Kidman,\u0026nbspDestroyer,\u0026nbspMelissa McCarthy,\u0026nbspCan You Ever Forgive Me?,\u0026nbspRosamund Pike,\u0026nbspA Private War\u0026nbspWill Win: Lady Gaga, A Star is BornShould Win: Lady Gaga, A Star is Born\u0026nbspAlthough Lady Gaga’s performance as Ally, the nightclub singer turned pop phenomenon, has been praised as revelatory by some, HFPA voters were already wise to her talents: she picked up the award for Best Actress in a Limited-Series or TV Movie back in 2016 for her deliciously theatrical turn as The Countess on\u0026nbspAmerican Horror Story.\u0026nbspSo there’s surely no doubt that the HFPA will reward her for this undoubtedly mightier performance, which delivers both vulnerability and dignity, making Ally a more grounded version of the classic Hollywood heroine.\u0026nbspOur predictions for Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture – Drama\u0026nbspNominees: Bradley Cooper,\u0026nbspA Star Is Born,\u0026nbspWillem Dafoe,\u0026nbspAt Eternity\u0027s Gate,\u0026nbspLucas Hedges,\u0026nbspBoy Erased,\u0026nbspRami Malek,\u0026nbspBohemian Rhapsody,\u0026nbspJohn David Washington,\u0026nbspBlacKkKlansman\u0026nbspWill Win: Rami Malek, Bohemian RhapsodyShould Win: Bradley Cooper, A Star is Born\u0026nbspOur critic says: Rami Malek’s turn as Freddie Mercury in Queen biopic\u0026nbspBohemian Rhapsody\u0026nbspmay have been praised as a spot-on impression by critics, but the film itself got a mixed reception. It was assumed the film wasn’t good enough to compete on the awards circuit, even before taking into account the sexual assault allegations faced by its director, Bryan Singer.\u0026nbspHowever, HFPA voters can’t seem to resist a film like this, and\u0026nbspBohemian Rhapsody\u0026nbsphas ended up with several nominations, making it very likely Malek will win in this category. However, as good as Malek’s performance is, he’s not given much material to make his Mercury shine, especially compared to Cooper’s layered performance as tortured country singer Jackson Maine.Our predictions for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy\u0026nbspNominees: Crazy Rich Asians, The Favourite, Green Book, Mary Poppins Returns, Vice\u0026nbspWill Win: Green BookShould Win: The Favourite\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspOur critic says:\u0026nbspGreen Book\u0026nbspis officially this year’s\u0026nbspThree Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri: a film with a significant groundswell of support, but also facing significant criticism for its depiction of race. A buddy comedy about the unexpected friendship between famous pianist Dr Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) and his driver (Viggo Mortensen), the picture has been praised for delivering a much-needed dose of optimism.\u0026nbspBut it has also been accused of oversimplifying issues of race, and implying that racism is now a thing of the past. Still, the HFPA picked\u0026nbspThree Billboards\u0026nbspover\u0026nbspThe Shape of Water\u0026nbspfor Best Drama in 2018, suggesting the controversy may have little effect on\u0026nbspGreen Book’s chances here. That means ignoring, however, the brilliance of Yorgos Lanthimos’s\u0026nbspThe Favourite, a viciously funny (and, when it needs to be, moving) comedy that rewrites the rules for period films.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspOur predictions for Best Performance by an Actress in a Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy\u0026nbspNominees:\u0026nbspEmily Blunt,\u0026nbspMary Poppins Returns, Olivia Colman,\u0026nbspThe Favourite, Charlize Theron,\u0026nbspTully, Elsie Fisher,\u0026nbspEighth Grade, Constance Wu,\u0026nbspCrazy Rich Asians\u0026nbspWill Win: Olivia Colman, The FavouriteShould Win: Olivia Colman, The Favourite\u0026nbspOlivia Colman is a national treasure and her work as Queen Anne in\u0026nbspThe Favourite, toying with the two courtiers vying for her affections (Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz), could very well be her best performance yet. The film’s script – which is also likely to win Best Screenplay at the Globes – is an actor’s dream and a formidable showcase for all three of its stars, thanks to its heady mix of absurdism, grandeur, and tragedy.\u0026nbspShe’s surely (yes) the favourite here, and may even have what it takes to beat Gaga to Best Actress at the Academy Awards, although it will be a tight race.\u0026nbspOur predictions for\u0026nbspBest Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy\u0026nbspNominees: Christian Bale,\u0026nbspVice, Line Manuel Miranda,\u0026nbspMary Poppins Returns, Viggo Mortensen,\u0026nbspGreen Book, Robert Redford,\u0026nbspThe Old Man and the Gun, John C Reilly,\u0026nbspStan \u0026amp Ollie\u0026nbspWill Win: Christian Bale, ViceShould Win: Robert Redford, The Old Man \u0026amp the Gun\u0026nbspOur critic says:\u0026nbspAwards bodies love a physical transformation, which makes Christian Bale’s unrecognisable turn as Dick Cheney in\u0026nbspVice, a biopic about the former vice president directed by\u0026nbspThe Big Short’s Adam McKay, a strong favourite in this category. Bale is well-known as a method-acting devotee and he certainly gets to go all in as Cheney, from the prosthetics to the mannerisms to the sense of ruthless ambition.\u0026nbspYet it’s such a safe choice for the Golden Globes, especially when compared to Robert Redford’s subtler work in\u0026nbspThe Old Man \u0026amp the Gun, supposedly his final performance and a charming, elegant curtain call for the screen legend.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspOur predictions for:\u0026nbspBest Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role in any Motion Picture\u0026nbspNominees: Amy Adams,\u0026nbspVice, Claire Foy,\u0026nbspFirst Man, Regina King,\u0026nbspIf Beale Street Could Talk, Emma Stone,\u0026nbspThe Favourite, Rachel Weisz,\u0026nbspThe Favourite\u0026nbspWill Win: Regina King, If Beale Street Could TalkShould Win: Regina King, If Beale Street Could Talk\u0026nbspOur critic says:\u0026nbspAlthough Stone and Weisz, both nominated for their performances in\u0026nbspThe Favourite, are strong contenders here, no one in this category quite dominated the screen like Regina King in\u0026nbspIf Beale Street Could Talk, playing a mother determined to fight for her daughter’s right to a life of love and freedom. It’s a performance where so much of the emotion is held beneath the surface, with many of King’s best moments playing out without dialogue.Our predictions for Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role in any Motion Picture\u0026nbspNominees: Mahershala Ali,\u0026nbspGreen Book, Timothee Chalamet,\u0026nbspBeautiful Boy, Adam Driver,\u0026nbspBlacKkKlansman, Richard E Grant,\u0026nbspCan You Ever Forgive Me?, Sam Rockwell, Vice\u0026nbspWill Win: Mahershala Ali, Green BookShould Win: Richard E Grant, Can You Ever Forgive Me?\u0026nbspOur critic says:\u0026nbspGreen Book’s strength lies in its two central performances and, if the film itself wins on the night, it seems inevitable that one of its stars will also be rewarded. Mahershala Ali benefits from a less competitive category than his co-star Viggo Mortensen, who is nominated as lead actor. He also gives the more memorable performance, despite having less screen time, playing a man determined to maintain his dignity in a world that’s structured to strip him of it.\u0026nbspHowever, even his work can’t top Richard E Grant’s fragile but sparkling turn as raconteur and petty criminal Jack Hock in\u0026nbspCan You Ever Forgive Me?, a biopic about literary forger Lee Israel.Our predictions for\u0026nbspBest Television Series - Drama\u0026nbspNominees: The Americans, Bodyguard, Homecoming, Killing Eve, Pose\u0026nbspWill Win: Killing EveShould win: Killing Eve\u0026nbspOur critic says: Freed from the behemoth that is\u0026nbspGame of Thrones, which didn’t have any new episodes in 2018, the Golden Globes has the opportunity to award new and original work. Although\u0026nbspPose\u0026nbspwas boundary-breaking in its transgender representation, and a thrilling new addition to Ryan Murphy’s television empire, no other show better fits that category than Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s\u0026nbspKilling Eve, which reinterpreted the spy genre in a masterful, unexpected way.Our predictions for\u0026nbspBest Television Series - Musical or Comedy\u0026nbspNominees: Barry, Good Place, Kidding, Kaminsky Method, Marvelous\u0026nbspMrs\u0026nbspMaisel\u0026nbspWill Win:\u0026nbsp The Marvelous Mrs Maisel​Should Win: The Marvelous Mrs\u0026nbspMaisel\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspOur critic says:\u0026nbspThe Golden Globes haven’t rewarded the same show two years in a row since 2010, when\u0026nbspGlee\u0026nbsptriumphed for a second time. However, last year’s winner, Amazon’s\u0026nbspThe Marvelous Mrs Maisel, simply doesn’t have a superior contender amongst this year’s nominees.\u0026nbspIts second season has continued to charm critics with its sense of warmth and humour, carrying on the story of a 1950s housewife pursuing a career in standup comedy. The only show that could possibly have threatened\u0026nbspMaisel’s chances was\u0026nbspAtlanta, 2016’s winner, but the HBO series was bizarrely snubbed in the nominations this year.\u0026nbspOur predictions for Best Motion Picture - Foreign Language\u0026nbspNominees: Capernaum, Girl, Never Look Away, Roma, Shoplifters\u0026nbspWill Win: Alfonso Cuarón, RomaShould Win: Alfonso Cuarón, Roma\u0026nbspOur critic says:\u0026nbspRoma’s glaring omission from the nominations for Best Motion Picture –\u0026nbspDrama isn’t actually a snub, but part of the HFPA’s rules for the Globes: any film entered in its Foreign-Language category cannot then compete for either Best Motion Picture awards. It is, however, eligible in categories such as directing, acting, writing, and score.This means the Globes will give a slightly warped representation of the awards race at large, where the top two competitors have already been narrowed down toRoma\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspA Star is Born. That means the Best Director race comes down to either Cooper or Alfonso Cuarón, although it’s more likely the latter will scoop up the prize, considering\u0026nbspRoma\u0027s\u0026nbspsophisticated construction, taking the intimate story of a maid in Mexico City in the 1970s and weaving it into a wider narrative of the country’s history.\u0026nbspOur predictions for Best Performance by an Actress In A Television Series - Drama\u0026nbspNominees: Catriona Balfe, Outlander, Elisabeth Moss,\u0026nbspThe Handmaid\u0027s Tale, Sandra Oh, Killing Eve,\u0026nbspJulia Roberts, Homecoming, Keri Russell, The Americans\u0026nbspWill Win: Sandra Oh, Killing EveShould Win: Sandra Oh, Killing Eve\u0026nbspOur critic says:\u0026nbsp​Although Sandra Oh will already be gracing the stage as Golden Globes co-host, alongside Andy Samberg, it’s a pretty safe bet that she’ll have to make a quick sprint from backstage to accept this award.Much like\u0026nbspThe Favourite, one of\u0026nbspKilling Eve’s biggest strengths is the depth of material it gives its stars to work with, as Oh nails the balance between the show’s dry sense of humour and the increasing, ragged desperation of her situation, as a deskbound MI5 worker suddenly tangled up in the machinations of a charismatic assassin.\u0026nbspOur predictions for\u0026nbspBest Performance by an Actor In A Television Series - Drama\u0026nbspNominees: Jason Bateman,\u0026nbspOzark, Stephan James,\u0026nbspHomecoming, Richard Madden,\u0026nbspBodyguard, Billy Porter,\u0026nbspPose, Matthew Rhys,\u0026nbspThe\u0026nbspAmericans\u0026nbspWill Win: Matthew Rhys, The AmericansShould Win: Matthew Rhys, The Americans\u0026nbsp​Our critic says:\u0026nbspThe Americans\u0026nbsphad its final season last year and it would be quite the mistake not to reward a show that has remained consistently excellent over the course of six season – a relatively rare feat on television. However, the series will have a difficult time competing against\u0026nbspKilling Eve, which benefits from the buzz of being a new show, so it’s likely Matthew Rhys will be the only one to walk away with an award for\u0026nbspThe Americans.Which is no bad news, since his wearied performance as a former undercover Soviet spy, now attempting to embrace the American life, is very much award worthy.\u0026nbspIf you want to watch live, the event is\u0026nbspbeing shown\u0026nbspon NBC in the US.

How could we take this incredible capability, the finesse of human actions, and apply it to the virtual world?He explained that\u0026nbspthe technology can fit onto a single chip measuring\u0026nbsp8mm\u0026nbspby\u0026nbsp10mm, allowing it to fit in a large variety of devices.What is most exciting about it is that you can shrink the entire radar and put it in a tiny chip, he said.\u0026nbspThat\u0027s what makes this approach so promising. It\u0027s extremely reliable, there\u0027s nothing to break. There\u0027s no moving parts, there\u0027s no lenses, there\u0027s nothing, it\u0027s a piece of sand on your board.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debate"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/03/07/16/istock-649900756.jpg?width=1000\u0026amp;height=614\u0026amp;fit=bounds\u0026amp;format=pjpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;crop=16:9,offset-y0.5  on= tap:gallery-lightbox-3906706  role= photo  tabindex= 0  layout= fill  alt=   srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/03/07/16/istock-649900756.jpg","title":"iphone future apple announcement tim cook ceo memo services wearables","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

Ben Chu investigatesClick to followThe IndependentShadow chancellor John McDonnell (right) has suggested Labour could include a pledge to reduce the working week in its next manifestoAs a society we can’t seem to make up our minds about work. Do we want more of it? Or less?There’s a chilling fog of fear over what technological advances will mean for our jobs, with an endless supply of alarming forecasts about how robots and algorithms are set to displace human workers.But there’s also a furnace of angst about low productivity and under-investment by firms in just the kind of innovations that induce those nightmares of a “jobs apocalypse”.Boss wants to make four-day working week trial permanentSome lament the supposed proliferation of pointless, soul-dismantling, “bullshit jobs”. Yet no one gets out the bunting when a struggling company announces redundancies.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThe UK’s official labour market surveys suggest\u0026nbspmany of us want fewer hours at work, presumably driven by a desire for a healthier “work-life balance”.Yet those same surveys also show that many people also want more hours, that the post-financial crisis curse of “underemployment” has not yet been lifted.Some complain about the raising of the state retirement age and the depressing prospect of being forced to work longer than they planned. But for others the big problem is ageism, the risk of being pressured out of jobs they enjoy prematurely.When it comes to work, we’re rather like those two diners in the Catskill mountains: “Boy, the food at this place is really terrible... Yeah, I know and such small portions.”Yet onto this terrain of confusion and apparent contradiction some stride confidently.To Alex Williams, a Corbynite academic, automation should be embraced by the left as the emancipation of labour, provided the gains are comprehensively redistributed.The Trades Union Congress seems to have been influenced by this cocktail of technological optimism and socialist assertion. Its general secretary\u0026nbspFrances O’Grady\u0026nbsprecently demanded a four-day week by the end of the century, declaring: “Bosses and shareholders must not be allowed to hoover up all the gains from new tech for themselves.”The Labour Party is keen too. The shadow chancellor John McDonnell has made favourable noises about the four-day week and is reported to be asking the crossbench peer, Robert Skidelsky, to head an inquiry into the subject.Yet this isn’t just a British story. There are tectonic rumblings from abroad too. The IG Metall union in Germany earlier this year won the right to a four-day week for its almost 900,000 members. One technology start-up, founded by former Google employees, has a “Free Friday” policy. Even a think tank close to the authorities in China has called for the most populous nation on the planet to have a four-day working week as soon as 2030.Any project that can unite German metal bashers, Silicon Valley coders and Chinese Communist apparatchiks clearly has an unusually wide appeal.So is the four-day week a big idea whose time has come? Or is it an unworkable left-wing fantasy? And even if a four-day week is economically feasible, should we really desire it? Or is it a case of being careful what you wish for?When Marei Wollersberger and her colleagues established an east London-based data design agency, Normally, as a four-day week operation in 2014, the motivation was largely personal.“We wanted to lead happier lives basically – enjoy ourselves more, not just to defer our enjoyment to retirement age,” she told me.But there was another goal: “There was also a motivation to be more productive.”The economics of the four-day week revolve around the concept of productivity, the amount we produce per hour worked.The size of the economy – the size of our national income – is derived from the value of all the goods and services produced by businesses and households.On the face of it, if we all worked one less day a week, our personal output would drop by around fifth. Multiply that fall across the overall economy and you’ve got an economy that is considerably smaller, implying lower income and lower living standards for all, one way or another.Yet what if working fewer hours were to stimulate our productivity? What if we produced more per hour working four days than we did per hour working five?In that case there might be no overall drop in total output, and therefore no decrease in living standards. If our productivity rose enough we might even have a higher income than we did before.Wollersberger says the model has worked in stimulating performance at her company. “You’re more productive – you achieve exactly the same or more in four days as you would in five,” she says. “And I honestly believe it’s better work.”\u0026nbspA New Zealand financial firm called Perpetual  found similarly gratifying results when it trialled a four-day week recently.“There was broadly no change in company outputs pre and during the trial,” said its boss. “No reduction in job performance and the survey data showed a marginal increase across most teams.”Created with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

The results of a Swedish trial involving 70 nurses working a six-hour day were more mixed. While there was some boost to worker productivity, the city of Gothenburg also had to hire more nurses to cover the hours lost.Intuitively, this seems much more likely to be the result of moving to a four-day week in services sectors that are, currently at least, heavily reliant on face-to-face human interactions such as healthcare or teaching.That’s not to imply the shift in working patterns should be ruled out as impractical. There are benefits in terms of lower stress and happiness to set against those financial costs. But it’s probably unrealistic to expect the move to always pay for itself, at least in the short-term.And some experiments have flopped. Treehouse, an online educational firm in Oregon, was one of those companies which got media publicity for its four-day week in 2015. But Treehouse’s founder recently lamented that the working practice killed the work ethic in his company and called the experiment a “terrible thing”.The only way is down?Inidual “micro” trials are certainly useful, but they aren’t necessarily a reliable guide to “macro” economic impacts.The closest thing that we have to a state-mandated four-day week is France’s 35-hour week, introduced in 2000 under the Jacques Chirac-Lionel Jospin cohabitation.Jospin\u0026nbsp(left) and president Jaques Chirac (right) (AFPGetty)The first thing to bear in mind is that this does not mean all French people work a four-day week. The regulation simply means overtime kicks in after a worker has completed 35 hours and they accrue the right to holiday lieu days. Yet it does establish a social norm of fewer hours and a financial incentive for firms to limit them.Opinions are mixed about its results. France has a high unemployment rate relative to the UK and other developed countries and it’s notable that Emmanuel Macron campaigned for president promising to increase the flexibility of the system.And though the level of French productivity stands comparison with the most productive nations in the world, there’s no evidence that its growth rate has risen since it introduced the 35-hour week.This might incline us to scepticism about the value of the the state having any role in limiting working hours.\u0026nbspYet that could be the wrong conclusion. For the historic trend is clear. In the late 1900s, UK workers put in more than 2,500 hours a year on average. That’s down to 1,680 hours in 2017. There’s been a similar steep fall in other developed countries over the past century and a half.That reflects the fact that the five-day working week, as opposed to six days with only Sunday off, only become standard practice in the 20th century.It was the industrialist Henry Ford who was the pioneer in the US, giving his factory workers a five-day shift in 1926 while keeping their wages steady. This prefigured legislation and Congress’ 1938 Fair Labor Standards Act, which mandated a maximum 40-hour working week (effectively five working days).We primarily think of John Maynard Keynes as the great promoter of employment for his pioneering theories on the economic benefits of government-funded job creation during the Great Depression.\u0026nbspBut it was this secular decline in hours worked, despite the agonising surge in unemployment in the 1930s, that led Keynes to look forward to a 15-hour working week in The Economic Possibilities for our Grandchildren by the year 2000.The question is whether the recent flattening out is the end of the decline in hours worked,\u0026nbspor merely a pause.\u0026nbspAnd is a government nudge necessary to get history moving again?There’s also the question of consumption. One of the reasons Henry Ford instituted a five-day working week was revealed in a 1926 interview: “Leisure is an indispensable ingredient in a growing consumer market because working people need to have enough free time to find uses for consumer products, including automobiles.”In other words, it was less a paternalistic concern for his workers’ well-being\u0026nbspthan a recognition that it would create help create more customers for Ford.There’s an echo of this macroeconomic concern today, with government-linked Beijing researchers suggesting a four-day week could boost the domestic tourism and entertainment sectors and help rebalance the overall Chinese economy to consumption and away from excessive investment.But perhaps the major economic question about moving towards a four-day week is whether it\u0026nbspcould somehow boost our long-term productivity growth rate (perhaps by inducing more investment in automation by firms) or whether a shorter working week could only ever be the fruits of productivity growth with an origin elsewhere.The truth is that we don’t know the answer. Yet it’s vital to recognise that countries and societies have autonomy too, even now.\u0026nbspThe US has a considerably larger GDP per capita than any developed country in Europe. But the bulk of this gap is due not to a vastly higher level of productivity but the fact that Americans, on average, work many more hours than the French, Germans or Swiss or British and so on.The trade-off between work and leisure is different between our two continents. Both Europeans and Americans, by global and historical comparisons, have very comfortable standards of living. Choosing more leisure over extra working hours is not, whatever some might employers might argue, necessarily a route to penury and decline.Doing nothing for ever and everThe Victorian historian and essayist Thomas Carlyle believed in the redemptive power of work.“A man perfects himself by working,” he enthused. “Foul jungles are cleared away, fair seed-fields rise instead, and stately cities ... Even in the meanest sorts of labour, the whole soul of a man is composed into a kind of real harmony the instant he sets himself to work.”The (possibly apocryphal) epitaph on a Hertfordshire gravestone took a different view of the intrinsic value of hard labour.“Here lies a poor woman who always was tired​”One does not need to be a Carlyle-style work zealot to appreciate that there is some intrinsic psychological value to labour. Work is where many of us find not just an income, but friends, stimulation and status. But we can also see where that Hertfordshire washerwoman was coming from.This dichotomy underlines that not all jobs are the same, or are experienced the same by the worker. For every occupation that that does help to clear away someone’s jungles of mental disorder there will be one that is felt as detestable drudgery.One of the deficiencies of the debate over the four-day week, as with discussions of the appropriate retirement age, is a failure to acknowledge the vast ersity of both jobs and workers. Labour is not homogeneous.Working until 70 might seem entirely reasonable, even desirable, to the university professor, the politician or the TV presenter. But to the cleaner, the firefighter or shop assistant – especially jobs with a physically arduous component – it may have considerably less appeal.\u0026nbspAnd so views erge too on the desirability of the four-day week.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 51Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The Lions part group of professional performers on Bankside, during the annual Twelfth Night celebrations on the South Bank in central London.

He confirmed he will remain in post and thinks it is important to continue working with Cabinet colleagues to ensure the best Brexit outcome for the countryOne of the most significant developments in the UK and broader Western economy over the past decade is the rise of the gig economy and self-employment. Around a sixth of the British workforce is now self-employed.This was brought home to me recently when I met the Romanian father of one of the friends of my young son. The father had been a chauffeur for a wealthy family in Chelsea. But he’d resigned after his son had started school and had signed on with Uber so he could pick his lad up directly from school and shift his driving work to airport shuttle-runs at night instead. “I wanted the flexibility and my previous employer couldn’t provide that,” he told me, as we watched our boys career around the playground.His work-life balance was not to be found in limiting the hours he worked (indeed he wanted to keep those the same or even increase them) but in the flexibility of his arrangements.Survey evidence suggests this is a common story. The majority of Uber drivers like the personal control over their working hours made possible by the platform. Drivers who valued flexible working reported higher levels of life satisfaction, as well as lower levels of anxiety.However, there was also a minority of Uber drivers who would prefer to work fixed hours in a more conventional work setting. And these workers reported lower levels of life satisfaction and higher levels of anxiety.A question of representationThis brings us back to the apparent paradox of many people in the UK workforce wanting fewer hours but many others wanting more.\u0026nbspDavid Bell, a labour market economist from the University of Stirling\u0026nbspwhose work, along with Danny Blanchflower of Dartmouth College in the US, has highlighted this ergence, says that the groups who want fewer hours tend to be older, while those who are underemployed seem to be younger.One of the implications is that younger people in the workforce may need the money from more hours because they are under greater financial pressure, perhaps because they have families, or perhaps because they have suffered a greater real wage squeeze since the financial crisis.\u0026nbspThis suggests that Corbynite left is correct in stressing that to consider the economic and social case for a four-day in isolation is a mistake. Incomes plainly matter too, as well as the level of inequality.\u0026nbspOne has to consider the role of income redistribution and employment policies. Give people higher incomes and more “outside options” for employment, perhaps through a jobs guarantee or even a universal basic income, and the desire for extra hours in their current job may well melt away. They may begin to make different work-leisure trade-offs than they do now.Perhaps one of the reasons why we some people languish in ultra-flexible gig economy jobs they don’t appreciate – like those disgruntled Uber drivers – is that, despite what most economic analysts say, there is actually hidden slack in our economy – and that if the slack was eradicated they could find the kind of regular job they wanted elsewhere.But that still leaves a circle to be squared, presuming that different people, all else equal, are still likely to put different weights on work and leisure. How do we give those who would prefer a four-day week more freedom to choose it, while protecting the interests of those who don’t?The empowerment of ordinary workers is Professor Bell’s answer. Let inidual employees have substantive input into determining the trade-off, rather than leaving it up to politicians or employers.This is how I know the NHS won’t survive without EU staffOver a million young women say they’re paid less than male colleaguesDJ jailed for raping boy, 3, in toilet at working men’s clubTrailblazing images of early 20th-century working conditions“One of the things that might help is a strengthening of worker representation, which has declined so dramatically,” he says. “Rather than jumping in to impose a four-day week you want to think first about whether workers’ interests are being properly represented.”This would be going with the historical grain, given the driving role of new trade unions in the achievement of an eight-hour working day in the 19th century and early 20th century.It’s notable not only that IG Metall workers in Germany this year were able to achieve a four-day working week through negotiation with bosses – but that they also had sufficient bargaining power to protect their overall levels of weekly pay.A fundamental question that underpins this broad discussion about the future of working hours is a philosophical one: what makes us happy and fulfilled as human beings?Modern psychological studies do partially back up Carlyle’s Victorian pompous sermonising: formal work can be as positive for human happiness as leisure, sometimes more so.\u0026nbspA job does seem to bring a valuable sense of social usefulness. Involuntary unemployment is clearly harmful for people’s mental health.But how much work do we want or need? Keynes in the 1930s called this desire for work “old Adam” and predicted that three hours a day in the future would be “quite enough to satisfy” this inherited instinct.Perhaps the right thing to do is not to dictate to people, or engage in speculation on what the future of work will look like, but rather to help them decide for themselves.Four day working weekOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

We should then go back to the EU with a discussion about a customs union.”Mr Corbyn also urged Labour supporters demanding he stop Brexit to “recognise a number of things”, saying: “About 60 per cent of Labour voters voted remain, about 40 per cent voted leave. We have to recognise why people voted in those directions.Conservative and Labour MPs join forces to stop no-deal Brexit“Labour is unique as a party, because it’s got to bring all sides together – hence my view on a customs union, on access to the market.”However, some estimates have put Labour voters’ backing remain at more than 60 per cent – while one recent poll found their support for a further referendum to be 80 per cent.The interview triggered a backlash from some Labour MPs, Chris Leslie, the Nottingham East MP, tweeting: “If Jeremy Corbyn facilitates Brexit he’ll share responsibility for the job losses, trade barriers and decade of austerity to come.Angela Smith, the Penistone and Stocksbridge MP, said: “We need to get the message over to Jeremy Corbyn that Labour members and supporters want a People’s Vote.”Created with Sketch.Newspapers react to Theresa May pulling the vote on her Brexit deal Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.And Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, said: “There you have it, Jeremy Corbyn refuses once again to take the blinkers off. He is ignoring the concerns of his own supporters and the economic damage experts warn Brexit will do to the UK economy.”In reality, the chances of a snap election in the new year are slim, with Theresa May having ruled it out – and many Tories opposed to her deal happy to run down the clock to a no-deal Brexit.Instead, Mr Corbyn is under pressure to swing behind a fresh referendum if – as seems certain – the prime minister loses the “meaningful vote”, in the second week of January and his vote of no confidence in her government fails.Some Labour insiders believe Labour backing for a referendum is all-but certain in those circumstances, given the party\u0027s inability to set out what the other “options on the table” it could pursue might be.Expats set to lose healthcare under no-deal Brexit, NHS toldThink homelessness is bad now?

So an identical, or near identical, motion should be out of order.”The warning came as the prime minister dismissed speculation that she will pull the “meaningful vote” for a second time, because of the scale of the opposition, saying: “We will be holding the vote.”MPs will resume debating the withdrawal agreement on Wednesday, with the vote expected on 15 or 16 January. Ms May said it would be “that sort of timing”.Strikingly, during the interview, Ms May appeared unable to point to any progress in persuading the EU to give ground on the Irish border backstop – still the key controversy.She said she was still seeking “further assurances from the EU”, but made no mention of securing a “legally binding” power for the UK to break free of the backstop, as she promised Tory MPs last month.The continued impasse points to a big defeat next week, which would plunge the UK into “uncharted territory”, the prime minister conceded.Majority backs Final Say on Brexit in biggest poll since EU referendumDivided Brexiteers could throw away their one chance to leave the EUHow to sound like you know what you’re talking about on Brexit in 2019Government to carry out major test of no-deal Brexit road planBoth Labour and the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) seized on the apparent failure to achieve a breakthrough\u0026nbspsince the vote was pulled three weeks ago.Nigel Dodds, the DUP’s deputy leader, said: “A number of commitments and promises were made when the meaningful vote was pulled. So far, the fundamental problems that make this a bad deal appear not to have changed.”And Jon Trickett, Labour’s cabinet office spokesman, said: “Essentially, nothing has changed. The prime minister’s promise to go back to Brussels to renegotiate was a cynical attempt to further delay the vote on her botched deal.”On repeat votes, Erskine May says: “A motion or an amendment which is the same, in substance, as a question which has been decided during a session may not be brought forward again during that same session.”Crucially, Mr Bercow has sought to build a reputation as a champion of backbenchers against over-mighty ministers and has sided with the Commons in most disputes.If the deal is thrown out, Labour will push for a no-confidence vote, to force a general election – but this is also expected to fail, with no sign of Tory or DUP support.Large numbers of Labour MPs, and the other opposition parties, will then push for a Final Say referendum on whether to halt Brexit, but Jeremy Corbyn is opposed.In that vacuum, with parliament unable to agree on any outcome, Ms May will hope the ticking clock counting down to a no-deal Brexit, on March 29, will force MPs to back her deal eventually.\u0026nbspBefore that, on Tuesday, Tory and Labour MPs will join forces to block the UK crashing out of the EU without a deal, in the first of many ambushes to put parliament in control.They have tabled an amendment to the Finance Bill, which would prevent any new taxes earmarked for no-deal preparations without the consent of the Commons.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Support for the current deal rises to only 28 per cent among Leave voters.Created with Sketch.Newspapers react to Theresa May pulling the vote on her Brexit deal Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Writing in\u0026nbspThe Mail on Sunday, the prime minister called Labour’s Brexit policy “a cynical tissue of incoherence, designed to avoid difficult decisions”.Ms May claimed Mr Corbyn “did not even bother to read the deal before he came out against it”.She also warned opponents in her own party that they “must realise the risks they are running with our democracy”.The YouGov poll shows reveals that if\u0026nbspthe choice was to remain in the EU or leave under the terms of Ms May’s\u0026nbspdeal negotiated by the government, the result would be 63 per cent to 37 per cent in favour of staying tied to Brussels.If the choice was EU membership or a no-deal Brexit, the poll indicated a 58 per cent to 42 per cent win for Remain.Labour MP David Lammy, a prominent supporter of campaign for a second referendum, said: “On the biggest issue of our generation, Labour risks complicity in the Conservative Party’s historic mistake. Although we are in opposition, due to the government’s weakness we have the opportunity to save our country from catastrophe and so we should seize it\u0026nbspwith both hands.“If we do not, this poll shows it is Labour, not the Tories, that will be punished at the ballot box. We not only risk fatally harming our chances at the next election, we will betray millions of voters – particularly the young – who saw us as a beacon of hope and put their trust in us only 18 months ago.“The time for prevarication and pussyfooting around on Brexit has long passed – we must now give voice to the clear majority of people who are demanding a final say.”Those surveyed were scathing of Ms May’s handing of Brexit, with 73 per cent saying the negotiations are going badly and 86 per cent saying the process is “a mess”.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

He confirmed he will remain in post and thinks it is important to continue working with Cabinet colleagues to ensure the best Brexit outcome for the country“If some of those MPs can be persuaded to back the prime minister’s deal, it won’t be because they’ve come under pressure to do so from their local party members over the Christmas break,” said Prof Bale.\u0026nbspThe study found that 59 per cent of Tory members opposed Ms May’s deal, compared to 38 per cent who supported it and 3 per cent who did not have an opinion.More than half, 53 per cent, also said that the deal “does not respect the result of the referendum”, comparing to 42 per cent who said that it does.People were then asked how they would vote in a referendum where there were three options – to remain, leave with the deal or leave without one – and in which they are able to put down a first and second preference.Some 57 per cent opted to leave with no deal as their first choice, with only 23 per cent putting Ms May’s deal and 15 per cent backing the option to remain in the EU.Forty per cent\u0026nbspthen put the prime minister’s proposals as their second choice, with 19 per cent putting no deal and 6\u0026nbspper cent opting to stay as a member of the bloc.The survey showed large majorities of members think both that a no-deal Brexit will have a positive impact on the economy in the medium to long term and that warnings of disruption have been exaggerated.A slim majority, 51 per cent, said they thought Ms May was doing “well”, but almost as many, 48 per cent said she was doing “badly” to some degree.But despite wavering support for Ms May and her deal, an overwhelming majority of members – 83 per cent – opposed the idea of having an election, while 82 per cent would not back a further referendum.Yesterday, the prime minister’s Northern Irish partners in government raised the stakes further in the Brexit talks, saying there is “no need” for key parts of the deal she agreed with the EU.Nigel Dodds, DUP deputy leader,\u0026nbspargued that the withdrawal agreement she is seeking “flies in the face” of the government’s own commitments relating to the border between the north and the republic.His comments came after a meeting in Downing Street, and are a blow to the prime minister as she desperately tries to convince the Northern Irish party and her own MPs to back her proposals ahead of a vote in the coming weeks.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

In 2014, astronomers found Thule using the Hubble Space Telescope and selected it for New Horizon’s extended mission in 2015. “Anything’s possible out there in this very unknown region,” said John Spencer, deputy project scientist for New Horizons. Launched in January 2006, New Horizons embarked on a 4 billion mile journey towards the solar system’s frigid edge to study the dwarf planet Pluto and its five moons. The spacecraft, which is the size of a baby grand piano, flew past Pluto in 2015, providing the first close-up views of the planet. During the flyby, the probe found Pluto to be slightly larger than previously thought. In March, it revealed that methane-rich dunes were on the icy dwarf planet’s surface.After trekking 1 billion miles beyond Pluto into the Kuiper belt, New Horizons will now seek clues about the formation of the solar system and its planets.There is a great deal scientists can learn from Ultima and the hundreds of thousands of similar bodies scientists deem to be in the solar system. Hal Weaver, project scientist on the mission, told the BBC the rock is “probably the most primitive object ever encountered by a spacecraft, the best possible relic of the early solar system”. The object is officially known as 2014 MU69, but was nicknamed Ultima Thule, a Latin phrase which means “beyond the borders of the known world”.Additional reporting by ReutersOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Rape, forced marriage and abduction have become standard tactics in conflicts from Syria to Yemen, and from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, to Nigeria, South Sudan and Myanmar.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialOver the course of 2018:- In Afghanistan, violence and bloodshed remain a daily occurrence, with some 5,000 children killed or maimed within the first three-quarters of 2018, equal to all of 2017, and children making up 89 per cent of civilian casualties from explosive remnants of war.Unicef photographer captures men bonding with their newborns- Cameroon has seen an escalation of the conflict in the northwest and southwest regions of the country, with schools, students and teachers often coming under attack. In November, more than 80 people, including many children, were abducted from a school in Nkwen, in the northwest of the country and released a few days later. To date, 93 villages have allegedly been partially or totally burned due to conflict in the areas, with many children experiencing extreme levels of violence.- In the Central African Republic, a dramatic resurgence in fighting has enveloped much of the country, with two out of three children in need of humanitarian assistance.- In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, interethnic violence and clashes between security forces and armed groupsmilitia in the Kasai region and in the eastern provinces of Tanganyika, South Kivu, Nord Kivu and Ituri have had a devastating impact on children. The response to the ongoing Ebola outbreak has been seriously hindered by violence and instability in eastern DRC. In addition, an estimated 4.2 million children are at risk of severe acute malnutrition. The situation is compounded by violations of children’s rights, including forced recruitment by armed groups and sexual abuse.Pierre’s mother died after he was born three years ago he now lives with his father in the Central African Republic- In Iraq, even as fighting has largely subsided, four children were killed in November in the north of the country when the truck they were travelling to school in came under attack. Children and families returning to their homes in areas previously impacted by heavy violence continue to be exposed to the danger of unexploded ordnance. Thousands of families remain displaced and now face the additional threats of freezing winter temperatures and flash floods.- In the Chad Basin, ongoing conflict, displacement and attacks on schools, teachers and other education facilities have put the education of 3.5 million children at risk. Today in northeast Nigeria, the lake region of Chad, extreme north of Cameroon and Diffa region of Niger, at least 1,041 schools are closed or non-functional due to violence, fear of attacks, or unrest, affecting nearly 445,000 children.- A recent surge in violence in the border region between Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger has left 1,478 schools closed.- In Myanmar, the UN continues to receive reports of ongoing violations of the rights of Rohingya remaining in northern Rakhine State, which include allegations of killings, disappearances and arbitrary arrests. There are also widespread restrictions on the rights to freedom of movement and barriers to access health and education including in central Rakhine State. Ensuring children have access to quality education and other essential services will avert a “lost generation”\u0026nbspof Rohingya children otherwise they will lack the skills they need to contribute to society.- In northeast Nigeria, armed groups, including Boko Haram factions, continue to target girls, who are raped, forced to become wives of fighters or used as “human bombs”. In February, the group abducted 110 girls and one boy from a technical college in Dapchi, Yobe State. While most of the children have since been released, five girls died and one is still being held captive as a slave.Nawai, 15, during a ceremony to release children from armed groups in Yambio, South Sudan- In Palestine, over 50 children were killed and hundreds more injured this year, many while\u0026nbspdemonstrating against deteriorating living conditions in Gaza. Children in Palestine and Israel have been exposed to fear, trauma and injuries.- In South Sudan, relentless conflict and insecurity throughout the annual lean season pushed 6.1 million people into extreme hunger. Even with the advent of the rainy season, more than 43 per cent of the population remain food insecure. While the promise of a revitalised peace agreement offers a glimmer of hope for children, reports of extreme violence against women and children continue, most recently in Bentiu, where more than 150 women and girls reported suffering horrific sexual assault.- In Somalia, more than 1,800 children were recruited by parties to the conflict in the first nine months of the year, with 1,278 children abducted.Unicef’s research on water predicts one in four children will not have access to clean water by 2040- In Syria, between January and September, the UN verified the killing of 870 children – the highest number ever in the first nine months of any year since the start of the conflict in 2011. Attacks continued throughout the year, including the killing of 30 children in the eastern village of Al Shafa in November.- In eastern Ukraine, more than four years of conflict have taken a devastating toll on the education system, destroying and damaging hundreds of schools and forcing 700,000 children to learn in fragile environments, amid\u0026nbspvolatile fighting and the dangers posed by unexploded weapons of war. The situation is particularly severe for 400,000 children who live within 20km of the “contact line”, which ides the government and non-government-controlled areas and where shelling and extreme levels of mine contamination pose a lethal threat.- and in Yemen, the UN has verified 1,427 children killed or maimed in attacks, including an “unconscionable”\u0026nbspattack on a school bus in Sa’ada. Schools and hospitals have come under frequent attack or been used for military purposes, denying children access to their right to education and healthcare. This is further fuelling a crisis in a country where every 10 minutes, a child dies due to preventable diseases, and 400,000 children suffer from severe acute malnutrition.A doctor measures the arm of Yemeni Ali Mohammed Ahmed Jamal, 12, who is suffering from malnutrition“2019 marks the 30th anniversary of the landmark Convention on the Rights of the Child and the 70th anniversary of the Geneva Conventions, yet today, more countries are embroiled in internal or international conflict than at any other time in the past three decades. Children living through conflict are among the least likely to be guaranteed their rights. Attacks on children must end,” Fontaine says.Unicef calls on all warring parties to abide by their obligations under international law to immediately end violations against children and the targeting of civilian infrastructure, including schools, hospitals and water infrastructure. Unicef also calls on states with influence over parties to conflict to use that influence to protect children.In photos: a toddlers recovery from malnutritionConflict in Congo has led to children being recruited as soldiers“Much more needs to be done to prevent wars, and to end the many disastrous armed conflicts devastating children’s lives. Yet even as wars continue, we must never accept attacks against children. We must hold warring parties to their obligation to protect children. Otherwise, it is children, their families and their communities who will continue to suffer the devastating consequences, for now, and for years to come,” Fontaine says.Across all these countries, Unicef works with partners to provide the most vulnerable children with health, nutrition, education and child protection services. For example, in October, Unicef helped to secure the release of 833 children recruited into armed forces in northeast Nigeria, and are working these children to reintegrate them into their communities. Since conflict broke out in South Sudan five years ago, Unicef has reunited almost 6,000 unaccompanied and separated children with their families. In Bangladesh, in 2018, Unicef reached thousands of Rohingya refugee children with mental health and psychosocial support. In Iraq, Unicef is working with partners to provide specialised services to women and children affected by gender-based violence.Democratic Republic of the CongoOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Its like a tsunami - you know its coming but when it hits you think oh f***, hold tight.“Watching what Ive been through will be mental and probably will be emotional as youre having to constantly relive it.Its glorying him even more, but he is notorious and one of the most prolic murderers in the country.Earlier this week, Joe was once again reminded of her killer ex when a new report claimed he was part of paedophile ring that groomed teenage girls.Joe says she was not shocked by the news.She said: “The sex grooming reports arent a surprise to me. Ive given names before. Id already given the police two names years ago in numerous interviews.“He had a fteen year old living with him at one point and she used to have all her friends round. One of his friends told me it was like a nursery round there - there were so many kids.“The fact that hes so obsessed with school girls anyway - it goes hand in hand. Its obvious.”Today, Joe is confident and bubbly, but shell never be able to forget the campaign of abuse she endured at the hands of cruel Bellfield, who used to brag about raping other women while he was with her.I have a few questions I’d like to ask him, she says. What actual pleasure did he get out of it all ”Joe adds: “I told the police in an interview I did that I’d get back with him tomorrow - because he’d have the best meal, the best day, the best sex, and I’d slit the c***’s throat as he slept and put an end to all of it, because it’s all of us lot paying for him to live his le of luxury.”And she still stands by this sentiment, adding: The victims haven’t got that, so why should he be allowed to be a fat f**k in prison Joe initially met Bellfield in  when she was  and regularly went to a bar in Cobham, called Rockys, where he worked as a doorman. But it wasn’t until some years later, in , that they began dating - and another decade would pass before Bellfields true depravity was revealed to the world. Bellfields first victim would turn out to be Milly Dowler, who went missing from Walton-Upon-Thames on her way home from school in .Her body was found six months later, dumped in a wood in Yateley Heath, in a horric case that went unsolved for nine years, with Bellfield eventually convicted in .Then in  Marsha McDonnell was hit over the head with a blunt instrument after she got off the bus near her home in Hampton, London, and in August  French student Amelie Delagrange was found battered to death in the street in Twickenham.Joe, who is now a horse groomer, can still remember in vivid detail the start of her horrying relationship with the hulking killer.  says: “He was huge. He was a big bloke. I didnt fancy him at first, but he was a proper ladies’ man - everyone knew that.“Then my dad died, and I was in a vulnerable place. He kept on askingI wanted to go for a drink and a meal, and in the end I did.“He stayed that night, and never left.”At the start of their relationship, there weren’t any signs Bellfield was evil. She says: “He’d turn up with flowers and was a gentleman. When he wasn’t psychotic, you couldn’t want for a better boyfriend.”However, almost immediately after Joe fell pregnant with their daughter Bellfield turned aggressive.Joe says: He started with the odd slap. He came home annoyed one night - there was no reason, it was out of the blue.“I was shocked, but my hormones were all over the place and I was still upset about my dad.“I believed him when he said it was because he loved me and he was jealous.“He was convinced Id been having affairs even though I hadnt even left the house - and he couldn’t help it and he was really sorry.”From there the abuse got worse, and by the time Joe fell pregnant with her son in , daily le had become hell.Joe says: “One time he came home from work and I answered him back and he went mental – punching, biting, kicking, pinching.“Towards the end of the relationship he’d use weapons. He hit me with a rubber mallet, he’d burn me with cigarettes - he’d bruise and cut me but it was always from the neck down.And the torment didnt end there, with rapist Bellfield frequently forcing himself on her at any hour of the day.Hed rape me. It didnt matter where we were -he wanted it, he took it, she says. You didn’t argue. You could fight but you’d always lose. It could be weekly, daily - over that period it was over  times.“He’d call me fat, stupid, say how useless I was as a mum, that I had no friends. You start to believe it.” Le became a vicious cycle of control. She says: “He was brilliant when my daughter was born. Hed always have time for the kids, and they were always well-dressed. This is why I don’t understand how he can take other people’s children away from them, because as a father he was very good.“Even after he beat the s**t out of you he’d still buy you things – sovereign rings, Kickers shoes, take you on holiday, clothes, stuff for the horses. Sometimes he’d say he was sorry but he would then start to say it was your fault. It was like he had multiple personalities.“They make you believe you’re a piece of s**t on the floor.“When people say why didn’t you walk away the first time  Until you’re in this situation and you’re living that le, you can’t know what it’s like.“I was just target practice. He was just warming up.”Bellfield – who has converted to Islam now and goes by the name Yusuf Rahim while in HMP Frankland – regularly bragged about raping girls when he ed from work as a doorman, according to Joe. But without evidence, she was too scared to say anything.Joe says: “I knew about a lot of the rapes. He’d come home bragging about it, but when I was in that position with two kids, what could I do  I’ve got to live with the guilt every day knowing potentially I could have stopped him, but there was never enough people to come forward.Imagine knowing what he is, and what he’s like - he gets arrested, gets questioned and gets let out - who’s going to get it  I fought for my le everyday - I was terried for my own le.“He bragged about raping a disabled girl on the bonnet of the car in the car park of a club. There were doormen who were there that knew, and nothing was ever done about it.Joe eventually split from Bellfield after he beat her up while heavily pregnant with their son, who was born in . She sought an injunction but Bellfield ignored it.Despite moving on with another girlfriend, Bellfield continued to terrorise Joe for years – while going on to commit multiple murders over a three year period. And it was Joe who finally exacted revenge on her evil ex by helping to bring him to justice.Joe got in touch with police after spotting Bellfield’s car on a Crimewatch programme about the attempted murder of schoolgirl Kate Sheedy in .The -year-old had been hit by a white people carrier Joe recognised as Levi’s, reversed over, and left for dead.With the help of Joe’s statements, Bellfield was convicted in  and given a full le sentence for the murder of Marsha and Amelie, and the attempted murder of Kate. He was later given the same sentence in , when he was found guilty of murdering -year-old Milly Dowler.Recalling the time that she saw his car on Crimewatch, Joe says: I was still in touch with Levi, but no longer felt scared of him. Hed moved on, he wasnt living with me anymore and I had more freedom so it was totally dferent. I called the police anonymously and told them that white people carrier had been on my driveway a couple of weeks before and it was my baby father’s car. However nothing was done at that point.“I can tell you nearly all his cars – the reg, the colour – because he stalked my le daily for  years, and would be in dferent cars all the time. You were always aware of him being around. Later that year Joe went to the police again, after the murder of Amelie.“I went into the incident room on Twickenham Green and told them Levi was a wheel clamper, had a white van and hated blondes.”Joe came face-to-face with Bellfield once again while giving evidence at Milly Dowler’s court without a screen. She says: “The last time I saw him was at the Old Bailey, and he stared back at me, he was so p***ed off.“I had photos showing hed been to Yateley horse show - the same area Millys body was found.”Today, Joe is eager to put her old le as far behind her as much as she can. She has created a new le and has been in a new relationship for nine months.“My son initially wanted to go and see Levi in prison when he was about ten, she says. I wasn’t happy about it but thankfully he changed his mind. It’s not my place to stop them seeing himthey want to.”She spends most of her time travelling for work or looking after her kids, her elderly mum and five horses, but she’s still scared by the psychological torment she suffered.She says: “I still don’t trust any guy. The minute they tell you they’ll never hurt you or cheat on you, they’re gone.“I’ve had one serious relationship since I’ve split up with him. Some friends laugh and call me ‘man hater’, but why should you trust when you’ve been through that “There’ll be god knows how many things he’s done that the police don’t know about and they’ll never know about.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But this did not deter him from taking new deposits from customers, even though their money was at risk.This ban should serve as a warning to other directors tempted to abuse clients and neglect their duties that they could be investigated and lose the privilege of limited liability trading.Among the couples left in the lurch by the companys closure were Kirsty Ehninger and Lee-John Watts, who were booked in to tie the knot on June  in .Speaking to the Sun Online, Kirsty said she and her fiancé had chosen the venue as she had grown up barely a mile from the venue, and had always loved it.But Mamhead House and Castle went into liquidation just months before - sending their plans into chaos.She added: “I literally grew up being in love with Mamhead Estate, its motto is even where there is love, there is trust.“This really has ruined it.”Mamhead House and Castle Ltd operated from a stunning £.million Grade I listed mansion near Exmouth, Devon.Another couple to lose out was Roya Jamshidi and and Dean Turner, who paid £, to hire the venue for the weekend, including catering, photography and cake.Roya, a holiday home sales executive, went on the social network Twitter to let Peter Andre know what had happened.The singer told her, Ive heard, Im so sorry,.He encouraged her: Dont let it get you too down.Glen King and her husband David Greensmith were another couple affected and had just three weeks to find a new venue when Mamhead House and Castle ceased trading in September .Mrs King said: My heart goes out to all of the couples.Its not about the money, it has spoiled what was supposed to be the most magical day of your le and you cant get that back."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NINTCHDBPICT000458593008.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"space final frontier theme park ride","story":"And it never does.All we ever get back are some meaningless graphs and a lot of algebra.And before we get a chance to ask whether it was a sensible use of our money, Oliver the boffin is back with his bowl, saying: “Can I have some more, because I want to get a closer look at Uranus.”Back in , they launched a probe which would fly past Pluto.We were told, after it did that, that the furthest outpost in the solar system was “very cold”.But before anyone said “you don’t say”, Professor Boffin was out with his collecting box again saying thathe could just lay his hands on another couple of trillion, he could get the Pluto spacecraft to take a look at something called Ultima Thule.The ultimate roof box It’s a -mile long lump of rock shaped a bit like a peanut.“It’ll help us understand where we came from” he told us, predictably. Really I only ask because when the fly-by happened on New Year’s Day, the space craft was traveling at ,mph.This is known in technical circles as “very fast”.And think about it. If you try to take pictures of the underside of a motorway bridge as you pass by, you’re not going to learn much.And you’re only doing .So what nuggets of information came back from the edge of our solar system Ah well. Because the probe only has a -watt transmitter and because it’s four billion miles from earth and because the sun’s currently in the wrong place, we won’t have all the graphs and the algebra for  months.By which time, the boffins will have been given another gazillion dollars to go and look at another bit of frozen rock.I’m not one of those people who say the money should be spent on blankets for refugees.But can we stop pretending that space is a big encyclopaedia of facts we need to know Because it isn’t. The moon taught us nothing of any great consequence.Missions to Mars have given us nothing but a very good film starring Matt Damon and all we know about the bit between is that it’s cold and empty.Yes, further out, beyond the Thermal Shock Region, ten or five thousand galaxies from here, there could be all sorts of juicy titbits for the boffins to analyse.But we can’t get there.And we never will.Becauseyou were on a space ship that took off like the Enterprise, you’d fall over.So let’s concentrate our efforts on something which IS achievable.Turning space travel into the ultimate zero-g theme park ride for tourists.A CHINESE space craft landed on the Moon this week.I anticipate it will learn nothing of any great value but that, within a week, it will have built a factory that makes , pairs of training shoes every month.LIKE many other bores and cowards, I decided on New Year’s Eve to quit drinking for a little while.As I write, it’s lunch time on January  and already, a small rash has developed on my stomach.I looked it up on the internet and, of course, it’s cancer.I was going to have a drink to help me think about that but then I noticed that the pain in my hip is also cancer and so is my failing eyesight and so is my deafness and so is my wonky ankle and so is every symptom anyone has ever developed anywhere.As a research tool, the internet is brilliant. As a doctor, however, it’s scary . . . and almost always wrong.THERE are many noble and well-meaning attempts to make people stop filling the sea with bits of discarded plastic.Iceland, the supermarket chain, has started a “reverse vending machine” scheme which gives you a ten pence voucher for every empty plastic bottle you deposit.And there are many volunteers who comb the world’s coastlines, pulling plastic bags from the mouths of turtles and stranded dolphins.I wish all these people well.But I think a more targeted approach is necessary.Every time I go for a walk on Britain’s coastline, I notice that the high-tide mark is always littered with the plastic wrappers from milk chocolate Bounty bars and Flora margarine tubs.So how’s this for a plan You go to the people who make these things and you give them an ultimatum.Do something about it. Or we will do something to you, involving sharks.AS I watched the fireworks light up the night sky over London on New Year’s Eve, I wondered how long it would take someone to say the money should have been spent on the NHS.The answer, very depressingly, was about four seconds.Well, let me provide a retort.The amount of public money spent on the fireworks was £.million.Which isn’t even enough to buy one decent MRI scanner.Let me put it this way.You could save all your money for a rainy day and live on gruel.But it’s nice once in a while to spend a bit of it on beer and curry.MANY don’t enjoy the first few weeks of the year because it’s usually cold and dark and miserable.I love it though because all my friends are back from their Christmas holidays.Which means my Instagram feed is no longer full of their legs on a beach with nothing in the background but the blue sea and the bloody blue sky.I’M delighted to hear that Olivia Newton John isn’t as poorly as was reported earlier.I’ve always been a fan.Once, in fact, I wrote to Jim’ll Fix It askinghe could fix it for me to sleep with her.The filthy little pervert never even replied.THERE are so many exciting new things set to lt our spirits in .We have what will probably be the last Avengers movie and, a quarter of a century after the original, a new Toy Story.On the small screen, Game Of Thrones will be back and there will be world cups in rugby and cricket.The soundtrack will be provided by the Spice Girls reunion and . . .  none of you will be paying attention to any of it because this month, Theresa May’s useless Brexit deal will be dashed on the foreshore of democratic debate.This will cause Corbyn to propose a vote of no confidence which will trigger a general election.And the winner of that will stage a second referendum which will provide the same result as the first so there will be riots, petrol bombs, power cuts, death and the end of days.Despite this, though, I’d like to wish you all a happy New Year.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They prefer either to surrendering our economic future to Brussels for ever.If EU leaders genuinely want this signed off they are going the wrong way about it.A SOBERING week for Ireland’s gobby PM.After all his naïve grandstanding, aimed at thwarting Brexit, Leo Varadkar is on the brink of begging the EU for a huge bailoutthere’s a No Deal.He could have spent two years talking sense into Brussels, working on a decent deal to suit them and us. Instead he acted as their patsy, issuing childish threats and hyping up the hard-border myth . . . just as the EU wanted.Now his farmers face potential ruin, and he may need a “mega money” rescue.Hate to say it, Leo. But we did tell you.A FEW selfish rotters have won the Lottery over the years.How refreshing, then, that £million EuroMillions couple Frances and Patrick Connolly aim to make dozens of others rich too. “It’s going to be so much fun giving it away,” Frances says.Good luck to them.

There is nothing cosier than the cocoon of Christmas. And leaving it is a wrench.So a lot of people will be full of dread at the prospect of going back to work.But I actually think that January can be one of the most productive, exciting and dynamic months.And just in case you don’t agree, I’m going to share my tips on how to make January into Fanuary.The first step is to focus on what you want out of this new year. Becauseyou don’t make a plan you will end up exactly where you started, but this time in .If you hate your job, don’t just keep saying that: Work out why you hate it and what steps you need to take to change it. Brush up on your skills. Look for learning opportunities wherever you can — and take them.Be active and invest time in yourself. Dare to dream a bit by applying for jobs you like the look of, evenyou think they are out of your league.Andyou need a helping hand, sign up to my masterclass which will help you to write a killer CV — and even get the pay rise you want.It’s also really important to be positive — evenyou don’t always feel it.If you are surrounded by miserable, negative people you will end up that way too, so go out of your way to mix with positive, enthusiastic types.It’s very easy to stay in your comfort zone but you’ll never know what you are capable of achieving unless you try. Be brave and start taking risks.Another scenario is that you might not hate your job, but wish you felt more challenged, appreciated or engaged.If that’s the case, write a list of things you would doyou were fearless. Then act asyou were. Take small steps: Speak up in a meeting or put yourself forward for something you’ve never done before.And evenyou fail, be proud that you’ve tried.It’s also important to trust yourself — that’s the first step to improving your self image.If you lack self-confidence you won’t achieve much.You might be thinking, “It’s easy for you to say that — you’re successful”.But after my A-levels I never went to uni, and had no other qualications.I had to work really hard and be super-resilient because I could only ever rely on myself.On the way to success you’ll inevitably experience setbacks — but it’s how you respond to them that determines what happens next. Trust that you can handle them.One of the core communication skills is to be assertive, so try to have faith in your opinions. Sure, respect other people’s views but respect your own too.If you’re hoping for a pay rise or promotion in , I firmly believe thatyou don’t ask you don’t get.If the answer is no the first time round, find out what needs to change and work on that so that next time the answer is a yes.Personally, I never hear the word “No”.I hear: “Find another way to get what you want.”Most importantly, never stop encouraging yourself — and find a network to plug into.To network, you have to be ­interested and interesting. First impressions are made in the first seven seconds so, when you meet someone, make eye contact, smile, be polite — and dress the part.Put your phone away and work out an articulate way to explain who you are in  seconds. Be enthusiastic and be your own best friend.Feeling better about January now  I hope so.If you really want to Get What You Want — sign up to my new Masterclass and make this year all about you.IT’S not really a newsflash that British children are addicted to sugar. But the problem is worse than we might have thought.New research shows that from the age of two, children are consuming an average of almost oz of sugar a day, which is more than twice the recommended maximum daily allowance.This is not just destroying our young people’s teeth. Britain now has the worst obesity rate in Western Europe.Being overweight increases the risk of major health problems including Type  diabetes.So this is an unprecedented health crisis waiting to happen.And the reality is it’s not the fault of the Government, the NHS or the schools – it’s down to parents.It’s our responsibility to read food labels and cook healthy meals from scratch rather than relying on ready meals and takeaways.We also need to teach our kids to make good choices themselves and to develop a taste for healthy food.Unfortunately, though, the hardest word in the English language is “No”.Saying: “No, you can’t have sweets, crisps, fizzy drinks or sugary cereal” can be hard.And, often, it’s so much easier to say yes. Sure, you certainly get an easier le, but you’ll also have an obese, unhealthy and unhappy child.Obesity is now a disease. And it’s almost always a self- inflicted one, which takes years off our lives.The good news is that it’s reversible.Perhaps eating less sugar is one new year’s resolution we should all aspire to keep ANYONE  joining me by doing a Dry January this year I’m becoming a bit of a pro since I seem to do it every year.And while I wish I had some uplting advice about how to get through it, the reality is that I am prepared for a depressing, miserable boring month.The only way to survive it is to not go out, not have friends over, do absolutely zilch and just keep on sipping water.I suppose that’s the whole point, in a way.So welcome to the wagon – but roll on February.HUGE congratulations to Abbey Clancy and Peter Crouch on the announcement that they are expecting their fourth child.And also . . . isn’t Abbey looking fabulous in her Instagram snap Most of us, me included, looked like a bag of spuds after two children. But she has three kids already and another on the way and still looks incredible.I guess that’s a combination of good genes, good diet and the right exercise. But whatever she is doing, it’s working. Good for her!SOMETHING tells me that Justin Bieber might regret his new tattoo.He’s had the word “Grace” inked above his eyebrow, which is a lovely sentiment, but at first glance I’m sorry to say it looks a bit like he’s had stitches.And that’s not going to be a great image when he is .I’ve never understood tattoos – let alone on the face – and especially when the result looks like you’ve had a am trip to AE.I’M so happy to hear that every child is going to learn basic first aid including CPR in school to help boost heart attack survival rates.Education Secretary Damian Hinds has announced that he wants all pupils to be able to give emergency care by the time they leave school so more lives can be saved.All I can say is: About time.I did an advanced first aid course and now offer them to all my employees at West Ham. In fact, I actively encourage them to do it.You never know when you might use it, andsomeone does need it you could save their le. Now all schools need to do is bring back home economics lessons so kids can cook for themselves.Then they’ll have some real le skills when they finally leave home.“COULD do better”. That’s the phrase that went through my mind watching Khloe Kardashian twerking on New Year’s Eve for her boyfriend, Tristan Thompson . . . who was completely oblivious.A video showed Khloe shaking her bits and bobs in a silver and black leopard-print bodysuit for Tristan’s benefit – only to look round for a kiss and see that his back was turned.She is a beautul girl and, frankly, she doesn’t have to try so hard.Khloe could be with someone who is genuinely interested in her as opposed to flogging this dead horse. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Will it be a General Election, a second referendum, the Government’s deal or a “no deal” exit My guess is that the last two are the most likely.Theresa May’s tactic is to run down the clock until MPs feel they have no option but to back the Government’s deal and avoid a no-deal departure.The Government has been blitzing constituencies to put pressure on MPs via their supporters.But a recent poll indicated that  per cent of Conservative constituency workers think a no-deal Brexit would be better than the PM’s deal.So that tactic hasn’t worked, and a nasty Commons confrontation looms.It is not surprising that David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary, has suggested the PM should postpone the vote for a second time.It is the Irish backstop, that tortuous measure which binds Northern Ireland closely to EU regulations, which has caused the most dficulty, particularly as the Government is dependent on DUP votes for its survival.To the DUP it is unacceptable that there should, in effect, be a border down the Irish Sea. To Conservative MPs there is also the danger of being locked into the backstop indefinitely and that, having already agreed to accept £billion, the EU would have no incentive to move on and negotiate a decent Free Trade agreement.If the PM could somehow get firm assurances from the EU that would guarantee the backstop was definitely a temporary measure then that might persuade MPs, including the DUP, to change their minds.After all,the backstop is only temporary, all the things that are objectionable in the backstop, such as the inability to sign new trade deals, are also only temporary.It is not impossible that there could be a concession on these lines. Butthe Government is defeated in the Commons, what then In some ways the PM’s hand might be strengthened and she could say to Brussels that it is absolutely clear the present deal cannot get through ­Parliament.The EU will maintain that its offer is final, but this would not be the first time the EU has said that, only for a new offer to then appear.Opponents of Brexit cling to the hope that defeat in the Commons will lead either to a second referendum or a General Election. But neither will happen automatically.Under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, a General Election can only be heldParliament votes for one or the Government loses a vote of ­confidence.The DUP don’t want Jeremy Corbyn as PM and as long as Mrs May’s deal has not passed, the DUP will continue to support the Government.A second referendum could only happenthe Government introduced legislation for one. No Conservative PM would survive doing that.The remaining option is the so- called no-deal Brexit, which really means trading on World Trade ­Organisation terms with both the EU and the rest of the world.This is how much of world trade is conducted and how many countries outside the EU trade with the EU.Strictly speaking there is no such thing as a no-deal Brexit.There would be many side deals covering administrative areas that are not strictly trade, such as health regulations, safety, aviation, transportion of animals and so on.No one is claiming there would be no problems. Inevitably there will be some, but they would essentially be short term, and we would not face a bill of £billion.Leaving without a deal is feared by some large businesses anxious that integrated manufacturing supply chains might be interrupted. But Britain imports manufacturing components already from many non-EU areas of the world. These issues are solvable.Roberto Azevedo, Director General of the World Trade Organisation, has said there is no reason why trading on WTO terms should lead to disruption.He presumably knows what he is talking about.But the Government seems unable to make up its mind about a no-deal Brexit.Originally the PM boldly declared: “No deal is better than a bad deal”. Presumably she meant it.But recently the Government has launched Project Fear Mark , highlighting the alleged disaster of a no-deal Brexit in a lurid way.This campaign provoked a civil servant to write a remarkable anonymous article in a national ­newspaper declaring that “the civil ­service was ready for no-deal”, advanced preparations had been made and she accused the Government of deliberately concealing the work that had been done in order to pressurise MPs to swallow the ­Government’s “disastrous deal”.It seems probable that the Government will not be able to get the PM’s deal through Parliament and so will have to go back to Brussels, not just once, but maybe several times.If the EU refuses to budge, the automatic legal position is that the UK will leave on March , eventhere is no deal and stalemate in Parliament.There is very little that Parliament can do to stop that now. It is what Parliament has voted for in the past.My guess is that the EU may well come up with some concession, perhaps a legally binding clarication, and that there will be a lot of arguing, probably right up to midnight on March .But whatever happens, the next day we will leave.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She’s still doomed, her Brexit plan damned and Britain leaving Europe remains a isive national disaster. Nothing has changed when next week’s crucial vote in Parliament could be postponed again and a PM who is denying people another vote might push for her own in the House of Commons. In her TV interview, the clacking of the PM’s necklace beads was the death rattle of an inadequate leader at a seismic moment for the UK. Honesty could offer May salvation, but she is hell-bent on following the Brown Brexit Road to a sticky end. When this vicar’s daughter condemns children to foodbank charity she is no brave Dorothy, the sweet star of The Wizard of Oz.   Manipulative May cynically cloaks her personal survival as public duty and obstinately trudges towards a Blackmail Brexit she knows would impoverish and weaken Britain. Nothing has changed when she would not vote for her own Tory mess in a referendum. Finding a way forward is dficultnot impossible. On the Right, there’s the Blindfold Brexit fanaticism of the Tory and UKIP Boris Johnsons and Nigel Farages while Labour is led by an ingrained Euro-sceptic in Jeremy Corbyn.If the March  deadline for Britain quitting the EU is suspended, then the Brextremists must own the “betrayal” because their poundmillion lies and  promises would be to blame. The Brextremist liars are already costing us a fortune in NHS fridges, customs officials, empty lorries trundling around Kent, phantom ferries, dredged ports, renegotiated air deals, lost investment, squeezed living standards and economic growth. The time, energy and money squandered on the madness of Brexit so that plastic patriots can wave blue passports printed by a French company on Dependence Day is the gravest folly since the Second World War. May could stop it all, stand up and declare what was promised cannot be delivered. And now that we know the truth, the people should be allowed to decide. But she won’t do it. Instead, she will put her own interests and those of the Tory Party first – which will deservedly earn her the contemptuous scorn of future generations.   Put Tories in charge of the Epiphany celebrations and Chris Grayling would’ve booked camels from a firm with no animals and Sajid Javid ordered Border Force to detain the three wise men.A Tory MP told me Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson is loving Failing Grayling struggling at Transport and The Saj in the Home Office. It leaves him, Private Pike, only the third worst Cabinet Minister. TOO LITTLE TOO LATE Nobody listens any more when the Conservative Government pretends it’s saving the NHS because everybody knows Tory austerity’s crippled our most precious public service. The poundbillion extra by  promised again today by the Prime Minister is barely enough to keep pace with growing demand, never mind repair the terrible damage inflicted by the nine-year most-ruthless spending squeeze in NHS history.Repeatedly missing accident and emergency, cancer and operation targets with waiting lists growing to . million and ,-plus job vacancies is a sick record for the Tories. If May wants a pat on the back, I suggest she do it herself then book a physiotherapy appointment to repair the dislocated shoulder. It’d be a toss-up for which comes first: the physio or her ousting from No .Lib Dems predict a race to succeed Vince Cable between Jo Swinson and Layla Moran.

The BBCs Andrew Marr asked the Prime Minister: “Is this vote it  Is it the only chance MPs will get to support or oppose your deal  Or will you come back again and again and againyou lose the first time ” But she would only insist that the “European Union has made clear that this is the deal that is on the table” and that she is “working on getting this deal through Parliament.”  Even when Marr quoted a number  source saying she could bring it back “ times” in order to get the result she wanted, Mrs May wouldn’t rule it out. She would only say: “I want to see this deal go through. And I want to see it go through when people vote on it.” She added: If the deal is not voted on in the vote that is coming up, then actually we’re going to be in uncharted territory. I don’t think anybody can say exactly what will happen in terms of the reaction we’ll see in parliament.”  She said Labour was playing politics and opposing any deal to create the greatest chaos possible. We have got people who are promoting a second referendum in order to stop Brexit, and we have got people who want to see their perfect Brexit. I would say dont let the search for the perfect become the enemy of the good because the danger there is that we end up with no Brexit at all.

And when a TV drama comes back for a new series after a period of time off the air, the producers often put together a quick recap. A reminder of who that weird Alice person is, why Luther is so grumpy, or which residents of Westeros remain curiously un-murdered. Well, were about to embark on theoretically the final season of Brexit. So whether youre new to the show, or just need to be brought back up to speed - heres where we are and what happens next. Previously on Brexit...    In December, Theresa May fended off a challenge to her leadership of the Conservative Party from her own MPs. Enough letters were written to trigger a vote of no-confidence in her leadership. But between the huge number of MPs she has on the payroll and promising to step down before the next election, she survived the challenge. Shes now safe from similar challenges for a year. Mrs May went on to pull the scheduled meaningful vote at the last minute, fearing a defeat at the hands of Labour and the DUP. The DUP have a voting deal with the Conservatives - but they have deep concerns about the Northern Ireland backstop - and say they wont back her deal in its current form. So she headed back to Brussels to try and convince the EU  leaders to to seek assurances over the controversial backstop.But EU chief Donald Tusk has issued a hardline statement saying: We will not renegotiate the deal, including the backstop.He said only that the EU can discuss how to facilitate UK ratication - in other words - cosmetic tweaks to the political declaration.Juncker added:There is no room whatsoever for renegotiation. Meanwhile, with the chances of a deal looking ever more remote, the Government triggered its contingency planning for Britain crashing out of the EU without a deal.  This morning, Theresa May insisted her vote IS going to happen once Parliament s - but she wouldnt guarantee thatMPs reject her deal, she wont bring the vote back again and again and again. What happens next  The meaningful vote is expected in the week commencing January  - most likely on Tuesday, January . Before then, theres a week of debate on the deal in the Commons. But it doesnt seem like MPs views on her deal have changed all that much over the festive period, and theres still a substantial chance itll be voted down. Or, alternatively, Labour and Tory MPs will run out of patience and take action before that happens. Either way, the options after that are pretty similar. Here are the main ones on the table.  Theresa May can resign as Tory leader, like David Cameron did after Britain voted Leave in . She seems unlikely to go of her own free will, but she might be forced to quit by the men in grey suits of her Cabinet. This wont force a general election - but it will force a Tory leadership contest. After all the candidates are declared, MPs eliminate one at a time in votes held each Tuesday and Thursday - like a Big Brother eviction. The final two candidates then go to the ,-or-so strong Tory membership for a final vote. Expect a battle between Remainers like Amber Rudd and Brexiteers like Boris Johnson and Esther McVey. Others like Sajid Javid and Jeremy Hunt could try to appeal to both camps, or leavers and Remainers could run on a joint ticket. HOW IT COULD END: A Brexiteer is thought to have the best chances among the Tory grassroots - and could drive the UK off the clf-edge of No Deal. If a Remainer wins, they could bring in a Norway plus option of softer Brexit.  MPs can use Parliament to force a general election in two ways. The first is to vote directly for an early election. But itd need two-thirds of MPs backing to pass. That means more than  Tories would need to vote for an election - thats very, very unlikely. The other option however is for MPs to vote no confidence in Theresa Mays government. This would only need half of MPs backing, so around  or  Tories. If a this motion passes, parties have  days to try to form a new government. That would give Labour a chance to team up with smaller parties. If no combination can win half of MPs backing within  days, a general election is triggered automatically. More than  Labour MPs and peers have called on Jeremy Corbyn to call a no confidence vote in the government this week - and the Lib Dems say they would back Labour in such a vote. But Labour sources worry bringing a no confidence vote too soon would just risk failure. Its a big ask for Tory MPs to vote their government down. Its not thought Labour would bring such a vote before Mrs May has gone to Brussels. HOW IT COULD END: This could trigger the countdown to a full-blown general election - refreshing the parliamentary arithmetic and allowing some kind of deal to pass. Labour Remainers also claim it could be used to force through a second referendum. But Labour arent planning to demand a no confidence motion until after the vote, because they only want to proposeit they know they can win. And Jeremy Corbyns allies insist other options should be exhausted before the prospect of a second referendum is taken up.  If there is a vacuum of power Labour claims it could take control - with or without an election. Jon Trickett, the Shadow Cabinet Office minister, said the very strongly preferred option is to force an election. If thats not possible, he claimed we are ready to form a minority government. But its not clear how this would actually happen. Theres been some suggestion Labour could force a censure motion in the Prime Minister. However, some opinions suggest evenshe resigned, Theresa May would have a duty to stay in office until a replacement is installed through a Tory leadership contest. The Queen can be invited to nominate a leader who can command Parliaments support - but onlya PM resigns on behalf of the government. If Theresa May resigns from her inidual position, its not so clear. HOW IT COULD END: Labour,they manage to take power, would try to renegotiate with the EU. But theyd run into the same dficulties, since Jeremy Corbyn has insisted that under his plan, there certainly wouldn’t be a backstop from which you can’t escape. Deadlock could then lead to a second EU referendum or general election. . MPs try to force a second EU referendum   Fears are growing among No insiders and Cabinet ministers that we will end up with a second referendum. Several Tory ministers have quit to demand a so-called Peoples Vote. There are many paths to such a vote and none of them are certain. But momentum for it is growing. One way would be for Labour to take power and push for one - this is covered above. Another way would beMPs win an effort to direct the government about what happens nextshe loses the vote. In theory they could mount a bid to force the PM into holding a new referendum. HOW IT COULD END: Remain could win, infuriating Brexiteers and in their words, splitting the country - but potentially halting Brexit in the process. On the other hand Leave could win for a second time - meaning were no further along than we are now. Andnone of that works  We leave on  March  with no deal.

Sophie Giblins ten-month-old daughter Alayna suffers from an undiagnosed brain condition which means she has regular spasms that can be brought on by almost anything - including teething and nappy changes. Her mum described how little Alaynas diaphragm spasms, causing her full body to stfen so she cant breathe - until finally she takes a big breath and is released. The spasms - which started when she was three months old but continue today - can last anything from  seconds to a minute, and happen five to  times a day, Sophie says. Alaynas condition means her brain doesnt tell her to breathe, so she has to have a non invasive oxygen mask overnight and during the day she uses nasal cannulas, her mum explained. The tot sadly deteriorated when in October she battled sepsis, leaving her terried mum and dad Jezz Bateson, , fearing for her le. But their one in a million girl pulled through and inspires her parents day by day with her strength.  At the beginning it was horrible to watch because she turns blue at the same time, -year-old Sophie from Withernsea, Yorkshire, told Mirror, speaking about Alaynas spasms. It frightens other people but now we stay calm because we know she will come back out of it. We call her holding her breath having a paddy. To get her out of it we put her dummy in and tap it because she loves her dummy - and that way she has to breathe out of her nose or we turn her oxygen up. All we want is for her to be comfortable and happy. Speaking of when Alayna contracted sepsis, Sophie told: I just cried and cried and didnt know what to do or what to say. It all happened so quickly, we didnt know how to process it. It was awful but we clung to each breath she took. When she went into septic shock we were told to expect the worst. We were terried we would lose her. We just kept being told she is a sick little girl and we dont know what the next  hours will hold. She was in such a critical condition. We have been through so much with her - and to have something that was nothing to do with her condition was horrible. We always thought it would be her le-threatening condition that would break her down. It was so hard to handle. We didnt know what we could tell our sons. I really didnt think she would pull through it because of her condition but Jezz said shes strong, she can do this and he helped pull me through.  Sophie added: She is honestly one in a million. Not only is she coping with all of her conditions she has just recently battled with sepsis and nearly lost her le but has come out the other side. She is our inspiration. Sophie said no problems were detected during her pregnancy. Shed noticed after Alayna was born that she would hold her breath temporarily when she was having nappy changes or when she was hungry, but Sophie says they were told it wasnt concerning at that stage. But a fortnight later, Alayna seemed to change colour. Two weeks after she was born she turned a grey-blue colour, Sophie said. We were just at home doing our day to day routine. She seemed fine, but just a dferent colour. People came round and commented on it. We took her to the GP who sent us to hospital as a precaution. There, she was given oxygen, but nobody knew anything.  Alayna was taken to AE at the Hull Royal Infirmary where she had an ECG, MRI and CT scan which her mum says came back clear. But Sophie was told that Alaynas carbon dioxide levels had increased dramatically over the two weeks from holding her breath and not letting enough out. So she was put on oxygen until her condition stabilised. Then aged  weeks, Alayna was transferred to the Leeds Childrens Hospital in May for further tests which showed she had too much white matter on her brain. Sophie was told her daughters brain was still like a newborns. When she was born, for two weeks she was a perfect baby, she said. It was hard to come to terms with the fact she is not going to be able to do certain things. Doctors said they didnt knowshe would progress orshe would stay like that- it was devastating.  At eight months old, Sophie said her baby had developed as much as a three month old. Medics had said at the  week scan that she had a le limiting brain condition - but Sophie says they still dont have an exact diagnosis. We still dont know what shes going to be able to do andshe is going to be able to do anything, she told. Alayna also has hypotonia, commonly known as floppy baby syndrome, which is a state of low muscle tone. She is on quite a lot of medication to try and soothe her and can only eat pureed food. Sophie says they dont know whats going to happen in the future and try to take each day as it comes, remaining as normal as possible for their sons Harry, five, and George, three.  Alayna spent the first six months of her le in hospital - between Hull and Leeds - before the family were finally able to take her home. But her shock battle with sepsis in October sadly made her condition worsen. Sophie had become concerned after Alayna was asleep for too long and so she took her to hospital to check everything was OK. But the mum says a water infection turned into septic shock and within a day her whole body was shutting down. Everything went dramatically downhill. Everyone thought that was it for her. Alayna was put on a lot of medication, sedated, incubated and put on a ventilator, Sophie said. We were told she was a very, very poorly child, she continued.  But each day she seemed to get better. She was trying her hardest and has been doing brilliantly. Everyone is shocked with how far she has come already - but it was frightening. Jezz is the strong one and we all followed him and tried to stay strong. She looked so small attached to everythingat every angle. All of us broke down. But within a few days she started waking up and slowly but surely coming back to her normal self. Alayna eventually came off the ventilator in place for a non-invasive one.

The -year-old, from Chelmsford in Essex, subjected his ex to a deluge of phone calls, messages and emails and even showed up at her home on several occasions. Dinig and Miss Lawrences relationship ended due to his jealousy over her relationship with her children’s father, Chelmsford Crown Court heard on Friday, reports EssexLive. While the two then had an on-and-off relationship, there came a point where the victim had enough of Dinigs behaviour and blocked him on social media.  Dinig, who has an eight-year-old daughter from a previous relationship, then took a course of action which descended into harassment. He would call Miss Lawrence between  to  times a day from a withheld number, would call from his own phone and he would also email her five times a day. Prosecuting, Alex Wright revealed how Dinig would beg his former girlfriend to rekindle their relationship and detailed how he started showing up at her home. One one occasion Dinig left shopping outside Miss Lawrences house and another time he left a note stating love you. “She contacted police after he sent an email to her ex, her ex’s parents and her, saying he and Miss Lawrence were in love and they should stop coming between them,” Mr Wright told the court. “On September  he phoned her while he was drunk and he kept ringing and turned up at her home address. “The police were called and he’d been trying to get in her car and through the back door.” Dinig also sent further messages on September  and additional calls to his victim were made between September  to October . Following the repeated incidents of harassment, matters became more serious for Dinig when he made contact with another woman. The woman, who had known the defendant for a long time, had been urging the victim not to get into a relationship with him. In a message sent to the second woman, Dinig told her to tell Miss Lawrence I have tried to kill myself or something”. Another message stated: “Make her retract it. I am so close to getting [my daughter] back.” She did not act on any of those requests but instead contacted Miss Lawrence to tell her about the messages.  This led to Dinig’s eventual arrest and he was charged with attempting to pervert the course of justice. During the proceedings at Dinig’s sentencing hearing today, his previous convictions were read out to the court. His most recent conviction was in May  and it was also mentioned that there had been two previous incidents where he had been accused of harassing a former partner, including the mother of his daughter. “He was under post-sentence supervision at the time of these activities,” noted Judge Turner. “He had finished the Building Better Relationships course in October, which doesn’t suggest it was particularly successful. The judge added: “This is the third relationship breakdown that has taken him into harassment - it makes it out ashe isn’t learning.” Defending Dinig, Alex Burrell admitted his client had dficulty accepting the relationship with Miss Lawrence had come to an end. However, he stated that his client had insisted that his focus was to repair his mistakes, rekindle his relationship with his daughter and at no stage was there ever a threat of violence. “He had a problem accepting it was over,” Mr Burrell added. “He has an eight-year-old daughter and his focus is to ensure he has as much contact with her and to do the electrical contract work he was doing before. Mr Burrell also explained that some of Dinig’s behaviour may be down to his father having an extramarital affair when he was younger. After hearing from both the prosecution and defence, Judge Turner passed sentence on Dinig. “For a third occasion in your le a relationship has gone badly wrong,” he said.  “To put it colloquially you haven’t been able to take no for an answer. “You must have known perfectly well the legal requirements you have to abide by and for some reason you haven’t managed to keep yourself under control. “That’s very concerning and very unpleasant for her. “You went entirely the wrong way about it and not for the first time. The judge continued: “You are now -years-old and you are a father of an eight-year-old - it’s time you started to take responsibility for your conduct. “This is the third relationship you have gone down this road and you have got seven convictions for  offences. “You appear to have learned almost nothing. “The irony here to this case is that you had finished the ‘Building Better Relationships’ programme. “None of that seems to have focused your mind.” Dinig, of Waveney Drive, was sentenced to six months in prison for perverting the course of justice and two months for harassment. Both sentences will be served consecutively. Dinig, who will serve half that time in custody, was also made subject to a restraining order for three years.

They increased from two reports of sexual assault in  to  in  then dropped. However the full data from  has not been released. Data from Dyfed-Powys Police, who cover mid-Wales showed there were six allegations of rape and  of sexual assault against people too young to be prosecuted, and in Gwent there were  of rape and  of sexual assault. In South Wales, no offences were recorded - but the force said the data is not routinely collated and while searches by its analysts found no results, it could not be sure this was accurate. A spokesman NSPCC Cymru said the charity was aware sexual crimes being committed by children were happening far too frequently.   There is something particularly shocking and disturbing about a child being sexually abused by another young person, he said. Unfortunately, we know that it is happening far too frequently with our Childline service providing thousands of counselling sessions a year to children to whom this has happened. Both victim and perpetrator are at risk of suffering lasting damage as a result of this abuse. Tackling it demands that all children are introduced to concepts such as boundaries and consent from primary school onwards so they understand what sexual abuse is and know how to keep themselves safe. Police said all reports of this nature were thoroughly investigated. Dyfed-Powys told the BBC that there was no standardised way of collecting the data so it is dficult to compare it with other forces.

Millionaire businessman Richard Mason, , was told by doctors he had been infertile since birth after being diagnosed with cystic fibrosis. DNA tests confirmed he had no biological link to his eldest son, now , and his -year-old twins. Richard, a co-founder of Moneysupermarket, believes the same man fathered the boys during a four-year affair with his ex-we Kate, . She admitted being unfaithful in , nine years after they separated, when he confronted her about the children’s paternity. It is not knownKate’s ex-lover knows he is the real father and she has refused to disclose his name.  Now Richard is planning to write a book about his traumatic ordeal and plans to litter it with clues as to the identity of his ex’s lover. He hopes it will lead to the mystery man being identied. Richard said it was: “Not least for the boys’ sake because they will want to know who their real father is, even , hopefully, they’ll always think of me as their dad.” Richard was told in  he had cystic fibrosis, a disease which mainly affects the lungs and causes men to be sterile. On receiving the shocking news he launched a legal bid to claw back some of Kate’s poundmillion orce settlement, as well as suing her for paternity fraud. She has since been ordered to pay pound, after a legal case that allowed her not to disclose the real father’s identity. Richard, now remarried to we Emma, , said the revelation about his sons had left him heartbroken. “You don’t know what’s real and what isn’t – it’s asI’m living in the Matrix,” he added. “In an instant I discovered I didn’t really have any children.” He claimed his ex-we “tricked’ him into thinking the boys were his. And he said: “After the orce, she constantly hounded me for more maintenance, even though I always complied with the Child Support Agency demands. “The biological father has never paid a penny as far as I know.” A possible clue to the identity of the man is that Kate became interested in Judaism, insisted all three children were given Jewish middle names and refused to have them christened. Despite winning his legal case against his ex, now living with a new partner in Uttoxeter, Staffs, two of his sons have cut off contact with him. He said: “I’m not their father, I know that, but I’m still their dad. When I talk about them with other people, naturally, after  years, I say ‘my sons’, then I have to stop and correct myself and say, ‘the sons I thought were mine’.” His solicitor Roger Terrell said the case was thought to be a legal first. He added: “There has never been a orce financial settlement set aside in such emotive circumstances. “Normally it’s the husband brought back to court because he’s failed to disclose some of his income, but in this case it was the we, and paternity of the children was the issue.” "},{"url":null,"title":"kate middleton joins queen church","story":"NewsKate Middleton joins Queen for church service as Christmas break comes to an endThe Duchess of Cambridge, Kate Middleton, joined her husband Prince William and the Queen for a service at St Mary Magdalene ChurchShareCommentsByZoe ForseyActing Audience Editor:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsKate and William were smiling as they arrived \"Get Royal Family updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge joined the Queen for a church service in Sandringham as their Christmas break comes to an end.

The detective stared back as he read the charges which would, he believed, land the triple murderer behind bars for le and saw Bellfield deflate. Sutton recalls: “He narrowed his eyes, he was absolutely still, staring me out. He hated me in that moment. “But you could also see that he had started to believe he had lost. “This was the man who later in court pretended to lick the microphone in the witness box like a lollipop, he was that arrogant. But in that moment he had nothing, no comeback at all.” Sutton says: “Never before had I so loved being hated. I loved the reason he hated me – we had taken a massive step to beating him.” The senior officer had led the team of detectives which, after a long and shypainstaking investigation, cracked the murders of Marsha McDonnell, , and Amelie Delagrange, . In doing so they first linked the “hammer killer” to the unsolved  murder of -year-old Milly Dowler. The probe is dramatised in ITV’s drama Manhunt, which started last night and stars Martin Clunes as Sutton. In dealing with Bellfield, Sutton saw the insecurities behind his bluster.   He recalls an extraordinary moment, hours after Bellfield’s arrest in November , when the desperate killer tried to hang himself in the most absurd fashion – with his head down the toilet. Sutton says: “In his cell he took the tape from his tracksuit, he put that round his neck and managed to get the end around the fixture for the flush. “But it was only ft off the ground, so to get it tight he had to stick his head down the loo. There was no way he was going to kill himself. I think it was a half-hearted, attention-seeking stunt.” Officers heard the attempt and managed to yank his head out. “I asked the doctorhe had Harpic poisoning – it got a few laughs, but not from Bellfield,” adds shySutton, wryly. Black humour was shysometimes the only way to offset the trauma in a case this dark.   The process leading to Bellfield shyeventually being charged for murder was painstaking. After his arrest, Bellfield could only be kept in custody thanks to charges ofshy assault and rape on three former partners – crimes which came to light during Sutton’s team’s investigation into his history of violence and abuse of women. It was only in March  that Sutton could stand before Bellfield and charge him with Amelie’s murder, and the attempted murder of another young woman, Kate Sheedy, , in May . The charge for Marsha’s murder came two months after that, and Bellfield, now , was convicted of all three charges at the Old Bailey in February . A conviction for Milly’s killing came three years later after Surrey police followed Sutton’s hunch in a separate probe. All these years on dad-of-two Sutton, , now retired and living in Suffolk, is reliving the landmark case of his career. He has written a book about the investigation, Manhunt: How I Brought Serial Killer Levi Bellfield To Justice, which is published this week to coincide with ITV’s three-parter, which is based on it and concludes tonight and tomorrow.  In the first episode we saw Sutton open his case when French student Amelie is found with fatal head injuries on Twickenham Green, South West London, on August , . The probe was meticulous – not least the police efforts to trace the killer’s vehicle. After a small white van was spotted at the murder scene and shyidentied as a Ford Courier made between  and , all , of the vehicles in the UK were probed. Former bouncer Bellfield’s name quickly came to the forefront when past partners come forward with revelations about his violence towards them. And it soon emerged he had owned a white van. In a similar fashion, police linked Bellfield to Marsha’s murder  months earlier, examining CCTV taken from a bus she was on and seeing a silver Vauxhall Corsa travel past as she got off.They worked out Bellfield owned one but had to rule out , similar shyvehicles. When that was narrowed down to  cars,  separate statements just left Bellfield. And they uncovered a link to the attempted murder of Kate Sheedy, run over as she attempted to cross the road three months before Amelie’s death. Sutton found crucial CCTV footage of the hit-and-run in Isleworth, West London, but initially detectives viewed the wrong night. Six months later they watched the correct footage. It showed Bellfield’s car and could have led police to him and saved Amelie’s le – had they viewed it. Viewers of the series will see Sutton visit the shyDelagranges to tell them the truth and apologise for Scotland Yard.  “I was tearful talking to the Delagranges, I think I managed to mask it, I don’t know,” he recalls. “It was the most dficult thing I can remember having to do in the police. I spoke to a lot of recently bereaved people, but to explain they had been let down because of this stupid mistake. In some ways the way they reacted made it more emotional. “If they, as I feared, had got really annoyed and upset, I had prepared myself, but I hadn’t prepared for them being so utterly reasonable. “It was almost surreal, they were so calm and understanding. So dignied. I felt exactly the same emotions welling up when I watched that scene in the drama, it put me back there doing it.I cried again, it brought it all back and I remembered how emotional an experience that was.” Sutton is still in touch with the family, as he is with Marsha’s. Since writing the book he has also made contact with the Dowlers for the first time.  While investigating Bellfield, it dawned on him that the nightclub doorman had lived close to where Milly went missing near the railway station in Walton-on-Thames. Today, he says he can’t blame Surrey police for missing that link – Bellfield wasn’t on their radar. But in the book, Sutton’s frustration is clear when he describes the moment where he takes investigators his theory and proof Bellfield was on the scene – only to discover they had a lack of crucial CCTV evidence.“I knew they had messed up, they knew they had messed up, and now they knew I knew they had,” he writes. But the Dowlers are clearly grateful for his input. “The Dowlers have thanked me,” he admits. “It means a lot.” Sutton is unaffected personally by the trauma of the case but knows nothing can ever heal the victims’ families hurt. “I always had this great feeling of hopelessness, powerlessness, at the end of trials,” he says. “We had done the very best we could for them but it still wouldn’t bring the person back.” Manhunt: How I Brought Serial Killer Levi Bellfield To Justice by Colin Sutton, published by John Blake on Thursday, pound..

Harrys great great grandfather King George V limited titles within the Royal Family in , meaning Baby Sussex will be too far down the line of succession to be a Prince or a Princess. However this could all changethe Queen steps in and decides to give the newest member of the family a title. But according to the Mail on Sunday, she hasnt done this yet. And theres a very good chance she wont as Harry and Meghan have spoken openly in the past about wanting their children to have as normal an upbringing as possible.  The Duke and Duchess of Sussexs baby, expected in Spring , will be a great-grandchild of the Queen - which is too far down the line of succession to be an HRH. The baby will be seventh in the line, pushing Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie down to th and th. George V declared that: The grandchildren of the sons of any such Sovereign in the direct male lineshall have and enjoy in all occasions the style and title enjoyed by the children of Dukes of these Our Realms. The eldest son and heir apparent of a duke can use one of his fathers lesser grade peerage titles by courtesy, according to Debretts. So a first son of Harrys would become Earl of Dumbarton - one of the subsidiary titles Harry received from the Queen on the morning of his wedding. A daughter would be LadyMountbatten-Windsor, and any subsequent sons LordMounbatten-Windsor.  But the Queen could make changes to allow Harry and Meghans children to be HRHs and princes and princesses. Ahead of Prince Georges birth, the monarch issued a Letters Patent to ensure the Cambridge children had fitting titles. Without this Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis would have been a Lady and a Lord instead, but Prince George, as the eldest son of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales, would still have been a prince. The Queen could decide to do the same for Harry and Meghans baby, but its very unlikely that he or she will ever take the throne.The duke may heed the words of his cousin Zara Tindall when discussing such matters with the Queen, and deciding which titles his child should use. Zara, who was born Miss Zara Phillips, has spoken of how not having a title was a blessing. Ive been very lucky. My parents didnt give us titles, so weve been able to have a slightly more normal upbringing. As soon as youve got a title, its very dficult to shed it, she said.  Harry too has told of the pressures of being a prince and has always stressed the importance of being seen as normal. He confessed in  that he once wanted out of the Royal Family. Harry said the time he spent in the Army - when he was just Harry - was the best escape Ive ever had and he once considered giving up his title. I felt I wanted out but then decided to stay in and work out a role for myself, he said. The Earl and Countess of Wessexs children Lady Louise Mountbatten-Windsor and Viscount Severn are actually entitled to be a princess and prince as children of the son of the sovereign. But the couple decided, with the Queens agreement, that their children would use the courtesy titles as sons or daughters of an earl rather than the style prince or princess. An example of a royal duke handing down a courtesy title to his son is the Queens cousin the Duke of Gloucester when his son Alexander was born in . Alex is known by the dukes subsidiary title Earl of Ulster, while the dukes daughters, before their marriages, were Lady Davina Windsor, and Lady Rose Windsor. Earl of Ulsters own son Xan - the dukes grandchild - is Lord Culleden - taken from the dukes third title Baron Culleden. If Harry had a son who had a son - Harrys grandchild - he would be Lord Kilkeel, taken from Harrys third title Baron Kilkeel.

But a member of staff at the Five Clouds Tap and Bottle in Macclesfield, Cheshire told her that the T-shirt offended other customers. And as a result, the barwoman informed her she was banned because of the clothing item, which was considered as transphobic and not inclusive. Ms Wershbale told the Mail on Sunday: What she meant was that I was somehow offending men who say they are women because my T-shirt did not include them in the definition of a woman. There aren’t even any transgender staff or patrons at the pub. It’s crackers. The -year-old backs the feminist group Fair Play For Women, which opposed a Government consultation to reform the Gender Recognition Act .   This would let people self-identy as the gender they believe they are without the need for medical diagnosis. But transgender campaigners and feminists have been in battle, as there are fears that the reform will harm the safety and privacy of women.

However she was shocked that a barwoman spoke to her regarding the complaint against her T-shirt. Ms Weshbale claims that nothing unusual happened during her visit until she spoke to a fellow customer, a gay man called Mika Johnson. She sat next to him and asked how he was but he made it clear that he did not wish to speak to him.   Around half an hour later the member of staff spoke to Ms Weshbale and told her she could not stay at the pub as she had been upsetting other customers and Mr Johnson was crying. She told the Mail on Sunday: She mumbled a bit about [my T-shirt] being transphobic and that I had been transphobic previously. She then said I was barred and that she had been nominated by the other bar staff to come to tell me that. That same day Mr Johnson took to Twitter to speak of his distress.   He posted: When you’re trying to relax in your fave pub and there is a TERF [trans exclusionary radical feminist] wearing an anti-trans T-shirt… it’s disgusting and I’m so upset by it. Tom Lewis, the owner of Five Clouds Tap and Bottle Brewery confirmed Ms Wershbale was asked to leave following the complaint.

Sara was inspired after she ed home from a pride festival in Oklahoma where she heard real horror stories.  This included tales of children living out of their cars, who had been kicked out of their churches or homes for just for identying as LGBT. But the mum-of-two admits that she was not always so liberal herself and that when her son told her in  he was gay, it took years for her to accept it. The Oklahoma City secretary however eventually began to stand up against her conservative Baptist church’s stance that homosexuality is shameful.   Then four years ago she and her husband attended a gay pride parade in Oklahoma with their son. It was there that she learned of everyones experiences which led her and other ally mothers to form the Free Mom Hugs organisation. Since her post, Sara has been invited to attend several weddings, and she said that her message has created something of a movement. She added: Im not the first mom to offer free mom hugs or attend weddings as a stand-in. But when we show up for any group thats marginalised, thats how we can make sure they really know they are loved and celebrated.

And from today, courts must noty women of their marital status via TEXT in an effort to put an end to secret orces. The measure approved by the justice ministry will help stamp out cases where men end a marriage without informing their wives. Texts would mean that women will be completely aware of their marital status which will help protect their rights including alimony. Lawyer Samia al-Hindi told local newspaper Okaz that it is common for women to file appeals to courts over being orced without their knowledge. In June last year, women celebrated going behind the wheel for the first time after a decade-old female driving ban was overturned.  Women can also enter sports stadiums, which was previously a male-only arena. The kingdom is also pushing for greater participation of women in the workforce in an attempt to ersy its oil-dependent economy. But women still remain subject to male ship laws. This allows men to exercise arbitrary authority to make decisions on behalf of their female relatives.  Saudi lawyer Nisreen al-Ghamdi told Bloomberg: The new measure ensures women get their [alimony] rights when theyre orced. It also ensures that any powers of attorney issued before the orce are not misused. This new regulation is part of economic and social reforms pushed by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.  However there are still a number of things that Saudi women are unable to do without permission from a male , usually a husband, father, brother or son. This includes opening a bank account, applying for passports, travelling abroad and getting married. Also getting elective surgery, starting certain businesses and leaving prison. The ship system has contributed to making Saudi Arabia one of the most gender unequal countries in the Middle East.

We controlled the game and had chances to score the second.“We didn’t and then we concede two goals and that is not good. If we want to be top of this league we cannot repeat this mistake.”Painful as the unexpected defeat was, he believes what’s vital now is United put the disappointment of what was only a second defeat since Neilson took charge in October, behind them as quickly as possible.And with home games against Partick Thistle and Dunfermline coming up over the next two Saturdays, he wants the focus to be on what lies ahead and not what’s just gone.“We now just have to think about the next game. We have two games coming now at home and we must think about that and make sure we win them.“Alloa was a very big disappointment but there is still half of the season for us to play and we must put things right. We must keep going and be strong for the rest of the season.“We have been good in most home games and we must make sure that continues.”Since his arrival near the end of the summer transfer window on a two-year contract at Tannadice, Bouhenna has impressed as a hard-tackling centre-half who can also play when he is moving forward with the ball at his feet.Saturday past, however, saw him moved into a midfield holding role and despite the result, put in an impressive performance.For him that change of role was about doing what was needed for the team.“I have played before some games in the midfield. Fraser Fyvie was injured and I will play there because you must always do what is needed for the team.“It was not a surprise because when I came here I played some games in midfield and when the manager asked me to play there I was happy to do it for the team.“I have played some games there during my career. Centre-back is my best position, of course, but I knew I could help the team there and I did it.”"},{"url":null,"title":"coastguards in tayside and fife receive 397 hoax calls","story":"Coastguards in Tayside and Fe are being plagued by hoax calls which are putting lives in danger.The Maritime and Coastguard Agencyhas received ,  alarms from across Scotland since , with , or %, classed as hoaxes.A total of  calls were recorded between Stonehaven in the north and the southern mouth of the Forth, % of the Scottish total.Malicious calls made up .% of contacts, more than the Scottish average.

I paid money to take him to MK Dons and his first season was excellent.#It hasn#t worked for him under a new manager down there, but I see him as the type of creative player who can help us produce more in the final third of the park.#Another possible target is midfielder Ian Harkes, who was recently released by MLS side DC United, where he’s been a team-mate of Wayne Rooney.Harkes, , is the son of former USA international John and qualies to play in this country because he was born in England during his father’s time with Derby County.By next week they could also be joined by former Tangerines favourite Morgaro Gomis.

Until departures are confirmed, Robbie would not name names.It’s believed, though, that one of them is defender-cum-midfielder Adam Barton, while winger Yannick Loemba is another who’s not likely to be seen again in tangerine.Since Robbie took charge in October, former Jag Barton has had just  minutes of game time via two sub appearances.He’s set to move back to England where he’s spent most of his career.Loemba’s time on the pitch has been even more limited under the new boss and amounts to a four-minute appearance against Inverness in October.Like Barton, the Congolese-born Belgian passport holder only arrived in the summer.

Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":null,"title":"man knocked down new years","story":"NewsMan knocked down in New Years Day hit and run as police appeal for witnessesA man was knocked down with the driver of a vehicle failing to stop following the incident in Tarbolton.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  JAN NewsPolice are appealing for witnesses following the incident\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA man was knocked down after being the victim of a hit and run attack in Tarbolton.

Vanessa Good, who heads up her own independent firm based in the town’s Newmarket Street, admits travellers need “far more clarity” over Brexit. But she this week laughed off the notion that flights will be grounded – leaving sunseekers stranded – when Britain takes a step into the unknown. It comes as fears grow that a ‘no deal’ Brexit will spark chaos at Britain’s borders and lead to untold problems for travellers. Vanessa, , who bosses the Good Travel Company, said: “There’s no doubt people are on edge at the moment. “Our customers are still coming in to book holidays in the usual numbers, but there is understandable concern. “The problem is we’re seeing so much political scaremongering and it’s hugely unsettling at a time we need far more clarity.” Vanessa, whose firm employs seven across two sites and also specialises in currency exchange, insists her team is trying to issue a note of calm to holidaymakers. She said: “We have people flying out to EU destinations on March , which is the day after Brexit, and they’re perfectly relaxed about the situation. “Others are more concerned so we’ve seen some look to other destinations as a result. “After all, the world is a lot bigger than Europe, and there will definitely be a knock-on effect in that regard. “Market experts say a no-deal will have a negative impact on the pound, and that is obviously something that nobody wants to see. “But the idea that they start grounding flights and nobody can move anywhere seems a bit far fetched. “Uncertainty will always be the biggest crippler and that is the problem facing the industry just now. “But our message to people is to continue booking their holidays as before. “In reality, it is changes like the new EU visa coming into play in , which will cost around seven euros every three years, which will be the biggest dference.” An ABTA spokesperson said: “The European Commission has said that even in a no-deal scenario, flights will still operate between the UK and EU. “ABTA is providing holidaymakers and travellers with advice about Brexit and travel, including on pet passports and driving licences, which can be found at abta brexit.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnEuropean UnionAyrHolidaysAyr News"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"woman admits acting intimidating manner","story":"NewsWoman admits to acting in intimidating mannerThe -year-old shouted, swore and acted in an aggressive and intimidating way towards Shannon Kerr.ShareByAyrshire Post:,  DEC NewsAyr Sherf Court \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA woman has admitted to acting in an intimidating manner.

She revealed: “I turned up alone and felt very apprehensive. “Due to my illness this wasn’t an easy thing for me to do, as I can be very self-conscious and don’t often go many places on my own, but I needn’t have worried.” Class wellness coach Kellie Brown and her team quickly put Deborah at ease, and she has now only missed one workshop since joining.   During her battle her weight has snowballed up and down as her medications changed. She said: “I am delighted with my weight loss so far as I am feeling much better, not just physically, but I think more importantly, mentally I am in a better place. Going out I do not feel as self-conscious and my confidence is now a lot better. “I went to my nephew’s wedding a happier and much more confident and content person, and looked forward to it, instead of dreading going. “This is all thanks to Kellie and the group I attend at Coylton and this time I will be continuing to attend workshops to help keep me on track.” She tracks calories with an online WW app as she trawls supermarket aisles.   Deborah said: “I love the fact there are so many zero smartpoint foods, and I eat out quite regularly. As long as I track everything and make sensible decisions, I can still lose weight no problem. I sometimes choose what I’m having before I go with the help of my app. I don’t have a sweet tooth so saying no to desserts and cakes is an easy decision for me.” Fatty foods like chips and fried meals have been swapped for fruit, veg, chicken and home-made soup. Trips out are now anxiety free. She revealed: “I am no longer thinking that people are thinking she is only using a stick or scooter because she is fat but they actually see I have a disability. “With my weight loss I am on the list for the Riding for the Disabled Association, and my fingers are crossed.” "},{"url":null,"title":"country-music-show-is-returning-to-the-borders","story":"A PEEBLES audience will be taken to Nashville and back in one night next month.Locals will be able to enjoy the hits of the likes of Patsy Cline and Johnny Cash when the Legends of American Country Showmakes itsto the Eastgate Theatre.A promoter for the event told us: ldquoNow seen by over , fans, the hugely popular hit show is set to make its welcome Peebles .ldquoAnd what a night of toe tapping country music itrsquos going to be.ldquoThe show is enjoying huge success this year with over  sold out shows at prestigious theatres all across the UK.

water treatment work in the Borders has proved its number one when it comes to number twos, as it celebrates a green efficiency milestone.Galafoot Waste Water Treatment Plant in Galashiels has become one of Scottish Waterrsquos most self-sufficient energy sites, generating more energy than it uses.Using a technique called Combined Heat and Power , the site generates electricity from sewage sludge, the semi-solid by-product of waste water treatment.On average the Galashiels site generates more than , kWh week of renewable energy - which is enough to power  homes for a year.The site does still have to import a small amount of power to the site when the CHP needs maintained, but the consumption of imported power to the site has dropped by a dramatic two thirds since the CHP was installed three years ago.Only two operators work at the Galashiels site which processes an average  m of sludge every day. The sludge is created as part of the water treatment process at the site ndash which serves a population equivalent of around ,. It also treats sludge from most other parts of the Borders, from Eyemouth in the east to Newcastleton in the west.Brian Reavely, better known as Fudge, has worked as a Site Operator at Galafoot for  years. He says one of his proudest achievements is seeing how the site has transformed the way it operates ndash and ensuring it becomes a green as it can.The -year-old, who lives in the town, said: ldquoTreating waste uses a lot of energy,you think about what we are dealing with and the dferent processes it has to go through you get an idea. Added to that this site operates round the clock every day, so it needs a lot of power.ldquoWe take our environmental responsibility very seriously here, even down to recycling items like cans and bottles and packaging in our kitchens.ldquoAnd one thing we have started doing is working with our neighbouring works to ensure that the sludge dry solids are as high as possible when they arrive at our site -ndash to save on energy use, reduce our carbon footprint and minimise vehicle movements.ldquoThings like this can make a real dference. The imported sludge is mixed with the on-site, indigenous sludge. This feeds the digestor which produces the gaswhich is the fuel for the  kW capacity CHP.ldquoWe are very green-aware here and proud of what has been achieved, so much so I have made signs reminding us of how self-sufficient the site is.ldquoI also thought it would be a good idea to let people in the town and the many people who visit here know about our achievements and it was decided a plaque highlighting how energy efficient we are would be a good way to let people know.Another addition to the site is a collection of items that have been put down toilets which enter the sewer network in the town these include a number of rubber ducks,  teeth, plastic toy figures, tennis balls, a dogrsquos chewy toy and ious sized toy cars.Fudge said: ldquoWhether these things have been put down accidentally or not they can block our drains and do real damage to the network. So we do urge folk to be careful what goes down their toilets and sinks.ldquoBut it is baby wipes which are our biggest headache these days, the number of items put into the sewer is unbelievable.ldquoThey do not break up ndash where do people think they go  They just clog up our machines and causes blockages that can lead to flooding and bursts.ldquoOne of my biggest hopes for the new year is for more people to get the message that they have to be more careful what they put down their loos and sinks, be that baby wipes or sanitary products or fats and oils and grease.More than  of Scottish Waterrsquos water and wastewater treatment works are either self-sufficient or partly sufficient in their power requirements, leading to lower operating costs and a more sustainable business.Galashiels is one of the top five that offset most of the sitersquos use as well as being able to export to the gridndash others include Glencorse Water Treatment Works, near Edinburgh and Loch Turret Water Treatment Works in Perth and Kinross.Simon Parsons, Scottish Waters director of strategic customer service planning, said: ldquoTo keep the cost of our services as low as possible it is essential we develop our approach to energy management and continue to reduce our carbon footprint.ldquoWhere appropriate, like at Galashiels, wersquore exploring opportunities to export energy to the National Grid, showing that itrsquos possible to maximise the economic advantages of Scotland water resources in the spirit of a Hydro Nation and contribute to national renewable energy targets.ldquoScottish Water is committed to continuing to reduce its energy bill and further increase renewable generation ndash and Galashiels is a wonderful example of what can be achieved.Three years ago Borders College in Galashiels became the first organisation in the UK to benefit from a waste water heat recovery system, installed in partnership between Scottish Water Horizons and Shark Energy.It extracts the natural warmth contained in waste water in the sewer and transfers the heat to the clean side of the heating system via a heat exchange mechanism. The recovered heat is then amplied via pumps to generate appropriate temperatures for use in buildings.The heat produced is being sold to Borders College producing savings in energy, costs and carbon emissions. The system now provides around  per cent of the heat needed by the Galashiels campus.Earlier this year Scottish Water achieved a major energy milestone when it was announced the amount of renewable energy the company generates and facilitates is now more than double its electricity consumption. It now generates and hosts  Gigawatt hourper annum of renewable energy - enough to power more than , homes for a year."},{"url":null,"title":"galashiels-woman-loses-six-stone-at-slimming-club","story":"A GALASHIELS woman who lost a staggering six dress sizes is encouraging people to join her in dropping the pounds.Jacqui Porteous decided  was her year to lose weight and has so far managed to sht a whopping six stone after signing up to her local Slimming Word class in Galashiels.Jacqui said: ldquoI joined Slimming World after I saw photo of myself that made me realise how overweight I was, as well as how much my health was deteriorating.

We now look forward to the merriment of Hogmanay! These days in between, traditionally known as the Daft Days, are my favourite of Yule time.Yet not so long ago the most popular focus of festivity was neither Christmas nor even Hogmanay, it was Handsel Monday.It fell upon the first Monday after New Year, although there was some dispute as to the exact Monday it should be celebrated, for some measured the date by the old calendar.This was the case for the country folk in East Lothian, or Haddingtonshire as it was then known. So Auld Handsel Monday fell for them on the first Monday after January .It was the country folkrsquos winter holiday because Christmas and Yule festivities had for so long been banned by the Kirk.The word Handsel apparently comes from an old Saxon word which means to give by hand.On Handsel Monday the family gathered together and shared gts and social time, which for much of the th century remained the main winter festival of the rural poor in East Lothian.The East Lothian writer and poet James Lumsden captured the atmosphere of this now forgotten holiday in one of his poems about the day.He tells us the children would wake up all excited, and the merriment would begin as the dawn of this winterrsquos day heralded a special time of conviviality and reunion:ldquoBy screich o morn the bairns are up,\"And loud the auld folk rousin\"What braws are donnd, what sangs are connd,\"What daffin an carousin!\"It was a time when family members made huge efforts tohome and celebrate together. Food had been specially kept for the occasion and those at home awaited the arrival of others who they had perhaps not seen since the previous Handsel Monday.Lumsden says streams of young folk left the towns for their homes in the countryside. Domestic servants, shop assistants, apprentices all set off in the early hours on Handsel Monday ason a pilgrimage, to share in the celebrations:ldquoSune ran we hame wi anxious haste\"For our grand Hansel denner,\"Pork chops and dumplins ndash lord a feast ndash\"A gorge for saunt or sinner!We can picture the scene as daughters and sons ed, greeted by parents and younger siblings, grandparents and old friends. It was a time of gt giving, with family and neighbours sharing treats.But the rich were expected to give too, as it was the tradition that masters and employers would give gts of drink, food and even a financial contribution to the communityrsquos festivities. In fact, the social norms were often overturned on this day, with the landowners serving and working for the poor on this one special day.While it had no religious content, Handsel Monday was in its own way sacred. It was a longed for day off for those who worked hard with little in the way of holidays. It was Christmas Day, Boxing Day and Hogmanay all wrapped into one.And as the day wore into evening, the merriment would build. People made the most of this precious social time together, with stories, dance and song:ldquoSyne sune wi reels, an strathspeys even,\"The wee cot housie dirled,\"As a the blasts o yearth an heaven\"Were gainst its boukie hurled\"Braw lads and lasses lap and skirled.As is always the case with such gatherings, time flew and too soon the day would draw to a close:ldquoBut daffin jigs, an sangs, an tales,\"Sped far too swith the hours on.Sad farewells would have to be made. Mothers and fathers hugged tightly their grown children as they prepared to set off back to their employment. Old and new friends from near and far, who had come to share the day, parted to their duties.They would have to wait another year for the next Handsel Monday gathering. Who knows what fortune and fate would have in store before that time:ldquoFor freends were met whom morrows gales\"Wad waft apart les course on\"Anither year, and maybe neer\"Again while times flood roars on,\"Might they eer meet, or even greet,\"This fickly warls shores on,\"Tho here this day!And yet it was to be Handsel Monday itself whose fate was sealed, as it faded in importance compared to Hogmanay and its traditions of gt giving and family time overtaken by Christmas.It has became part of our Auld Lang Syne, yet its spirit is perhaps now spread over a thankfully longer time of winter festivity.Happy New Year, when it comes.With thanks to Electric Scotland website for the copy of the poem."},{"url":null,"title":"man-caused-disturbance-at-tranent-opticians","story":"Paul Donaghue behaved in a threatening manner and repeatedly shouted and swore at MontgomeryOptometrists on the townrsquos Bridge Street.Donaghue, of Main Street, then began throwing papers around the shop and refused to leave the premises when asked to do so by staff.The -year-old also stole a toy from the Tranent Paper Shop and a quantity of foodfrom a nearby Greggs shop.All the offences took place on November .Donaghue then told police officers his name was James Davidson in an attempt to evade arrest and he was prosecuted for perverting the course of justice.He also pleaded guilty to being in possession of a screwdriver on the same day.Donaghue appeared at Edinburgh Sherf Court,where sentence was deferred for reports to next month."},{"url":null,"title":"new-council-houses-planned-for-ormiston","story":"Proposals submitted by East Lothian Council for  new homes in the village will be scrutinised by its planning department.The site, which would be made up of one, two and three-bedroom properties, is off Tynemount Road and forms part of a wider development of the area which includes  new homes by developer Walker Homes.The development would consist of four one-bedroom ground-floor cottages four one-bedroom upper-floor cottages six two-bedroom ground-floor cottages six two-bedroom upper-floor cottages  three-bedroom end-terraced houses five three-bedroom mid-terraced houses one two-bedroom bungalow and one three-bedroom bungalow.A council spokesman said the local authority was investing pound million in new council housing over the next five years.He added: ldquoThis development would provide a mix of dferent house styles, providing high-quality accommodation for families and iniduals, contributing to the outcomes set out in our local housing strategy by increasing the supply of affordable housing.ldquoWhile a small number of the new properties may be made available to a housing trust for rental opportunities, the majority of the new homes built will be offered as council housing.ldquoFollowing a number of applications for market housing on the site this detailed application is for the development of affordable housing on the site.Scott Gillies, chairman of the villagersquos community council, welcomed the potential of council houses being built.He said: ldquoWithout a doubt it is welcome."},{"url":null,"title":"unique-new-features-for-new-elphinstone-playpark","story":"Pupils at Elphinstone Primary School were given a choice of three potential options for a replacement playpark on the villagersquos Buxley Road.A vote was taken, with an option chosen to create a playpark with two features which will be unique to East Lothian.The first of those is made up of three D hexagon structures which have foot and hand-holds and are designed for climbing on.The second is a raised disc which youngsters can run on.The rest of the park is made up of familiar playpark favourites, including swings, a slide, seesaw, flying fox and climbing net.Elphinstone Community Association has been busy working with East Lothian Council on the project for nearly a year.Now they are hopeful the playpark, which it is estimated will cost about pound,, could be in place in the spring.Stuart MacKenzie, chairman of the villagersquos community association, said: ldquoI think it is fantastic.

And the world is an unfair place where those who have too much money and too many things keep it to themselves, so those who have too little money never get their fair share, even though there is sufficient for everyone to have enough.ldquoSo I want to be one of those that has too much! declared one member of the class, to laughter.ldquoAndso would you share what you have with others who do not have enough  asked the storyteller.The child paused for a moment for thought: ldquoMaybe some of it.Other children voiced dferent opinions. ldquoIrsquod keep it all, ldquoIrsquod share it, ldquoIrsquod give some to my family and friends.It created some discussion amongst the children.The teacher was going to ask the children to be quiet and listen to the storyteller, but he indicated he was happy with what was happening.ldquoBut then yoursquod end up being poor again, said one. ldquoNo, Irsquod not give it all away.ldquoBut the whole point of being rich is that you can do what you want.ldquoWell, it also means you can help other people.The storyteller listened to the debate for a minute or two, then he beat his drum to regain the childrenrsquos attention.ldquoAnd so, for most here, money will be your dream. I understand that. Nobody wants to be poor. But lots of money is not really your dream.A chorus of: ldquoYes it is!ldquoNo, replied the storyteller, ldquomoney is not your dream, it is what you spend it on, what it might make possible for you that you do not have now, that would be your dream. That is what you must think of before you set out on your quest.ldquoBecauseyou pick the apple of your dreams, but have no dreams for your le, then you will still be poor, evenyou have all the money in the world.ldquoThatrsquos just stupid, said one boy. The teacher was quick to remind him not to be rude, but the storyteller asked him: ldquoWhat is stupid ldquoWhat yoursquove just said, you canrsquot be pooryou are rich, that doesnrsquot make sense. Thatrsquos what I meant is stupid.The storyteller smiled. ldquoPerhaps you are right, but do you think sometimes people can also be poor in things that money canrsquot buy There was silence for a moment. Then a girl said: ldquoYou mean people can be poor in dreams for their le The storyteller smiled and nodded.ldquoPrecisely, said the storyteller. ldquoThe whole issue of getting rich has stopped us thinking about what our dreams actually are.ldquoI want to be a dancer, said one child. ldquoI want to drive fast cars, said another.ldquoI still want to be rich so I donrsquot have to do anything and just play computer games.ldquoI want to make the computer games, said his friend. ldquoYeah, me too, agreed his pal.ldquoI want to be the President! another said.ldquoI just want to be happy!The storyteller beat his drum again.ldquoAnd so before you set off on your quest you must think about your dreams. And let me tell you that dreams can be shared too.ldquoHowrsquod you do that  he was asked.The storyteller thought for a moment: ldquoWell, for some their dream may be to save an animal that is in danger of being extinct.ldquoOr save the planet, called out another.ldquoThatrsquos why I want to be President.ldquoSo I want you to think about your dreams, and once you have you got your dreams you are ready for your quest into the forest, said the storyteller.The children assembled their thoughts and soon everyone had a collection of dreams to take with them to the apple tree.ldquoThere is one more thing I forgot to tell you, said the storyteller. ldquoItrsquos an important piece of information. You see, when you finally get to the clearing you must be very careful, for wrapped around the base of the ancient apple tree there is a ferocious dragon.ldquoIt sleeps, but very lightly. It will wake when you approach the tree. It will hear you no matter how quiet. It will hear your heartbeat. And there is no place to hide in the clearing. The moment you approach the tree, the dragon will pounce on you.ldquoCan the dragon fly  asked one.ldquoYes.ldquoAnd breathe fire ldquoYes.There were murmurings.ldquoAnd so, the storyteller continued, ldquoyou must decide how you will overcome and defeat the dragon. It is there to stop you reaching the apple of your dreams.Some of the children came up with immediate ideas:ldquoIrsquod run as fast as I could in zig zags.ldquoIrsquod distract the dragon.ldquoIrsquod shoot the dragon with a gun.ldquoIrsquod make a giant kite and fly to the apple.ldquoIrsquod take some friends and feed them to the dragon while I get the apple, then dream my friends back again.There were many solutions and the storyteller listened to them with interest. Each child came up with a dferent strategy.The storyteller nodded, explaining the powers of the dragon that it couldnrsquot be killed by bullets or blades or fire, that it was faster than lightning and once it had heard you and seen you it would go for you.ldquoKnowing all this, are you still going to try and defeat the dragon and reach the apple of your dreams They all said yes, refining their ideas.And so once the children had come up with their final strategy, the storyteller asked them to think about what they might need to take with them to defeat the dragon. They will have to carry these things through the forest, or perhaps collect them on the way.Then the storyteller set the children the task of drawing the things they would need and then the dragon and apple tree. In drawing the apple they would have to decide what the apple of their dreams would look like.When this was all done, the children settled down to hear who had the right answer.ldquoI have looked at all the ideas, said the storyteller. ldquoWhat I must say is that le is unfair and so is this quest. For some, the journey through the forest will be longer than others. The dragon will be more dficult to defeat for some than others, as its mood changes. But you have all come up with the same answer, and so you are all right.There were howls of protest.ldquoNo, we didnrsquot we all have dferent answers!The storyteller beat his drum again to calm the children.ldquoWell yes, you all have dferent ideas on how to defeat the dragon and reach the apple, that is true. But you all have the same answer to the most important question.ldquoWhatrsquos that  the children asked.ldquoWell, said the storyteller, ldquoI had told you how fierce and dreadful the dragon could be. And then I asked youknowing all this, are you still going to try and defeat the dragon and reach the apple of your dreams.ldquoAnd you all said yes, yoursquod try to reach your dreams, even though you had a big fight on your hands.ldquoThat, I believe, is the right answer. You may have dferent ideas on how to get that apple, but yoursquore all right because each of you will have to fight the dragon in a dferent way. The most important thing is your determination to get to that apple.ldquoWhatafter all that we fail  asked one child.ldquoYou might, said the storyteller, ldquobut on your journey to your dreams you may find a new path that leads to another ancient tree without a dragon.ldquoTherersquos another magic apple tree without a dragon !ldquoPerhaps, perhaps not.

long-warned that indigenous organised criminals are breaking out of traditional strongholds - such as the taxi or security industries - to seize control of chunks of Scotlandrsquos economy.Now, for the first time, they are suggesting overseas crime groups are doing so too, posing a serious threat to legitimate traders and their customers.Kenneth Murray, head of forensic accountancy at Police Scotland, confirmed the purchase of a mainstream Scottish company by a foreign businessman with known gangland affiliations.But he declined to give any details of the buyer or the company bought.He stressed that Scottish underworld figures, who have traditionally protected their own turf from overseas gangsters, were also actively purchasing distressed, real-world businesses to expand their grip well beyond their heartlands in the poorest communities of the Central Belt.In an exclusive interview with our sister title The Herald, Mr Murray effectively sounded a wake-up call about the threat of organised crime infiltration into Scotlandrsquos legitimate economy.The investigator said: ldquoWe are lucky in Scotland. We have strong institutions and professions. We have lots of natural strengths. But they will be eroded at a pace that will scare uswe are not awake to this threat.Mr Murray said there were no longer any ldquountouchables in Scotland but warned that there was a danger of a long-term ldquodrag on the nationrsquos economygangster infiltration was not stopped.The investigator said the profits of Scotlandrsquos multi-billion drugs industry were not increasingly being laundered at home, in the new corporate equivalent of traditional cash ldquosafe houses.The old safe houses were properties where bulk cash could be stored before being laundered abroad.Mr Murray explained: ldquoCompanies are now being acquired to take the place of safe houses.ldquoThere is always a reason for cash to be in companies. The companies themselves may have an entirely legitimate business but it provides an effective shelter for these funds which are then drawn in through a network of associated companies. This can then provide a story of value or a source of income for organised crime players.ldquoYou could always tell the sort of companies associated with organised crime. Taxi, security and logistics firms, tanning salon and nail bars.ldquoWe are beginning to move away from that now. What we are seeing is that for the serious players in organised crime and looking to acquire business with a good track record, training and good reputation in marketplace.ldquoThe typical scenario is they identity a company which has all of these characteristics but for whatever reason has run in to cash flow dficulties.ldquoIn general, the central belt of Scotland has always been resilient to outside influences. Increasingly the senior players in Scottish organised are engaging with international service providers.One of those foreign iniduals has himself acquired a business in exactly the way I have described.ldquoI think that could be as a result of wishing to de-risk from being directly involved in the physical carriage of drugs.Scotland has increasingly become known overseas as the new Switzerland - with its shell companies offering the same kind of opportunities to hide illicit cash as Swiss bank accounts once did.Mr Murray, however, is not talking about shell companies, such as Scottish limited partnerships, which tend to bank overseas. He is talking about the purchase by gangsters of real-world business which employ real people and do real business in Scotland.And he believes the consequences for failing to deal with this criminalisation could be grave. Mr Murray said: ldquoThe fundamental penalty for allowing an accumulation of criminal cash in the economy is that it is a drag on the economy. It undermines competitiveness, it discourages legitimate players from entering those markets. If it becomes a growing theme in Scotland, it is bound to affect inward investment. I think it is a serious issue."},{"url":null,"title":"we-can-aim-higher-and-do-better-nicola-sturgeon-raises-expectations-of-second-vote-on-scottish-independence","story":"She saidindependence offered Scotland the chance to ldquoaim higher and do better.The First Ministerrsquos declaration came in Twitter exchanges as she dismissed aldquopretty skewed logic a suggestion to make  the year to end the pipe dream of a second vote on Scotlandrsquos future, reports our sister site The Herald.It takes pretty skewed logic to look at Brexit and the general direction of the UK just now and reach this conclusion.

Like the Ides of March, Britains fate must be sealed on Brexit day in only  weeks time.Will May finally win parliamentary support for her Withdrawal Deal  Will she be ousted in a cabinet coup  Will there be a repeat referendum  Will Britain end up revoking Article   These are the options, broadly speaking. About the only thing that seems pretty certain to me is that there will be no General Election and no ldquoNo Deal Brexit. I simply cannot see parliament or the country accepting the chaos, cost and potential suffering of crashing out of the European Union without any negotiated settlement.True, planes wouldnt fall out of the skies and trade would continue, somehow, but the disruption would create enormous stress. There is a strong possibility of food shortages, and people with medical conditions would suffer needless anxiety over medicine supplies. The fact that the Government is preparing to put the army on the streets and ports testies to the risk of civil disturbance. There would be a hard border in Northern Ireland overnight and a resumption of sectarian tensions. Small firms would go bust and big firms would leave.So, I am confident that MPs and ministers will prevent this happening,necessary by removing Theresa May and forming the equivalent of a wartime coalition. Working back from that the most probable outcomes look like: Revoking Article  or Mays Withdrawal Deal. And, it will be Labour, not Theresa May, the Tory Brexiters or the DUP, who decides which.Brexiters hate the Withdrawal Deal, which they think chains Britain to the EU, and Jeremy Corbyn does too ndash and for rather similar reasons. He thinks the state aid rules would prevent a Labour government nationalising the utility companies, and also believes that a permanent backstop would give Britain ldquono say on any future trade deals. Mays Withdrawal Deal should therefore be defeated by around - votes.Corbyn will then finally table that motion of no confidence in the government which he delayed in December. May will assuredly win that vote, because the last thing Tory MPs and the DUP want is general election, a Corbyn government and an even worse deal. May will now have won confidence votes from her own MPs and from the House of Commons. That will make her immovable ndash at least for the time being.Armed with this she willto Brussels and stage another televised spat with Jean-Claude Juncker. The  will probably have something  up their sleeves . Perhaps Michel Barnier will propose amending the Political Declaration to include a -month limit to the Irish backstop. This was dropped from the final draft of the December communique.The  could also extend the transition period making a commitment that negotiations must be concluded by March . This is already in the Political Declaration, but it could be built into a firm commitment and subject to independent arbitration. The Irish backstop would thus become a last resort and triggered only in the event of a total breakdown of time-limited trade negotiations.This will be the moment of truth for Labour, as Theresa May brings her amended deal back to the Commons in February. The hardline Brexiteers and the DUP will not be persuaded because the legally-binding Irish backstop will still be there in the Withdrawal Agreement. The future will be in Labourrsquos hands. Many pro-Europeans tell me that Corbyn will at this point ldquopivot to a referendum, voting down the Withdrawal Deal a second time, and backing a cross-party amendment for a Peoples Vote.But while he doesnt accept Mays Withdrawal Deal, still less Norway Plus, nor does Corbyn favour remaining in the European Union. Before Christmas, he caused widespread dismay among pro-Europeans by confirming that, evenhe were to win a general election, Labour would still be committed to Britainrsquos departure from the European Union.The Labour leaders instinct will surely be to secure concessions from Theresa May on the future trade negotiations. A closer alignment with the single market and a permanent customs deal, is what he wants. To get her business through, she would surely end up agreeing. Deal done. Britain leaves as planned. Pro-European Labour MPs would rebel, but that would be unlikely to scupper the governments pro-Withdrawal majority.Alternatively,Jeremy Corbyn stands firm and pivots to a referendum, there will be unprecedented turmoil in parliament, not least over what the question should be. Theresa May will stand down and there will be a political vacuum. As the clock ticks down to Brexit day, a new parliamentary party could emerge: the Europe Party, uniting all the pro-Remain MPs, and dedicated to a second referendum. The choice for voters would be Revoking Article  or No Deal. Mayrsquos deal, it seems to me, would be a dead duck by this stage.By Revoking Article  Britain would retain its opt-outs from the euro and its budget rebate and there would be no disruption of trade. It would be asBrexit never happened. Brussels would happily delay Article  for a referendum. However, this referendum would be like an offer voters canrsquot refuse, because MPs in the ldquoRemaniac Coalitionwould have to resign en massethe country opted for No Deal.It would be terrible campaign, exactly three years after the original referendum, with the far right raging about immigration. It would take years, decades for the bad will to subside. But faced with the prospect of a chaotic No DealI suspect voters would back Revoke. There is nothing undemocratic in having a final say. Parliament has failed to find a credible formula for leaving the EU. The only way end this agony and confusion is for Britain to accept that Brexit is just too costly, too dficult, too unpredictable and too all-consuming. The message would be: For Gods sake, lets just stop this madness and get our lives back."},{"url":null,"title":"Today   s feminist activists are wrong to exclude men","story":"Anne Widdicombe might have dismissed it as trivial and whingeing ndash and some #MeTooers undoubtedly deserve that label ndash but the culture of sexual harassment and abuse it calls out is far from unimportant. Equally crucial are other issues that have vexed women for decades,not centuries, among them equality of pay, professional respect and opportunity.So far, so reasonable. Yet, when I heard Mary Robinson, former President of Ireland, talking last week about Mothers of Invention, a podcast she has set up that focusses exclusively on womenrsquos efforts to address climate change, my heart did a double skip: one for delight, two for despair. Delight that women are getting involved directly in trying to help reduce our carbon footprint, without a doubt the most urgent of the worldrsquos ails, but despair at Robinsonrsquos smug assumption that ldquoitrsquos women who change behaviour, in the family and the community.Letrsquos put aside for a moment the fact that, as Robinson reveals in her recent book, Climate Justice, her own awareness of environmental calamity dawned on her like a Damascene conversion astonishingly late in the day. What sets my teeth on edge is the sanctimonious way in which women are increasingly frequently being portrayed ndash mostly by other women. Itrsquos asthere is a collective halo that needs constant polishing, lest it lose its lustre. Indeed, it seems you cannot these days be a female in a position of influence or authority without feeling the urge ndash or the pressure ndash to add a stone to the cairn of womenrsquos rights, entitlements and endeavours.Donrsquot misunderstand me. I am an old-style feminist, and decry utterly the unfair, oppressive and sometimes iniquitous treatment of women in our and other societies. Men have an awful lot to answer for, today and in the past. But I get decidedly uneasy at the perceptual ide that appears to be widening between the sexes. Climate change, said Robinson, is ldquoman-made, and she enjoys using the term, even though admitting it embraces men and women. But apart from this deliberate provocation, is she really correct in assuming that women change attitudes more widely than men Maybe it depends on what sort of country yoursquore living in. When I look around the UK, I donrsquot recognise that stark distinction. Plenty of men seem to be trying to bring about green change, ethical enlightenment, societal improvement, better childcare and education, and are working towards this alongside women. Sometimes, for heavenrsquos sake, they are even taking the lead.Meanwhile, children in two-parent families are open to influences from both parents. While women still tend to spend more time with their young, this does not necessarily equate to a more lasting influence on their behaviour or outlook. The other day my husbandrsquos granddaughter rushed to interrupt her mother who was on the phone to announce that Liverpool had just scored a fourth goal against Newcastle ndash whose influence was that We are going through a phase where almost every interview with a woman politician or banker, entrepreneur or artist, includes the obligatory question about #MeToo, in the same way that every American is asked their opinion of Trump. And while it obviously takes women at the top to help bring about change for those lower down the ladder ndash or in the community at large ndash it is surely not a sacred obligation placed upon each of them. To assume that is to be sexist and discriminatory. Itrsquos certainly not an expectation placed upon men.Yet to listen to some womenrsquos outrage, yoursquod think therersquos a contract, signed at birth, that insists women pay especial attention to female issues eventhere are things that interest them more. Florence Nightingale and Elsie Inglis personally helped save hundreds of lives, and their influence rippled down the decades to the benefit of all, women as much as men. Yet their initial impulse was not to improve things for their own kind, but to help wounded soldiers and the sick and dying. In other words, to improve the conditions of humanity as a whole, not one gender or the other.Of course splinter groups and special interest parties can make things change ndash just look at Dr Inglisrsquos formidable all-women hospitals. There is a galvanising power and collective spirit in female solidarity that nobody can deny. So letrsquos hear it for women tackling climate change. And for men too.In these unsettling and perilous times we surely need to remember that we are all just people. Our identity is not primarily male or female, trans, intersex, other, or whatever label fits. We are simply and essentially human, with all the complexities of personality, type, and biases that entails. Since wersquore in it all together, thatrsquos also how we should sort things out."},{"url":null,"title":"brexit-what-is-the-meaningful-vote-and-how-does-it-work","story":"The action is designed to maintain Parliamentary sovereignty over the Government by preventing unpopular changesbeing steamrollered through followingthe narrow EU referendum result in June .This concept has a long and complex history, starting when the Government unilaterally invoked Article  on March  , setting a two-year deadline for completion of Brexit negotiations.Remain campaignerGina Miller challenged the Government at the High Court, insisting Parliament should have voted before Article  was invoked.Ms Miller won her case, with judges ruling that authorisation by Parliament was required for the invocation of Article , a decision which was also upheld by the Supreme Court on appeal.As a result, Mrs May confirmed she would put the final Brexit deal to a vote in both Houses of Parliament before any Brexit deal came into force.However, it remained unclear whether the vote on the deal would be ldquomeaningful, by allowing MPs to reject Mrs Mayrsquos deal, orit would be merely rubber-stamping a deal ndash potentially after Brexit had happened.The baton for parliamentary sovereignty was picked up in the Commons by Tory MP and former attorney general Dominic Grieve in December , when he sought to get a ldquomeaningful vote on Mrs Mayrsquos deal put into law.After strong resistance from then-Brexit secretary David Davis and some parliamentary ping-pong, the Government conceded the point and the Withdrawal Agreement Bill containing the requirement for a meaningful vote passed into law on June  .So, when Mrs May brought her Brexit deal to Parliament in November last year, a meaningful vote on the deal was scheduled for December .However, after three days of debate in the run-up to the vote, Mrs May pulled the vote the day before it was due because she was facing defeat and appealed for more time to come back with improvements.The vote has now been rescheduled for the week beginning January  ndash but another delay or a change in direction looks increasingly likely given the unpopularity of Mrs Mayrsquos deal.If the Government is defeated, ministers have days to make a statement to the House of Commons setting out how it plans to proceed and a fresh vote on those plans must take place within seven days."},{"url":null,"title":"teaching-post-advertised-14-times-figures-show","story":"The party said it was ldquoextremely troubling to see some schools having to advertise jobs over and over again.The figures were uncovered by the Scottish Lib Dems after freedom of information requests were submitted to all of Scotlandrsquos  local authorities.The  responses show that one secondary post, for a technical education teacher in the Ellon area of Aberdeenshire, has been advertised  times ndash with four applications received throughout the process.In the same local authority area, primary teacher vacancies in Banff have been advertised seven and nine times, while an Aboyne chemistry teacher post was advertised six times.On the other side of the country, a vacant primary school teaching post in East Ayrshire was advertised nine times.Meanwhile, the figures show a teaching post in Dundee has been vacant since June , and a post to teach Gaelic in Aberdeen has been advertised seven times with one application received.The responses reveal that some advertised posts have drawn no applications.The latest data comes weeks after it emerged that nearly , teaching vacancies have been re-advertised in the last three years.Scottish Liberal Democrat education spokesman Tavish Scott said: ldquoThese new figures demonstrate the pressure in schools for teachers across all subjects.

Not vote. Let the Tories squirm. Not our problem, mate.Its not Jeremys fault that the PM came back from Brussels with a broken-backed deal that is, in Corbyns words, ldquothe worst of all worlds. If hed been allowed to do the dealing: why, hersquod surely have come back with a joyous, jobs first Brexit. The Corbynator wouldve tough-talked Brussels into agreeing a bespoke customs union, plus privileged access to the European Single Market without any obligation to accept freedom of movement or state aid rules. Job done. If only the Tories would call that election so Jeremy could make it happen!Except of course therell be no General Election, and eventhere was, Jeremy Corbyn has about as much chance of finding a better deal in Brussels as the police have in finding drones over Gatwick, or Chris Grayling a channel ferry operator that actually has ferries. Of course, no-one is allowed to say this in the presence of the Dear Leader. So Labour ministers and MPs bite their ragged lips and perpetuate the most cynical political hood since Donald Trump promised to make Mexico pay for the border wall.And given their supine behaviour thus far, it is probable that many Labour MPs would allow themselves to be whipped into abstaining on the only meaningful vote on Brexit. After all, they abstained last year on the motion to allow parliament to consider the EEA ldquoNorway option, even though thats the one alternative to Mays deal that Brussels might accept. Their latest abstention may not be on the first outing of the ldquomeaningfulvote, scheduled for next week. May is expected to lose that , and to bring her final, final, amended deal back to the Commons, probably in February, hoping that MPs will fall into line as the Article  clock runs out. Thats when Labour will decide the fate of the nation.And lets be absolutely clear: abstaining on Brexit, the most important issue facing the UK since the Second World War, would not just be an abdication of opposition ndash it would be a betrayal, a craven capitulation, for which Labour would never be forgiven. Abstention would mean handing the future of the UK to the hardline Brexiteers who have been holding May and country to ransom for the last two years, despite representing a small minority in parliament. At the very least, Corbyn would be conniving in saving Theresa Mays discredited Withdrawal Deal, thus condemning the UK to a ldquobotched Brexit, which he described in November as ldquoan act of national self-harm.The press would have a field day with headlines about ldquoLabours Meaning-less Vote over pictures of a bewildered-looking Corbyn in Parliament as Theresa May berates him for having no policy on Brexit after two-and-a-half years of attacking the Governments. ldquoWhat is Labour for , commentators would ask, questioning Corbyns reason, leadership and his fitness to govern. But that would be nothing compared to the comments in Labour itself.Abstention would risk splitting the party. The vast majority of Labour members oppose Brexit and want a referendum. This is an issue, uniquely, which unites the young left activists of Momentum with the old right Blairites of what used to be called New Labour. There would be mass resignations, with young members burning their party cards. Rebel Labour MPs, like Chuka Umunna, would likely join with SNP, Liberal Democrats and Tory remainers, creating a new political coalition. The party could be split for years, decades even ndash like Ramsay MacDonaldrsquos Labour after .So, why is Corbyn even contemplating this ruinous route  The answer is partly his own ingrained euroscepticism. He says he voted Remain in , but ever since the s he has opposed the free market economics that underpin the  Treaty of Rome that founded the EEC. Corbyn thinks the rules of the single market could make British socialism impossible. ldquoI dont want to be told by someone , hes said, ldquothat we cant use state aid to develop industry in this country. This is disputed by Labour supporters of the EU, but it is not in doubt that Brussels generally regards Government subsidies as anti-competitive.The other reason is electoral. Most of Labourrsquos General Election target seats are pro-leave constituencies. So, while the opinion polls may indicate that a majority of voters would now vote Remain, Labour could still lose the next General Electionits seen to block Brexit. Again, this electoral calculation is disputed. But clearly Corbyn is trying to keep his pro-European party on side while not alienating anti-European voters. Riding two horses is notoriously dficult owing to the tendency to fall off both of them.But perhaps the main reason Corbyn might be tempted by abstention is the old political adage, attributed to Napoleon: ldquoNever interrupt your enemy while he is making a mistake. Brexit will be a disaster for the Tories from day one, and then get steadily worse. So, why get in her way  Let Theresa May or her successor, implement her useless Withdrawal Deal, leave the EU as planned, and then allow Labour to benefit from the public backlash. Corbyn will have his general election without ever having to have a coherent policy on Brexit, which by then will anyway be a done deal.This is a superficially attractive strategy but ultimately ruinous for Labour. First of all, this is not a battle, but a war. You DO interrupt your enemyheis about to run all over you. By abstaining, and effectively allowing Mayrsquos deal to go ahead, Labour will be fatally implicated in the subsequent disaster. The public wont forgive Corbyn for failing to seize the only opportunity to prevent Brexit. Its unlikely he would survive the backlash that will afflict our entire political class .Remain supporters in Labour hope that reason will prevail and that Corbyn will not succumb to abstentionism. That he will ldquopivot to a Peoples Vote after May loses the meaningful vote next week. But I dont think this is going to happen by itself ndash he is too wedded to keeping his head down. Anyway, Corbyns instincts are clear from his candid remarks over Christmas that, even after a General Election, he would still carry Brexit through.However, the Labour leader is supposed to believe in party democracy ndash hes been arguing for it from the backbenches for most of his career. It is now time for Labours unsilent majority to take control. Either through a special conference, demonstrations or petitions, they must show Corbyn that they will not accept Labour voting for Brexit by pretending to vote for nothing at all. The meaningful vote must mean something."},{"url":null,"title":"last-waltz-for-music-tuition-in-scottish-schools","story":"THE performance of the day came from Linlithgow Academy pupil Alice Ferguson, although it was her vocal chords rather than her trumpet that sounded the last post for equality of access to school music tuition.Appearing before the Scottish Parliaments education committee to talk about the impact of rising charges for tuition, Alice said some of her friends had given up playing because they could no longer afford the higher fees introduced by West Lothian Council.\"It is the privileged that are getting to do music now which is going back to Victorian times where only the elite get to do music,\" she said.\"A lot of my friends have now dropped out of music because they cannot afford it. Why should somebody be denied the opportunity to play an instrument because they cannot afford it \"Alice, a member of the Scottish Youth Parliament for Linlithgow, is in good company. Earlier this year, Scottish violinist Nicola Benedetti hit out over rises in tuition fees across the UK, signing a joint letter with other musicians calling for all primary pupils to be taught an instrument at no cost.Mick Cooke, a former member of the indie band Belle  Sebastian, also spoke out saying he and other musicians such as KT Tunstall, Ricky Ross and Eddi Reader had all benefitted from free lessons.The impact of the rising charges in West Lothian has been signicant. Since officials introduced fees of pound, more than , pupils have dropped out. David Dodds, executive councillor for education in West Lothian, admitted reductions are more pronounced in poorer areas.Other councils that have either raised charges or introduced them for the first time have also flagged the disproportionate impact on poorer families.Worryingly, Fe Council said more than  pupils from poorer families who were entitled to free tuition under a concessionary scheme had discontinued simply because of the climate of uncertainty the introduction of higher fees had created.The issue of access to music tuition is one that will resonate with families across Scotland, regardless of their financial background.More than a third of Scotlandrsquos  councils either increased charges or introduced them for the first time in the   school year. Currently  local authorities charge for instrumental music tuition, with fees for group lessons ranging from pound to pound.In order to offset hardship for poorer families, councils have introduced concessionary schemes, but the evidence suggests these do not always have the desired impact. Families who just miss the threshold can be particularly disadvantaged.Figures published before the impact of the latest increases showed the number of pupils accessing instrumental music tuition across Scotland fell from , in   to , in  .It is not just increasing charges which are causing concern, with a fall in the number of music instructors over the past few years, particularly those working full-time. The Educational Institute of Scotlandteaching union said there are currently just  dedicated tutors serving primary and secondary schools compared to , in .The perfect storm of declining music tutors and rising charges means providing instrumental music lessons to all interested pupils is proving impossible.The Improvement Service, a support organisation for local government, found only five councils currently able to provide provision for all interested pupils, with the rest operating unpopular selection processes and waiting lists.A recent survey by parent body Connect highlighted the trend with one family responding: \"The current system of testing for aptitude in P without warning favours young people whose parents have already invested in music lessons. Anecdotally, those in my sonrsquos year who have passed the test are all already receiving private music tuition.\"Experts believe the long term impact of the squeeze will create a situation where only the wealthy will be able to develop their talents to play at the highest level. Andrew Dickie from the Scottish Association for Music Education has warned membership of the National Youth Orchestra of Scotland is already \"almost exclusively\" from private schools.Tudor Morris, director of the Edinburgh Music School, said: ldquoTalent is not handed out by postcode. The cultural history of Scotland has been permanently enriched by the creative genius of iniduals from less advantaged backgrounds.\"Morris argues another consequence of charging is that certain instruments, such as the double bass, bassoon, oboe, French horn and viola, will become \"rare or even extinct as pupils choose cheaper instruments or ones more commonly taught in school such as acoustic guitar.Kenny Christie, chairman of the Heads of Instrumental Teaching Scotland, said the situation was the worst he had ever seen. \"As the network comes into its st year it would be fair to say that never before has the concern and fear for the future of instrumental music education been so profound.\"Campaigners estimate it would cost about pound million per year to ensure all children have a right to instrumental lessons, but say the benefits make the investment worthwhile economically and educationallyThe Such benefits are well-researched. Susan Hallam from the Institute of Education at University College London identied wider improvements benefits in language and literacy skills, numeracy, intellectual development, general attainment, creativity and personal and social development.In a letter to the education committee last year, the Music Education Partnership Group said: \"The practice of music develops transferable skills such as team working, resilience, discipline, performing, problem-solving, evaluating, abstract thinking, physical and fine motor coordination.\"So why is it happening  The root of the problem is the fact instrumental music is a discretionary service provided by local authorities that is separate to the core music curriculum taught within the classroom.With council budgets increasingly coming under pressure in the era of austerity, cuts to services which are not a statutory responsibility naturally come under scrutiny.The extent of the financial dficulties in West Lothian which led to the increase in fees were explained to Holyroods Education Committee by Dodds, who said an original budget of pound, had been almost halved to pound,. \"Instrumental music tuition, like many other areas, faces huge problems due to the underfunding of local government,\" he said.Willie Wilson, from Perth and Kinross, said the council had introduced charges many years ago, but after a six-year freeze introduced a % increase last year.\"We thought long and hard before we put the charges up. We were faced with the traditional rock and a hard place. Either to diminish the service in some way or to maintain the service and increase the charges,\" he said.So what are the alternatives  One of the recommendations of the Scottish Government-backed Instrumental Music Group from  was that, in a challenging financial climate, councils should consider economies of scale such as collaborating with community groups, other local authorities and national music bodies in the provision of tuition and the purchase, repair and sharing of instruments.There have also been calls for government funding to be ringfenced - or to have grant conditions attached to it - to ensure local authorities spend it on what was intended.Others have suggested a national service removed from council control. A spokesman for the independent St Marys Music School in Edinburgh, said: \"It is simply unacceptable for children to be excluded from the study of music on grounds of cost due to a postcode lottery. It never has been sensible, reasonable or pragmatic to entrust music education to local authorities who have other funding allocations to consider.\"Other attempts to preserve tuition include Highland Councilrsquos transferral of the service from its education department to a charitable armrsquosorganisation, High Le Highland, which has resulted in an increase in participation.The Western Isles has been able to provide instrumental music tuition for all interested pupils partly because of its innovative use of technology, with e-lessons provided through a school video conferencing system.In order to kickstart an interest in music, the Scottish Government currently funds the Youth Music Initiativewhich provides pound.m of funding to local authorities so every pupil in Scotland is offered a year of free music tuition by the time they leave primary school.The   YMI annual plan states it had reached an estimated , young people in  , but there are concerns the project will create an interest in music that cannot be fully explored, due to the cost of continuing tuition.Kirk Richardson, convener of the Instrumental Music Teachersrsquo Network, run by the EIS, said the initiative gave little more than a ldquobrief taster.\"This initiative is no substitute for properly resourced local authority music services. If a child shows interest and ability, there must be an appropriately resourced instrumental music service to enable the pupil to continue developing their talent,\" he said.Whatever solutions may help save the service, there is an underlying concern about a \"disparity of esteem\" between classroom music teaching and instrumental teaching.As part of its inquiry into rising costs, education committee MSPs held focus groups with students from the Royal Conservatoire which highlighted the worrying trend. Examples included a tutor being asked to hold group string sessions in a school bathroom.A report on the focus group said: \"Students generally felt instrumental tutors are being provided with less quality time to spend with pupils. It was suggested that a lack of pupils in inidual schools resulted in tutors being asked to travel between schools in a local authority in a single day on a very tight timetable, which led to both tutors and pupils feeling rushed.\"It was reported that this change to working patterns has also led to tutors feeling less embedded in particular schools, and therefore feeling less like part of the department.\"Students called for music tuition to be viewed in partnership with classroom teaching because it was \"unrealistic\" to expect teachers alone to get students to the level required to achieve qualications.\"Without tuition the classroom teacher would need to be able to play all of the instruments played by the class they were teaching,\" the report said.Alastair Orr, a brass instrumental teacher in the Stirling area, called for the work of instrumental and vocal teachers in Scotlands schools to be recognised as fundamental, not only to music education, but more widely to the cultural and creative character of the country.\"The time has long passed for instrumental and vocal tuition to be regarded as some form of casual add-on to the daily timetable. There is a clear argument, highlighted by pupils, parents and others, for instrumental tuition to enjoy parity of esteem with every other subject being taught in schools,\" he said."},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-tory-stephen-kerr-xenophobic-colleagues-have-more-in-common-with-the-snp-than-unionism","story":"Stephen Kerr, who will be voting for the Prime Ministerrsquos deal to leave the EU, said party hardliners displayed the same sort of ldquoromanticised and ldquosometimes xenophobic attitudes as some Scottish nationalists.He also said that Scottish and English nationalists suffered from ldquoarrogance and a ldquodetachment from reality.An SNP spokesperson said: ldquoThe two futures facing the people of Scotland could not be more dferent ndash a Tory Westminster government which is determined to cut the UK off from the world ndash or the positive, outward-looking Scotland which the SNP is proud to endorse, and which Scotlandrsquos economy badly needs.\"It is for Stephen Kerr to explain why he continues to endorse the former over the latter.Theresa Mayrsquos plan to take the UK out of the European Union is facing defeat this month after a backlash by Tory MPs showed no sign of abating.Her right-wing colleagues, who failed to topple her as Prime Minister last month, loathe the draft agreement she struck with EU negotiators and are relaxed about a no-deal departure.Although her plan is expected to be defeated heavily, May has received strong, but not unanimous, support from her contingent of Scottish Tory MPs.Kerr, who was elected to serve the Stirling constituency in , voted for Brexit but has said he backs Mayrsquos draft agreement.Speaking to The Herald on Sunday, he is also firmly against a no-deal exit and believes crashing out could ldquopour petrol on the embers of nationalism in Scotland.He also had strong words for MP colleagues who he believes are motivated by nationalism:ldquoMy concern about the attitude of some of my English Conservative colleagues is that they have more in common with the SNP, and their attitudes, than sometimes I think they have with conservatism and unionism.ldquoThey have a very similar, black and white, sometimes romanticised, sometimes xenophobic attitude towards other people.He continued: ldquoScottish nationalism, like all nationalism, is not positive in my eyes.

who lives in Thurso, has been awarded the British Empire Medal in the New Years Honours List in recognition of his services to the community in Caithness. He will be  next month but still visits schools and other groups to give slideshow presentations about his war experiences. Here we reproduce an interview with Don which was published in the Groat in June  to mark the th anniversary of the D-Day landings. Don flew to Normandy twice on D-Day, first dropping paratroops and then a glider with more troops and equipment.*WHEN the grey dawn broke over Normandy on June , , Don Mason had already made the first of his two contributions to the momentous events of D-Day. The young airman was part of the six-man crew of a modied Stirling bomber that had dropped  paratroops and their equipment at Ranville under cover of darkness. Heading for home, the Stirling came under fire from anti-aircraft guns on the French coast but ed unscathed to its base at Fairford in Gloucestershire. In the early evening the same crew were back over Normandy, this time towing a glider with more troops destined for the original dropping zone ndash and by this stage, almost  hours after the start of the Allies seaborne invasion, the full enormity of Operation Overlord was clear to see. \"It looked like a scene out of a nightmare,\" Don now recalls.Don had been fascinated with aeroplanes since his childhood in Worcestershire. As a young boy he once walked four miles with his family to see a travelling circus which featured a plane of Great War vintage Don could only gaze in wonderment as the flying machine entertained the crowds, and he resolved that one day he would fly an aircraft of his own. It was an ambition that would be fulfilled with the onset of World War Two.Although just  at the time of D-Day, Don had already clocked up numerous operations as a bomber pilot. He had been severely injured in a fighter attack over Germany in  and was declared medically unfit. After being reinstated on appeal, he was retrained as a radio observer.\"We had been in No.  Group Bomber Command,\" says Don, who moved to Thurso in the s but whose Caithness connection goes back to  when he flew Blenheims out of Wick. \"The whole squadron were suddenly lted out of Bomber Command and put into  Group, airborne support, which was a completely new role because wed never worked with paratroops or the like before.\"He was now in  Squadron, flying a modied version of the Stirling four-engined heavy bomber: the Mk IV troop-carrier and glider tug. \"We had to do a lot of exercises to get used to that aeroplane and to get used to dropping troops and towing gliders, which obviously was a dferent ball game altogether... it required a lot of dferent techniques.\"And it was necessary with any airborne group to drop them accurately in as tight a bunch as possible ndash therefore youd got to operate at a low height and also not get them scattered, so timing was important.\"There developed a formation flying technique which was called starboard echelon, so youve got two lines of aircraft flying parallel to one another. We had to practise these on group exercises, and a number of things happened: tow ropes broke, gliders went down in dferent places.\"On one group exercise we were flying along in this starboard echelon formation and there were literally hundreds of us ndash it wasnt just my squadron, it was a number of dferent squadrons ndash and suddenly an aircraft in the port line veered straight across into an aircraft in the starboard line and they both went down in flames. We lost two aircraft and two crews, just like that, on an exercise. Those are the things that stick in the mind.\"That tragic accident occurred on May , , in one of the last group exercises before D-Day. It was becoming clear that a big operation was imminent, one that would have major repercussions for the course of the war.\"Obviously we knew something was happening,\" Don says, \"because we were practising with troops and gliders and whatever. But we werent aware, of course, until the th of June when we were briefed originally.\"The invasion was scheduled initially for June  but was postponed for  hours because of the weather. \"Before that we had the indications of the airfield being closed off and we werent allowed to leave ndash we were shut in, the mail was censored.\"Paratroops of the th Airborne Division had been arriving at Fairford from the middle of May, and glider pilots were gathering there too as the security arrangements became ever tighter. The troops camped out on the airfield and Don remembers: \"One thing that struck me was that most of them were not very big men but the amount of equipment they carried was phenomenal, with kitbags full of gear strapped to their legs. The other thing that struck me as quite remarkable was they were all carrying water bottles full of white rum!\"Stirling LJ  took off from Fairford at . hours on June  in what was code-named Operation Tonga, with Don as wireless operator air gunner. On board were  fully equipped paratroops and the BBC correspondent Guy Byam.Dons chief recollection of that night flight over the English Channel is the sight of vast numbers of landing craft and other vessels in the assembly area ndash which was known as \"Piccadilly Circus\" ndash as they awaited the signal to head for the beaches.\"We were briefed to drop precisely at a time and place,\" he explains. \"It was important to get the troops on the ground in a bunch, not scattered. We were only over mid-Channel so we did an orbit ndash that was a bit dicey with so many aircraft about, all flying in one direction, and us crossing the stream. It all went to build up the tension.\"Finally, at . hours, the troops were released at Ranville, where they were to set up a homing beacon to aid following aircraft and also to assist in holding bridges over the nearby river Orne after the seaborne invasion had begun. Don remembers the red light in the fuselage turning to green on reaching the dropping zone. \"They all had to go together. Naturally some hesitated on the lip of the door ndash but they had all got to go.\"In the lead-up to the drop, there had been a close encounter between the Stirling and a group of paratroops released by a nearby Dakota. \"He released his troops and they came past us and we flew right through and didnt touch one,\" says Don.\"There was no flak at all over Normandy but then we had to fly in a northerly direction towards the Pas de Calais after dropping our troops, which was a feint because the Germans expected us to attack the Pas de Calais rather than anywhere . So we flew on a northerly track and we experienced flak around Le Havre and Dieppe, and then when we exited France towards Beachy Head we got some light flak on the coast, but there wasnt a great deal of resistance.\"It was a dferent matter altogether when Don and his crew-mates embarked on their second operation of D-Day, code-named Mallard.This time their Stirling had a Horsa glider in tow, containing more troops bound for the Ranville area along with an armoured jeep, four anti-tank guns and ammunition. Take-off time was . hours and the glider was to be released at ..Don remembers the scene vividly: \"The Channel was still littered with shipping but when we approached the Normandy coast it was a chaotic mass of ships and landing craft and smoke and explosions. It looked like a scene out of a nightmare, really. And, of course, as we went over land and approached the landing zone there was a lot more activity and a lot more flak.\"You couldnt tow a glider above  knots so it was fairly slow. You were low because you didnt want the glider to be shot down before it could get down to land. So obviously a big aircraft like the Stirling, with a ft wingspan or thereabouts, and a Horsa glider behind it, was a good target. In fact, all  of our aircraft were hit by anti-aircraft fire.\"Indeed one of those planes was shot down and crash-landed into the beachhead. The airmen were uninjured and got away for a while before being picked up by a German patrol.Subsequently the German position where they were held prisoner was captured and the crew ed to base.Reflecting on the chaos and confusion of D-Day, does Don recall feeling scared by what was happening around him  \"Well, everybodys scared ndash I dont care what anyone says,\" he replies. \"If youre not scared you dont perform, but its discipline and training that takes you through. You do reach a point of no .\"This is rude, I know, but its what I call s**t or bust. You go on and do it. Its a matter of accepting whats going on and just dealing with it, and doing the job youre supposed to do.\"Its not a question of bravery. Im very suspicious when people say, Oh, youre a brave man, or Youve got a lot of courage. You react to circumstances. Its a question of training and discipline and doing your job, without really recognising the probability of being killed.\"And I think to some extent the unorm protects you ndash you feel less vulnerable when youve got a unorm on and youre acting in that capacity. Everything happens very quickly.\"So Im very suspicious about bravery. I think we react more instinctively based on our training and our own iniduality. I dont think I could have coped with being an infantryman, for instance. I dont know how those chaps did it, because it must have been hell on earth for them.\"Don can look back on hundreds of hours of operational flying in a distinguished RAF career that included missions for the Special Operations Executive. And yet, despite the passage of years, he has never forgotten the thrill of his first tantalising taste of aviation.\"I fell in love with aeroplanes when I was a kid when Alan Cobhams Flying Circus came to visit our town with an old World War One aeroplane, and it was fascinating,\" Don says. \"He had a couple of old SEs [fighter aircraft] and you could have a flip round the field for  shillings ndash but of course  shillings was half a mans wage, so we just stood there with our mouths open.\"But the smell of hot engine oil, castor oil and fumes and what-not got into you. I was determined to try to get into it in some way, and of course thats what I did.\"He grew up in Kingswinford, Worcestershire, where his father ran a transport yard. Don trained as a motor mechanic after leaving school at the age of  and went on to qualy as a motor vehicle technician in the summer of . He was called up when war broke out in September of that year, having joined the volunteer reserve two years previously.After pilot training he enjoyed rapid promotion in Bomber Command and was an acting squadron leader when, ing from a mission near Hanover in May , his aircraft was attacked from below by an unseen German fighter plane. The bomb aimer, navigator, flight engineer and wireless operator were all killed but Don survived along with his mid-upper and rear gunner. Somehow he managed tohis crippled Stirling to an emergency landing field on the east coast of England despite suffering severe spinal injuries, damage to his left eye, lacerations around his head and a hole in his knee. He still bears the scars.Don spent eight months in hospital and was discharged as medically unfit. However, he refused to accept that his flying career was over and lodged an objection with the air ministry. Eventually his appeal was successful and he was reinstated, being retrained in the new discipline of radio observer.Operations in the aftermath of D-Day included Market Garden in September  ndash \"I went to Arnhem five times during that debacle,\" says Don ndash and he continued in Stirlings until .He and his first we Lillian were married in  and they had three children: daughter Elaine, now living in Ashby-de-la-Zouch, and sons Peter and Robert, who are both ex-Navy. Peter is in Denmark while Robert has a management post at Dounreay.Don ed to the motor trade after the war and became general service manager with a large garage group. He then spent more than  years working in further education, including a spell as head of the engineering department at a college of technology in Salisbury.Lillian died in  after many years of ill-health and in  Don moved to Thurso, coming out of retirement to work for eight years with local firm Ashley Ann. In  he was married for a second time, to Lybster-born Isabel, whose three daughters became part of the family. Isabel died in .Don still keeps in touch with three of his former crew-mates from those D-Day operations: Jim Wayman, the rear gunner, who lives in Dorset Eric Winter, flight engineer, in Coventry and Sid Harrison, the mid-upper gunner, who lives in Crewe. However, there was a particularly close and enduring bond between Don and his pilot, New Zealander Frank Cox.\"Although our families were half a world apart, they sort of grew up together ndash he came over [to this country] and I went to New Zealand,\" says Don. \"In  his daughter rang me from New Zealand and said Frank was dying of bowel cancer ndash he knew he was terminally ill and he hadnt got long to live. They had asked himthere was anything he really wanted, and hed said, Id love to see my old mate again. So I went to New Zealand and I was with him when he died.\"Now you cant explain relationships like that ndash they exist because of the worth of each one of you to the other in action. Its what they call camaraderie. Im still in touch with his family.\"As his thoughtsto the events of  on the Normandy beaches, Don agrees that D-Day was a turning point ndash \"theres no doubt about that\". But he adds: \"I regret to say I dont think weve learned any lessons. I dont think we should be doing what were doing now [in Iraq].\"As I look back I think first of all how lucky I was and I feel very sad about the people who gave their lives in that struggle. Its not really appreciated, the sacrices that were made both on the home front and in action. Its a sad reflection on society, I feel.\"We ought to be very thankful that were free, because thats what it was about. We should remember that this country wouldnt be freeit had been overrun by Nazi Germany.\"It was all for a cause. People may say, Oh, thats patriotic nonsense. But it isnt.\"* This is a slightly edited version of an interview first published in the John OGroat Journal of June , .Monday  Jan  : AM"},{"url":null,"title":"More festive frustration for Wick Academy as Formartine snatch victory in stoppage time","story":"Wick Academy  Formartine United Formartine United took advantage of a late red card to Danny Mackay to hit an injury-time winner and consign Academy to a second defeat over the festive period.The Scorries struggled to create any clear chances but defended resolutely and the game appeared to be drting towards a goalless draw before Graeme Rodgerrsquos late strike.Manager Tom McKenna made two enforced changes to his side, with Ross Allan and Andrew Hardwick replaced by Gordon MacNab and Craig Gunn. Sixteen-year old Mark Macadie, brother of Richard, made his first appearance on the bench.Academy started positively and Marc Macgregor twice tested Formartine keeper Kevin Main within the opening  minutes ndash first when he scuffed a shot straight at Main after being set up by a driving run down the right from Davie Allan, and then seeing an edge-of-the-box effort comfortably held.With Wick sitting deep in clear defensive blocks of four and five, the visitors took control after that and passed up several decent opportunities to take the lead.Archie Macphee found himself with a clear look at goal a quarter of an hour in but he somehow poked wide of Sean McCarthyrsquos left-hand post, and Rodger followed that moments later by guiding a shot wide of the same spot.After coming through that tough -minute spell, it was Academy who threatened next when, after a great spin in midfield by Grant MacNab, the ball came through for Macgregor whose shot was blocked by Main.The biggest cheer of the half came when Formartine assistant manager Russell Anderson, unhappy with what he felt was a series of unfair decisions against his team, was given a strict talking to by lineswoman Molly Alexander.Academy made a tactical switch with Craig Gunn and Davie Allan swapping wings and Gordon MacNab moving upfield to partner Macgregor up top.

They also improved the character of residential areas and the quality of le for residents, he added.Councillor Andrew Sinclair, Wick and East Caithness, admitted to being a bit sceptical when he first heard about the proposal. ldquoIt sounded like change for the sake of change. Whilst I have slightly warmed to the idea, I still have some concerns, he said.Councillor Sinclair thinks the vast majority of vehicles are already driving at around mph through Wick anyway.He wonders how effectively the new speed limits will be implemented with all the current pressures and priorities of the police.The scheme is being rolled out across the region with restrictions implemented for Alness, Dingwall, Invergordon and Tain. Gateway signage, roundels, mph repeater signs and speed indication devices have been introduced in all four Ross-shire towns.Some local residents commenting on social media felt it would be hard to police the speed restriction effectively.Wick man Konrad Szewczyk said: ldquoSuch nannying should be relegated to nurseries and primary schools, not entire settlements.\"A Bridge Street shopkeeper, Kevin Milkins, thought there was \"little use having laws with no-one to enforce them\", referring to a lack of policing.While one local woman who did not wish to be named said: \"They can set whatever speed limits they want but the idiots and young racers will decide their own speed.\"A council spokesperson said thatthe scheme goes through the consultation process with no objections it could be in place by March.Monday  Jan  : AM"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118636.jpg","title":"New chief is told of local issues","story":"BUDGET cuts and decentralisation were the main topics raised by Caithness people when the new Highland Council chief executive, Donna Manson, visited Wick and Thurso.She met staff, councillors and members of the public as she listened to their concerns and issues.

The issue was highlighted in the Courier of November  and Highland Council made aware of the most recent spate of vandalism in which first-floor windows were broken.A former janitor had confronted boys throwing stones at the windows and had previously alerted police when he saw people walking about on the roof of the former technical department.Speaking about her efforts to make the building safe, Councillor Sinclair said: \"I first asked for this work to be done several months ago but officers in every department are very stretched both for time and money, so I am pleased that the work has finally been completed and thank the people involved, both council and contractor.\"However, she stressed that it was only a \"small step forward\" and that it should \"not take elected members months of asking to have this small amount of work done\".She said: \"The council as a whole needs to consider whether it has become so bureaucratic and centralised that it effectively disempowers its own members. I hope our new chief executive will take radical steps to shake things up and deliver the localism we have been promised.\"She went on to say how she is now considering a motion to the council that commits it to having a better-planned exit strategy for its estates. \"Too many town centres are falling into a state of terrible decline,\" Councillor Sinclair said. \"Often that is to do with market forces and therefore beyond our control, but when its council land contributing to that decline we have a responsibility to address it.\"A council spokesperson said: \"The property was boarded up to try and prevent further vandalism.\"Initially we boarded up all the ground-floor windows and doors on all the buildings.

More information is given on the Scottish Government#s website, here.Publishing the payment schedule, rural economy secretary Fergus Ewing said: “As we approach the commencement of the New Year, I want to provide farmers, crofters and other rural businesses with as much clarity and certainty as possible.“I am therefore confirming that we intend to keep to the proposed CAP payment timetable published in our stabilisation plan, which outlines when farmers and crofters can expect to receive their CAP entitlements.“By doing this, we are offering clarity and certainty over when payments will be made, demonstrating stability in our payment system, while enabling farmers and crofters the opportunity to plan ahead accordingly.”The president of the Scottish farmers union, NFU Scotland, Andrew McCornick said the timetable will be valued by farmers and crofters, particularly following a tough year for agriculture in Scotland.Mr McCornick: “Confirmation that balance payments for Pillar  schemes will start in March, and payments for coupled support and LFASS starting a month later, will allow many businesses to now plan their cash flows on that basis.#Many farmers are extremely reliant on these scheme payments and their timing so the payment calendar will allow farmers and crofters to carefully plan for the year ahead. Any delay in the timetable with an important scheme like LFASS, would merit Scottish Government considering another loan scheme as a contingency, as it has previously.“Successive loan schemes have been invaluable in addressing cash flow concerns but the continued need for loan schemes demonstrates that confidence in the SGRPID system to deliver prompt payments in the future is still an issue. The move from loan schemes to direct payments and other schemes meeting set payment deadlines will build trust within the sector in the post-Brexit era and aid the organisation and planning of farm businesses in uncertain times.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He sent out a tweet picturing a supposedly official warning of an NHS in crisis with medicine and prescription shortagesthere is a no-deal Brexit. The Department of Health had to correct his misleading tweet with an official and direct response saying: #This is not an official NHS leaflet. People should trust advice from official NHS sources. We are confident thateveryone does what they need to do, medical supplies will be uninterrupted and patients will get their prescriptions as normal.#In addition Health Secretary Matthew Hancock had to issue a video providing reassurance there would be no shortages. Lineker had to take down the misleading tweet.Before then, in an even more ignorant and egregious act, the SNP’s Westminster leader Ian Blackford eroded any remaining respect opponents might have had for him by retweeting a comparison of the treatment of foreign residents following Brexit with the Holocaust. Despite being condemned by relatives of Holocaust survivors for his gross misjudgment that both belittled the crime and demonstrated a lack of awareness that the SNP’s White Paper on independence advocated removing residency rights from EU nationals in Scotland, there was no apology nor a retraction.It is bad enough for elected representatives to focus almost entirely on Brexit when there is so much in society requiring reform and improvement, but it is an especially sad reflection of our current political discourse that celebrities feel the need to ape our politicians who, after all, the public ranks as being among the least trusted and honourable of professions.The truth is – and we can all see it but few are willing to admit it – this Government’s cursed and botched Brexit process has, like the domination of the independence issue in Scotland before it, sucked most of the oxygen from policy debate and dominated column inches in all forms of media communication. Educational standards are being corrupted health and social care is well down the road to a cruel financial reckoning and a sense of disharmony and injustice is growing. Yet while these are real issues that affect people and can change for the worse inidual le chances, the priority of both the Government and opposition parties is Brexit. Even for the SNP, Brexit is the means to keep independence on le support.If one were to stop and ask any person in the street what particular action the UK Government is taking to improve the lives of its people, I wager that practically all, say at least  per cent, would struggle to offer an example of a policy. Nor do the opposition parties offer any comfort. Were members of the public to be asked what Labour or the rest are specically offering – beyond just doing the opposite of the Government – I again believe there would be general incomprehension. This might explain why, in the latest polling from YouGov, with Theresa May’s Government in disarray and Conservative MPs ided beyond what anyone living can remember, Labour has still fallen back five points to only  per cent while the Conservatives are at  per cent.How do we get back to normal – or is this deepening binary ision the new normal for a long time yet  One thing is certain: the Withdrawal Agreement will simply preserve the negotiating stasis as there is no incentive to settle anything until near the end of the transition period. This will only continue the growing mood of economic uncertainty for at least two more years – and in that way risk the recession that its advocates say they wish to avoid. It will maintain the growing polarisation of people across the land where nearly every conversation with friends and family tends towards Brexit and the impotence of political parties to bring about much needed change in society’s institutions is guaranteed.Fortunately the former trade secretary Peter Lilley and Labour Future leader Brendan Chilton publish today a paper entitled  Truths About Leaving on WTO Terms that, one by one, deconstructs the myths of departing the EU without a deal. Naturally it demonstrates how we could keep our £ billion to deal with our own problems, be free to create our own laws from day one, not be held back about making trade deals with China, the US or India and need not worry about availability of medicines, international flights or chocolate for Easter eggs . Notwithstanding all these and many other truths, possibly the strongest to recommend itself is thatwe commit to leaving and living with a World Trade Organisation deal then we can deliver to ourselves something we should all cherish – the debate will be over, we can move on, we canto normal.If May’s deal passes we commit the country to at least two more years of building up ision in our society. If after then there is still no deal acceptable to either partywe will be caught in an interminable maze we can wander around but never escape from.If we leave and make good of the WTO terms of trade – and the accompanying micro-deals on aviation, higher education, scientic research, citizenship of expatriates and the like – we canto fixing our outdated democratic institutions to mending our roads, rail and infrastructure to healing our health and social care systems and ing standards of discipline and learning to our schools. Yes, we shall still have to negotiate a trade deal but we shall have left and the whole issue will move from being dominant to a dull backwater compared with our real societal problems.Businesses, knowing again what they have to deal with, can make plans for trading under WTO rules and begin to make investment decisions. We might avoid an economic recession that in the cycle is now overdue and that two more years of negotiating paralysis and indecision about our future must only make more certain than all the scaremongering we have endured about Brexit.We might even see again the day when Lineker keeps his views about politics to himself and opines instead on football and sport. As for Blackford, with the sting of Brexit drawn, he can look forward to being a crofter again in a more harmonious United Kingdom.l Brian Monteith is a director of Global Britain©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4850066.1546196471!/image/image.jpg","title":"survey finds st kilda sea caves in good condition","story":"Researchers have captured #stunning# images of marine le in the waters around St Kilda as a survey revealed its reefs and sea caves are in good condition.Scottish Natural Heritagehas just published the findings of the wide-reaching survey which was carried out in  by a team of ers.Home to nearly one million seabirds, the St Kilda archipelago is the UK’s only dual Unesco World Heritage Site for both its natural and cultural signicance.It was evacuated on August ,  after the remaining  islanders voted to leave as their way of le was no longer sustainable.The survey aimed to judge the current condition of the sea caves in the archipelago, which is situated around  miles west of the outer Hebrides and, in North Rona, north-west of Cape Wrath.The team of researchers concluded that the site was in “good condition”.The researchers also discovered a new species of soft coralwithin one of the St Kilda caves.SNH said that St Kilda hosts huge seabird populations, including the world’s second largest colony of North Atlantic gannets.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4851946.1546682355!/image/image.jpg","title":"interview rising star jade anouka on her new tv drama cleaning up","story":"After a decade, Jade Anouka is finally making her living through acting alone, with breakthrough roles on stage, TV and film, including new drama Cleaning Up.Numbers, numbers, numbers, I’m not a numbers person,” says the actor and poet Jade Anouka and laughs. “It’s funny because everyone  in my family is about numbers – my mum’s a maths teacher, and my dad was a financial adviser. They’re all numbers, my lot. I’m a complete anomaly. I’m a words person.”Shakespeare, poetry, Ted Talks, and over the phone too she’s a wizard wordsmith, but ask her about insider trading, stocks and shares and hedge funds and she’s stymied. No matter because what she CAN do is act, and it all adds up in her latest role in ITV’s Cleaning Up, in which she stars opposite Sheridan Smith as a pair of down-on-their-luck cleaners who find an ingenious,illegal, way of playing the system. The result is a darkly amusing tale of have-nots at the bottom of the social pile fighting back, using the same methods as the have-it-alls they clean up after in Canary Wharf, a tale about modern Britain with zero hours contracts and with strong female leads. Cleaning Up, written by newcomer Mark Marlow, and directed by Lewis Arnold Humans, Broadchurch, Misfits, Banana centres on the friendship between Anouka’s character Jess and Sam, played by Sheridan Smith. The actors hit it off at the audition, lending an ease and authenticity to their performances.“Sam and Jess have grown up together and Jess is the voice of reason, someone who thinks before she does, which Sam doesn’t, so they’re a good match. Jess tries to keep her out of trouble.”It’s not easy to stay out of trouble when you’re hard up and the pair are tempted to take a gamble, much like the financiers in the shiny offices the invisible army cleans overnight. “It’s about who deserves to get away with stuff,” says Anouka. “Being the underdog you feel you’ve got to look out for yourself andyou’re living hand to mouth, one mistake has massive repercussions. Seeing people get away with it, you’d feel like, ‘why shouldn’t I ’” “It puts the spotlight on the everyday people, the ones working hard to pay their bills, not living the high le, which is most of the country. It’s good to see people like that fighting back.”“I think a lot of people will just love Cleaning Up. When I watched it I was thinking about all the people I know and thinking ‘my dad will love this’ and that it really is one of those shows you will sit down and watch with your family, it’s brilliant.”Anouka is no stranger to cleaning up from when she worked in pubs and cafes to supplement her acting income, starting out. Last year was the first she’s made a living through acting alone.“When I was starting out there were times when I had three jobs. If I wasn’t auditioning or learning lines I was always working. I would wake up and go shoe shining, then in the afternoon work in a pub or cafe, then in the evening in a call centre, so it’s quite full on. There’s no chill time. That’s what you see in Cleaning Up, that these characters are always working and never get to relax.”Surprisingly, the bar work or call centre jobs are not the ones that come to mind when Anouka recalls her worst ever job.“Oh God, I was a children’s entertainer when I was at drama school,” she says, still scarred. “I did parties and face painting and that was fine, but it was before I had satnav on my phone and I’d get completely lost trying to find the houses so I’d be late. And I’d look ridiculous, in a yellow car carrying a red suitcase wearing green dungarees or a tutu and having to run into petrol stations to ask directions. Then turning up in tears because I was late and ruining their day.” The children’s “No, the parents, oh my god. The children don’t care, they don’t know you’re late. They were all fine. But the parents were so stressed, and I just wanted to burst into tears but you can’t come in dressed as a clown and cry. It was so stressful I had to stop.” Anouka has been making a name for herself on stage and screen, with the airing of last year’s psychological thriller Trauma, for ITV, with John Simm and Adrian Lester and The Donmar Warehouse’s All-Female Shakespeare Trilogy in , as well as cult hit Chewing Gum in .This last year has been busy for the  Screen International Star of Tomorrow, working on three productions, two theatre and one film. She took the lead as Queen Margaret at the Royal Exchange Theatre in Manchester, a composite of Shakespeare’s lines for Margaret of Anjou, a character he gave more words than any other, including Cleopatra and Rosalind, across four history plays. This production saw Anouka reassert Margaret as warrior queen, cutting a swathe through patriarchal power struggles in a re-telling of the Wars of the Roses, and at the same time waging a contemporary war on the historic gender imbalance in Shakespeare performance. Earlier last year she went forward in time to a dystopian world where blood quality can decide your credit rating in The Phlebotomist, and as well as Cleaning Up, she made the film, Fisherman’s Friends. Starring Tuppence Middleton and James Purefoy, it’s a feelgood tale of Cornish fisherman who land a record deal singing sea shanties, due out in March. She’s a familiar face north of the Border too, having won a Fringe First for her one-woman show Chef at the Traverse in  and the film of Donmar Warehouse’s Julius Caesar was up for best feature at the Edinburgh International Film Festival. “Incredible,” says Anouka, “considering it’s a live theatre recording. But Phyllida [Lloyd, the director], is also a film director so she knows what she’s doing. It’s quite special.”Born and raised in Greater London, Anouka is the middle of three children to a Jamaican father and Trinidadian mother. An athlete, she ran for Kent but got the acting bug at school and won a scholarship to the National Youth Theatre while at sixth form college in Lewisham.“Everyone there was going ‘yeah, I’m gonna be an actor, I’m going to drama school’ and I was ‘going to drama school  What’s going on ‘ere ’ Then after that I was like, “Oh, OK, I’m going to do this, it isn’t just a hobby, this is what I want to do.’” Guildford School of Acting followed and from there to the RSC, making her debut in  in Margaret Atwood’s Penelopiad. More theatre followed then TV with parts in Lucky Man and Doctor Who, before she landed the role in Trauma, ITV’S follow up to Doctor Foster, requiring her to learn how to rock climb. On stage, the Donmar Warehouse set her star rising too. Set in a women’s prison, the Trilogy of Julius Caesar, Henry IV and The Tempest, prompted Lloyd to hire an all-female ensemble cast of all ethnicities and ages to re-invigorate the Bard. Within a decade from first working in theatre Anouka was playing traditional male leads Hotspur, Ariel and Marc Anthony delivering the “Friends, Romans, countrymen…” speech.“It’s funny because I never liked Shakespeare when I was younger,” she says. ”But when I left drama school I got an interview with the RSC, ended up being there for two years and fell in love with it. And Shakespeare was where people started doing colour-blind casting. Everyone does Shakespeare at some point in this country and we need to look at why those plays should still be done, why they are relevant. So many seem quite modern in their themes – in a scary way I guess it’s history repeating itself.”She might be a words woman but Anouka likes a piece of the action too, and she played Hotspur as a kickboxer, preparing for the part by studying videos of Olympic boxing champion Nicola Adams, and training hard. “I grew up watching boxing with my dad, but they were big heavyweight guys, so I watched Nicola Adams, hours and hours of videos, how she trained. She even copied the Muhammad Ali shuffle. It was great fun, a great way to keep fit and I’d like to do it again. But I never sparred, not that, no-one’s coming near my face!” She laughs.Anouka writes and performs her own poetry, some of it published in her collection Eggs on Toast, and admits to sometimes finding it easier to express herself through poetry than through acting. She would love to combine theatre and poetry, her two loves, into a lyrical theatre piece, at the same time as popularising poetry by making it ‘less stuffy’. “With acting I find it often much harder to express what you want to say because you have less control over what’s going on. I started writing poetry a long time ago because I could use it to have my own voice, whereas in acting, obviously you try to take work that you think is good and represents you, but you don’t always have that luxury. So poetry is a way of being creative and having an outlet when you are not working in something that’s creatively interesting or fulfilling. And between jobs, I always have to do something that’s creative.”It was to her poetry she turned when she was invited to do a Ted Talk last year, reciting a poem she wrote that was inspired by Maya Angelou.“I’ve always thought of Ted Talks as being very intellectual, where you have to have a great invention or know about a particular topic so I wasn’t sure whether I deserved to be doing it or what I should do, but I thought what an honour! And I decided to speak from my experience, so it was ‘Being Black, being a Woman, being ‘Other’ and hopefully that strikes a chord with others, everyone who has felt Other.” And it felt natural to put poetry in there.” Anouka went on to talk about her crowdfunding a screening of Black Panther, the  black superhero film now tipped for an Oscar, for kids in her local area of Peckham because she thought it was an important film for them to see, a film that reflected the ‘other’ and underscored the belief that everyone was entitled to fulfilment and a voice no matter their creed, sexuality, culture or gender. “I couldn’t believe how much we raised. So much more than I expected that I’ve got a bit of money left over. We extended the screening so many more kids got to see it and I’ve given money to charities who work with young people, but I really want to do another film screening. That film was such a special thing, so it’s hard to know what the next film to do that for would be. But I’ll definitely do it again.” As for ersity, Anouka feels inspired by the changes she sees in the acting world, citing Sophie Okonedo, who recently won an Evening Standard Best Actress Award for her performance with Ralph Fiennes in Antony and Cleopatra. “She works in film, TV and theatre, which is a dream of mine. And she was in Undercover with Adrian Lester, who is a legend.”It was Lester who presented Anouka with the Ian Charleston Commendation Award for Shakespeare for Under s and having followed his career ever since, she was delighted to play his daughter in Trauma.“I think things are changing, definitely on stage particularly, it’s going in the right direction, but you can always do more. I think theatre is ahead of TV and film in this country, but I see it improving and more exciting stuff coming out.” “Queen Margaret was an example of that. Rather than just re-telling Shakespeare, it changed the lens we’re looking through, so it was all through Queen Margaret’s eyes.”Having played three of Shakespeare’s great male roles Anouka would love to take on more. “God there are so many. Loads of good ones!” she says and laughs. “I’d do LOADS of them! I’ve said before I’ve wanted to play Hamlet. Obviously it was written as a male role, but I see the character, not as a male character, but as a young adult, not quite knowing how to deal with grief and finding out about relationships, romance, all of these things coming in at once. It very much feels like showing somebody turning into an adult, and it’s something I would love to do before I get too old.”Anouka doesn’t talk about her age in a bid not to be tied down to age specic roles, witness her convincing teenager in Trauma. Similarly, she doesn’t talk about who she shares her south-east London flat or le with, apart from rescue dog Evie, who is possibly half Yorkie half Bichon Frise, “I’ve never seen another dog like her, so we’re waiting for a DNA test, just to see,” she laughs.As someone who has been in Doctor Who twice, Anouka has nothing but praise for Jodie Whittaker’s take on the Time Lord. “I wasn’t the right age for it when it came back – it was my little sister that watched it, but then I was in it and I thought gosh, it’s brilliant, are they all like this  And it’s not just brilliant entertainment, but important to watch, like the Rosa Parks episode. School children should all have to watch that episode, it was a great history lesson.”“And it’s important when you’re growing up to see things reflecting of your le, someone who maybe looks a bit like you, and more and more we need someone to do exactly this, be bold like Doctor Who and then the impact is going to be enormous. You realise how little it happens, because when it does, you see the impact. Cleaning Up’s like that, full of women leads, and you just don’t see that.” Next up, Anouka is in the new Idris Elba comedy, Turn Up Charlie, a series of eight half hour episodes for Netflix. She plays a DJ who is an arch rival to Elba’s character, a failing DJ working as a nanny to an out of control -year-old. “It’s nice to be doing comedy.

And they contain a stark warning that the policy will see the attainment gap widen.The Scottish Government insists the tests are a “key part” of its drive to improve schooling standards.MSPs will start an inquiry into the tests this week, with a separate independent investigation into the testing regime already under way after having been announced by Education Secretary John Swinney.The Scottish National Standardised Assessmentswere introduced last year and see youngsters tested in literacy and numeracy in P, P, P and S. But they have proved contentious with complaints that youngsters have been left distressed and teaching unions insisting they have little educational value.Joanna Murphy of the National Parent Forum of Scotland warned: “We are now in a situation with SNSAs that is entirely unacceptable: our children’s education is being used to score political points.”And in the forum’s submission to MSPs she hit out at a “repeated lack of good, direct communication” from schools, councils and the government to parents, saying: “When there is a vacuum of information it allows fear and anxiety to spread.” The Scottish Parliament has already voted for the tests in P to be axed after all opposition parties united to defeat the SNP government on the issue. Fe Council has announced it has scrapped the tests for the youngest pupils.And although the exams provide teachers with “exceptional information”, according to Ms Murphy, the information passed on to parents was branded “meaningless”.Eileen Prior, executive director of independent parents’ group Connect said the P test is being introduced at a stage where “learning through play” is the declared focus of the teaching system.“To introduce tests at this stage is to act completely counter to the purpose of this approach,” she said.The tests are a multiple choice exercise carried out online and delivered by the Australian Council for Educational Research International United Kingdom . Acer UK’s director of assessment and reporting, Juliette Mendelovits, will appear before MSPs this week. The same assessment is supposed to take place in every state school in Scotland, though teachers decide when to do them. They do not take place under exam conditions and ministers have said they should happen in “an informal and relaxed way”.Ms Sturgeon has pledged to drive down the gap in performance between schools in affluent parts of Scotland and less well-off areas and in a keynote speech in  called on Scots to judge her on this.But children’s organisation Upstart Scotland warned that the pressure of the P tests could exacerbate mental health problems, particularly in disadvantaged pupils. The body states in a submission: “It is therefore improbable that the introduction of SNSA will help close the poverty-related attainment gap – indeed, it is ore likely to widen it.”It added: “The First Minister’s call to be judged on her record in education means that SNSA is recognised by the public and media as a key factor of a high-stakes policy. As such, it puts considerable pressure on local authorities, schools and teachers.”Children in Scotland added that the assessments “appear to present a pathway to high stakes testing” and questioned their “validity and reliability”.But a submission from the Scottish Government insisted that the tests provide a “valid assessment” of children’s literacy and numeracy in line with Scotland’s Curriculum for Excellence.It adds that the “positive impact” of the assessments on learning and teaching is “clearly demonstrated” in a series of case studies published by ministers in October, and said: “The information can also help redirect learning and support teachers in looking at how certain groupings might be working.”©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4852496.1546811291!/image/image.jpg","title":"theresa may admits brexit defeat in commons could lead to second referendum on eu","story":"Theresa May has admitted that a defeat for her Brexit deal at next week#s crucial vote in the House of Commons could open the door to a second EU referendum.With only days to go until MPs decide whether to accept or reject her Brexit plan, the Prime Minister said a defeat for the government would put the UK’s exit from the EU “in danger”.In a warning to Conservative MPs planning to vote against the deal, Mrs May said they were risking “no Brexit at all” by trying to achieve an impossible “perfect” exit from the European Union.Parliament s from its winter recess today and a debate on Brexit is set to restart on Wednesday, with the crucial vote expected to take place on or around \u2028 January.Mrs May said the vote would “definitely” go ahead and that between now and then she would set out “assurances” in three key areas with the hope of gaining enough support to get her deal through.She said these involved new measures specic to Northern Ireland, a greater role for Parliament in shaping the Brexit process and further assurances from Brussels, with the last yet to be finalised.The Prime Minister also re­affirmed her opposition to a second referendum, claiming this would be “disrespecting” people who voted for Brexit.But she admitted she had no way of knowing what might happenMPs rejected her deal, adding that the country would be in uncharted territory.“I don’t think anyone can say what will happen in terms of the reaction we see in Parliament,” she told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show yesterday. “We have got people who are promoting a second referendum in order to stop Brexit, and we have got people who want to see their perfect ­Brexit. “I would say: don’t let the search for the perfect become the enemy of the good, because the danger there is that we end up with no Brexit at all.”Mrs May also refused to rule out holding a series of votes on her Brexit deal in the CommonsMPs reject it the first time around.The Prime Minister repeatedly sidestepped questions in the interview on whether she would simply keep putting the deal back to MPs with amendments in an attempt to get it through.Last week a Downing Street source suggested Mrs May could ask MPs to vote again and again on her deal to get it through Parliament. “If we have to have the vote  times, we will,” they said. Mrs May now faces a race against time to persuade enough MPs – including many in her own party – to support her plan, with the parliamentary arithmetic currently against her.Meanwhile, the shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry said a future Labour government would call a second referendum on BrexitMPs refused to support any new deal it negotiated with Brussels.Ms Thornberry said her party would be happy to “go back to the people”it won power at a snap general election but failed to get its own Brexit plans through.The MP, a key ally of Jeremy Corbyn, also said Labour would back another EU referendumMrs May was replaced as prime minister by someone who backed a no-deal Brexit.Her views were echoed by her fellow shadow cabinet minister, Barry Gardiner, who said it would “make sense” to call another voteLabour won power and secured a fresh deal with Brussels.Labour’s current policy is to push for a general electionMrs May fails to get her Brexit deal through Parliament next week.But Mr Corbyn would be under pressure to back another referendumthis proved impossible, with a YouGov poll suggesting support for another vote is high among Labour supporters.The survey of more than , people, commissioned by the People’s Vote campaign, found that  per cent of Labour voters supported the idea of another referendum.Ms Thornberry said she believed that another general ­election was the most likely way of breaking the deadlock on Brexit, adding it could happen “within months”.She said in a radio interview thatthere was a general election Mr Corbyn would run on a promise to negotiate a new deal with Brussels, which would include a new UK-EU customs union.But she added: “If Parliament says, ‘This is just nonsense, this is no better than Theresa May’s [deal],’ we will put our hands up to that. We would, \u2028I think at that point, need to \u2028go back to the people \u2028again.”Mr Gardiner insisted that a Labour government would be able to get a “dferent, better deal” to the one secured by Mrs May as it would not have the same red lines.“At that stage it makes sense to go to the country and say, ‘Here we are, this is what we have managed to negotiate...we think it’s a better way forward’,” he said.“And it seems to me, at a personal level... that is the time when we would then say to people, ‘Now make your decision on what we have managed to conclude’.”©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4852492.1546810570!/image/image.jpg","title":"theresa may defends planned overhaul of universal credit programme","story":"Theresa May has defended an overhaul of the government#s controversial Universal Creditprogramme, saying it was always the plan that the scheme would change as it was implemented.And the Prime Minister said it would still be fully rolled out by the original introduction date of , despite widespread criticism of the extension of the flagship welfare reform.She was speaking after Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd moved to scrap an imminent Commons vote on plans allowing all existing claimants of relevant benefits to be moved onto the new all-in-one payment. Instead, Ms Rudd plans to seek approval to move just another , claimants on to UC to monitor the way the system works.Influential committees in both Houses of Parliament had raised concerns about the plan to move around three million claimants on to UC and the government faced losing a House of Commons vote on the “managed migration” programme.Allies of the Work and Pensions Secretary insisted the decision to overhaul the migration was not due to fear of a Tory revolt but because it was the right way to handle the change. The change comes after Ms Rudd took over from Esther McVey at the Department for Work and Pensions in November’s reshuffle.A source said Ms Rudd had taken a “no-holds-barred” approach and wanted a “fresh mandate” from Parliament for the roll-out of UC once it had been trialled. She is expected to announce the proposed pilot scheme within days.She tweeted yesterday: “UC is a vital reform so I want to roll it out carefully. “I’m glad charities and colleagues are backing my plans to move and monitor , people from the old system.“It means UC can proceed on time and be fit for purpose: helping people work and getting support to people quickly.”In a TV interview yesterday, Mrs May said: “Throughout the introduction of Universal Credit we’ve been clear that we would roll it out as a steady process, learn as we go along, make changes, we’ve done that.“We’ll be saying more about it in the coming weeks but it will be fully rolled out by  as was originally intended.”But Labour’s shadow work and pensions secretary Margaret Greenwood said: “Hopefully the government is waking up to the devastating implications of its so-called ‘managed migration’ to Universal Credit.”She said the policy is “deeply flawed” and the government needs to halt the roll-out “as a matter of urgency”.The SNP gave a cautious welcome to news of the delay, with work and pensions spokesman Neil Gray saying: “Any pause to the botched roll-out of Universal Credit is welcome, but it shouldn’t have taken this long for the Tories to listen to the SNP and the huge number of anti-poverty charities who have condemned the system.”He added that the Tories “must now take this opportunity to overhaul the system and fix the problems that have caused so much misery in Scotland and across the UK”.But a Whitehall source said: “This is a responsible course of action from the government to ensure UC is working in the best possible way.”The move has also been welcomed by charities including Shelter, Mind and the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. ©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4852289.1546783732!/image/image.jpg","title":"priority for buses over other vehicles in scotland s cities urges traffic commissioner","story":"Bus passengers must be given greater priority over other vehicles in Scotland#s traffic-clogged cities, the country#s traffic commissioner has urged.Joan Aitken, who is stepping down next month after regulating buses and lorries for  years, said roadworks should also be better planned to minimise disruption.She said despite firms operating far more safely since she was appointed in , passengers being held up in tailbacks had become a signicant problem.The call comes a year after bus operator Lothian said Edinburgh was being strangled by a “huge circle of congestion”.Aitken, who received an OBE in the New Year’s Honours List, is the latest senior figure to raise alarm at the problem, which has been blamed for a major fall in the number of bus passengers.Edinburgh City Council is considering extending bus lanes to all-day operation seven days a week, but this has still to be put out for consultation.Aitken said: “The lack of bus priority measures means running times are much slower than ten years ago.“The quality of buses is astonishing – their engineering, comfort and facilities are first rate.“But all that is thwarted by the fact they cannot get along the road, even in Edinburgh, which boasts one of the best bus services in Britain.“Every single day, buses are not able to get through the traffic.“Local councillors want to own or run bus services, but unless they prioritise bus movement then ownership won’t matter. They need to throw their weight behind bus priority measures.”Aitken said delayed buses had a signicant knock-on effect on the economy because of the disruption to passengers, who could include shopkeepers and key health service staff.She said: “Councillors should not think about it as a bus, but as - or more people whose lives could be made better.“Councillors have it in their power to prioritise the bus and say to their officials they have to make the connection about the importance of bus travel.“People on the bus are really important to the economy and our wellbeing. If people cannot get to their work or college, it is not a marginal matter.”By contrast, Aitken said many bad practices by bus operators had been curbed or eradicated since she took on her role.They include buses running early, services cancelled for routine vehicle checks and drivers not stopping for passengers at bus stops.Aitken also said fewer wheels came off buses and fewer of them failed annual tests.Edinburgh council said extending bus lane hours was among measures being considered as part of its public transport priority action plan.The number of bus stops could also be cut to further speed up journeys.Transport vice-convener Karen Doran said: “Enhancing and developing public transport provision is a priority for us.“With a rapidly expanding population, it’s essential we continue to provide reliable, sustainable modes.”A Glasgow City Council spokesman said: “We absolutely accept the principle that bus priority measures are the best way to improve bus reliability.“Improving the reliability of bus services is also of critical importancewe are to encourage car users to make a switch to using buses as a regular mode of transport.”The spokesman said recent improvements included measures on Renfield St and Union Street – among the city centre’s busiest for buses – that had sped up journeys.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"vandalism incident takes place in sumburgh airport car park ","story":"Police are appealing for information after three cars had their windows smashed at Sumburgh Airport.Each of the vehicles, which were parked in the main car park, had their door windows smashed.The incident is believed to have happened between pm on Monday and am on Wednesday.Police are asking anyone with information to contact , or attend Lerwick Police Station..."},{"url":null,"title":"creative project manager at shetland arts ","story":"Shetland Arts are seeking a Creative Project Manager to help drive forward our vision of a creative, connected Shetland that values art, culture and creativity, and the positive impact it can have on everyone’s le.The Creative Project Manager will be responsible for delivering a strategy that supports and inspires creative practice, formal and informal learning, outreach, performance, exhibition and programming opportunities throughout Shetland.

Seismic political events, including the Home Rule crisis, the World War, the  Rising and the Conscription threat had shaken the country since the last General Election in . Women had the vote for the first time, other restrictions on the universal right to vote had been removed and the widening of democracy helped to ensure a stunning victory for Sinn Féin on a Republican . Ireland elected  members to the House of Commons in the Westminster Parliament. They were elected in single-seat constituencies on the first-past-the-post voting system, as Westminster MPs are elected to this day. Since its foundation in  Sinn Féin had advocated the withdrawal of Irish MPs from Westminster and the establishment of an Irish constituent assembly. It was only in , in successive by-election victories, that Sinn Fein won Westminster seats and put its abstentionist policy into operation. The swing to Sinn Féin was not only because of the executions and mass imprisonments after the  Rising there was also growing opposition to Irelands involvement in the war and its cost in lives, the inclusion in the British Cabinet of Tory Unionists who vehemently opposed any form of Home Rule, the threat of Partition and the ineffectiveness of the Irish Party at Westminster, led by John Redmond, increasingly seen as collaborators with British imperialism, as well as ongoing repression and press censorship. Redmond died in March  and in April the British government introduced legislation to impose Conscription in Ireland. The Irish Party MPs withdrew from Westminster in protest, thus ending forever any signicant Irish nationalist presence in that Parliament. Sinn Féin, the Irish Volunteers and the trade union movement took the lead in the anti-Conscription campaign. The Irish Party was also involved and it had three by-election successes in  but the writing was on the wall. In East Cavan in June Sinn Féins Arthur Grfith won a decisive victory on the abstentionist  which Irish Party leader John Dillon had called a policy of lunatics. It was widely predicted that Dillons party faced heavy defeat whenever the General Election came. Well before the war ended, Sinn Féins election preparations were under way. The jailing of many of its leaders in the British governments concocted German Plot did not deter the movement. In August  General Secretaries Harry Boland and Tom Kelly reported to the Ard Chomhairle that there were over , cumainn throughout the country. The same meeting endorsed a motion to contest every seat in the General Election “in order to give every Irish voter the opportunity of voting for or against the establishment of an independent Irish Republic”. By the time of the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis in October , many candidates had already been selected, a process overseen by Harry Boland, based at the movement’s Head Office in  Harcourt Street, Dublin. That same month the electoral register was revised to take account of the widened franchise. Women over  could vote for the first time and remaining property qualications for men over  were removed. This meant that the number of people in Ireland entitled to vote in the General Election grew enormously from , in  to ,, in . On  October the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress announced its intention to stand in a number of constituencies. But there was opposition both internally and externally. Sinn Féin requested that Labour candidates take a pledge to abstain totally from Westminster, in which case Sinn Féin would stand aside in selected seats. But the Labour position was to abstain conditionally, retaining the option to attend in certain circumstances. A great many trade unionists were members or supporters of Sinn Féin and opposed Labour standing unless the full pledge was taken. A special conference of the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress was held in the Mansion House on  and  November, at which the decision was taken not to stand in the General Election. Debate has continued ever since about the reasons for this decision and its consequences. There was a wide iety of views within the Irish trade union movement ranging from socialist republicans to Home Rulers to Unionists, so the reasons for non-participation were ied. Historian Dorothy Macardle put it this way: \"The majority of the working men and women of Ireland were members of Sinn Féin or the Volunteers or Cumann na mBan, and, as the disciples of James Connolly, held that the freedom of the nation and the freedom of the working classes must be pursued as one unided aim.\" . The war ended on  November and the British Parliament was dissolved on  November. Polling days was set for  December. The Sinn Féin manesto reflected the republican position adopted by the Ard Fheis a year previously and stated that the party \"gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic\". It was committed to establishing the Irish Republic by withdrawing Irish representation from Westminster, using “any and every means available” to make British rule impossible, establishing a constituent assembly and appealing to the post-war Peace Conference to recognise Ireland as an independent nation. It roundly condemned the role of the Irish Party in collaborating with the British government and attempting to “harness the Irish people to England’s war chariot”. The Manesto endorsed the  Proclamation “guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens”. The manesto was censored by the British authorities when it appeared in the newspapers but the full version was widely circulated. Press censorship was only one of the many forms of repression that the British used during the election. Hundreds of republicans were in jails  – including  of Sinn Féin.s candidates. Raids and arrests were frequent, as were bans on public meetings and among those arrested during the campaign was Sinn Féin Director of Elections Robert Brennan. His two predecessors, Seán Milroy and Dan McCarthy, were already in prison. British soldiers and loyalists had attacked  Harcourt Street on  November and subsequent nights, leading to the death from a stroke of ‘Nationality’ editor Seumas O’Kelly.  On  November the office was raided by a large force of armed Dublin politan Police who arrested Brennan and seized manestos and other election material. Acting Director of Elections James O’Mara wrote to the press: “Each arrest has naturally caused some disorganisation, but the cause of Irish independence will not be stayed or broken by such tyranny. Men have been, and will be, found who will fill the vacant places.” Nominations were due to close on  December. In North-East Ulster the Catholic bishops suggested that Sinn Féin and the Irish Party should not split the nationalist vote in seats where this would allow a Unionist to win. Sinn Féin proposed that a plebiscite be held among nationalist voters in these constituencies. Dillon rejected this in talks with Sinn Féin representative Eoin Mac Néill. The latter acceded to a call for the Catholic Cardinal Logue to propose a four-four ision of eight seats between the two parties. Others in Sinn Féin criticised Mac Néill for not adhering to his instructions. Sinn Féin candidates remained in the race in three of the four Irish Party-allocated constituencies but did not campaign and their voters were urged to support the Irish Party to keep the Unionists out. In taking this position the need to oppose the British threat of Partition was very much to the fore. When nominations closed it was realised that  outgoing Irish Party MPs were not contesting the election and in  constituencies,  of them in Munster, the Sinn Féin candidates were unopposed. Sinn Féin contested  of the  constituencies . Harassment continued right up to polling day with raids and arrests, seizure of Sinn Féin election material and removal of posters by British crown forces. After the death in Usk Prison, Wales, on  December of republican prisoner Richard Coleman, Sinn Féin campaigners wore black crepe on candidate badges. In The Four Glorious Years Frank Gallagher says a final election rally filled Dublins OConnell Street with speakers on several s, each flying a Tricolour with a black cross for Richard Coleman. He describes how on polling day Dublin dockers marched to the polling station behind an advance guard of Citizen Army veterans and hundreds of workers at the new British aerodrome at Collinstown – now Dublin Airport – went to the polls in a fleet of lorries flying Tricolours. The only two women candidates were both suffragists and  Rising veterans - Countess Markeivicz in the St Patrick’s Ward in Dublin’s South Inner City and Winred Carney in the strongly Unionist Victoria ward in Belfast. Markievicz was in Holloway Prison in England and her election address to her constituents she said:“I have many friends in the constituency who will work all the harder for me. They know that I stand for the Irish Republic, to establish which our heroes died, and that my colleagues are firm in the belief that the freeing of Ireland is in the hands of the Irish people today.”There was a two-week gap between polling day and the announcement of the final results on  December. Sinn Féin had won an overwhelming victory, taking  of the  seats in Ireland. Unionists won  and the Irish Parliamentary Party six . The majority vote for Sinn Féin was  per cent:  of the  Counties ed only Sinn Féin TDs. Of Dublins  TDs, all but one were Sinn Féin. The myth of nine-county Ulster being Unionist was exposed. Unionists polled a majority in Antrim, Armagh, Derry and Down but there were nationalist majorities in Cavan, Donegal, Fermanagh, Monaghan and Tyrone. Constance Markievicz was the only woman elected in Ireland and Britain and would go on to be one of the first women government ministers in the world in the First Dáil Éireann. Preparations for that Dáil, the democratic assembly of the Irish Republic so strongly mandated by the electorate, began soon after the General Election that transformed Ireland  years ago. GENERAL ELECTION - MANIFESTO TO THE IRISH PEOPLETHE coming General Election is fraught with vital possibilities for the future of our nation. Ireland is faced with the question whether this generation wills it that she is to march out into the full sunlight of freedom, or is to remain in the shadow of a base imperialism that has brought and ever will bring in its train naught but evil for our race.Sinn Féin gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic.Sinn Féin aims at securing the establishment of that Republic.. By withdrawing the Irish Representation from the British Parliament and by denying the right and opposing the will of the British Government or any other foreign Government to legislate for Ireland.. By making use of any and every means available to render impotent the power of England to hold Ireland in subjection by military force or otherwise.. By the establishment of a constituent assembly comprising persons chosen by Irish constituencies as the supreme national authority to speak and act in the name of the Irish people, and to develop Irelands social, political and industrial le, for the welfare of the whole people of Ireland.. Irelands claim to the application of that principle in her favour is not based on any accidental situation arising from the war. It is older than manynot all of the present belligerents. It is based on our unbroken tradition of nationhood, on a unity in a national name which has never been challenged, on our possession of a distinctive national culture and social order, on the moral courage and dignity of our people in the face of alien aggression, on the fact that in nearly every generation, and five times within the past  years our people have challenged in arms the right of England to rule this country. On these incontrovertible facts is based the claim that our people have beyond question established the right to be accorded all the power of a free nation.Sinn Féin stands less for a political party than for the Nation it represents the old tradition of nationhood handed on from dead generations it stands by the Proclamation of the Provisional Government of Easter, , reasserting the inalienable right of the Irish Nation to sovereign independence, reaffirming the determination of the Irish people to achieve it, and guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens.Believing that the time has arrived when Irelands voice for the principle of untrammelled National self-determination should be heard above every interest of party or class, Sinn Féin will oppose at the Polls every inidual candidate who does not accept this principle.The policy of our opponents stands condemned on any test, whether of principle or expediency. The right of a nation to sovereign independence rests upon immutable natural law and cannot be made the subject of a compromise. Any attempt to barter away the sacred and inviolate rights of nationhood begins in dishonour and is bound to end in disaster. The enforced exodus of millions of our people, the decay of our industrial le, the ever-increasing financial plunder of our country, the whittling down of the demand for the Repeal of the Union, voiced by the first Irish Leader to plead in the Hall of the Conqueror to that of Home Rule on the Statute Book, and finally the contemplated mutilation of our country by partition, are some of the ghastly results of a policy that leads to national ruin.Those who have endeavoured to harness the people of Ireland to Englands war-chariot, ignoring the fact that only a freely-elected Government in a free Ireland has power to decide for Ireland the question of peace and war, have forfeited the right to speak for the Irish people. The green flag turned red in the hands of the Leaders, but that shame is not to be laid at the doors of the Irish people unless they continue a policy of sending their representatives to an alien and hostile assembly, whose powerful influence has been sufficient to destroy the integrity and sap the independence of their representatives. Ireland must repudiate the men who, in a supreme crisis for the nation, attempted to sell her birthright for the vague promises of English Ministers, and who showed their incompetence by failing to have even these promises fulfilled.The present Irish members of the English Parliament constitute an obstacle to be removed from the path that leads to the Peace Conference. By declaring their will to accept the status of a province instead of boldly taking their stand upon the right of the nation they supply England with the only subterfuge at her disposal for obscuring the issue in the eyes of the world. By their persistent endeavours to induce the young manhood of Ireland to don the unorm of our seven-century old oppressor, and place their lives at the disposal of the military machine that holds our Nation in bondage, they endeavour to barter away and even to use against itself the one great asset still left to our Nation after the havoc of the centuries.Sinn Féin goes to the polls handicapped by all the arts and contrivances that a powerful and unscrupulous enemy can use against us. Conscious of the power of Sinn Féin to secure the freedom of Ireland the British Government would destroy it. Sinn Féin, however, goes to the polls confident that the people of this ancient nation will be true to the old cause and will vote for the men who stand by the principles of Tone, Emmet, Mitchel, Pearse and Connolly, the men who disdain to whine to the enemy for favours, the men who hold that Ireland must be as free as England or Holland, Switzerland or France, and whose demand is that the only status befitting this ancient realm is the status of a free nation.ISSUED BY THE STANDING COMMITTEE OF SINN FÉINtest"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27506  ","story":" Aengus Ó SnodaighThe flu epidemic that swept across Britain and Ireland in  struck at the weak and elderly in society. Hundreds died and many more spent many weeks crippled in agony in their beds during the winter months.Richard Coleman was born in Dublin in , one of eleven Coleman children, most of whom were active in the Gaelic League. Brought up in Swords, County Dublin, Richard was a religious and a patriotic young man. He trained to be a Christian Brother, but left to begin a career with the Prudential Insurance Company.When Thomas MacDonagh came to Swords in April  to recruit members for the recently formed Irish Volunteers, Richard was among the first to join. When John Redmond forced a split in the Volunteers later that year, the remaining Volunteers elected Richard as their captain.On Easter Sunday , Richard mobilised his men, the Fingal Battalion, at Saucers Town, ensured that they were ready for what lay ahead and dismissed them till the following day. On Easter Monday they, along with other Volunteers from surrounding areas, came under the direction of Thomas Ashe, whose instructions were to prevent British reinforcements from reaching Dublin. They fulfilled that task heroically that week.On the Tuesday,  Volunteers were sent into the GPO in response to a request from the Commander-in-chief, James Connolly. On reaching the GPO, the group was split up. Six men became the tunnelling unit around the GPO - `the engineering corps - while the others under Richard were instructed to reinforce the garrison under Sean Heuston in the Mendicity Institute. Connollys parting words to them did not augur well for their mission: ``I dont think you will all get there, but get as far as you can.They got as far as the Mendicity Institute unscathed. A Volunteer at one of the barricades they passed through said of them: ``In the midst of the firing, men approached up Church Street towards our barricade. When they reached it, they passed briskly towards their objective - whatever it might have been. They were dressed and, I thought looked, like countrymen... I could not but admire very much they way they went into action.At the Mendicity Institute, the garrison was under severe pressure, with the British attack coming virtually from all directions. By Thursday, things were hopeless and Sean Heuston was forced to surrender to a much larger British force.They, similar to the other captured Volunteers, were corralled at the Rotunda Hospital for identication purposes. They were then court-martialled and sentenced. Richard was sentenced to death, though this was commuted to three years penal servitude.The sentenced prisoners were transported to Dartmoor Jail in England first and then ided up. Richard was sent to Lewis Jail in Kent. When they were released after a very successful campaign in Ireland and abroad for their freedom, each Volunteer was granted £ from the National Aid Fund in America to help them rebuild their lives. They all pooled their money and began the New Ireland Friendly Society, with Richard as a director and a trustee with a superintendents wage.Like many of the other released prisoners in June , Volunteer Richard Coleman of Swords travelled to Clare to help Sinn Féin and the Irish Volunteers in their efforts to get Eamonn de Valera elected in the by-election.While there he addressed the first unormed parade of Irish Volunteers to be held since . For this, he was arrested and jailed for six months. While in Mountjoy Jail, he and the other prisoners went on hunger-strike, led by Thomas Ashe. Ashes death led to such a public outcry that the remaining prisoners were first moved to Cork Jail and then Dundalk Jail before being finally released.Richard was not to remain `at large for long and he was again arrested, along with many of the other republican leaders whod been active in rebuilding the Movement, as part of the British authorities `German Plot conspiracy.The prisoners were assembled first in Dublin Castle on  May  and were then ided up and sent to Usk and Gloucester Jails in Britain. Conditions were harsh in the jail and attempts were made to criminalise them with the order to wear prison unorms. They resisted and at the direction of the Home Office the prison governor, Mr Young, capitulated. On their first night in Usk, the internees won the right to free association, the right to receive and send letters, to smoke and to wear their own clothes.Despite their victory, the prison regime and their confinement weakened the men and with the onset of a severe winter, many succumbed to the influenza virus which had reached epidemic proportions, killing hundreds outside the prison walls. Richard was among a group of POWs struck down by the virus - they were left in their damp and cold cells for three days after the flu struck them down. On  December, a new prison doctor, Dr. Morton took up his new duties in the prison and immediately he diagnosed that Richard had now suffering from pneumonia and he had him transferred to hospital. He died a few days later on  December .Remembering the result of Thomas Ashes inquest - that the prison authorities were culpable - no formal inquest was allowed and when Richards brother arrived he was prevented from getting an adjournment of the local inquest so as to instruct a solicitor. The local inquest heard Richards brother state that Richard was a strong healthy man at the time of his arrest, while three fellow POWs attested to the insanitary conditions in the jail and that improper nursing contributed to his death. These statements got good publicity in the Irish press and added to the campaign to get the POWs released.Richard Colemans remains were released to his brother and were taken to Dublin where they lay in state for a week in St Andrews Church, Westland Row. Over , people filed past the coffin to pay their last respects. Volunteers in unorm formed a guard of honour during that time. A public funeral procession in driving rain from Westland Row to Glasnevin was followed by over , people. Three volleys were fired over the grave in Glasnevin Cemetery by six Volunteers despite a huge police presence. The size of the crowd prevented the police from moving against the Volunteers.Volunteer Richard Colemans death in an English jail, aided Sinn Féin campaign against Britains occupation and their general election campaign which was in full swing at this stage, and two weeks later Sinn Féin won a landslide victory of parliamentary seats. A month later in January  Sinn Féin MPs met as Dáil Éireann for the first time. The escape from Usk Jailby four of Richards comrades on the same day saw that republican POWs were unbroken and unbowed by their comrades death.Volunteer Richard Coleman died of pneumonia in Usk Jail on  December ,  years ago this week.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27507  ","story":" Michael McMonagle“This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account. - Chris Hazzard MPThe proposal from a senior Tory MP that the threat of food shortages in Ireland should be used to put pressure on the Dublin government and the EU in the Brexit negotiation exposes the colonial attitude of Brexiteers, a Sinn Féin MP has said. South Down MP Chris Hazzard was speaking after senior Tory MP and former minister Priti Patel urged the British government to use the threat of food shortages which could arise from a no-deal Brexit as leverage in the Brexit negotiations. The Tory MP, who previously stepped down from her ministerial role after revelations of secret meetings with the Israeli government, asked why the threat of food shortages wasnt being \"pressed home\" during the Brexit negotiations. Her remarks have sparked outrage on social media, with comparisons to Charles Trevelyan, the notorious British civil servant known for his role during The Great Hunger. Chris Hazzard said the proposal from the Tory MP were \"crass and offensive.\" “This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account.“They know the history of the Irish famine and Britain’s role in it and the very fact that they would seek to inject that into the Brexit debate is crass and offensive.“The Tories couldn’t care less about the impact of their reckless Brexit agenda on the people and economy of Ireland. We are simply collateral damage,\" he said. The South Down MP also said these and other public statements from Tory MPs highlight the importance of the backstop. \"It is our only insurance policy against a hard border in Ireland and comments such as Priti Patel’s will only serve to reinforce the determination of those of us who are saying that the backstop is the bottom line. It cannot and will not be abandoned or renegotiated,\" he said. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27508  ","story":" Síle DarraghWhen young women were imprisoned throughout the conflict, in this state, in Britain and in the six counties, they knew they were walking in the footsteps of the women of . We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.I was asked to speak at this event because I am a woman ex-PoW. To my mind there is nothing extraordinary in that, because I am only one of many.  There are hundreds of women throughout this country who have endured imprisonment because of their republicanism – and who carry that past with pride. There are women around us today who have shown bravery that would be considered well above the call of duty in any other walk of le. And, there are thousands who have quietly lived their lives and never told anybody of the things they did to further republicanism.And today we’re here to honour the memory of Constance Markievicz, one of the most famous republican women in recent Irish history a woman revered equally by historians and revisionists, and a woman who believed in, and participated in physical force republicanism.Constance Markievicz didn’t give a second thought to taking up arms and declaring war on the British Empire. Neither had she any misgivings about teaching young Fianna members to fight and bear arms. And she is rightly hailed a hero for taking that stand but the same people who revere her would, in a heartbeat, condemn me and others like me, and would pour scorn on those women on our republican role of honour, and claim that there is a dference.But I wonder could they tell me the dference between Constance Markievicz, who stated in  that:And the words of Volunteer Mairéad Farrell when she stated in :And I would love those revisionists, who laud Constance Markievicz and condemn Mairéad Farrell, to explain to me the dference between the circumstances that drove republicans in  to strike a blow against the British empire, and of republicans in  and  who took up arms to defend small communities like mine – trapped on the fringes of loyalist east Belfast, subjected to sectarian pogroms, ignored by a British government and forced into a state that neither wanted or accepted us.Marie Moore, a native of Clonard, a veteran of republican struggle and Belfast’s first Sinn Féin Deputy Mayor speaking of her le of republicanism rememberedWhere were the revisionists when thousands were being burned out of their homes when frightened mothers were dragging terried children onto buses and trains and being forced as refugees across the border, hoping for help and safety in another state that had abandoned us, and that also neither wanted nor accepted us When those who revere Constance Markievicz’s philanthropy and work among the poor of Dublin are celebrating her le, do you wonderthey ever give a thought to what she would have done had she been there when the hundreds of refugees from ‘the black north’ poured off buses with their meagre belongings in battered suitcases Do they think she would have stood idly by and did nothing I know none of us can speak for the dead none of us know what the other would have done, but we know enough about her to come to our own conclusions and I would like to think that she would have been as much a leader now as she was then.Her commitment and her legacy was an example to young women like me when I was growing up in a war-torn Belfast. She inspired us. She gave us aspirations to live up. She set an example. And part of that example was to never back down.We knew her history. We knew she took up arms. We knew she was a commander in the IRA. And we aspired to be just like her.She was also a POW, and when young women were imprisoned throughout the conflict, in this State, in Britain and in the six counties, they knew they were walking in the footsteps of the women of . We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.And no political opponent or revisionist will tell me, and all those thousands like me, that I should be ashamed of that.But the irony is, that the people who are so quick to condemn today’s republicans for taking the decisions we did, have never once considered what drove so many Irish men and women, young and old, to walk the hard roads we walked during these last  troubled years. We didn’t do for fame or fortune. We did it because it was the right thing to do.There are always reasons and circumstances behind people’s decisions and, we need as much today to consider those journeys, as we do the journeys of the men and women of . Circumstances and history shaped all of us. That’s undeniable.Throughout the decades republican women have been to the forefront of struggles in Ireland in the Suffragette movement, the Labour movements, the Gaelic League, and many other organisations – much as republican women today are deeply involved in every aspect of daily le and organisations working to better peoples’ lives.In every phase of the struggle, women have taken risks. From their involvement in the ’s border campaign, to those who broke the Falls Curfew and carried guns and ammunition out under their coats, in prams and in shopping bags. And, we know many too who lost their loved ones, and their own lives, to plastic, rubber and live bullets on active service for the IRA, and to loyalist and British State murder squads.We all know women who walked the streets wrapped in blankets, in bare feet, in rain and snow, to highlight the plight of the prisoners in the H-Blocks and Armagh who smuggled comms, love letters, and much more into and out of the prisons who marched in their hundreds to the steps of Stormont when Sinn Féin were locked out of talks, demanding their rights and representation.There are women who travelled every week, for years, to visit loved ones imprisoned in this state, in the six counties and in Britain, most times with young children in tow. The hardship of prisoners’ families is often forgotten, and imprisonment impacted on thousands upon thousands of people throughout this island, not just the prisoners themselves.Brave republican women stood as Sinn Féin candidates in the early ‘’s and ’s, when in councils throughout the six counties they were vilied and subjected to the vilest of sectarian abuse and threats of death.And I’m proud to say that the temerity of those who led the way has paid off in idends. Republican women were elected in their hundreds – councillors, MLAs, TDs, MEPs, Senators and including – dare I say it – three very proud and very capable women MPs are walking in the footsteps of the first female MP elected to sit in the British House of Commons the first abstentionist Sinn Féin MP, Countess Constance Markievicz.And still, there are people telling us today that our Sinn Féin MPs, elected by thousands of Irish citizens full in the knowledge that, like Markievicz they would not be taking seats or swearing an oath to a foreign government, should take seats in a British parliament, or better still, resign those seats and gt them to others who are more than willing to doff their caps and swear an oath to defend an English monarch. Do these people even listen to themselves These same people, who are lecturing us, will no doubt be lauding Constance Markievicz for her part in the birth of the nation, with all her history of abstentionism and of physical force republicanism.Do they genuinely not understand irony And do they think that our supporters, those who flock to the ballot boxes in their thousands toSinn Féin elected representatives, don’t aspire to the goal of Markievicz, of a democratic republic that cherishes all of the children of the nation equally Where is the equality for nationalists in the six counties  Where is the respect for the democratic mandate of thousands upon thousands of people who have yet to have their rights and entitlements respected in the British constructed and maintained sectarian six-county state  Where is the support for our democratic mandate  Where is the aspiration to cherish all of the children of the nation equally  Or do they not consider us part of that nation  They need to bear in mind that when the Proclamation was being written there was no border in Ireland – hard or soft.They also need to bear in mind that there is no single narrative to this conflict. Yes, people have been hurt, on both sides, and those who are trying to revise the history of the IRA of , are also trying to revise the history of the IRA of this phase of the struggle to present one side and one side only. As a republican woman I am proud of the rich history of Irish women that we can lay claim to, and many here today were part of that history. And I am proud and in awe of those women who lost their lives as part of that struggle.Unfortunately, throughout the decades of our troubled past people who know nothing about what we went through are writing and rewriting our history.We cannot allow the memories of our dead, the stories of nationalist and republican victims, and the history of repression and oppression that led to young people again taking up arms, in the same way Constance Markievicz and Tom Clarke and Pádraig Pearse and all those others in  took up arms, being airbrushed out of our history. And maybe one day we’ll be in a place where the circumstances that led to those decisions are acknowledged and accepted.Because, rest assured, not one of us woke up one morning and decided on a whim to take up arms, to put our lives on the line, to face imprisonment and death. There are always reasons why people make the decisions they do but some people just refuse to see or accept that.We know those reasons and we need no lectures from people who have not walked in our shoes. is something we should all aspire to.We have a duty to future generations to ensure that our revolution isn’t rewritten. We need to make sure that our young people know why and where our history of struggle comes from to remind, educate and to see that it never happens again to ensure that young women continue to be inspired by Constance Markievicz, by her bravery, her philanthropy and her work for those less well off. But we also need to ensure that the circumstances that led to her and future republican women seeing the need to take up arms, never happens again.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27509  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinI remain optimistic because Ireland is changing.

It was given voice in the Repeal referendum. In Belfast the largest political demonstration was Pride. For this generation the border is an anachronism. When the Repeal result was read out a sign was held aloft, ‘The North is next’. Rights transcend borders and so does this generation. will mark the centenary of the First Dáil. A people’s parliament for a revolutionary generation. The coming year is an opportunity to rebuild that culture of change and a parliament that serves the people and not vested interests. Sinn Féin will stand with the people on the streets and stand up for them in the Dáil because the housing and health crises can and must be ended.The policies of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael created and sustained the health and housing crises. As waiting lists grow and the number of patients on trollies hit record highs, the Taoiseach points the finger of blame at doctors and nurses who take Christmas leave. His response to rising evictions and homelessness is to defend the Vulture Funds and give tax breaks to landlords.The Taoiseach and Fine Gael are supported in all of this by Mícheál Martin and the supply and confidence trick.Regardless of what choice the British government makes on Brexit, it cannot be allowed to damage Irish interests, our economy, our agreements or the rights of citizens. This is one issue that unites the majority of parties North and South. We will continue to stand up in the interest of all Ireland. Early in January I will travel to Brussels to continue our engagements with European leaders.An Executive in the North should be in place delivering for all in the community, growing the economy, standing up to destructive Tory policies, and representing the majority view on Brexit. Instead we have witnessed daily at an inquiry the corruption of governance that led to the RHI scandal.No government could sustain the abuse of power and intolerance displayed by the DUP. All the while the Irish and British governments looked on and refused to act. It is a disgrace that the institutions of the north are not up and running.We had a deal with the DUP leadership that would have reinstated the Institutions. The DUP walked away. The two governments promised a new talks process. Ten months on there has been no talks and no process. There has been nothing constructive from the two governments. That is not good enough.Every day that the Executive is suspended undermines the political institutions. Every refusal to recognise rights undermines the political process. The threat to impose Brexit undermines the democratic process.The DUP know that their deal with the Tories will end. They also know that the refusal of rights is not compatible with equality and power-sharing government. They should also know that there is no good or positive Brexit for the north.Sinn Féin is ready for talks, to establish a new Executive working in genuine power-sharing, and operating to the highest standards of governance. A new Executive must include new ways of working, be inclusive of all parties and respect the rights of all the people.The DUP knows what needs to be done. Theresa May knows what needs to be done. It will require leadership that has been absent to date.The two governments have indulged the DUP at the cost of the political process. The two governments know what must be done to form a new Executive in the north. The current do-nothing approach is running out of road.The majority of parties share a common approach to Brexit and to the rights of citizens, and are committed to working together to build a new Executive.The two governments must convene talks and make clear the agreements and rights of citizens will be at the core of a new Executive.The Irish Government cannot look on as spectators. They cannot stand idly by while the DUP and British government shred the agreements. The agreements are the people’s agreements. The people voted for them. The Taoiseach said that the people of the north will not be left behind again. The government must plan for a successful talks process and also have a backup plan.They must also begin preparations for Irish Unity. There is no contradiction in seeking the establishment of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement and fulfilling its promise of a unity referendum. The time is right to hold an informed and respectful conversation and referendum on our shared long term future as a united people and a united Ireland. No government should try and stle that debate or call for it to be suspended.I remain optimistic because Ireland is changing. I believe that we have the policies and plans to tackle the housing and health care crises. The debate on Irish unity is under way, and we will have elections and the opportunity for people to have their say. The choice is simple, continue with the failing policies of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil or plot a new course for a new and united Ireland.I look forward to the new year and the continued challenges and opportunities of a changing Ireland.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27510  ","story":"Civil Rights marchers attacked at Burntollet Bridge.

I had received other such callsfrom Jer over the years but I was never available to join him, untilthis year, so I called my friend and comrade Larry OToole and we metJer in Gaffneys in Fairview in the aptly named snug The OfficersMess. It was an unforgettable afternoon with Jer. He had been very ill in hospitalnot long before and while he was in great form, both Larry and I feltthat this was almost like a goodbye. Little did we think that lessthan a month later Jer would be gone from us. He died on StStephen’s Day. November. And as always his conversation ranged widely - from thefamous ambush in West Cork to Dalymount stadium and his beloved Bohs,from the streets of the North Inner City with the Dublin Brigade inthe s - and indeed the s - to the Dubs winning four in a rowin , from the docks of our city to the plains of the AmericanWest, from a Dublin stage to a Hollywood set. Jer did entrances and exits well,befitting a man of the stage, and even the shortest of time in hiscompany was entertaining. He knew the power of words and versestripped easily from his tongue. His accent was deep and Dublin, aswas everything about him, the historic Dublin of the working class,locked out in , rising up in , resilient and proud of itsheritage of struggle. In his day Jer was an IrishRepublican Army Volunteer and a political prisoner. He was asocialist republican through and through in the tradition of JamesConnolly and in the style of his idol Jim Larkin. He embodied Larkinon many occasions and at many events. He was always available to do aturn for The Cause - be it trade union, republican or internationalsolidarity.  We asked him to read theProclamation at the Dublin Sinn Féin Easter commemoration inGlasnevin in  and he proudly obliged. Previously at many of ourEaster commemorations over the years he had read James ConnollysFinal Statement to his Court Martial to great and stirring effectoutside the GPO. In  he performed Larkin with us at thestatue in O’Connell Street to begin the Centenary of the Lockout,and again at the Liberty Hall conference organised by Sinn Féinearly that year. A more poignant memory is of Jeras Wolfe Tone at the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis in , bicentenary of theUnited Irish Rising. He was accompanied by a group of pike men andwomen, among them his son Diarmuid who died so tragically later thatyear in a fire in Glasgow, after a Celtic game which father and sonhad attended. Leaving the stadium that day, Jer saw his son for thelast time. The loss of Diarmuid was a terrible tragedy for Jer andhis partner Eithne, who died in December , a further loss fromwhich Jer never recovered. Among Jers talents was as adesigner of banners, which he produced with Eithne, and many of whichcan still be seen at trade union rallies. He championed the use ofthe original green, silver and gold Starry Plough as designed for theIrish Citizen Army and flown in Dublin at Easter , and, thanks inlarge part to Jer, it is now widely seen and recognised. It wasplaced on permanent display in the Oak Room of the Mansion House forthe first time, when as Ardmhéara I accepted it as a presentationfrom the Dublin Council of Trade Unions. And it was in the Oak Room,under the Starry Plough, that we gathered on  January to pay tributeto Jer with a night of eulogies, music and song. In October  Jer joined us forSpraoi ar an Sráid, the Moore Street Party that I organised asArdmhéara, in support of the campaign to save the  battlefieldsite. As always, he was proud and glad to answer the call. Once againthat day he passionately declaimed the words of the Frenchrevolutionary Camile Desmoulins, as quoted by Connolly and Larkin: \"The great are not great. Thegreat only appear great because we are on our knees. Let us arise!\" Many hundreds of people attendedJer’s funeral on  January. His coffin was draped in the StarryPlough and passed his North Strand home on the way to the church in aprocession which included some of his finest banners. The attendancewas a cross-section of the republican left, in all its ersity, aswell as people from the theatre, the trade union movement and hismany friends and neighbours. Sinn Féin President Mary Lou McDonaldattended, as did Gerry Adams.

Schoolchildren, cyclists, runners, older people and people with acute medical conditions immediately spring to mind, but in fact I think everyone should carry an ICE Card. People don’t think twice about wearing a seatbelt or cycling helmet, butyou had a serious accident you’d like your next of kin to know as soon as possible and you’d want the best care possible in a medical emergency. Almost everyone carries a wallet or purse with them so this is the ideal place to keep an ICE Card”.Chief Inspector Barney O’Connor commented: “PSNI is fully supportive of this initiative which is straightforward, practical and user-friendly and provides families reassurance that a loved one has personal information accessible in all emergency situations.

Or, more accurately, David Stitt BSc Hons is on Twitter. Arlene Foster’s erstwhile photo companion has been busying himself of late on the Kilcooley bonfire in Bangor, which he’s determined to ensure is the biggest and the best in Are Wee Country.First up, Squinter’s not sure what Science Dee is a Bachelor of Honours in – the UDA man doesn’t say. But from the tweets about the appliance of structural engineering science to the massive edice, it might appear that it is in that field of endeavour that he excelled at university. We might be tempted to speculate on what university handed the qualication over to him, given the quality of the spelling on his Twitter account, but let’s stick to the matter in hand.On Thursday, as the bonfire crept out of the North Down troposphere and into the stratosphere, Dee gave vent to the vaunting pride that’s filling his barrel chest as the race for the title of Biggest Boney came down to the final furlong: “Kilcooley Bonfire, Well on its way to be Ulster Biggest . A Military Operation, being constructed by Structural Engineers for safety.” Across the Pravince, men of substance nodded slowly and gravely and gave thanks that the health and safety of the children of the large estate is in such professional hands. Next day the Kilcooley boney fell down.AUGUSTAN open letter from Emma Little Pengelly, DUP South Belfast MP, on the Glidergate scandal#Thank you for giving me space in your paper to lay out my position on the Woodstock Road Glider stop, erroneously referred to by some as the ‘Short Strand’ Glider stop, among them the people who designed and built the Glider system and the people closest to it.It has been alleged that I have never before shown an interest in bus stops.. Nothing could be further from the truth. At university I was a founder member of the ‘Campaign to Save Ulster Bus Stops’ and I wrote a very well-received pamphlet which I distributed to membersentitled ‘Classic Bus Stops of Markethill and Richhill – Ulster’s Hidden History’. Furthermore, I have on occasion been on a bus, although admittedly not for a while. That the Glider stop I referred to is near the Short Strand is not in question, but since when did geographical proximity have anything to do with naming things  The Donegal Celtic football club on the Suffolk Road is not in Donegal. The Dublin Road is not in Dublin. Even the Woodstock Road is not in Woodstock, which most people are unaware of . So calling the stop Short Strand because it is near the Short Strand makes zero sense and is in fact potentially confusing. What is this place coming to when routes can’t be changed or amended just because they are traditional  SEPTEMBERSCOTLAND’S Shame, it’s called – the ,lb gorilla in the Holyrood Parliament that nobody wants to speak about. Many and frequent are the manestations of anti-Catholic sentiment at the very core of Scottish society, but the antics this week of a senior Labour Party official at the party conference in Liverpool has seen the issue reach a wider audience and that may make it rather more dficult for it to remain a dirty secret. Speaking from the , Scotsman Andy Kerr, Chairman of the Labour Party’s ruling National Executive Committee, invited a woman to speak and then added: “Did you cross yourself there  In that case I might not.” Not surprisingly, the ‘joke’ went down like a fart in a space suit as Andy obviously forgot that he wasn’t speaking before a select audience in Glasgow. The apology wasn’t long coming “unreservedly” with Andy adding: “I was trying to be lighthearted but what I said was ill-judged and wrong.” Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said: “People from all parties and none will be appalled by this and by the casual dismissal of concerns.” Much as Squinter cheered Ruth’s decisive intervention, he must reluctantly point out that her party has blotted its copybook in the recent past when it comes to the matter of Catholics in Scotland. Last year a Conservative member of Stirling Council was readmitted to the party after being suspended for posting anti-Catholic comments online. Alastair Majury tweeted: “Why is the Catholic Church against birth control  Because they#ll run out of children to molest.”Of course, had Andy Kerr made a religiously loaded remark like the one he did about Catholics about, say, Muslims, or Jews, he wouldn’t have seen the end of the day. But in situ he remains, at the very heart of a party currently struggling with allegations of anti-Semitism which so far have not been solid enough to see any heads roll. The Zionist lobby which is after Jeremy Corbyn’s head would surely have claimed their first victory had this remark been aimed in the direction of Judaism. Perhaps you’ll remember that in July the Orange Order called off a parade in Glasgow. They called it off rather than obey a direction not to walk past a Catholic church where at a previous Orange Order march a priest had been spat at and struck with a baton by parade followers. Now the socialists have joined the KKK. Jings, crivvens, help m’boab!OCTOBERWHAT IS THE BACKSTOP The factsAn insurance policydesigned to avoid a hard border in the event that a customs agreement cannot be agreed by the end of the transition period . If no agreement is reached, the EU wants to see the north remaining in the Single Market and Customs Union until London comes up with a solution. Under pressure from hardliners, British Prime Minister Theresa May wants the backstop done away with or, at the very least, subject to a time limit.The loyal Ulster factsKeeping the Pravince in the Single Market and Customs Union while the rest of the UK leaves is an existential threat to the future of Are Wee Country and the DUP is battling to “save the union”. The party is clear that there can be no ergence within the UK, except on things that it wants to erge on, gyeh morrage and abortion, for instance. A DUP source has promised to up the pressure on the Tory government: “We are going to squeeze their balls until their ears bleed.”Promises, promises# NOVEMBERWhich brings us to James McClean. Again. Since last year’s Remembrance Day festival the Derry native and Republic of Ireland international has switched clubs from West Brom to Stoke. In order to keep their fans informed ahead of the annual wearing of the poppy football shirts across the English leagues, the club issued a brief statement outlining the player’s historical stance and confirming that he wouldn’t be sporting a poppy on his shirt this year either.Despite the fact that nothing had changed – other than the name of the club at the top of the press release – the statement sent the Pravince’s media to DefCon , just as it has since the day and hour James spoke his first words on the topic, occasioning the familiar angry social media blast from Ulster’s stout yeomanry. There’s a delicious and very fitting circularity in this local saga:just as nothing has changed in relation to James McClean and the poppy, nothing has changed in Ulster’s attitude to it.DECEMBERA BURNING question finally gets its answer. No, it’s not about Brexit, or world hunger, or famine or plague. It’s simply this: what do you call this item pictured below left  You may never have given the matter any thought, but Squinter has, because, well# because that’s the kind of guy he is. Fact of the matter is that you’re very unlikely ever to ask for one because  out of every thousand of these things sold are simply lted by the customer and brought to the counter or check-out without a word. If you have a shopping list it will simply say ‘milk’ and everyone knows exactly how large or how small their milk requirements are.But every time Squinter buys one he asks himself why he doesn’t have a clue what it’s called and, further,a tourist asked him what it was he wouldn’t be able to answer. So, enough being enough, Squinter put the question to Twitter – and back came around  replies, some of them fairly sensible, some#. Quart.. Barrackbuster.. Big milk.. Flagon Jar.. Green milk..

That gap in our knowledge has now been put right with the the timely publication of the powerful ‘War Against All Puerto Ricans: Revolution and Terror in America’s Colony’ by accomplished journalist Nelson A. Denis. His book sweeps through the many humiliations heaped on Puerto Ricans after the US invasion of , such as a ban on Spanish in schools and a prohibition against the flying of the nation’s flag. Where the American government led, business followed. Suffocating poverty on the island and slave-like conditions on the sugar plantations worsened. The first civilian governor Charles Allen ed to the US and leveraged his contacts and influence to become the King of Sugar. “By ,” writes Denis, “Allen and US banking interests had converted  per cent of all arable land in Puerto Rico into sugar plantations. These bank syndicates also owned the insular postal system, the entire coastal railroad, and the international seaport of San Juan.”Patriots responded with their own Nationalist Party but its ranks were riddled with FBI informers and when that didn’t stymie its growth, supporters were massacred in the town of Ponce. On Sunday March  , a parade of unarmed nationalist cadets was effectively ambushed by police in scenes similar to our own Bloody Sunday. “The police kept shooting and clubbing for thirteen minutes,” says Denis. “By the time they finished,  men, one woman and a seven-year-old girl lay dead over  more were gravely wounded — moaning, crawling, bleeding, and begging for mercy in the street.# marked the high-point of this revolutionary rising when, following  years of military occupation, the Nationalist Party of Puerto Rico staged an unsuccessful armed insurrection.They paid a heavy price for tweaking the tale of the tiger. Ill-trained and poorly-equipped cadres of nationalists – branded communists by the powers-that-be – were cut down by US National Guard troops. In the town of Jayuya where revolutionaries had seized control, the residents were subjected to a merciless bombardment by ten Thunderbolt fighter planes armed with -lb bombs. It was the only time in history that the United States bombed its own citizens.Within a fortnight, the rebellion had been quashed but not before a failed assassination attempt on President Truman had ensured the tiny island nation’s freedom struggle made headlines around the world. The nationalists paid a heavy price: vengeful prison sentences were meted out to the leaders and activists. One woman, Blanca Canales, served  years of a le sentence for burning the post office in Jayuya — the same town levelled by US planes. Their incarcerated leader Pedro Albizu Campos was subject to brutal conditions right out of the Gulag Archipelago — and then some. In , he was exposed to radiation poisoning which led to visible burns on his extremities, swelling of his face and led to a stroke which left him paralysed. Thus ended the long struggle of the revolutionary who had parlayed with De Valera and raised money for the Irish liberation movement in Boston in  — at one point he spoke in front of , people in Sanders Theatre in Boston and delivered what was described, by an English lord no less who was present, as “the most complete, the most brilliant speech” on Irish freedom ever heard. The  years which followed his death in  were, says Denis, “a downward spiral of chaos and corruption that turned the island into a punch-drunk fighter, unsure of its whereabouts, wobbling on its feet, pawing at empty air”.It’s hard to argue that things have improved of late. Emigration is the only route to meaningful work for an entire generation: In  alone, it lost a net , residents or nearly . per cent of its population. In , the island went bankrupt with the US Government refusing to come to its aid. In , Puerto Rico was hammered by a Hurricane Maria — the worst natural disaster to ever hit the island. “Is there a solution to all this ” asks Denis. “Of course, but the complicated ones rarely work. Those that have been tried include corporate tax subsidies to giant pharmaceutical companies, a fraudulent war on drugs, government subsidies, austerity programmes, and real estate speculation. These ‘solutions’ breed government fraud, police corruption, absentee ownership, junk bonds, media spin, and rampant hotels, shopping malls and parking lots. The answer may be much simpler. It starts with an honest self-appraisal. It acknowledges the eviction of an entire people — literally and systematically — from their own land.”Nelson Denis has done a service to the people of Puerto Rico — his people — and to the wider world watching on with this authoritative history of a brave island people. He has, at last, put Puerto Rico on the map."},{"url":null,"title":"meet the brexitbashing twitter account followed by leo varadkar","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Editors Viewpoint: State papers show leaders saw a bigger picture The diplomat said many MPs who did not take an active interest in Irish affairs became \"puffed with outrage and conviction\" about doing something in response to the killings.He said suggestions ranged from demands for a tougher and revised policy of policing funerals to a demand for internment throughout Ireland and, in \"more cases than previously\", to a demand to setting a date for withdrawal from Ireland \"in order to let the Irish get on with butchering each other\". State papers: Clintons invite to Adams provoked furious response from PM Majors private secretary Mr Ryan also said people across Britain wrote to their MPs demanding greater action against terrorists.The two plain-clothed British soldiers inadvertently drove into the path of the funeral before mourners pulled them from the car and were beaten before being shot dead by members of the IRA.The murders happened days after the funerals of the three IRA members who were shot dead by the SAS in Gibraltar. State papers: Taoiseach backs Garda in face of Iron Lady Margaret Thatchers disdain Mr Ryan said after meeting backbenchers at Westminster, he was struck by their exasperation and anger \"without any proper sense of how to ventilate it\" while there was a resurgence of \"frustrated patience\" with Ireland.\"The complexity of the issues elude their instinctual approach to policy questions, that of self-interested pragmatism and this further fuels their primary response to events such as last Saturdays,\" he added. State papers: Thatcher warned Haughey of worst civil war everUK allowed Irish unity \"It has to be said that no amount of violence toward the UDR, the RUC and Northern Irish or Irish civilians of any religious persuasion could come anywhere near provoking the same reaction in Britain to Saturdays killings - and the sort of killings they were - of their own English soldiers.\"He later said there was a risk the Anglo-Irish relationship and the Agreement may be \"caught in the net\" when MPs look for the reasons behind the murders.Days after the killings, the Secretary of State Tom King, made a speech to the House of Commons in which he described the \"horric events\" that shocked the world. State papers: Thatcher asked to make gesture of clemency in Guildford Four case  In a separate memo from Mr Ryan following a meeting with Conservative MP Edward Leigh, he said the Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was left \"very distressed and very angry\" by the soldiers murders.Mr Leigh indicated that MPs held special meetings to call for support for \"much tougher and direct action\" by the SAS and other special units against terrorists.\"He stressed several times that he was not exaggerating the mood generally\", Mr Ryan wrote.Mr King told Mr Leigh during a meeting they had reason to believe the IRA was \"planning a serious offensive\", however he did not elaborate further than this."},{"url":null,"title":"someone played a cover of totos africa on a squash and two sweet potatoes","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The two places of worship, he said, stand as a symbol in the face of “attempts to undermine the country’s stability and sectarian seditions.”Mr el-Sissi’s widely publicised policy to staunch sectarianism, however, has done little to protect Christians in rural Egypt, where Muslim extremists frequently attack their homes and businesses or force them to leave their homes after violent disputes. \" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Egyptian Christians pray during Orthodox Christmas Eve Mass at the Great St Antony Church in Cairo Critics and activists say discrimination against Christians there is often tolerated by local authorities and branches of the security agencies.

Receiving the MBE is just totally surreal.ldquoIrsquom overwhelmed the work I do in safeguarding children and women has been recognised by the Queen.Sheila started to work as a front line practitioner in the field of social work  years ago. Today, she is Social Work Manager for the South Eastern Health and Social Care Trust.She is also the chairperson of the South Eastern Area Domestic and Sexual Violence Abuse Partnership, a multi-disciplinary and inter-agency made up of voluntary and statutory community groups like Sure Start, Womenrsquos Aid and PSNI.Sheila said social workers were used to being on the receiving end of unwarranted bad publicity, but were expected by society to protect vulnerable children.She said: ldquoI first began to understand domestic violence when I became a social worker. I quickly realised it was prevalent in a lot of families.ldquoThankfully, society is beginning to talk about it more. ldquoWe need to continue to talk about it because it is so dficult for anyone living with domestic violence to tell their story and it is extremely dficult for children.ldquoThey are scared to speak out because they remain afraid of what might happen to themthey told an outside organisation. Sometimes, their silence is due to them feeling ashamed or even responsible for the abuse they are dealing with.Sheila understood quite early in le about the effects of trauma. Her elder brother, Eugene, disappeared on New Yearrsquos Day  when Sheila was in her early teens.His three children came to live with her family and she saw how her own mother and father were able to make their lives as normal as possible which led to some healing for all of them.The tragedy was the inspiration behind a play called, The Ferryman which debuted in London recently.ldquoMy role is tough, she explains, ldquobut social workers are our own support network. We meet with a lot of anger and abuse. It can be challenging but it can also be rewarding. Many people do come back to us to say thank you or, they will say to us that wersquove helped to turn their le around. That is said to us more frequently than anything . Thatrsquos what keeps us doing the job. We are the source from which change is possible. Everyone has the potential to change and I see it played out time and time again.It is evident that Sheila is dedicated to the families she protects. She said: ldquoDomestic violence is quite prevalent in Northern Ireland. One in six women and one in nine men will live with it including their children some time in their le.ldquoPolice are called to an incident every  minutes. Curiously, it is this time of year that sees a spike in those figures. Christmas Day and New Yearrsquos Day will see the highest numbers of women and children call the police for help.ldquoAnd, I do think the timing of this MBE from the Queen will only serve to raise awareness of this issue. And might even help someone who is suffering abuse to pick up the phone and ask for help.Sheila advises that anyone who wishes to make a call should contact   , which is completely confidential. It is available to all men and women affected by domestic and sexual violence..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Call for upgrade at Ardglass harbour  ","story":"THE need for major improvements at Ardglass harbour to allow signicantly larger vessels to enter the port has been highlighted by former South Down MP Margaret Ritchie.Her comments come after last monthrsquos annual EU Fisheries Council meeting in Brussels which determines how much fish can be landed at the local port and at the neighbouring harbours of Kilkeel and Portavogie.EU chiefs have decided to reduce prawn quotas by just over % to ensure the species ldquostays within sustainable levels, while the herring quota has been reduced by %.The Fisheries Council also determines how many days boats can put to sea, but the December meeting will have been the last UK fishermen were represented at ahead of the Brexit at the end of March.Welcoming some of the outcomes from the Brussels negotiations, Miss Ritchie has urged British and Irish governments to resolve what she described as ldquooutstanding problems in the fisheries sector to build the economies at the three Co Down fishing ports.She explained that the Fisheries Council consists of EU Fisheries Ministers who decide on the annual quota allocations for range of species mdash including prawns and white fish mdash which are the main staple of Northern Ireland fishermen.Miss Ritchie said she was concerned there has been a slight decrease in the amount of prawns which can be landed locally, after a series of successive quota increases over recent years.ldquoIt is important that the British Government has realistic proposals capable of implementation in place to safeguard and grow our local industry, said Ms Ritchie.ldquoThere are also other fishing issues that require resolution as they present ongoing challenges to the catching and processing sectors. They include the Voisinage Agreement with the Irish Government to allow Co Down fishermen to resume fishing in Irish Sea waters. There is also the need for improvements to harbour infrastructure at Ardglass and Kilkeel to allow larger boats to land fish.Miss Ritchie said the prawn quota reduction was more to do with the species being exempted from so-called discard ban.She added: ldquoIt is vitally important that our local fishing industry in the catching and processing sectors is allowed to continue to grow and develop.ldquoThe Government needs to continue with a positive working relationship with the industry to allow the economic sectors in Ardglass and Kilkeel to be nurtured to ensure existing jobs are sustained and new employment opportunities are realised.Mr Alan McCulla, chief executive of the Anglo-North Irish Fish Producers Organisation Sea Source, believes the outcome of the annual negotiation on catch quotas ldquoputs Northern Irelandrsquos fishermen in a good starting position for the next phase in our relationship with the EU.He said the agreements reached at the Fisheries Council meeting offered ldquosome positives and some negatives for the Irish Sea, with the December negotiations described by the Department of Agriculture Environment and Rural Affairsas ldquoone of the most dficult councils in recent years.A spokesperson for the government department said it was vitally important to ensure that sufficient quota was obtained for all Irish Sea fish species to enable them to land all the fish they catch from the start of the New Year, particularly whiting which is a by-catch in the prawn fishery.ldquoThe EU Commission initially proposed an Irish Sea whiting quota of  tonnes but this was successfully negotiated up by % to  tonnes, with agreement to carry out a further review of the quota in the new year.The government department spokesperson said the deal ldquoensures that there are now workable solutions to alleviate the pressure for fishermen while preventing fish from being wastefully discarded unnecessarily..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Castlewellan tree voted top in NI  ","story":"CASTLEWELLAN Forest Parkrsquos giant redwood is celebrating being voted Northern Irelandrsquos Tree of the Year in the Woodland Trustrsquos search for the countryrsquos best-loved tree.The stunning redwood mdash or multi-stemmed giant sequoia to be precise mdash finished second in the  UK final.Everyone associated with the Forest Service, the people of Castlewellan and ious groups helping with ambitious regeneration proposals at the stunning forest park, are delighted with the majestic treersquos success in the regional heat.The giant redwood stands within the walled garden at the forest park and at over  years old has seen centuries come and go.

The Hoops raced into a - first half lead with goals from Stephen Galbraithand Sean McMahon before Jordan McCoubrey delivered the coup de grace in the th minute to finally kill off a game Olympic outfit.Celtic looked the more composed and inventive side from the off and an understrength Olympic struggled to create anything of note. The Hoops seized the lead with only six and a half minutes gone and never looked back.Chris Mullan, who was like a fleet-footed gazelle down the left flank and just missed out on the man of the match award, sped past his marker on the edge of the box.His stinging shot that looked destined for the bottom corner of the net was parried out by an alert Ryan Connollly, but Galbraith was hovering around the six-yard box and was perfectly placed to steer the ball home.Less than two minutes later Mullan dipped his shoulder again and cut inside Jack Roddy before striking the base of the post with a fierce shot.Olympic steadfastly refused to buckle and with  minutes gone were unlucky not to equalise when Aaron McCaffrey, their most potent player in attack, was unable to take advantage in a rare moment of panic in the Celtic box.Celtic went back on the attack and with  minutes gone taskmaster Jordan Curran teamed up with Mullan to create an opening for Sean McMahon, but he fired wide.Back at the other end, the dangerous McCaffrey got in behind Conor Doherty, but his delightfully flighted cross missed by everyone in the box.With  minutes gone Rottweiler Curran blocked an Olympic attempt to send Rhys Patterson clear. The ball flew off his shin and into the path of the willing Sean McMahon who raced away from Michael Rice and Darryl Russell, but with only Connolly to beat, his cheeky, dinked effort grazed the crossbar on the way to safety.A minute later another mazy Mullan run ended with the wing wizard crossing for McMahon, but this seasonrsquos top scorer had his audacious effort blocked on the six yard box with Celtic claiming a penalty.The second goal wasnrsquot long in coming and with  minutes gone a Mullan cross was deftly headed home by Doherty, who had been given the freedom of the box. Three minutes later Galbraith made it - when his low corner evaded Connolly at his near post and ended up in the net.Celtic continued their dominance after the break with Mullan and McMahon dovetailing perfectly for Curran, but his shot went well over the top. With  minutes gone McMahon decided to go it alone, but he was well off target as Olympic backed off him.Olympic tried desperately to get things moving, but it just wasnrsquot their day and with  minutes played Russell did exceptionally well to prevent Galbraith from making it - with a last-gasp tackle.The fourth goal was just around the corner and with  minutes gone Andy Baggley headed the ball into the path of prodigy Jordan McCoubrey, who looked suspiciously offside. The teenage terrier didnrsquot hang around as Olympic had pushed up and he raced cleat to beat Connolly all ends up.If anything, Celtic could have won by an even bigger margin and Connolly saved brilliantly in the th minute to deny Baggley a fth Celtic goal.Celtic Bhoys: Nathan Curran, Shaun Megahey, Conor Doherty, Matthew Carson, Mikey Rice, Jordan Curran, Terence Bell, Ricky Kerr, Stephen Galbraith, Sean McMahon, Chris Mullan.

into the wild after months of recuperation.Grey seals Bran and Thor were given an emotional send off this morning at the tranquil Knockinelder bay at the tip of the Ards Peninsula.The two seal pups, Bran and Thor, make their way down the beach at Knockinelder bay after their releaseThe pups were saved by Northern Ireland’s only seal sanctuary at the nearby Exploris Aquarium.They were found dangerously underweight in the early autumn having not received sufficient milk from their mother.After months of rehabilitation and feeding up at Exploris, they gained enough weight and insulating blubber for ato the Irish Sea.A small crowd gathered at the bay to watch as sanctuary staff, who had helped bring the pups back to health, said goodbye.Two children were invited to open the doors of the pups’ crates to let them make their way down to the water’s edge.Peter Williams, who runs the animal welfare department at Exploris, said it was a time of mixed emotions for his team.“It can be emotional for us,” he said.“We love what we do. It’s very important for us to keep our distance when working with the animals – essentially they are wild animals and that’s what they need to stay, so we do interact very little with them.“However, each one has their own personality and we all have a favourite and when you say goodbye it’s almost like sending a child off to university.”The sanctuary cares for between  to  seals every year.Mr Williams said last year was particularly busy for the team at Exploris because extreme weather conditions presented more problems for seal pups.Kingsmills massacre commemoration: Killers should own up to what they did, says victim’s daughter Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"The sanctuary relies on members of the public to contact it when they find a seal in dficulty.For more information ring    or visit www.explorisni seal-sanctuarytry catch            ..

Scotland had the lowest level of overpayments, with % saying they had done so in the year up to June.Poor interest rates from money sitting in savings accounts could be one factor driving the high levels of home owners using their cash to make mortgage overpayments, those behind the research suggested.Continued low interest rates on mortgages, making debts relatively affordable, could also mean some borrowers have a bit of spare cash left over which they can put towards paying their loan off more quickly.David Blake, principal mortgage adviser, Which  Mortgage Advisers, said: “While it might be surprising to hear that so many people have paid off extra chunks of their mortgage recently, the benefits can be massive, cutting months off the totalof your loan – and, in turn, saving you hundreds or even thousands in interest.”More than , home owners with a mortgage were surveyed.Which  Mortgage Advisers said that some mortgage lenders limit the amount you can overpay to % per year and thatyou could consider either making regular overpayments or doing it in lump sums.Thieves try to smash through wall to steal ATM Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch            ..

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

Initially under the baton of Clford Bunford and later conducted by Douglas Baxter, the choir performed many of the major works of the choral repertoire and several less well known works. Following Douglas retirement in , the choir began to suffer a decline in numbers, which led to a ersying of the repertoire.The choir was rebranded as Barry Community Choir in  and, under the leadership of conductor, Emma Arscott, the membership has begun to increase again.The choir meets in Crossway Church in Barry on Wednesday evenings and all are welcome to join.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The site will potentially generate up to  new work positions across management, supervisory, warehousing staff and apprenticeship roles.Speaking of the new facility and what it will bring, Mr Rattenbury said: ldquoWe are delighted that our vision of a lsquoone stop shoprsquo for our customers is being realised and having a  hour, seven day a week co-packing facility in the heart of Wales, is a game changer for our industry. We can now offer our customers a streamlined product supply chain package by integrating their co-packing requirements with the grouprsquos warehouse and transport subsidiary companies.ldquoLogistically, this works out to be more cost effective overall, but also lowers the carbon footprint on the transportation of food products, which is something we are passionate about.Wild Water Group has a current annual turnover of poundm and Mr Rattenbury believes the company can increase that figure by a further poundm within  months and then reach poundm within two to three years.The project is backed by a pound. million investment from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking and the Development Bank of Wales and has secured Welsh Government funding under the new economic contract.Using a similar business model to the grouprsquos other three sites in Merthyr Tydfil, Llanishen and Cardf Bay, the first phase of development will be the conversion of available space into a large ambient open plan co-packing facility, which will be operational early November  to meet festive season demand.During the first quarter of , Wild Water Group will move the entire Cardf Bay co-packing facility to Aberbargoed, once freezer facilities, production lines and machinery are in place.The company will then continue services such as frozen to frozen storage, bagging, over wrapping, sleeving and tray sealing, as well as the full spectrum of print labelling applications required under the Food Safety Technicalspecications.Economy Secretary Ken Skates said: ldquoThis project will not only see a successful, growing Welsh business create an additional  jobs, it will also create a new strategic hub and facility for both large and small food and drink businesses across the region to pack or store products themselves. This could, in turn, open up new markets for those businesses ndash so Irsquom excited about what this means not only for Wild Water Group and Aberbargoed, but for the region more widely.ldquoIt shows that both our Economic and Food and Drink Action plans are delivering what we had hoped ndash jobs, prosperity and sustainable growth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

However, I do prefer to buy and shop from local family businesses.And for all those curious about Veganuary, are taking part for the first time or are interested in finding out more, Ms Thomas will be holding a VeganJanuary fair in Penarthrsquos Paget Rooms on Sunday, January  from pm to pm.There will be a iety of stalls including Melrsquos Kindness Kitchen Vegan Cheeses, Lottiersquos Vegan Bakery and more.For more information, search Absolutely Fabulous Vegan Fayres on Facebook. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Some of the major deals completing last year included PwC’s move to Merchant Square, the Northern Ireland Civil Service at  Lanyon Place and Allstate at Mays Meadow. “During an unsettling period of political uncertainty, the local office market is an indicator of the health of the Northern Ireland economy, with the professional services and technology sectors in particular leading the way,” Brian Lavery, managing director at CBRE said. “Currently we only have around , sq ft of grade A office space available fragmented across a number of buildings underpinning the need for more investment in this space. “Alongside this office space growth, we are also seeing the green shoots of demand for residential living in the city centre. We believe this is the trend to track in  and beyond as investors across the UK and globally continue to look for opportunities in this area. “However, on a more positive note, we are seeing strong interest from a wide spectrum of investors for office investments in Belfast which is being driven by growing rents and demand, combined with limited supply of high-quality accommodation.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/34453454454.jpg","title":"supporting belfast start ups on the rise","story":"Posted on Thursday January  by Ulster Business The UK’s digital tech sector has attracted more capital than any other European country and Belfast has established itself as a key hub, writes Roisin Byrne, business director, Hays Northern Ireland The  Tech Nation report makes it clear that digital tech makes an essential contribution to our local economy with clusters and start-ups forming primarily around AI , machine learning, cyber security and big data industries. The Belfast start-up community ecosystem is alive and well and has carved out a reputation in the wider tech community for having good access to talent, funding and transport links. It also benefits from great workspaces such as Ormeau Baths, Farset Labs and the Innovation Centre at Catalyst Inc. Indeed, the city is bubbling with entrepreneurial talent as demonstrated by the large number of start-ups which have launched in the last two years. Belfast boasts a disproportionate number of the UK’s high growth firms and it is estimated that the local ecosystem now supports around , jobs. Hays has worked with a number of these start-ups as they have scaled up operations – firms such as Analytics Engines, Uleska and Vox to name a few. As part of our commitment to the sector we’ve also taken space in Ormeau Baths which has become an epicentre for tech meet-ups, hackathons and pitch events. It’s also a campus for early stage and growth stage start-ups to network, share experience and build scalable, globally focussed businesses. In its first year, % of companies based in Ormeau Baths grew their teams and revenues, and raised over £m in venture funding. We’ve also launched a new national initiative called Super Connect delivered by Empact Ventures which aims to help tech start-ups and scale-ups to explore collaboration with large organisations and funding providers through a series of venture labs and pitch days. The initiative brings together corporates, SMEs, angel investors, venture capitalists, grant providers, loan funds and crowdfunding s to explore supporting these start-ups and scale-ups. Details can be found at www.superconnectseries. In an increasingly competitive marketplace Hays sees real value in the innovative ideas start-ups are using to network and build traction and as they scale up to the next stage we are providing material support and employer value branding to help them attract the talent they need.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
