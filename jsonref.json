Ismaila Sarr, who ran Liverpool ragged at Vicarage Road a couple of seasons ago, replaces Emmanuel Dennis, who drops to the bench.But history gives Watford a little succour, too. They’ve twice trounced Liverpool 3-0 at Vicarage Road during the Jurgen Klopp era, most recently in February 2020 just before the first lockdown. They also held Klopp’s side to a 3-3 draw down there on the opening day of the 2017-18 season, Mo Salah’s debut ruined just as Big Sami’s had been all those years ago. Roy Hodgson has also done a number on Liverpool at Anfield in the past, and no that’s not barbed reference to his brief stint as manager, rather West Brom’s 1-0 win in April 2012. Liverpool, on a nine-game winning run in the Premier League, are strong favourites for the three points. But nothing’s certain when the pressure’s on at the business end of the season, you’re fighting for the title, and your opponents are battling to avoid relegation and have just won away at Southampton.

Photograph: Diarmuid GreeneA Co Offaly meat plant worker who nearly died from Covid-19 is suing his employer for personal injuries in the first known damages claim involving a case in a meat factory.Paul Feighery has taken a High Court action against Rosderra Irish Meats Group claiming that he contracted the virus while working at its plant in Roscrea, Co Tipperary.Mr Feighery took ill in March 2020. His health rapidly deteriorated and he was admitted to Midland Regional Hospital Tullamore. He spent more than two weeks on a ventilator in ICU before recovering and being discharged in May 2020. He still suffers ill effects from the disease.His solicitors, Deirdre K Ryan \u0026amp Co in Roscrea, confirmed that Mr Feighery was taking a personal injuries and negligence case against Rosderra.He is claiming damages for severe personal injuries, allegedly caused by the company’s negligence, breach of contract and breach of duty, including statutory duty.Total disregardIn his claim filed in January, he is alleging that Rosderra showed a total disregard for his safety and welfare. The company has yet to file a defence in the action.Rosderra chief executive Jim Hanley had no comment. The firm’s solicitors, Benjamin J Higgins, said: “As this matter is the subject of legal proceedings, we cannot comment at this stage.”The first legal case arising from a Covid-19 case in a meat-plant worker could spark a flurry of similar actions by people who claim they contracted the virus as a result of their working conditions.Rosderra suffered one of the biggest Covid-19 outbreaks at any workplace in the country during the first wave of the pandemic. Regarded as an essential food business, the company – the largest pig-meat processing plant in the State – remained open throughout the pandemic.Sinn Féin TD for Laois-Offaly Brian Stanley raised concerns in the Dáil about staff infections at Rosderra in April 2020 claiming that out of about 350 workers in Roscrea, up to 140 were out sick.He claimed at the time that workers who later tested positive were allowed to work next to healthy staff. The outbreak prompted the HSE to mass-test hundreds of staff for Covid-19.Meat plants have been among the workplaces worst affected by the virus as the circulation of chilled air and close-quarters working conditions encourages transmission.A surge in infections out of meat plants in August 2020 led to regional restrictions in Kildare, Laois and Offaly, the first and only local lockdowns of the pandemic.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"thousands take part in climb with charlie fundraiser as more than 1m raised","story":"People hiking up Croagh Patrick in Co Mayo on Saturday as part of the Climb with Charlie fundraiser, which has raised more than €1 million for the Irish Motor Neurone Disease Association and suicide charity Pieta. Photograph: Mark HennessyTens of thousands of people are taking part today in almost 200 Climb with Charlie fundraisers to raise money for the Irish Motor Neurone Disease Association and suicide charity Pieta, according to the campaign organisers.The charity campaign, led by broadcaster Charlie Bird who was diagnosed with motor neurone disease last year, has already raised more than €1 million.As part of the fundraiser, Mr Bird (72) is being joined by some 500 “friends and family” on a trek up and down Croagh Patrick.Among those who have taken to the Reek this morning are Mr Bird’s wife, Claire, daughters, Orla and Neasa, and five grandchildren, as well as singer Daniel O’Donnell, Matt Molloy of the Chieftains, boxer Barry McGuigan and the Late Late Show host Ryan Tubridy.In a tweet on Saturday morning, President Michael D Higgins sent “every good wish and warmest support” to Mr Bird.He said: “Charlie’s strength and dignity over recent months has been a source of true inspiration to people across Ireland and beyond. I know that the public will be with him every step of the way.”Separate Climb with Charlie events have also been planned across the world, in countries such as the United States, South Africa, Australia and Spain.Other climbs taking place include a 17.5km hike up Mount Cooke in Western Australia, a 700m-high climb up Ben Gorm in Co Mayo, a 6km night-time trek from Glenmore to Barnavave peak (350m) in Co Louth, and a 494m-high hike up Cnoc Bulaba.The journey up Croagh Patrick began at 9.30am on Saturday from the mountain’s base in Westport, Co Mayo.Temperatures were expected to range between seven degrees in the east and about 10 degrees in the west “and as we climb of course it will be colder”.“I have no idea how many people are going to scale the Reek with me, but I feel it is going to be a day like no other,” he added.Upon reaching the summit, Mr Bird is expected to make a speech to his supporters and light five candles in the mountain’s church one for his friend Vicky Phelan, one for people suffering a terminal illness, one for anyone in a dark place with their mental health, one for everyone involved in the fight against Covid and one for the people of Ukraine.The Climb with Charlie campaign is still accepting donations on www.climbwithcharlie.ie for the Irish Motor Neurone Disease Association and Pieta.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"miriam lord s week leo s chinese lantern sparks security alert at leinster house","story":"Tánaiste Leo Varadkar: a suspect package addressed to him sparked a security alert in Government Buildings three weeks ago. Photograph: Colin KeeganCollins DublinOn a sleepy Friday afternoon three weeks ago, with the Dáil and Seanad in recess and those Ministers still in the whole of their health embarking on St Patrick’s week travels, a suspect package addressed to Leo Varadkar sparked a security alert in Government Buildings.It was deemed serious enough to force a 40-minute closure of Merrion Street while the bomb squad reportedly entered the premises. Gardaí rushed to the scene and closed off the street from Merrion Square as far as the junction with Baggot Street. While staff were not evacuated, the front gates were locked and staff were sent an email asking them to leave via the back entrance.The Irish Daily Mail reported that the package was marked as coming from China and gardaí were called after it was X-rayed at Government Buildings. A subsequent examination revealed the contents did not contain any dangerous items or substances.At the time, the Government press office refused to comment on the report as it “does not comment on security matters” while the Garda press office told journalist Louise Burne: “Gardaí were alerted in relation to concerns regarding the contents of a package at Government Buildings. Following a preliminary examination, no further action was necessary.”They did not confirm reports that the bomb squad was called. The intended recipient of the suspicious package was in no danger one way or the other. The Tánaiste was on St Patrick’s Day duty in Chile.Since the incident, we hear there is much amusement around Government Buildings about Leo’s mysterious parcel from the Orient which set off alarm bells on the security front when what appeared to be electrical components and wires showed up in the X-ray machine.Turns out the package contained a new lamp. A very nice lamp, apparently.We have been unable to ascertain if the Tánaiste purchased it for his Merrion Street office (perhaps already thinking about the refurb when he takes over from Micheál Martin as taoiseach at the end of the year) or for the newly purchased gaff in Portobello.As Tennyson might have written: In the spring, a youngish man’s fancy lightly turns to thoughts of lovely lights . . .Pinch of salt for Stephen Donnelly’s health reportEverything is going great guns in the health service. We’ll be world-beating and world leaders in no time, if Stephen Donnelly’s telephone address to the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party this week is anything to go by.In the course of a comprehensive overview of developments in his department and the many projects he is working on, the Minister for Health treated lowly deputies and Senators to a glowing progress report. He also wrested credit for the pioneering but ill-fated Mother and Child Scheme in the late 1940s from Dr Noel Browne and gave it all to Fianna Fáil.We understand some TDs had large pinches of salt at hand while listening to the Minister’s rundown of the sterling efforts under way and the many difficult issues which still need to be resolved. But rest assured, their man is toiling “relentlessly”, particularly in the area of waiting lists, diagnostics and consultant recruitment.While he has been doing “huge, huge” work, he also praised Ministers of State Mary Butler and Anne Rabbitte for also “doing incredible work” in the areas of mental health and disability. They, of course, are members of Fianna Fáil, but he graciously remembered the other junior minister, the one who bats for Fine Gael. “A very good guy, Frank Feighan”, apparently.In the course of parping the ministerial trumpet, Stephen, who jumped ship from the Social Democrats to Fianna Fáil in 2017, offered some historical perspective to his audience of dyed-in-the-wool Soldiers of Destiny.Over the years, despite challenges, he said the party made huge differences to the quality of Irish healthcare, citing the decade starting from 1997, when infant mortality fell and the nursing degree and the smoking ban was introduced.He then moved on to list the very many achievements under his own watch. While there is much unfinished business and some serious challenges to address, there is “a lot to be proud of in terms of the national effort”, he said.And that is a scheme, he told colleagues, “which Noel Browne gets the credit for” when actually the previous Fianna Fáil government drafted the Health Act. He said it wasn’t even implemented by Browne’s inter-party administration, without explaining the crucial reasons why. The Fianna Fáil government which came next implemented it, he crowed.Hardly a feather in the cap as the Minister omitted that important technical bit about it being considerably watered down as a result of the same government bowing to clerical pressure.Anyway, in the area of women’s health, he is doing “a really big push”.Super Doolan moves onTeresa Doolan, the first woman to hold the prestigious position of superintendent of Leinster House, is moving on to pastures fresh after two years in the post and taking up a new job within the Department of Justice.Clerk of the Dáil and head of the Houses of the Oireachtas Service, Peter Finnegan, pays tribute to her in his latest staff bulletin.“Teresa has been a brilliant addition to our team a calm, efficient and highly effective superintendent who brought a new outlook to the position. We are sad to see her leave us and her expertise will be greatly missed,” he writes, adding that it was “an immense pleasure” to work with her and wishing her every success in her new role.The civil servant was formerly Enda Kenny’s private secretary when he was taoiseach, and she transferred to the Oireachtas team in Leinster House from the human resources unit in the Department of the Taoiseach.As head of the superintendent’s unit, Doolan was in charge of all security functions relating to the Dáil and Seanad, as well as the infrastructure and accommodation needs of TDs and Senators. She made a break with tradition on her first day in the job – traditionally the preserve of ex-army officers – when asking ushers to call her Teresa instead of using the conventional and formal “superintendent”.There is talk in Leinster House that her predecessor, Paul Conway, who moved to Brussels as the Oireachtas representative at the European Parliament, may be drafted in as a temporary replacement while Derek Dignam, head of communications and international relations, has also been mentioned in dispatches.Teresa’s departure means that two key security positions in Leinster House are now worryingly vacant. John Flaherty, former stalwart of the Oireachtas Golf Society whose evidence to the Golfgate court case in Galway in January was praised by Judge Mary Fahy, finished up as captain of the guard in 2020.Dáil’s drama kings and queensIt should come as no surprise to hear that politicians in Leinster House were broadly in favour this week of Norma Foley’s plan to introduce theatre, film and drama studies to the Leaving Cert syllabus, given the amount of drama queens and old hams populating the benches on all sides.Former Fianna Fáil TD turned disaffected Independent Marc MacSharry was a leading light in Sligo amateur dramatic circles before scaling new theatrical heights in Kildare Street, while Fine Gael junior minister Hildegarde Naughton is a classically trained soprano her Eliza Doolittle and Calamity Jane are still fondly remembered in Galway Musical Society circles.Another paid-up member of the luvvie brigade is Wexford-based Fianna Fáil Senator Malcolm Byrne, who is treading the boards next week in Gorey Musical Society’s production of The Sound of Music. The show opens with a Sunday matinee tomorrow and will run nightly until Saturday’s two-show finale. Tickets are selling fast, with limited availability for some shows. Malcolm’s credits include the role of Juan Perón in Evita, Major General Stanley in The Pirates of Penzance and the Cowardly Lion in the Wizard of Oz.He is playing Admiral Von Schreiber (who forces Captain Von Trapp back into the Navy) in this week’s show. A minor role, which leaves him free to join the chorus for the waltzing scenes.Meanwhile, speaking of Senators, we must congratulate Tom Clonan for triumphing in the Seanad byelection and taking Ivana Bacik’s vacant Trinity seat after what turned into a nailbiting contest in the final counts. The former Army captain, who turned whistleblower following his research into sex abuse in the Defence Forces, is a disability campaigner and a well-known commentator on defence and security matters.Members of the Upper House are now wondering how their colleague on the Labour panel, lance corporal Gerard Craughwell (special speechifying ops), will cope with not being the Seanad’s only authority on national security and soldiering. Obviously, he’ll still be the leading one. And he can show young Clonan the ropes.Plurilingual praiseMalcolm’s party colleague and namesake Thomas Byrne, the Minister of State for European Affairs, was looking very pleased with himself on Tuesday. There were two reasons: he wasn’t wearing his arm in a sling anymore following an unfortunate funeral-related injury and he had just returned from a conference organised by the French embassy where he spoke in four languages: English, Irish, French and Italian.The ambassador, His Excellency Vincent Guérend, was so impressed he tweeted thanks to the Minister in the same four languages for his commitment to “plurilingualism, a key driver of the EU citizenship”.Thomas addressed the conference on the theme of “Inspiring plurilingualism: stakes and perspectives in Europe”.Is Byrne a plurilinguist? We’re not sure, as he had a script, but we imagine if any TD were to call him one in the Dáil the Ceann Comhairle might boot them out for inappropriate use of language.As for the aforementioned sling, the TD for Meath East confessed to us that he tripped in the church while on his way to extend his condolences to a constituent and suffered a slight fracture to his arm.

It all started when shadow cabinet minister Emily Thornberry signed up her Labour colleagues Rupa Huq, Paul Blomfield, Alex Sobel and Luke Pollard to the group. “She did not want to see this APPG hijacked by a group of Tory MPs fixated on fighting silly culture wars,” her spokesman tells me.The mild-mannered Murrison – now co-chairman with Pollard – is having none of it: “If Emily or any of her colleagues think the Trust would not benefit from parliamentary scrutiny, greater transparency, from being democratically accountable to a huge membership and responsive to its workforce, tenants and army of loyal volunteers, they should say so. Under my chairmanship the APPG and its officers will continue to be the Trust’s critical friend with an open door to its many stakeholders.”Let the battle commence!Julian Fellowes, the Downton Abbey creator, tells me that one of the hazards of being a top screenwriter and producer is that random people approach him with terrible ideas for their own shows. “It happens quite often,” Fellowes said at a Dorchester Hotel event, on the arm of his wife Lady Kitchener to raise funds for sick children.Fellowes – or Lord Fellowes of West Stafford as he is known – adopts a line often used by the Queen. “I just say ‘how interesting’,” he says. That normally does the trick.Two theatrical dames – Joanna Lumley and Judi Dench – were on hand to pay tribute to Laura Kuenssberg, the BBC’s political editor, who stood down this week after seven years. Guests were treated to a “greatest hits” package of Laura K’s toughest questions, notably a corker to Donald Trump from a January 2017 press conference in the White House, when the then-prime minister Theresa May called her for a question.Kuenssberg listed Trump’s previous dubious claims about torture, abortion and Russia, and a ban on Muslims coming to the US, before she asked him: “For many people in Britain, those sound like alarming beliefs. What do you say to our viewers at home who are worried about some of your views and worried about you becoming the leader of the free world?”A shocked Trump turned to May. “This was your choice of a question? There goes that relationship.”Ed Balls has moved onwards and upwards since being unceremoniously thrown out of Parliament by voters at the 2015 general election. But at a fundraiser for the National Theatre, he said his “one regret” was rejecting a role in the musical Grease after appearing on Strictly Come Dancing in 2016.“I got asked whether I would like to play Teen Angel in the touring show Grease,” he tells me. Balls turned it down and the part went to 1970s singing sensation Jimmy Osmond. “It is one of the high points of my life to think me and Jimmy Osmond were competing for the same gig,” he tells me proudly.Before the culture wars were invented, liberal minded Joan Bakewell and conservative campaigner Mary Whitehouse would regularly clash over morals and standards on television in the 1960s and 1970s. Today, Bakewell has lost none of her fire, describing this week how she found Whitehouse – who is the subject of a new documentary – to be “a prudish, narrow-minded campaigner”. But Bakewell added a footnote. “Nevertheless, I visited her when she was dying. We made up.” Perhaps a lesson for today’s keyboard warriors.Boris Johnson has clearly not given up on persuading Christian Wakeford to return to the fold. The former Tory MP crossed the floor of the Commons to become a Labour MP at the height of the Partygate controversy.“I think CCHQ has a malfunction with its email because I got an email the other day asking me to join the Conservative Party,” Wakeford tells me. “I am probably now the last person they want to join ...

They were wrong.”Yet Marina remains remarkably upbeat as she chats about her past, present and future, showing the strength of character that has got her this far, and which she still believes will see her facing Putin in the International Criminal Court one day.Her biggest ambition in life is “to live longer than Putin, and one day see him tried for war crimes and for the murder of my husband”. The war in Ukraine might even have brought that day closer.For now, though, Marina has a rather more introspective mission at hand. She and her son Anatoly are about to begin work on a joint memoir about Alexander, about his murder, and about the international criminal investigation that has dominated their lives ever since.Anatoly was just 12 when his dissident father died, and Marina believes the process of writing a book together will not only help them to relive cherished memories of Alexander, but also confront unresolved, unspoken elements of their grief.“Anatoly was definitely traumatised by his father’s death,” she says of the boy who was taken to see Alexander as he lay dying in University College Hospital, “but he was very protective of what he was feeling inside. He didn’t cry, and it was only when he got older that he started to talk about it.“When we write this memoir together it will be interesting to hear maybe for the first time his feelings about what happened, from his perspective.”Anatoly, now 28, still lives with his mother in their small flat in West London. He has been working as a paralegal but has decided his future lies in IT and is about to embark on a course in computer coding.Marina and her son talk about Alexander – or Sasha, to use the Russian diminutive form – “a lot” and she has always tried to impress on him the fact that “yes, your father died, but in some way he is with us”.Keeping Alexander’s memory alive, of course, has been a highly public affair for Marina, but not one which came easily.“I’m a very private person,” she says, “and I’m always really surprised when people recognise me in the street, though they are always very polite and generous.“What I do in public, I am doing for my husband, but it doesn’t come naturally. When he was lying in that hospital bed I refused to do any interviews. Sasha said I should do them, and tell people what was happening, but I thought he was going to recover so I never thought I would need to.”Before his death at the age of 44, Litvinenko dictated a statement to be read after his passing, in which he said: “You may succeed in silencing one man, but the howl of protest from around the world will reverberate, Mr Putin, in your ears for the rest of your life. May God forgive you for what you have done, not only to me but to beloved Russia and its people.” Putin’s blood-curdling reaction to Alexander’s death was to say: “The people that have done this are not God, and Mr Litvinenko is, unfortunately, not Lazarus.”A public inquiry chaired by Sir Robert Owen concluded in 2016 that Litvinenko had been the victim of a Federal Security Service (FSB, formerly KGB) assassination “probably” approved by Putin.It named two Russian agents, Andrey Lugovoy and Dmitri Kovtun, as his killers they had slipped a lethal dose of the radioactive substance polonium 210 into a pot of tea drunk by Litvinenko when they held a meeting with him on Wednesday, November 1, 2006 at London’s Millennium Hotel.Litvinenko told Marina that as he sipped his tea, “in one second he realised something wasn’t right”.Twenty-two days later, he was dead and she believes that if he had finished the cup he might have died very quickly, meaning the cause of his death might never have been detected.Two days after the meeting, he was admitted to Barnet General Hospital, before being transferred to University College Hospital on November 17 when his condition worsened. Doctors diagnosed acute radiation syndrome, and on November 23, after losing consciousness, he suffered a cardiac arrest and died after attempts to resuscitate him failed.And so he became the key witness in the investigation into his own murder. The public inquiry was a personal triumph for Marina, who had spent an entire decade pushing for it, despite the obvious risks to her own safety from taking on Putin and his hitmen.I ask if she feels she has to spend her life looking over her shoulder, but she says she has never had bodyguards and refuses to allow security concerns to constrain her.“In 2006 I was given close communication with the police, which meant I could always contact someone 24 hours a day, and I still have that access, but I don’t really need it,” she says.“I do pay attention to what happens around me – if I see the same person cropping up too many times I might want to know why.”Later this year a four-part ITV series, starring David Tennant as Litvinenko, will dramatise the murder and Marina’s fight for justice, which she hopes will bring the story to a new audience too young to remember the scarcely believable events of November 2006.Anatoly acted as a consultant for the series, but contractual obligations elsewhere meant she could not be involved in the production. Did she meet Tennant? She blushes and smiles, which gives away the answer, even though the official version is that they have never met.Marina, who will soon celebrate her 60th birthday, retains the unmistakable poise of her former life as a ballroom dancer (she still teaches dance), and sits straight-backed on the edge of a sofa as she sips green tea at a hotel near her west London home.]She recalls her first meeting with Alexander, in 1993, when he was working for the FSB investigating organised crime – she was 31 and he was 30.“I had heard about him before I met him,” she says, “and I was really quite surprised when this very young man arrived, looking quite shy. He certainly wasn’t what you expect a KGB man to be!”She was meeting friends for drinks on her birthday (“I always joked afterwards that he was my birthday present,” she says) and Alexander accompanied a friend of hers who was nervous about her safety because of her involvement in a case he was investigating.“Sasha gave you so much confidence. He supported you, he protected you, you felt very confident around him, whether you were his wife, his friend or his child. I never thought I could feel so loved, so protected and so happy.“He was always very open-minded, open to anything new. I never thought I would find all of those qualities in one person.”She also, of course, remembers the last time they spoke, and tears prick her eyes as she recalls leaving his hospital bedside to go home to Anatoly for the night.“I told him: ‘Don’t worry, I’ll be back soon’,” she says. “He said: ‘I love you so much’, and he looked so sad. I tried to make a joke by saying ‘finally you tell me!’, but it was the last thing he said to me. Two hours later he was unconscious.”Campaigning for justice can be lonely work, and Marina does not rule out marrying again one day, saying the idea of having another relationship “isn’t a problem to me”, but that any suitor would have to realise that “Sasha will always be in my life, so it would have to be a strong personality to accept that because most people want to be the only one”.At the start of our interview, before bombarding her with questions about her husband, about Ukraine, about Putin, about Roman Abramovich and so much more, I ask her if there are any particular messages she wants to get across, and her answer comes as a surprise.“Firstly, I’m worried about Russophobia,” she says, without pausing for thought. “Of course I support sanctions against Russia, but now people don’t even want to play Russian music, they want to boycott Russian composers. It’s stupid. The past 100 years have not been good for Russia, but it is also the country that produced Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky, Tchaikovsky and Prokofiev.”She accepts that it might seem odd to some people that she is so passionate about defending the country that murdered her husband, but she believes that “there may be a chance for Russia to become a different country” in future.Could she ever see herself going back to a Putin-free Russia if a modern-day Gorbachev were to take over one day and bring about a new glasnost?“When I left Russia I didn’t think I had left forever,” she says, recalling the couple’s arrival in the UK as political refugees in 2000. “There were people who left during the Cold War that knew they were leaving for good, but for me I thought it was going to be temporary.“Now, though, I would be more happy to go to live in Ukraine. It’s a very similar culture I have friends there and there will be plenty of work to do in rebuilding the country once the war is over.”She praises British people for being so “welcoming and open” to taking in Ukrainian refugees, but warns that “they need to be serious about it. “It’s not just about being generous it’s about being capable of supporting people who are traumatised, who have just come from a war zone. People also need to be prepared to be in this for the long haul you can’t just reject someone after a couple of weeks.”She does not have space in the small flat she shares with her son to be able to house a refugee, but is acting as a liaison for others who want to open their homes. She admits the war took her by surprise – a few days before the invasion, Moscow-born Marina was in Ukraine visiting friends in the south-west of the country.“I didn’t think there was going to be an invasion at all,” she admits, “or certainly nothing beyond the Donbas region. There were so many reasons for Putin not to do it, especially the effect that sanctions would have, that I thought he would hold back.”She says the West has been guilty of a collective failure to see Putin for what he is – “someone who has turned Russia into a mafia state and then a terrorist state” – because successive leaders have convinced themselves they knew how to handle him.“During the Cold War it was simple, because the West didn’t really have any personal relationships with Russia,” she says. “But after glasnost the West started doing business with Russia, private companies got deeply involved, personal relationships formed and they wanted to give Putin the benefit of the doubt.”She recalled George W Bush’s meeting with Putin in June 2001, when the US president said he had “looked the man in the eye” and found him to be “straightforward and trustworthy… I was able to get a sense of his soul”.“No-one believed the president of Russia was a real monster,” she says, “but he is and my husband Sasha tried to show it before his death, and he tried to show it through his death.“Russia carried out an act of nuclear terrorism on British soil by murdering Sasha, and it should have been a watershed moment, but it wasn’t.“In 2010 the new government of the UK gave Russia another chance to build its relationship, and more money came in, big donors with Russian surnames gave money to the Conservative Party. It was a big mistake.”She fears the West will become “fatigued” with the situation in Ukraine, and that President Volodymyr Zelensky will accept a peace deal that would be too advantageous to Russia.“It might suit western leaders to push Zelensky into agreeing everything Putin wants so that they can move on, but the Ukrainian people would not accept that, so it won’t be over.”She even suggests that Zelensky’s position as president could be in doubt if he is too accommodating, despite his Churchillian popularity at present.It is Marina’s misfortune that she knows more about Russia’s use of poisons than almost anyone else in the UK, so what does she believe happened to Abramovich, who claims he was poisoned while acting as a go-between in peace talks?“I believe this is all part of a propaganda exercise to frame Ukraine,” she says. “The Russians have already tried to suggest that Ukraine has chemical weapons so that they can stage false flag operations if they want to, and I think Russia will tell its people that Ukraine has tried to poison Abramovich.She believes that ultimately, Putin’s miscalculation in invading Ukraine could have profound consequences for him. “Russia could break up it’s such a huge country that it’s a nightmare to govern, as history has shown.”As for the war, she is concerned that Putin could use battlefield nuclear weapons, but thinks he would not risk all-out nuclear war because “he doesn’t look like a kamikaze he likes his money and his yachts too much”.Even if Putin were to give the order to use tactical nuclear weapons, Marina still has enough faith in the country of her birth to believe his soldiers would refuse to carry out their orders.“My husband refused to carry out orders to kill people,” she says. “I still believe Russia has heroes.”More from News\u0026#39Chilling effect\u0026#39 of China crackdown and Covid measures prompts record brain drain in Hong KongRussia-Ukraine latest news: Russians ‘mining bodies and homes’ around Kyiv as they retreatDame Cressida Dick: Met Police Commissioner to leave her post next weekCovid vaccinations open for five to 11-year-olds in EnglandRamadan 2022: Fasting, prayer and how Muslims celebrate the revelation of the KoranMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"covid vaccinations open five 11 year olds england","story":"Bookings opened on Saturday for children aged five to 11 in England to receive a Covid-19 vaccine.Children will be offered two doses of the PfizerBioNTech vaccine, at least 12 weeks apart, at a third of the normal strength.Parents and carers can arrange appointments for Monday onwards through the NHS vaccines website or by calling 119 from 7am on Saturday morning. NHS England said hundreds of sites will offer jabs from Monday, with more coming on stream throughout the week.Some five million children are eligible for the jab, following on from the success of the campaign to vaccinate vulnerable youngsters with health conditions.Most new appointments will be at local vaccination centres or community pharmacies outside of school hours, and there will be walk-in clinics available, with timings on the NHS Grab a Jab website.NHS England said more appointments will be added throughout the week so anyone unable to get a convenient slot should keep trying.The development comes as a record 4.9 million people in the UK were estimated to have had the virus in the week ending March 26, according to the Office for National Statistics - up from 4.3 million the week before. The surge in Covid cases also came as free tests ended for most people in England on Friday.The ONS figures revealed that Covid infections among people aged 35 and over in England have reached record levels, with notable increases in the oldest groups. Prevalence of Covid is higher among these groups than at any point since ONS estimates began in spring 2020.Prevalence of the virus among the over-70s has been at an all-time high for several weeks, and climbed again to 6.6 per cent, or one in 15 people, in the seven days to March 26. Meanwhile, infections among 50 to 69-year-olds hit a record high for the second week in a row and stand at 7.2 per cent, the equivalent of one in 14 people.An estimated eight per cent of people aged 35 to 49 were also likely to have had the virus last week, or around one in 13.However, prevalence among all age groups remains highest for children between the age two and school year 6, with one in 11 likely to have had Covid-19 last week.Calum Semple, professor of child health and outbreak medicine at the University of Liverpool, told Sky News: This is now a vaccine-preventable disease and the vaccine is safer than the disease.It\u0027s a very unpleasant illness for children. And if they have a weakened immune system or if they live in a family where a member has a weakened immune system, the consequences can be devastating. So yes I am pleased.Prof Semple, who advises the Government as part of Sage, said the vaccine will reduce days lost from education.Dr Nikki Kanani, a GP and the deputy lead for the NHS Covid-19 Vaccination Programme, said: From today, parents of almost five million five to 11-year-olds can book their little ones in for a vaccine, ensuring they get their first dose of protection and helping to protect against potential future waves of Covid-19.Vaccines remain the best defence we have against the virus - my 13-year-old son has had his two vaccinations and I\u0027ll be booking my 10-year-old daughter in for hers at the earliest opportunity, and would encourage all parents to read the NHS information available and consider doing the same.Sajid Javid, the Health Secretary, said: From Monday, the NHS will be rolling out the non-urgent offer for Covid vaccines for all children aged five to 11 in England.Parents, if they want, can take up the offer for their children to increase protection against Covid as we learn to live with this virus.Children without underlying health conditions are at low risk of serious illness from Covid and the priority remains for the NHS to offer vaccines and spring boosters to adults and vulnerable young people, as well as to catch up with other childhood immunisation programmes.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Russians ‘mining bodies and homes’ around Kyiv as they retreatDame Cressida Dick: Met Police Commissioner to leave her post next weekRamadan 2022: Fasting, prayer and how Muslims celebrate the revelation of the KoranFrench election 2022 poll tracker: Emmanuel Macron\u0026#39s lead dwindles as Marine Le Pen mounts comebackFrench presidential election 2022: When is it, how does it work and who are the candidates?More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"net zero conspiracy against british voters","story":"The law has never looked like more of an ass than in the decision by a court to issue an interim driving disqualification to a mother who used her Range Rover gently to nudge Insulate Britain protesters who were blocking the road.Sherrilyn Speid, 35, of Grays, Essex, pleaded guilty to a charge of dangerous driving when she appeared at Southend Magistrates’ Court on Monday.She had been on her way to drop her child off at school when she came across an Insulate Britain protest near the M25 last October at about 8.30am.Two members of the group, wearing high-vis jackets, were seen sitting in front of her vehicle while another stood in front of it, holding on to the bonnet.The scene was caught on camera by a passer-by and heavily bleeped footage was shown in court in which Ms Speid shouted: “Move out the way.

But it is in the shadow, appropriately, of the Suffolk town’s great Norman Tower, in one of these handsome houses that another great Norman has chosen to spend his retirement after stepping down from the House of Lords last month: Lord Tebbit, the Chingford Skinhead, the ‘semi-house-trained polecat’, the man who told the unemployed to get on their bikes, the Tory who was more Thatcherite than Mrs Thatcher herself.Tebbit and I have been friends for so long that I can’t recall when I first met him: it was, I think, just before the 1987 general election, when he had returned to be chairman of the Conservative Party after recovering from the devastating injuries he sustained in the IRA’s attack on the Grand Hotel in Brighton in 1984, during the party conference. The footage of him and his wife Margaret being pulled from the rubble early on that eerily still October morning still has the power to shock not only had the Tebbits nearly been killed, but Margaret’s injuries were so severe that she spent the remaining 36 years of her life in a wheelchair. In all the years I have known Tebbit we have never discussed this life-changing moment, so it is somewhat surreal to hear him today, at 91 – spare figure stooped with age, neatly dressed in a pullover and tie, brilliantined hair white – recollecting such a dramatic event from the serenity of his drawing room. ‘The bombing did make an enormous difference to me,’ he recalls with trademark understatement. ‘Margaret and I had gone to bed. I’d not really wanted to stay on that Thursday night – I just wanted to get home – but I thought it might look a bit untidy on the platform if I wasn’t there. We were woken by the explosion – it was not a big bomb, but big enough to destabilise the big brick chimney, which collapsed. Margaret and I were injured, bleeding, tangled up, and I doubted whether we were going to survive.’‘We were semi-conscious, Margaret and I: there are those famous pictures of me being dug out. A bloke in the back of the ambulance with me, as they took me to hospital, remembers saying to me before he gave me a painkilling injection, “Are you allergic to anything?” and I replied, “Oh yes, bombs.”’Tebbit cracks jokes whenever he can. But as he rattles around his big house, there is a sadness about him that suggests life’s heavy toll sometimes catches up. He was widowed just before Christmas 2020 he and Margaret had been married for 64 years, and their loyalty to one another was fierce. When we speak of Margaret’s death he remains stoical, but the pain is still evident. ‘It was pretty devastating,’ he says. ‘I woke in the night, put my hand out to her and found she was cold, and that she was dead, and that was quite awful.’ The pair met in 1955 when he was a young pilot in the Royal Auxiliary Air Force (RAuxAF) and she a nurse. Young Tebbit had originally, at 16, gone to work at the Financial Times, where, with the help of his school, Edmonton Grammar, he had landed a job putting together the share prices page. ‘The great objective was to see if one could get through an obscene sub-heading for a paragraph,’ Tebbit recalls with a chuckle. ‘All the successes were posted on the wall. Phillips’ rubber soles were very useful in that respect.’ After a national service stint in the RAF, however, the appeal of rude headlines had waned. ‘I got bored,’ he admits. He went off to sell advertising, but kept his hand in as a pilot in the RAuxAF, joining 604 County of Middlesex Squadron. ‘I entered another new world – my flight commander was a partner in a leading firm of solicitors, the CO was a Lloyd’s underwriter. I then began to grow up.’ Not that his childhood until that time had been without event. Tebbit grew up on the borders of Enfield and Edmonton, where Hertfordshire and Essex meet. His father had fought on the Western Front in the First World War, and the post-traumatic stress, or shell shock as it was then, meant that ‘the rest of his life was just useless. He couldn’t cope with anything, really.’ It was his mother, the daughter of a butcher, ‘a very tough lady’, who ‘managed everything. In 1926, at the heart of the general strike she was delivering meat to customers in a pony and trap when a picket line tried to stop her. She simply whipped the pony first and, as they rode through the line, whipped the pickets too.’ Tebbit was eight when war broke out. ‘Probably my most powerful early memory was being at home with my parents and hearing Mr Chamberlain in 1939 say that Herr Hitler had not responded to his ultimatum, and therefore we were at war. And I remember rushing to the window and looking out to see if things looked any different. ‘At the beginning of the war, my brother, who’s three years older than me, and I were evacuated to South Wales. It was so heavily bombed we were brought back home.’ But there was bombing there too: ‘We had a lot of air raids and had to use an outdoor Anderson shelter, which was bloody awful. ‘Towards the end of the war, during the flying bomb raids, my parents were in the shelter and my older brother and I were sitting outside when we heard a doodlebug. When the engine cut, if you didn’t hear it coming down it was going to be pretty close. Well, when it came down, the door flew open, and several houses on the other side of the road were destroyed.’His father’s experiences were what made him choose the RAF for his national service. ‘I didn’t want to risk what my father had gone through. Remembering that we had nearly lost the Battle of Britain, not because we were running out of aircraft, but because we were running out of pilots, I volunteered – I had been highly impressed by the Battle as a child. I got my wings, and started flying Meteor fighters.’ His subsequent return to the RAuxAF sounds idyllic. ‘Somebody once asked me what I did with my childhood. I replied, “I delayed it.” My childhood was spent growing up in 604 Squadron.’As he talks about those days it is clear that it was the camaraderie, and the chance to meet people outside his normal suburban circles, that he found the most appealing. Not least because it also led him to Margaret. He was not entirely oblivious to the opposite sex, thanks to his time at school. ‘It was unusual for those days in that it was a mixed school. There were these girl things, which was interesting because I hadn’t got any sisters, and so one talked to girls.’ Margaret was the daughter of a tenant farmer from Cambridgeshire. They married six months after they met, in 1956, at which point Tebbit decided to put his practical skills to better use in order to fund their married life. He took a job with BOAC, flying mostly on routes to Africa, the Far East and down to Australia. Although he had landed an enviable job, the strains on family life were soon apparent once their first son, John, was born in 1958. Like many pilots, Tebbit found he was rostered to be away on special family occasions, and this became more apparent after their daughter Alison was born two years later William, their third child, was born in 1965. By that stage Tebbit had taken the initiative. ‘I noticed many pilots would simply call in sick when they wanted to be at home, which was causing chaos. I suggested that we be allowed to take control of our own rosters. We did, and it worked: absenteeism dropped like a stone. It was a lesson for my life in politics – always look at the roots of a problem and not just its symptoms if you want to solve it.’Despite this, life with three small children took its toll. After William was born, Margaret suffered from postnatal depression and ended up in hospital, leaving Tebbit in charge of a seven-year-old, a toddler and a newborn. ‘I managed.’ It would not be the last time he would do so. A ll his life Tebbit had been influenced by his upbringing, by a clear understanding of the link between effort and reward, and by the importance of seizing opportunities when they presented themselves. Even before his national service, he became a Young Conservative, because, ‘I realised I was not a statist.’ This was during the period when the Attlee administration, which had ruled since Labour’s landslide victory in 1945, had started to nationalise industries it considered strategically important and to provide cradle-to-grave welfarism. Tebbit had been forced to join a print union when he worked at the FT, and it had given him a loathing of the power of the closed shop. Everything in his upbringing – not least the self-reliance of his parents – had taught him that it was the growth of the inidual, and not of the state or of collectives, that was the key to a successful future. However, during the 1950s and 1960s, the leadership of the Conservative Party did not always think like Norman Tebbit.The parliamentary party had, though, ceased to be the preserve of the privileged classes, exemplified by Ted Heath – from a similar background to Tebbit – becoming leader in 1965. Tebbit, as a party activist in Hertfordshire, disapproved of Heath’s consensual policies, and increasingly in the late 1960s of his management of the party. In a fit of frustration, he wrote a letter of protest to Iain Macleod, a leading member of the shadow cabinet and former party chairman on whose judgment Heath relied heavily. Years earlier, Tebbit had been on the selection committee at Enfield that had chosen Macleod. ‘I wrote to him, presuming on our acquaintance, telling him what was wrong, and what should be done to put it right – I was a young man and so knew all these things! He replied that, if I thought things were wrong and I knew how to put it right, why didn’t I go and help them do it? And I remember saying to my wife, “I bloody well will.”’This was quite a leap from being an airline pilot, but Tebbit had acquired a taste for wider political involvement at a time when his party wanted people such as him – self-made men and women who could relate to an electorate increasingly full of voters with a similar background. Once he had made his decision, Tebbit threw himself into the process of trying to become an MP.‘I knew I had to fight a hopeless seat, do well, and then get a safe Tory seat. I decided the place for me was Epping, which included Harlow New Town, which was a rather Corbynista place,’ he observes. ‘Ninety per cent of the housing was owned by the New Town Commission or the council, and the Labour Party went round at election time to help people put their posters up – or rather, to tell them they were going to put their posters up.‘I think their majority was seven or eight thousand. We fought a good campaign: Stan Newens, my Labour opponent, was very indignant about my first piece of election literature. It was a picture of me standing beside a civil aircraft in my uniform, and it said: “Why does a man with one of the best jobs in Britain want to do something else?” The only place where the word “Conservative” was mentioned was in the imprint at the bottom.’The contest was tight. ‘On the night of the count it became obvious it was close. A recount was called, and I was duly elected: which was not the plan at all. I woke up the next morning in bed in a hotel in Epping and said to my wife, “Oh Christ, what have I done now?”‘She was very supportive, but was a bit shattered about it too. It meant a complete change in our life. She had to go back to nursing to help make ends meet.’The Tory party of the early 1970s was a turbulent place. ‘It was soon quite clear that Heath was making a balls of it. And Airey Neave took me to one side to ask me who I thought would make a better leader. I said, “I don’t know enough.” He replied, “You’d better come and talk to Margaret Thatcher,” whom I’d never spoken to before.‘Having met her, I agreed that she was the one. We had quite a long conversation. What struck me about her was that she was the daughter of a lower-middle-class shopkeeper in middle England. She was a qualified scientist and had worked as one. She was a Christian and she had a powerful intellect. You could guess where she was going to go.’Since he has mentioned Christianity, it occurs to me that there is another conversation we have never had in all these years, but which, given all he has been through, might be relevant. ‘Do you consider yourself a religious man, Norman?’He looks especially contemplative. ‘I started off as an atheist and slid across to being an agnostic: I felt that one couldn’t be certain whether God existed, but I thought it would be rather a good idea if He did, and took more of an interest in our affairs. I have gradually slid to being on the believer edge, so I am an occasional attendee at the cathedral here.’As for whether particular experience of the bomb had affected his view of God, he says, ‘No, I don’t think so. I remember coming round in hospital and finding a nurse sitting next to me. She told me what had happened. I’d suffered a hell of a lot of injuries – broken collar bone, several broken ribs, some had penetrated my chest cavity and my lungs, several vertebrae though not, thank God, my spinal cord, the top of my left hip, and all sorts of bits and pieces.’He was moved to Stoke Mandeville to be with Margaret, who was in the spinal injuries unit there. He was made to eat all he could to build up his body tissue. ‘The doctor said to me, “It’s bloody awful food, so to assist you I’ll send you in a case of red wine, which you can keep under the bed.” It was the health service at its best.’Severe though his injuries were, they did not compare with his wife’s. ‘I realised that she was very badly injured right from the beginning. It was clear that she was never going to walk again.’ It was six months before he could return to work, so he ran his department, with the help of officials, from his hospital bed. Considering the extent of Margaret’s handicap, did he consider leaving public life at once?‘No. That would have been to give the IRA another victory… The only occasion when I was ever cheered from all sides of the House was when I came back in after the hospital to take my seat.’ At the time of the bomb, Tebbit was Secretary of State for Trade, running the Thatcher programme of privatisation. He was seen as a natural successor to her: he had already become ‘the Chingford Skinhead’ – a coinage believed to have been made by Private Eye and, thanks to Michael Foot, also a ‘semi-house-trained polecat’. Did he mind? ‘No. Not really. It made me laugh. I remember calling Foot a fascist. He was upset about that. He was even more upset the next day when a newspaper said, “Tebbit was right: Foot is a fascist.”’He declined to serve, however, in the cabinet after the 1987 election. ‘It was because of my need to earn more money to look after Margaret.’Above his desk there is a photograph of Tebbit, sleek and dashing in white tie and tails, looking tenderly at Margaret as she dabs her eyes. It was taken when she went out in public for the first time after the bomb, at a smart City dinner. One only needed a few moments with Margaret to gauge the extent of her heroism, but Tebbit’s, in overcoming the attempt to murder both of them and then devoting much of the rest of his life to caring for her, is no less immense. The bombing remained with him. A couple of years ago, he finally gave up game shooting: I used to see him twice every season at a pheasant shoot in Norfolk where his Danish son-in-law Paul was the estate manager. I can testify to his accuracy – and he was rumoured to mutter ‘Adams’ or ‘McGuinness’ every time he pulled the trigger.   ‘I was once asked what would I do if I bumped into Adams and McGuinness. I said that as long as I was driving a heavy truck when I bumped into them I would laugh. The IRA were the great beneficiaries of the Good Friday Agreement. They were all given get-out-of-jail-free cards by Blair, while they continue to prosecute the soldiers who were trying to protect people against the IRA: monstrous, absolutely monstrous.’He thinks public life has changed ‘for the worse’ in his half-century in Parliament. ‘There have always been bounders of one kind or another. But now I think there are far more people who have gone into politics with the aim of getting into a job in government, and they have on the whole been rather poor material. There are one or two who’ve got ability and integrity. I think the leader of those is the Chancellor. But I think you could make a better cabinet, a smaller cabinet, and a cabinet principally of people who had not been career politicians all their lives.’So what now for Tebbit the polecat? Now that he has retired, will he slide gracefully into the sunset? He has full-time carers and he is close to his children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren. Tebbit family values remain cast-iron, and all three of his children provide a serious support group for him.He feels comfortable in Bury, and plans to spend the rest of his days there. ‘After Margaret died I thought whether I should sell this place, and go and live in sheltered accommodation.

Brits are being clobbered by the biggest rise in household energy bills in living memory with a % hike to the energy price cap from April . Households on default tarfs who pay by direct debit will see an eye-watering £ annual rise to their bills, from £, to £,. There will be an even bigger jump for prepayment customers of £, from £, to £,. The Chancellor unveiled a package of help for families, including a £ council tax rebate in April and a £ energy bill discount in the autumn, which will be clawed back in instalments over  years from .But the measures were slammed at the time for being too stingy. MPs have raised alarm that people could miss out on council tax rebate or see payments delayed due to loopholes in the system.In a letter to Cabinet Minister Michael Gove this week, Levelling Up Committee chairman Clive Betts said: The Government needs to get a grip on the operation of the council tax rebate and give clear guidance to councils so that this rebate is delivered to households reliably and effectively.If the Chancellor is minded to bring forward additional support to households through the council tax system later in the year then it is even more crucial that every effort is made to create a process that works now. How does it work  People living in homes in council tax bands A to D in England will be eligible for the £ payment. It must be your sole or main home to qualy, so second homes and empty properties are not eligible.  Local authorities will deliver the rebate, with eligibility determined on your situation on April  .You can check which council tax band your home is in on the government website. Councils have also been given a £ million discretionary fund to use in areas of high deprivation or for people outside the eligibility criteria. . People need to be signed up to direct debit Payments will be made automatically to people who pay their council tax by direct debit, meaning local authorities already have their bank details. Councils have been told to contact people who do not pay their bills this way to make sure they donapost miss out. But fears have been raised that this could mean delays to payments for people not on direct debit schemes. Our Cost of Living team of experts are here to help YOU through a very dficult year.

The Levelling Up Committee has been pressing ministers for estimates of how many households are in this category. Figures sourced by the Local Democracy Reporting Service last month found that , households in County Durham and Northumberland did not pay council tax by direct debit. The overall figure is expected to be much higher. The Government has ordered local authorities to ensure people get their rebate by September   - months after it was initially supposed to be received. . People should have a current account Another concern is people who donapost have a current account, which has been estimated to be around ,. The Government states where the recipient has no bank account, for example Post Office Payout vouchers. But the committee said it wasnapost clear how this would work and asked whether councils could hand out cash payments.  . Pensioners could miss out for living in aposwrong kind of homesapos Age UK has warned that millions of older people will miss out as they live in the wrong kind of homes - despite struggling with financial hardship. The charity estimates there are .m households in England that will not be eligible for the Council Tax rebate because they live in properties with Council Tax band E to H, among whom halfinclude at least one person aged +. Older people often live in homes that are dficult and expensive to heat, leaving them at greater risk of developing health complications because of the cold.. Payment could go to landlords rather than tenants MPs are concerned that landlords could receive the payments and not pass them onto their tenants.

Energy bills are soaring by around % today National Insurance is going up on Wednesday and inflation is soaring.Chancellor Rishi Sunak last week unveiled cuts to fuel duty and tweaks to National Insurance in his Spring Statement - but neither will help the poorest part-time workers who donapost have a car. And he unveiled just £m of extra support for benefit claimants in distress, at the same time as inflation wipes out £bn of benefitsapos value this year. Labour leader Keir Starmer said today: The Government really needed to step up in its Spring Statement last week.They failed to do so and their response is frankly pathetic on a very, very dficult day for millions of people.  Energy bills are going up far more than weaposve ever seen on record. People are really struggling and I just donapost think the Government gets it. Policing Minister Kit Malthouse today insisted Chancellor Rishi Sunak could act again, but warned the UK had “huge debt” and it would only happen “ the economy allows”. He said: “He is monitoring it on a daily basis,he needs to move further in the future,the economy allows us to do that, don’t forget we’re carrying huge debts at the moment, then I know he’ll look very seriously at doing so.” Hereaposs a breakdown of some of the biggest bill rises coming that have demanded political intervention. And we look at what intervention -any - was offered to help.Energy bills riseDATE: April  WHATaposS HAPPENING:The energy price cap has risen to a record £,-a-year for a typical household. Around million Brits on iable tarfs have been hit with a £ rise to the average annual bill overnight on April .A second hike that could be just as big or even worse is expected on October . WHAT SUNAK ANNOUNCED:Rishi Sunak previously announced plans to help, which include people living in bands A to D getting £ discount on their council tax in England, and a £ repayable rebate off energy bills in October.But he announced no new cash help in the Spring Statement - despite speculation he was going to raise the £ or delay the date to start repaying it beyond April . Council tax riseDATE: April  WHATaposS HAPPENING:Englandaposs average Band D council tax bill has gone up by £ to nearly £, a year. Official figures show the .% hike - despite Tory ministers insisting most rises would be capped at % - will bring Englandaposs average bill for a Band D home to £,.Now of course, most people’s council tax will be lower than last year due to the £ discount for Band A-D homes in England. But there are two big catches. First, that £ is meant to pay for energy bills - not absorbing the cost of a tax rise. In Rutland a Band D bill will go up by £, wiping out much of the £ discount. Second, the £ is a one-off. Next Spring, you’ll suddenly feel the force of not just this year’s rise but also the April  rise at the same time.WHAT SUNAK ANNOUNCED:The Chancellor announced no changes to the council tax bills and no increase to the £. Councils were given another £million to help the hardest-up families via the Household Support Fund - doubling it to £bn. But this is dwarfed by inflation wiping out £bn of the value of benefits. Search for your council tax rise by postcode by following the link below. Real terms cuts to pay - including for NHS and teachersDATE: April  WHATaposS HAPPENING:Inflation tipped to peak near % means planned rises to public sector wages - which are due every April and backdated - will be wiped out by rising prices.Ministers have already spelt out plans to raise salaries for experienced teachers by only % in  . Health unions have also blasted plans to offer NHS staff in England a “miserly” % hike. The Royal College of Nursing is demanding % above inflation.And civil service organisations can make average pay awards up to just %, with a further % to be targeted at specic priorities. WHAT SUNAK ANNOUNCED:The Chancellor announced no extra cash for public sector wage rises. They are already having to be funded out of departmentsapos existing budgets - those did not rise in the Spring Statement.Royal College of Nursing General Secretary Pat Cullen said: “The cost-of-living crisis means some are having to choose between filling up their cars and feeding their children. [Spring Statement] fuel measures are not enough to stop nursing staff subsidising the NHS when they fill up their car.  VAT s to % in pubs and restaurantsDATE: April  WHATaposS HAPPENING:From today VAT s to % in pubs and restaurants, and other hospitality venues - inevitably raising the prices for punters while inflation is already raging.The VAT rate had been cut due to the Covid pandemic and despite the cost of living squeeze, itaposs ing to the full rate as planned. WHAT SUNAK ANNOUNCED: Rishi Sunak announced nothing to stop the VAT hike. UKHospitality Chief Executive Kate Nicholls said: “Locking in VAT at .% would have given hospitality businesses a major boost, and helped the sector in its ambition to lead the UK back to post-Covid prosperity.As it is, thousands of jobs could be lost, the UK will remain uncompetitive versus international rivals, and already hard-pressed consumers in the midst of a cost-of-living crisis will see price rises in their favourite pubs, bars and restaurants, further fuelling inflation. A real-terms cut to Universal Credit housing supportDATE: April  WHATaposS HAPPENING:At the start of the Covid pandemic, aposLocal Housing Allowanceapos - the amount of Universal Credit you get to cover your rent - was raised to match the cheapest % of rents in your local area.But this has been frozen in cash terms since then and has been frozen again for a year from April . The National Residential Landlords Association said the freeze while inflation soars was simply absurd and will exacerbate the already serious cost-of-living crisis.WHAT SUNAK ANNOUNCED:No change.A real-terms cut to childcare helpDATE: NOW WHATaposS HAPPENING:Poor parents will be hit hard by this monthaposs cost-of-living crisis as Tory ministers refuse to raise a crucial childcare allowance - despite soaring inflation.Parents on Universal Credit can claim back % of childcare costs, but only up to a £.-a-month cap - which has not changed since  and is not rising in April.WHAT SUNAK ANNOUNCED:You now the message by now - there was no change to this. Nor was there help for the childcare sector or schools more generally, beyond what was announced in the Autumn.Paul Whiteman, general secretary of school leaders’ union NAHT, said: “Like every household and business, schools are facing crippling rises in energy costs, to be funded from already stretched budgets.” InflationDATE: NOW WHATaposS HAPPENING:UK CPI inflation hit .% in February. The Budget watchdog now says itaposll rocket to an average of .% this year - and could peak at nearly % thanks to the Ukraine-Russia war.That -year high will mean the pound in your pocket buys you less in bread or fuel, and tightens business margins to the point firms could go bust. It means real household disposable income set to fall .% this year - the biggest since records began in .WHAT SUNAK ANNOUNCED:The Chancellor cut fuel duty, raised National Insurance thresholds and increased a Household Support Fund in what the Treasury claimed was £.bn of help. But it wonapost help the poorestand he admitted he canapost stop the tide of inflation. Mr Sunak said: “The OBR have not accounted for the full impacts go the war in Ukraine and we should be prepared for the economy and public finances to worsen - potentially signicantly”.The IFS think tank warned even with everything put together, a middle earner on £, can still expect to be £ worse off this year than last year.  Interest ratesDATE: NOW WHATaposS HAPPENING:Last month the Bank of England increased interest rates to .%, despite warnings it would “crush” households already drowning in the cost of living crisis.The Bank took the move to slow the economy down and cool soaring inflation . Governor Andrew Bailey recently appealed to workers not to ask for big pay rises, as that fuels inflation further. But it will mean new mortgage rates become more expensive, and inflicts an overnight rise to monthly payments for people on standard iable rates. WHAT SUNAK ANNOUNCED:The Chancellor had his hands tied on this one as interest rates are decided independently by the Bank of England.There was no new help for homeowners in the Spring Statement, apart from knocking the % VAT off green home improvements like solar , insulation and heat pumps. Meanwhile the Bank rate rise has knocked £bn off the public finances by making borrowing more expensive, wiping out the National Insurance rise in one fell swoop. Petrol pricesDATE: NOW WHATaposS HAPPENING:Petrol prices have hit record highs due to Russia ’s war in Ukraine. The average price of petrol reached .p a litre while diesel rose to .p a litre Sunday before last.A month earlier they averaged .p and .p a litre respectively. A family car with a typical -litre tank is now paying £.p to fill up compared to £. a year earlier. WHAT SUNAK ANNOUNCED:Fuel duty was cut by p a litre in the Spring Statement last week, until March .The Chancellor said it was the biggest cut ever and the Treasury boasted the fuel duty cut, along with a freeze already planned, will save the average van driver around £ this year - or £, for the average haulier. But it will still only knock around £ off a -litre tank for a family car. The Resolution Foundation said it will save the typical driving households £ a year, but evenpassed on in full by garages, it will only reverse % of the increase in pump prices over the past year.  National Insurance riseDATE: April  WHATaposS HAPPENING: A £bn rise in National Insurance will hit working people as the Treasury looks to cut Covid backlogs in the NHS and begin funding social care.Employees will pay .p more in the pound on earnings above the threshold, a rise from % to .%.WHAT SUNAK ANNOUNCED:Mr Sunak raised the threshold at which workers start paying National Insurance by £, to £, - claiming itaposd save Brits up to £ a year.Of all the cost of living rises facing Brits this is the one Rishi Sunak came closest to sorting out. But this doesnapost factor in a . percentage point rise in the same tax . This will cut into the £ saving, and outstrip it entirely for anyone earning over £, a year.Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves accused Rishi Sunak of “making an historic mistake” by failing to scrap a tax hike on jobs, warning families will “endure signicant hardship”. Officials are also confident that inflation is so high, there will still be more National Insurance coming in overall - despite thresholds being raised.Income tax ‘stealth tax’DATE: April  WHATaposS HAPPENING:Rishi Sunak chose to freeze income tax thresholds at a time when inflation is climbing at frightening speed. Youaposll have to carry on paying % on earnings over £,, and % on earnings over £, - just like this year.According to the Commons library, more than a million more people will be paying a higher rate of income tax by . The IFS think tank now warns it’s a £.bn ‘stealth tax’, two and a half times bigger than first thought. WHAT SUNAK ANNOUNCED:Rishi Sunak announced no changes to the thresholds despite a campaign to do so. The National Insurance thresholds are more generousbut income tax remain frozen.The IFS said as a result, almost all workers will be paying more tax on their earnings in  than they would have been - even when the tax cuts are taken into account. Student loans aposstealth taxaposDATE: April  WHATaposS HAPPENING:Millions will be forced to pay more on their student loans under what has been branded a “stealth tax rise”. Student loan repayment thresholds will be frozen from April  after plans to raise them by .% were scrapped.The respected Institute for Fiscal Studies warned the freeze will cost £k earners £ a year more than they expected. It gets worse further in the future. Students starting university next year will begin paying off their loans when they earn more than £, - down from the existing £,-a-year threshold. And theof time to repay their debt will be extended to  years, up from . The IFS said this will leave poorer graduates paying £, more over their letimes.WHAT SUNAK ANNOUNCED:Nothing for the student finance system or graduates repaying loans. Quite the contrary - the small print of Budget forecasts shows the long-term changes to the student loan system will net tens of billions for the Chancellor.It will save the public finances £.bn in   and an average of £.bn a year over the following years.  Massive real-terms cut to welfare benefitsDATE: April  WHATaposS HAPPENING:Benefits will rise by .%, as little as £. a month on the rate of Universal Credit.Tory MPs pushed through the plans earlier this year - saying it was in line with inflation. But inflation has since doubled to .%. This will severely exacerbate the cost-of-living crisis for those who are struggling the most, with food bank use soaring as food prices in the supermarket rise by a predicted %.WHAT SUNAK ANNOUNCED:The Chancellor announced no changes to benefits despite speculation he could tweak work allowances in Universal Credit.His allies claimed he didnapost need to act again after raising work allowances and cutting the taper rate in the last Budget. But these measures only help people in work - as do most of the measures announced last week, too. Once again, those who cannot work due to sickness or other reasons are left behind. Pensions are being cut in real terms - before rising next yearDATE: April  WHATaposS HAPPENING:Pensions could rise by more than % next April after the Tory DWP chief promised to bring back the triple lock - despite soaring inflation.Therese Coffey suspended the triple lock - a solemn manesto pledge - for one year in   because post-Covid wages were bouncing back in an “anomaly”.That sparked fury as it meant the state pension will rise by only .% next month, less than inflation. That is a real-terms cut of £ to Britain’s million pensioners, Shadow DWP chief Jon Ashworth said.But Ms Coffey said the triple lock wouldin   as promised. That could lead to a rise of .%, experts predict.WHAT SUNAK ANNOUNCED:Like above, Rishi Sunak announced nothing extra to help pensioners.Kate Henderson, Chief Executive of the National Housing Federation said: “The increase in the household support fund and changes to the National Insurance threshold are welcome, but there will still be many families on the lowest incomes who are very anxious about the cost of living, particularly rising energy bills.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Spring StatementPoliticsCost of Living: Were Here to Help\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Tonight the BBC reports the Indian IT company is now trying to find replacement roles abroad for staff employed in Moscow. Mr Sunak has previously rejected allegations his family has been benefiting from Vladimir Putinaposs regime when pressed about his weaposs stake in Infosys.He told Sky News he had nothing to do with that company and said he had absolutely no idea whether Infosys was following the signicant actions put in place in response to the invasion. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here Earlier, Keir Starmer demanded to know whether Mr Sunak’s family was benefiting from cash made in Russia.The Labour leader said: As the Chancelloraposs we is concerned, thereaposs just a fundamental principle, is their household benefiting from money made in Russia when the Government has put in place sanctions  That is in the public interest for us to have an answer to - Iaposm not attacking their family but I do want to knowthe Chancelloraposs household is benefiting from money from a company thataposs investing in Russia when the Government is saying quite rightly that nobody should be doing that.  Earlier this week, Mr Sunak angrily hit out at his we and her family being thrust into the spotlight. “I think itaposs totally fine for people to take shots at me, itaposs fair game - Iaposm the one sitting here and thataposs what I signed up for,” he told BBC Newscast. Itaposs very upsetting and wrong for people to try and come at my we and beyond that actually, with regard to my father-in-law, for whom I have nothing but enormous pride and admiration for everything that heaposs achieved. No amount of attempted smearing is going to make me change that because heaposs wonderful and has achieved a huge amount. “As I said, Iaposm enormously proud. The Chancellor has previously urged business owners to think very carefully about any investments that would in any sense support Putin and his regime as fighting continues across Ukraine. Labour aposs deputy leader Angela Rayner has said Mr Sunakaposs ties to Infosys amount to a conflict of interest, and has demanded Mr Sunak declare his we’s shareholdings in the usual way on the Register of Members’ Interests.She told the Mirror: One minute he is telling British companies to think carefully about investments that in any sense support Putin and his regime - the next we hear his family are making millions from a company operating out of the Russian capital. This company, founded by Sunak’s father-in-law, has been handed millions of pounds of taxpayers’ money in contracts. Rishi Sunak must come clean about whether he is personally benefiting from business in Russia and whether he has declared this conflict of interest to the Permanent Secretary orheaposs been profiting in secret.Despite allegations of hypocrisy, Mr Sunak has insisted he has “followed the ministerial code to the letter” and has previously denied benefitting from doing business in Russia. A spokesperson for the Chancellor told the Mirror Ms Murthy is a minority shareholder in the firm, adding: Neither her nor any member of her family have any involvement in the operational decisions of the company.

Sir Keir said: He told the House no rules were broken in Downing Street during lockdown. The police have now concluded there was widespread criminality. The Ministerial Code says that ministers who knowingly mislead the House should resign. Why is he still here  Boris Johnson scoffed hang on a minute! and accused Keir Starmer of being a human weather vane after the Labour leader stopped short of repeating his call for the PMaposs resignation last week.  The PM said the Met Police - whoaposve warned they could issue more fines beyond the  anonymous ones so far - must “get on with their job” adding: We are going to get on with our job.But Keir Starmer said: There are only two possible explanations.“Either he’s trashing the Ministerial Code, or he’s claiming he was repeatedly lied to by his own advisors and that he didn’t know what was going on in his own house and his own office. “Come off it! “He really does think it’s one rule for him and another rule for everyone  - that he can pass off criminality in his own office and ask others to follow the law.” Labouraposs leader added: When is he going to stop taking the British public for fools  It came after Boris Johnsonaposs deputy today finally admitted  staff broke the law over Covid lockdown parties - after No bizarrely tried to avoid saying they did.Dominic Raab also confirmed ministers like Rishi Sunak will inevitably disclosethey get fined. So far, No has only pledged to name Boris Johnson and Cabinet Secretary Simon Case.Scotland Yard yesterday said it would hand out  fines to people over parties in Downing Street and Whitehall.Yet the PM still appeared to be in denial. Pressed over Mr Johnson’s view, his spokesman said: “It’s for the Met to make that judgment, rather than the Prime Minister.”Today Mr Raab, who is the Justice Secretary and once prosecuted war crimes, accepted the  fined people broke the law saying: Clearly there were breaches of the regulations - that’s the only thing that could warrant the  fixed penalty notices”. Last night Boris Johnson threw a glitzy bash for Tory MPs, hours after the Met confirmed Downing Street lockdown parties had broken the law. The PM hosted around  MPs for dinner at a central London hotel as he attempted to bolster his leadership and draw a line under the Partygate scandal. Politicians were set to dine on salmon tart, chicken thighs and a chocolate praline dessert, washed down with fine wines. Top Tories walked past families who lost loved ones to Covid, who held a candlelit vigil in protest outside Londonaposs Park Plaza hotel and shouted at MPs: Off to another party, are we  One Tory MP, Michael Fabricant, told the waiting media the party would be a lot of fun adding: Itaposs great, we had a photo taken, it was absolutely super. SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford blasted: Last night millions of families will have been desperately trying to figure out how they will possibly afford the £ energy price hike that will hit them this Friday. At the very same time, Tory MPs were gathering across the street for a champagne bash in the Park Plaza. We all know the Tories partied during lockdown and now they’re partying through this cost-of-living emergency. Earlier Keir Starmer blasted the PM and “cynical” Chancellor Rishi Sunak for putting the  Tory re-election campaign over and above helping people pay their bills by promising a p income tax cut. The PM insisted he was still a “tax-cutting Conservative” - but Keir Starmer told Mr Johnson to “cut the nonsense and treat the British people with a bit of respect”. He said the Tories were imposing  tax rises, bringing the tax burden to its highest for  years and for every £ taken in tax rises, £ is given back. “Is that cutting taxes or is it raising taxes ” he mocked. Boris Johnson fumed: “I don’t know where he’s been the last two years…. “Even for Captain Hindsight, to obliterate the biggest pandemic for the last century from his memory, to obliterate the £bn we’ve had to spend… is quite extraordinary.” But Keir Starmer said: “I can only hope that his police questionnaire was bit more convincing than that. This year British people face the worst fall in living standards on record. While they are counting every penny, the Prime Minister is hitting them with higher taxes.“But in  when there just so happens to be a general election, they will introduce a small tax cut. That is not taking dficult decisions, itaposs putting the Tory re-election campaign over and above helping people pay their bills. How did he find a Chancellor as utterly cynical as he is  Prime Minister Boris Johnson replied: What we have is a Chancellor who took the tough decisions to look after the UK economy throughout the pandemic, who protected people up and down the land with £ billion worth of support. And by the way,we had listened to them,we had listened to Captain Hindsight, we would not have come out of lockdown in July last year. We would have stayed in lockdown over Christmas and New Year, with the result that the UK economy would not be growing in the way that it is. And so we would not be able to make the investments that we now are and under Labour we would have to tax more and borrow more and they cannot be trusted with the economy.

But the plans have already been criticised, with unions saying ministers have not gone far enough and the British Ports Association pointing out ports cannot enforce wage rules. Mr Shapps also outlined plans to close minimum wage loopholes and clampdown on fire and rehire practices. He will ask the Insolvency Service to consider disqualying PO chief executive Peter Hebblethwaite from acting as a company director, after the boss brazenly admitted to MPs the firm broke the law by not consulting with unions or notying the government. TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady said: “This plan has gaping holes. It won’t deliver a fair outcome for the  sacked workers, and it won’t stop another PO-style scandal.  “Closing the legal loophole which lets companies pay less than the minimum wage is a start, but we need much more from the Government. “Ministers must do everything they can to ensure PO reinstate staff on their previous pay – a union-negotiated rate that is signicantly higher than the national minimum wage. “That means severing all ties with DP World, including lucrative freeport contracts. “Andministers really want to stop companies firing at will, they must go further than a feeble statutory code and finally deliver the long-promised Employment Bill to boost worker protections. “Without stronger employment legislation, bad bosses will continue to trample over workers’ rights.”  British Ports Association, Richard Ballantyne, added: While itaposs right the government and the ferry industry look to improve employment rules and standards, the expectation that port authorities will need to enforce minimum wage rules in the shipping sector could be unworkable. This will place ports in a dficult legal predicament, especially before any legislation is in place. DP World-owned PO Ferries sacked its crews and replaced them with agency workers on March . The minimum wage in the UK for people aged  and over is £. per hour. Mr Hebblethwaite, whose basic annual salary is £,, told MPs on March  that the average pay of the agency crew is £. per hour, but insisted this was permitted under international maritime laws. Speaking in the Commons, Mr Shapps said: “Where new laws are needed, we will create them. Where legal loopholes are cynically exploited, we will close them. And where employment rights are too weak, we will strengthen them.” Mr Shapps said HM Revenue  Customs will dedicate “signicant resource” to ensure all UK ferry operators are “compliant with the national minimum wage, no s, no buts”.Employers will be prevented from using “ fire and rehire tactics”they fail to make “reasonable efforts to reach agreement through consultation”, the Transport Secretary said.Mr Shapps added of the proposals: “It’ll send a clear message thatyou are using British waters and British ports to ply your trade then you must accept British laws.” Shadow transport secretary Louise Haigh told the Commons that the steps announced by the Government to “insist on the bare minimum cannot come a moment too soon”. PO Ferries has accused the Maritime and Coastguard Agencyof operating with “an unprecedented level of rigour” after it detained two of its ships. European Causeway was held in Larne, Northern Ireland, on Friday, while Pride Of Kent was detained in Dover, Kent, on Monday.  Mick Lynch, general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union, was also unimpressed with the plans, saying: “Despite all the bluster, Grant Shapps has failed to grasp the opportunity to adequately stand up to the banditry behaviour of PO. “The Prime Minister repeatedly said to Parliament that the Government would be taking legal action to save British seafarers’ jobs, but he has failed to keep his word. “This continued lack of action and courage has meant a ferry company owned by the Dubai royal family has been able to break our laws and disrupt our ports and ruin people’s lives with impunity, and we will keep pressing the Government to ensure justice for our members. “What has been announced today is far too little, too late, and we are calling for urgent action for speedier, more radical reforms to save the UK seafarer from oblivion.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON \" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The Virgin Voyages cruise ship Valiant Lady was making itsto its boarding point in Portsmouth following a tour of Spanish and Portuguese ports on the Atlantic when the passenger went missing on Wednesday night .Crew members launched an urgent search and rescue operation, with the cruise lineraposs captain even asking guests to keep a lookout for any sign of the missing man, the Daily Mail reports.After it was discovered the man had gone into the sea, the ship turned around to search for the man. Despite the combined efforts of those on the ship, a spotter plane, a helicopter, and nearby merchant vessels, the rescue operation was suspended hours later. The passenger, believed to be British, is now feared to have drowned. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter hereThe Virgin Voyages cruise ship Valiant Lady hosted performances from s pop icons including Tony Hadley, Toyah, T’Pau, Altered Images, ABCaposs Martin Fry and former Radio  DJs Bruno Brookes and Gary Davies. After the search was suspended, the ship resumed its journey to Portsmouth - finally docking  hours later than planned. According to the Mail, further inquiries onboard show the man appeared to deliberately jump over the side of the ship, though no CCTV footage has yet been made available.  Passengers paid up to £, for the cruise - aimed at a demographic of young at heart adults and kitted out with restaurants, bars and a nightclub. But the trip was blighted by several incidents throughout its voyage, including one destination being dropped from the itinerary altogether. At one point, a passenger became gravely ill and had to be air-lted off the ship by helicopter. Passengers have also claimed there were multiple covid infections, leading to staff creating an area for those who had tested positive to isolate in. Another guest said: Everyone among the passengers is devastated by what’s happened - it’s just horrible to think that a fellow passenger has probably died.  A Virgin Voyages spokesman said: In the early hours of the morning, we were informed of a man overboard incident involving a Sailor [passenger], which resulted in a search and rescue mission. Weaposre deeply saddened by this news and our thoughts are with this Sailor’s family and loved ones. Our investigation indicates that this was an intentional act and that no foul play is suspected. A Maritime and Coastguard spokesperson said: Since .am yesterday HM Coastguard was coordinating a search for a man overboard from the Valiant Lady cruise ship in the Bay of Biscay, with the assistance of our counterparts in Spain and France. The French sent a fixed-wing aircraft to provide air support to a helicopter sent by Spain to conduct a search. Two merchant vessels and the cruise ship were also assisting.

Environmental policy consultant Mavourneen Conway, , from Norfolk, UK, and husband Chris first tried their hands at home renovation when they added an extension onto their first house several years ago. With three boys - Ciaran, , Liam, , and Owen,  - the couple decided to find somewhere with more space for them to grow up, so purchased a five-bedroom Georgian farmhouse in March . Rolling up their sleeves, the family got to work on creating their dream home, with most furniture thrted and upcycled.  My husband grew up in a family whereyou could do it yourself, you gave it a go, said Mavourneen. His approach has certainly rubbed off on me. Building the extension to our first house taught us both a lot of skills and gave us a lot of confidence to try things. Our kids have also gotten stuck into lots of our DIY projects so hopefully theyaposll do the same when they grow up.  Iaposve always loved being creative, and DIY has given me a great outlet. Itaposs so satisfying being able to learn something new and make something yourself. With all the information available online, thereaposs a tutorial for pretty much anything which makes it so much easier to try doing things yourself.Mavourneen has developed a love for DIY, and is passionate about finding pieces second hand that she can upcycle. My first DIY project in our new home was turning a coffee table I found second hand into an ottoman, she said. Iaposd never upholstered anything before so that was a learning curve. Now Iaposve got six dining chairs Iaposve found that all need upholstering too. I also did my first bit of DIY art recently and Iaposm excited to do more of that.  Iaposd love to get into carpentry and building things from scratch so Iaposve got a couple of projects that Iaposm thinking about to give that a go. Some of Mavourneenaposs other upcycling projects include giving a makeover to a piano she found for free, which her son is now learning to play, creating a vanity unit from a £ chest of drawers she got second-hand, and creating a lampshade out of an old cat bed. I love our new DIY vanity unit, but our oversized ottoman will always be a special project as it was my first time upholstering anything, said Mavourneen.  Over Christmas I loved doing a DIY hanging wreath, and the boys and I made some oversized outdoor light baubles by using wire flower baskets tied together and wrapped in fairy lights. Iaposm hoping to be able to use them in the garden this year as they had such an impact. With a love for DIY, Mavourneen and her family have been keeping down costs as they renovate the home. The cheapest transformation by far has been the bathroom, which only cost us about £ to do, she said.  There is such a huge list of other priorities, and the fixtures and fittings in the bathroom were generally sound so we had to work around what we had.We made a new vanity unit out of a chest of drawers I found on Facebook marketplace. We used a lot of items we already had and just repurposed them, including the vintage light fittings and the vintage mirror.We found a vintage cast iron radiator second hand for £ which my husband installed.  We also made some peg shelves to go around the bath which cost £, and decided to seal and paint the wooden floorboards to save on flooring. In terms of the other rooms, the new kitchen was the biggest expense, costing £,, as we had to start from scratch. We had to open up and reinstate a fireplace, as well as replace all the units and worktops. However we saved the old units and turned them into a utility room in the cellar. We also kept and repaired the  year old vintage La canche range cooker that had been left behind by the previous owners.  We saved money by sanding and refinishing the old parquet floor ourselves. Weaposve also kept and painted the dining table that we were left from the first property we rented  years ago instead of buying a new one and Iaposve bought second hand dining chairs which Iaposm currently refinishing. Our light fitting is actually an old woven cat basket that I found in a charity shop that weaposve turned into an oversized pendant light over the dining table. I think my style is still evolving, and has certainly changed a bit to suit the kind of property we now live in. Thereaposs so much inspiration out there now that itaposs almost impossible not to keep adapting and refining your style.Iaposd say my style is a mix of natural, rustic and modern traditional elements. Iaposm also drawn to some eclectic items having lived abroad for so much of my le, so I like to incorporate those too. I love thrting unique items, thereaposs nothing better than a good second hand find. The children also get involved with shaping their home, knocking old tiles off walls and helping to paint the kitchen. Mavourneen added that there is still plenty to do in the house, and that the full transformation could take up to ten years.  We only moved in a year ago, so weaposve just scratched the surface of everything that needs to be done, she said. So far weaposve redone the kitchen, the living room, one of the bathrooms and the boysapos bedroom. But even those rooms arenapost finished as thereaposs a long snagging list. Sometimes the scale of what weaposve taken on feels overwhelming but I have to try and remember that this is a - year project and that I need to be a bit more patient with progress.  This year weaposre hoping to build a treehouse for the boys, tackle the hallway, the cloakroom and to make a start on the garden. Iaposve found a gorgeous second hand brass sink that I canapost wait to install in the cloakroomI can just find the right unit to fit it on to, whilst Iaposve given my husband some plans for the garden furniture Iaposd like us to try and build. After that, we have four more bedrooms, two bathrooms, a study and a conservatory on the list of rooms to sort so itaposs going to be a long process. Weaposve bitten off a bit more than we can chew but itaposs a joy to be able to restore a home like this.

There are hundreds, sometimes it even looks like thousands of birds just everywhere.They fly over people and poop everywhere. Iaposm scared I’ll get unwell because they come so close to you.” Some local residents and shoppers in Croydon say harsh measures should be taken to curb the problem. Karl, from East Croydon, said: “I think they should all be killed. They’re pests so why do we not just get rid of them  Every single summer should just go round and clear loads out. Would make everyone’s lives easier”.  Around the town centre there are signs not to feed the pigeons but with the abundance of birds in the area some locals don’t think these measures are working. Shop owner and beautician, Anna Tali, , said: “The pigeons are a real pain. They just annoy everybody. No one actually likes them and it doesn’t help business having loads of birds flying over you and pooping everywhere.” She explained that already businesses were struggling because of the aposslow recoveryapos following the pandemic and pigeons werenapost helping.  She didnapost know how much of an impact they were having on footfall but explained that aposthey surely canapost helpapos. A spokesperson from Croydon Council said: “The council doesn’t have a policy to control or cull birds within the general area and the advice to residents and businesses is to take pigeon-proofing measures to stop them perching roosting and to ensure that there isn’t a food supply for them. British Pest Control advises that food restriction is the best way to manage pigeons. If the council receives a specic complaint about an inidual feeding pigeons – and that this is leading to a public health issue – then it would investigate that further.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Birds\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The -year-old had his son Daice with a childhood friend who he began dating when he was . After seven years of being in an on-and-off relationship, the -year-old realised he wanted to live his le openly and told his girlfriend that he was gay. The two childhood friends are still close and Joe credits Daiceaposs mum as being one of his aposbiggest supportersapos - saying she was happy that heaposd told her the truth. Since becoming single and embracing his sexuality, Joe has found himself having to explain how he has a child on a aposday to day basisapos.  Meanwhile, his status as a dad has invited mixed responses on dating apps, with some singletons claiming he has apostoo much baggageapos. But TikTok videos showing Joe embracing le as a dad have been met with widespread praise. Joe said: I donapost think a lot of people get that Iaposm gay just from speaking to me, so when they find out Iaposm gay and a dad, theyaposre just a bit like aposWhat the f**k  How apos I find myself explaining it on a day-to-day basis. Joe says he already knew he was gay but his close friendship with Daiceaposs mum meant they just found themselves in a relationship at a young age. Joe said: I met Daiceaposs mum when I was eight years old. She used to train with me and weaposd do lyrical contemporary dance competitions together. As we got older, our friendship grew and grew. When I was  or , weaposd basically gotten to a stage where we knew we loved each other and we decided weaposd give it a go.  We were together for about seven years. It was on-and-off, we had our ups and downs, but we were best friends. I knew I was gay but because we had such a strong connection and were so close it was just easy. There was never really a moment where we said aposdo you want to be together apos, we got together and it just didnapost stop. We ended up having Daice together. It wasnapost planned as such, but we both wanted children. After he was born we got to a point where we thought apossomething isnapost rightapos. I was growing up thinking aposI like guysapos. In my mind, I knew things werenapost working out. It was in early  that we broke up. I think when COVID happened, it made me realise what was important. Leaposs too short to live it unhappily.  It was an amicable split, it wasnapost nasty or anything, we were really open and honest with each other. Sheaposs still one of my biggest supporters and my best friend. She was happy that I was honest with her, that I wasnapost leaving to be with other girls, I just needed to be who I am. We spend so much time together, we still go out for dinners. I donapost have Daice full time but I see him a lot. Iaposm very involved in his le. Joe never had a formal aposcoming outapos and grew up hiding his sexual orientation as he feared being ostracised at school. Joe said: I always knew I was gay, ever since I was little. My mum said she knew since I was two.I was a huge Miley Cyrus fan and I always wore a little blonde wig acting like I was Hannah Montana - the signs were there.I think I never come out before because I already got bullied at school for being a performer so I knewI said I was gay it would have been worse. I didn’t want people to think I was weird so I suppressed it for a long time. I knew but because I was so close with Daiceaposs mum it was easy. It was like a friendship that just grew and grew. We ended up having a baby out of it and weaposre both really happy with how it happened.  I never really had a aposcoming outapos. I never felt the need to sit everyone down and tell them I was gay. I was really down at the start of , I just thought that I needed to change my whole le around. I just needed to get to a place where I was happy. We were at a point where we werenapost really speaking, we were so unhappy. The relationship was over before it was over. I didnapost need to tell her, she knew I was like a Hannah Montana-obsessed person. She just asked me one dayIaposd date guys and I said apos%. It feels right, it feels rightapos. She was just happy that I was being open and honest. Joeaposs status as a young gay dad has drawn a iety of responses in real le and online, particularly as he navigates the world of gay dating.  Joe said: You obviously get the people who say aposyouaposre sick, itaposs wrongapos. Theyaposll say that because Iaposm a gay dad, but I couldnapost care less. I am who I am. Itaposs massively rewarding being a dad, my boy has made me who I am today. I was so down and my boy gave me the motivation to sort my le out. I look at le dferently. I feel like I have a purpose and thereaposs a reason for me to go out and work hard every day. Iaposm definitely looking to meet somebody. Some people think I might have too much baggage, but Iaposm open about having a son on my dating profiles.Do you have a story to share  Get in touch at webfeatures@trinitymirror.Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON TikTok\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

However, an expert locksmith has revealed that is simply not the case and that burglars are out on the prowl whatever the weather. Elizabeth Johns also said that many Brits make a common mistake during the winter by not wanting to stand outside in the cold ripping up large cardboard boxes.  Many will leave these boxes, often which have branding of high-cost items such as TVs or games consoles, leaning against the bin - giving burglars a key indicator as to what they will find inside your home.She told the Sun : In the summer, itaposs very easy to go out to your bin and put boxes in but in the colder weather, a lot of people donapost want to go out all the way to the bins to rip boxes up to put them in the bin.So they will leave boxes out that have markers on them of high-value items. Any high-value items that come in big cardboard boxes can be quite a chore to rip up and put in the bin in the colder weather. She added that it is vital to ensure that these are hidden from burglars because it will alert them to the fact high-value items are in the property.

She and Prince William spent last week on an action-packed and sometimes dficult royal tour that took in Belize, Jamaica and the Bahamas.Despite the fast pace, Kate appeared confident and composed at engagements as they met a range of people across the three countries. However, despite appearances, royal expert Katie Nicholl says these tours are often a wrench for Kate and there is always one thing about them she finds dficult - leaving her children behind.For their journey to the Caribbean, her three children Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis stayed at home.And Katie told Closer magazine : I remember being with her when we were on a tour together in Bhutan [in , when Princess Charlotte was just  months old] and we had a moment to talk about how dficult it was to leave little children behind.“Despite being the Duchess of Cambridge and being able to afford around-the-clock nannies and so on, she had her mum looking after Prince George and Princess Charlotte, which struck me as just really normal.

It is the most high-profile royal event by far that the two youngsters have attended with William and Kate keen to give them and younger brother Louis as normal an upbringing as possible. This means that their public appearances have so far been few and far between.However, now they are getting older, there have been signs that both youngsters - especially future king Prince George - are now being primed for royal le.

Michael Masson, prosecuting, said Shipley had been in a relationship with the woman since  and they were in the kitchen of the house in Drfield drinking and listening to music at about .pm. She was trying to comfort him as he appeared to be downhearted and then suddenly he locked her outside of the house and continued drinking, the court heard.  She simply waited for him to calm down, said Mr Masson adding that she was eventually let back into the house and went back upstairs. Then Shipley went upstairs and while she suggested he should sober up, he indicated that she should leave the house. She noticed that he had a kne and it looked to be a -inch kitchen kne, said Mr Masson. It was pointing upwards. She immediately reacted and reached for the kne and grabbed it. The defendant didnapost let go of it and it caused a cut between her thumb and her index finger. He immediately put the kne down. She dropped to the floor and was trying to stem the blood. Shipley alerted the police and the ambulance service. He mentioned to the paramedics that he had stabbed her but she said that he hadnapost stabbed her and that she had grabbed the kne, said Mr Masson. But Shipley told the police: I meant to stab her. It was my kne game. I sliced her hand. He said that he had drunk  cans of Stella Artois and half a bottle of Southern Comfort.  The defendant, for whatever reason, came into the bedroom and, in the course of that disagreement, the complainant was injured, said Mr Masson. Shipley had a previous conviction from Bridlington Youth Court for possessing a blade in August . Dale Brook, mitigating, said that the woman had not supported the prosecution and Shipley acted out of character. He is very sorry for what happened that night, said Mr Brook. That night, he had drunk too much and the incident spiralled completely out of control. He hasnapost particularly found a way of coping with stress and dficult situations. He had not been in contact with his now ex-girlfriend since the incident and does not know her feelings towards him now. Shipley had suffered from problems, including signicant financial pressures after he lost his job, but he had sought help for his alcohol problem. Judge Sophie McKone said that for some inexplicable reason Shipley took a kne into the bedroom and pointed it towards the woman. Her instinct was to grab at that kne, causing an injury to her hand, said Judge McKone. It may not have been your intention to injure her or threaten her with it but the presence of it did cause that injury. When drink and knives are involved, itaposs a very dangerous combination and can lead to far more serious injuries or even death. I accept that you deeply regret what happened that night. Oliver Shipley, , of Star Hill Road, Drfield, admitted affray. He was given a one-year suspended prison sentence,  hoursapos unpaid work,  daysapos rehabilitation and a building better relationships programme.

Barbara Young, , took the two electric scooters worth £ from Smyths in Eccles after voiding a transaction.When a shop worker realised what had happened he took a picture of Youngaposs Fiat  and threatened to call police, the Manchester Evening News reported.She was with her sister and her son when it happened. Young, of Bolton, walked out of the store with the scooters and put them in the boot of her car, whilst her sister was stopped by the store assistant as he realised a bag for le hadn’t been paid for. The woman apologised and handed him the bag for le back. It was only once he ed to the checkout he noticed the transaction had been voided in relation to the scooters, Manchester Crown Court heard. “He followed her to the car park and saw the defendant in the driving seat, and saw a male and a child in the front seat,” Juliet Berry, prosecuting, told the court. “The second female explained to the defendant that they needed to get the scooter out of the boot, to which she said the boot wouldn’t open. At this point the store assistant became suspicious and took a photo of the registration plate and said he was going to call the police.”  Young’s sister then jumped into the car as Young drove at him. CCTV of the footage showed the man clinging onto the bonnet as she drove away, shortly before he slumped to the ground. She then drove over his feet as she made good her escape. An hour later the car was found abandoned, along with one of the unicorn scooters and another bag for le. The store assistant’s phone was found on the edge of the windscreen. Following a check of the car by the police and DVLA, Young was found to be the registered keeper, but the vehicle itself was on  plates and she wasnapost insured. The man sustained numerous injuries including abrasions to his sternum, back, elbow and knuckles. In a victimaposs personal statement he said the impact on him physically and mentally was ‘hard to put into words’. Five months on from the incident he still has no diagnosis despite still suffering pain. “I have to keep going - I just keep living in this cycle of pain and torment,” he said. Young was said to have seven previous convictions for  offences including shoplting, driving without due care or attention and driving without insurance. Jane Dagnall, defending, said the car had been a gt from her family, but didn’t know it was stolen. She said she only knew the car was on  plates after her arrest. “Her instruction is that it wasn’t something she wanted to do. There was very little thought,” Ms Dagnall said. “She has been on remand for two months. The clanging of the prison gates has affected her. It hit home what it’s like to lose her liberty. “She is a young woman, she is a mother of two and she is totally ashamed and remorseful.” Jailing Young, of Crompton Lodge Caravan Park, Hall Lane, for  months, Recorder Paul Reid QC said: “You got into a car which you had no right to be driving. You had your child with you. “It’s perfectly clear he was standing immediately in front of your car. You couldn’t avoid seeing him. You chose to drive off with him in front of you, it wasn’t just a nudge, you drove into him with such force that he was propelled on the bonnet of the car and was hanging on. “You must have known you had driven over him, yet you didn’t stop to seehe was alright, such was your keenness to get away. It’s a miracle he wasn’t more seriously hurt.” Along with her prison sentence, Young, who pleaded guilty to theft assault occasioning actual bodily harm and dangerous driving as well as driving with no insurance no licence and failing to stop after an accident was banned from driving for two years and nine months and made the subject of a restraining order for seven years.

Why isnapost everybody cheering for the white man  Will thinks.Yes, the monarchy benefitted from slavery. Yes, protestors are calling for reparations. Yes, Iaposm completely out of touch but I got up on stage and declared slavery should NEVER have happened. What more can I do  I wonderthis was a mistake  Kate whispers - the first thought sheaposd formed on her own in a while - as she shakes the hand of a Black child through the prison- I mean gates. Safe to say, the standing symbolically high on his moving pedestal deserved the backlash it created. But from it, talk about the royalsapos hard work ethic and dedication to duty also arose. Itaposs the perfect smokescreen to move on from the controversy something the royals have had plenty of practice with. But in doing so, they stick their fingers up at the public once again, and dig themselves an even bigger hole. Will certainly takes after Daddy, Prince Charles, who is impatiently twiddling his thumbs for his five minutes of being King.  The Prince of Wales was crowned the hardest working Royal back in  - after completing  engagements. Republic states this is the equivalent of aposworkingapos  and a half days - a measly fraction of the average full-time worker, who puts in more than  days a year. And that would be fineCharles was on a pro-rata salary and just looking for a little bit of cash to fund his gardening projects. But no, the Royal has a personal income of more than £ million - meaning he gets to shake peopleaposs hands and poses for photos for an eye-watering £, an hour. We need to get rid of the idea that any of the royals are hard-working. Itaposs an insult to teachers, to NHS workers, to those scraping by on minimum wage while the monarchyaposs only job is to protect itself.

Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter hereDr Stankovic also revealed that these symptoms can also appear in those fully-vaccinated. Speaking to the Times Now News Portal, Dr Stankovic said: “Pain is often associated with ringing in the ears. Surprisingly, these symptoms, although more rarely, can also appear in patients who have been vaccinated with a full course. She also advised those with hearing loss, ringing in your ears and dizziness to not dismiss these symptoms and still take a test. Brits can no longer have testing kits for free after the scheme was stopped, with those looking to test having to buy from local pharmacies or online. Covid infection levels have hit a record high across the UK as free Covid- testing for millions in England comes to an end.Some . million people in the UK are estimated to have had Covid- in the week ending March , up from . million in the previous week, the Office for National Statistics said.The ONS data shows one in  people in England are estimated to have had Covid during that week, up from one in  the week before, and in Wales the figure is one in  people, up from one in .Both are record highs and it comes after experts warned that at such levels anyone in the population who can catch Covid is likely to get it.

It has also been suggested that it shows the -year-old Queen still has control over the Royal Family as she was behind Andrew’s prominent role while other senior royals disapproved.  Either way it has raised hopes for Andrew that he can have an important role for the Jubilee events to mark the Queen’s  years on the throne. It comes after he was removed from public le and paid suspected millions to settle a civil sexual assault case involving Virginia Giuffre. He has always denied any wrong-doing in the case.“Prince Andrew does want to participate in the Platinum Jubilee celebrations and to be present at the St Paul’s Cathedral service of thanksgiving and to pay tribute to the Queen’s magnicent  years of public service, a royal insider told the Express.“The Prince and Queen do have a close bond. The Queen knows exactly what she is doing. She’s very much in charge.  A packed itinerary to mark the royal milestone opens with Trooping the Colour and the Queen’s Birthday Parade, on June . Then the St Paul’s service next day is followed by a trip to one of the monarch’s favourite engagements – the Derby at Epsom. Other key events include a Platinum Party, when some of the world’s top entertainers perform at Buckingham Palace, and the Platinum Jubilee Pageant.

Up until recently she still regularly went riding - enjoying her time with her horses in the fresh air. And it now appears that her great-granddaughter Princess Charlotte is following in her footsteps by reportedly also taking up the hobby alongside her brothers Prince George and Prince Louis. The three are said to have become aposavid ridersapos and are all trotting about on their very first ponies. It is believed they began to hone their riding skills at their Norfolk home Amner Hall during lockdown last year.Dad Prince William was said to be aposthrilledapos that his children are taking on the hobby after he learned how to ride as a child. The Queen has long been known for her love of horses after having her first riding lesson at the age of three. Previously, she selected eight special horses that she and her family have loved riding and watching, plus five of the most memorable racehorses of all time that she has bred and owned.

Her choices included tributes to the memory of her late father George VI with Aureole which she inherited from the King and the moment when her daughter Princess Anne won the European Eventing Championships on Doublet - a horse bred by Her Majesty. The head of state also chose the racehorse Estimate which triumphed in the Ascot Gold Cup, making her the first monarch to win the trophy. In October last year, It was reported that the Queen was told to give up horse riding for at least six months, following a bout of ill health. A royal source said at the time: “The Queen is sad she can not get out on her horse, which is one of her favourite pastimes, but she is resting and taking every precaution to get back to full fitness. However she is very determined to be back riding as soon as possible and in no way does she feel her riding days are behind her.” Itaposs unclearshe has been out riding since this.

While Her Majesty has been scaling back on her public appearances after a few bouts of poor health, she was recently accompanied by the Duke of York at a memorial for her late husband Prince Philip. The move was seen as a way of confirming Prince Andrew still plays an integral part in family le.It comes after Andrew paid off his sexual assault accuser Virgin Giuffre with a reported £million just three weeks ago. He has always denied the allegations made by Ms Giuffre and denied ever meeting her. The two heirs to the throne Charles and William were said to have been “shocked” and dismayed” as Andrew emerged front and centre.  However, Vanity Fairaposs Royal Editor Katie Nicholl said the Queen deliberately chose to have Andrew play such a prominent role on the day and shows the public she still aposmakes the decisionsapos. Katie Nicholl said: This was the Queenaposs way of showing two things one, that the buck stops with her, and she makes the decisions, and secondly that she believes heaposs innocent. She made the point very, very clearly. But Charles and William were very aware of the perspective, of the optics of this.  Unfortunately, this picture [of Prince Andrew escorting the Queen] has overtaken what should have been a memorial to a great man. Andrew has spent a considerable amount of time with the ailing -year-old monarch, who has suffered from a series of health problems in recent months as well as recovering from Covid.The Duke of York, who lives on the Windsor estate, has also been ever present at his mother’s Windsor Castle home after the death of her beloved husband Prince Philip, who died last April aged . It is believed he still holds ambitions of staging an unlikelyto front line royal duties, despite being banished being stripped of all his royal titles over Ms Giuffreaposs allegations that he sexually assaulted her in , when she was a -year-old former sex slave of his paedophile pal Jeffrey Epstein.. Andrew has always strenuously denied all allegations against him.

Buckingham Palace will calculate an elderly monarchaposs above criticism on the day of her dear, dead husbandaposs memorial service. But choosing to be escorted to and from Westminster Abbey by a man who paid a reported £-million to settle a sordid sex case to avoid court was deeply distasteful. It wasnapost a sweet old maaposam who wanted to travel from Windsor Castle in state limousine with a scoundrel shunned since paying off a woman who alleged when a teenager she was force to sleep with a dad of two old enough to be her own father.  This was an elderly monarch exploiting sympathy at a personal yet very public event to walk back into polite society a reviled man forced to give up even honorary membership of a posh golf club over the scandals spewing from a close friendship with a convicted paedophile and his jailed fixer. What Virginia Giuffre makes of it one can only imagine but much of the watching world, particularly women victims of abuse, will have been revolted. The removal of his military titles and royal patronages, including the use of a His Royal Highness title, look a ersion.  The Duke of York, her favourite son, remains promoted despite stomach-churning behaviour that shouldaposve seen tainted Andrew seated out of sight at the back behind a pillar. Perhaps age and frailty are distorting her judgement because this was a colossal mistake by a declining monarch. She put her son and family before decency, trying to sell a leper to the country at a service commemorating her husband. Knee-bending courtiers will struggle from now on to argue sheaposs principled and does what is right in the service of the country.  She held on to Andrewaposs arm but it was her parading him. He continues to deny the claim but embracing the humiliated sex case settler damaged her own reputation. After the disastrous royal colonial relic tour of the Caribbean, the head of the creaking institution also undermined a family business suddenly feeling very out of date.

He would dress like a stable lad and amid the ensuing mayhem when the race finished, grab the winner’s reins and march it confidently to the winning enclosure. A couple of times he made it, leaving us doubled up with laughter as the TV cameras were taken in by the centre-stage con man. I thought of him on Tuesday during Prince Philip’s memorial service when Prince Andrew led his mother up the aisle of Westminster Abbeyand putting himself bang in the centre of the national spotlight again. But I doubt many royals were laughing. Because how it looked, and what it said, was utterly abysmal. He wasn’t just allowed to escort the monarch to her seat by the way, but conscious that he is now unable to use his HRH title, the Queen decreed no other royal should be listed as HRH in the order of service. It was a callous and crude attempt to rehabilitate a disgraced man with an indecent haste by those at the top of this country.  It is barely a month since the royals agreed a £million payout to Virginia Giuffre who alleged she was forced to have sex with Andrew after being trafficked by his paedophile friend Jeffrey Epstein. ­Allegations he denies but allegations that he halted being tested in court by paying his accuser. The royals pushing him back into the centre of national consciousness as though nothing had happened was a kick in the teeth for every woman who has ever been abused and felt powerless to do anything about it. As Nazir Afzal, former Chief Crown Prosecutor for North West England, who specialises in cases of child sexual exploitation tweeted in reference to Andrew’s appearance: “I’m all for ­rehabilitation but it starts with facing justice, accepting responsibility and working to rebuild victims’ confidence. None of that is present here so far.” Allowing the Queen’s son to be her escort in such a public way said we royals do what we want because we are above you all. That the stripping of Andrew’s titles and honours was a pretence. It said we may live in an era when accusations of sexual harassment against high-profile men drives them into obscurity, but it’s OK. The one accused here is the Queen’s son. He’s got superior blood.  Also, Virginia Giuffre was held as a sex slave by Andrew’s friend, whom he visited on many occasions. Did the link not occur to a family that had just walked into a huge row in the Caribbean about their role in the slave trade  Did The Firm not imagine, after that catastrophic image of an aloof William and Kate driving through Jamaica in all their colonial finery, how appalling this would look  I think William did, as he looked as exasperated and uncomfortable sitting in a row behind his disgraced uncle in the Abbey as he had on that Caribbean tour. I wouldn’t be surprisedhe was wondering what the point of it all was and whether it’s right to force his kids into being players in this antiquated circus. You can but hope.

The bug, which causes nausea and vomiting, usually sees a surge in the winter months but had been kept at bay by covid restrictions. With Brits now free to mingle more than previously, germs are spreading more easily. Care homes and schools are often the worst affected by norovirus outbreaks, which then quickly spread within families. Experts have since warned parents to act fastthey notice any symptoms and to regularly wash their hands with soap water, as hand sanitiser is ineffective at killing the virus. The UK Health Security Agency, which monitors outbreaks of the vomiting bug, has urged Brits to be vigilant as cases continue to rise. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter hereLesley Larkin, Surveillance Lead, Gastrointestinal Infections and Food Safety, UK Health Security Agency told The Sun the increased cases were due to a relaxing in covid restrictions. Symptoms include sudden onset of nausea, projectile vomiting and diarrhoea but can also include a high temperature, abdominal pain and aching limbs, she added. Ms Larkin urged Brits to stay at homethey were experiencing symptoms and to avoid ing to work or sending children to nursery until at least  hours after symptoms have cleared. Those who believe they have contracted the virus are advised to keep as hydrated as possible and stay clear of elderly relatives, especially in care homes or hospitalswhile they are feeling sick. Handwashing is key to help stop the spread of this bug, but unlike for Covid- alcohol hand sanitisers do not kill off norovirus, so soap and warm water is best, Ms Larkin added.Anyone suffering from norovirus symptoms can book a phone consultationthey are concerned, but are advised not to see their GP in person. Norovirus can easily spread through contact with infected patients or contaminated surfaces, however, the virus usually passes after a couple of days. Covid restrictions also saw flu cases lower than usual during the winter months, but as restrictions have lted these too have begun to pick up. Compared to pre-pandemic levels, cases are still relatively low but have nevertheless seen an increase over her last week. Dr Conall Watson, Consultant Epidemiologist for the UK Health Security Agency, told The Sun the increase was likely to increased mixing in office workspaces and urged Brits to regularly wash their hands to curb the spread.

Metaldehyde pellets have been used as bait to control slugs, snails and other garden pests, but the government has moved to ban their sale and use after it was was advised that pellets can severely poison other animals Instead, gardeners have been advised to use beer to kill slugs instead. Experts from the charity Garden Organic say slugs love the drinkaposs yeasty aroma, meaning they are at least happy when they fall in and drown.The charity found that slugs are  times more likely to be caught in a trap containing lager than water, with bitter  times more effective than water, the Daily Mail reported. Garden Organic’s head gardener Emma OaposNeill said: Slugs love lager. Many gardeners know that slugs are confirmed lager louts and their love of this tipple can certainly distract them from your plants. The smell of lager and bitter really seems to attract them. The charity advises using copper tape to protect plants from slugs or luring them underneath an old roof tile with a piece of lettuce. It also recommends raised beds and containers to deter the creatures. Garden Organicaposs chief executive Fiona Taylor said that the ban on metaldehyde pellets had been a long time coming.  Metaldehyde pellets have long been recognised as posing an unacceptable risk to birds and mammals, she said. There have been cases of dogs ingesting pellets, leading to sickness and even death. Toxins can also find their way into rivers and freshwaters, posing wider harm to the environment and other wildle. We are pleased that the government has listened to safety and environment experts about the huge risks of this chemical, which far outweigh any benefits. We hope this is the start of a range of measures which sees an end to the use of harmful pesticides.  If we care about wildle and the future of our planet, we must make the positive move to organic, environmentally friendly methods for our gardens, allotments, balconies and pots. Announcing the ban in September , farming minister Victoria Prentis said: The scientic evidence is clear – the risks metaldehyde poses to the environment and to wildle are too great.

Telescopes were lined up at observatories to scan the clear blue skies for the first hint of the crescent of the new moon before reports came in that it had been seen in Sudair, Saudi Arabia. The first full day of Ramadan, with fasting from dawn to sunset, will be tomorrow - April . Some Muslims follow the Saudi announcements but other Muslim communities wait for veried moon sightings from the UK, Morocco, or where, so Ramadan can y by a day or so. That means that for some it will instead start on Sunday.In Australia, an early declaration of the date of Ramadan this year was made, Birmingham Live reports.  The Australian Fatwa Council posted on March  that it had decided Ramadan  would also begin on April , because it knew from astronomical data that it would be easy to see the moon on April . Saudi Arabiaaposs Umm al-Qura Calendar had already predicted Ramadan to start on April , . It says the month will finish on May , with the next monthstarting on May  with the three-day festivities of Eid al-Fitr. The Umm al-Qura Calendar is used by the government of Saudi Arabia for civil purposes, with its dates determined at the Institute of Astronomical  Geophysical Research in Riyadh.  Islamic Relief UK has a calendar predicting the same dates. This calculated lunar calendar is also followed by several neighbouring states on the Arabian Peninsula such as Bahrain and Qatar. However, the HM Nautical Almanac Office, a British Government agency that produces astronomical data for organisations including the armed forces, police, religious groups and diary calendar manufacturers, predicted that it would only be possible to see the new moon on Friday in a few locations, including parts of South America, the USA and Caribbean. On Saturday, April , the agency says easy sightings of the crescent moon are likely across the world with the possible exceptions of southern and eastern Australia, New Zealand, and the north-eastern parts of Russia.Muslims in the UK and the rest of Europe, and in Africa, the Middle East and most of Asia will easily be able to see the crescent with the naked eye on Saturday, it said. Astronomers in Morocco have already said that they predict Ramadan will begin on Sunday, April .  They said they would not be able to observe the moon on Friday, so the current monthwould last one more day. Observations of the moon are not the same everywhere, due to the way it orbits the Earth. It can mean Islamic dates y by a day or two in dferent countries. There can also be discrepancies within the same country or even the same city,some Muslim communities fall in line with announcements from one overseas nation and some from another.

Stay-at-home we and mum Christina Keeler, , currently has four dolls that she loves to dress up, take on trips and photograph. Christina, from Wyalusing, Pennsylvania, USA, loves the hobby so much her husband Bill and two daughters, Grace, four, and Joy, two, join in, and the family have even launched their own YouTube channel. The mum-of-two, who admits some of her family and friends donapost like the unusual hobby, started obsessing over the dolls shortly after she lost her and Billaposs first baby in . The heartbreak cut even deeper because Christina suffers with endometriosis - a long-term condition where tissue similar to the lining of the womb grows in other places, such as the oies and fallopian tubes - when she was in her twenties and was told by doctors that she would not be able to conceive.  Thankfully, Christina and Bill went on to have Grace and Joy but Christina still had a longing for a newborn baby to hold, dress up and photograph. At the same time Christina watched a documentary about reborn dolls and the people who take part in the hobby of roleplaying with the hyper realistic dolls asthey are real babies and was instantly intrigued.Christina researched the hobby on Instagram and bought her first reborn doll, Hannah Hope, in January .As an adult, my husband, Bill, and I suffered the painful loss of our infant, said Christina. I found myself searching for the feeling of a newborn baby in my arms. To this day it is very dficult to speak about, it is only because of reborns that I can even talk about it at all. I remember screaming and crying out to God from the hospital bed aposI want my baby! I want my mum!apos, Christina added. I lost my mum a few years prior due to cancer, and it was at that very moment I realised my baby was now in Heaven with my mum and my arms were left empty.  Thankfully we were able to go on and have two healthy daughters, but I never could shake the feeling I had in that hospital bed yearning for my baby in my arms and being left empty handed and broken hearted. Currently Christina has a collection of four dolls of newborn roleplay age called, Isabella aposIzzyapos Sage, Isaiah Scott, Lennon aposLennyapos Levi and Princess, that she loves to dress up, snuggle with and take pictures of. Grace and Joy often take the dolls out in public to places like the supermarket where people often mistake them for real le babies. Christina says she quickly because obsessed with reborn dolls after watching a documentary about them, and eventually set up her own YouTube channel with the help of Bill so they can film box openings, roll play videos and a aposreborn news showapos. I love many aspects of the hobby - from dressing them and taking photos, snuggling them, and taking them on outings with my family, the mum said. I love that itaposs a hobby I can do together with my family - they are the most important things to me besides my faith, and to have them share in this hobby Iaposm so passionate about makes me so happy.Christina and her family share their reborn adventures on Instagram under the handle, @the_reborn_family_youtube and on YouTube where they are known as The Reborn Family. Despite her immediate family being supportive of their hobby, Christina admits that not everyone in her wider family understands reborns but she hopes by continuing with her social media channels the hobby of reborning will soon be viewed as an acceptable hobby by society. When Christina is out and about with her dolls, most people are shocked to learn that the dolls are not real babies after mistaking them for real le newborns, something which is highly amusing for the Keeler family. I have in-laws nearby that completely disapprove of my hobby and have asked Bill to not support me in it. None of my friends or family have accepted my hobby, said Christina. They find it odd and refuse to even talk about it with me. Itaposs like the big elephant in the room that we all just pretend isnapost there. Itaposs hurtful. Iaposve even had family members write rude comments on my YouTube channel.  YouTube filters most of the rude comments so itaposs rare they come on our radar, but we still do get a few comments that sneak through and arenapost the kindest. I had a distant family member comment, aposYou guys are freaks,apos I contemplated responding but decided to just delete it and carry on. I wish they would be happy for me and celebrate that I found something I enjoy. This hobby might be strange to some people, but it isnapost hurting anyone - itaposs a harmless hobby that I wish we could normalise. Thataposs my goal anyway. To normalise this hobby to be accepted by society. Christina added: I take my reborns out maybe a few times a month. I donapost always film it, but usuallywe take a reborn out we are filming for our YouTube channel. Other than the occasional whispers, we seem to get really positive feedback. If we wanted people to think it was a doll, we would make them look like dolls. People will come up to us and ask how old the baby is orthey can take a look at the baby and then we tell people itaposs a reborn doll - they are usually pretty surprised and have a good laugh and enjoy the incredible art that is so lelike. Sometimes, however, people will feel silly for thinking they are real. I feel bad because thataposs not what itaposs about. Itaposs meant to bring a smile to your face and enjoy the beauty and wonder of the art. Christina hopes that she will be able to normalise reborn dolls as a hobby and hopes to showcase the artistry that goes into creating these beautul dolls in achieving this. I understand that this hobby may seem strange at first - but take a minute and ask yourselves, aposwhy does that bother me apos, said Christina. The truth is that this is a perfectly harmless hobby where a group of predominantly womenadmire the realism of the art in ious ways such as holding them, photographing them, naming them etc. No matter what the hobby may be, as long as it isnapost harmful to yourself or others, andit brings you joy, then go for it and what others think is their problem not yours.

Al Lupiano, who attended Colonia High School, Woodbridge, told how he started to research the cases of the cancer and was shocked with the results. He himself had been diagnosed with the extremely rare cancer  years ago and when other family members also developed the disease, which affects the left side of the brain, he began to look into what was going on. He discovered that  sufferers had gone to his school. The environmental scientist said that he lost his sister to stage  glioblastoma who was diagnosed in August last year and two hours after that diagnosis his we also was told she had a primary brain tumour. It led to him putting a post on Facebook enquiringother Colonia High School children have suffered from tumours. What I find alarming is thereaposs truly only one environmental link to primary brain tumours and thataposs ionizing radiation. Itaposs not contaminated water. Itaposs not air. Itaposs not something in soil. Itaposs not something done to us due to bad habits, Mr Lupiano told CBS News.He is now working with local officials to find out what could have happened at the school that was built in , with materials used in the construction one theory put forward. It was virgin land. It was woods. The high school was the first thing to be there, so there was probably nothing in the ground at that time. The only thing that could have happened, potentially, was fill that was brought in during construction. We have no records  years ago, Woodbridge Mayor John McCormick said. The states department responsible for environmental protection has been contacted now to investigate. We are looking at possible things that we can do between the town and school, and they said they will look at anything we come up with, said Mr McCormick. Iaposm a lelong resident here.

Lisa goes on to explainyou see your beau with someone , you might start to question who that other person is and how they know each other, which could bring out a jealous side. She said that,you continuously watch the Instagram stories of your new love, you become too invested in their le when you donapost actually know them that well yet.

Speaking to the newspaper, Lisa said watching Instagram stories of a new person youaposre dating could hark back to old dating experiences - and you might end up self-sabotaging. For example,you dated someone in the past who was untrustworthy, you might start looking for behaviour you consider untrustworthy in a new partner through their Instagram stories. She said: Not looking [at Instagram stories] gives one the opportunity to come into dating with no agendas, preconceived notions and excitement in getting to know the inidual with a clean slate.” Lisa acknowledges her advice is easier said than done, so she also gives some advice for how to stick to your guns.

He askedthings with IVF donapost work outI would be willing to be a possible surrogate , she said. I was shocked and honestly slightly disgusted by the idea. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. She went on to say how sheaposs had a rocky relationship with her father and they went a number of years without speaking, so her initial reaction was one of surprise - All of this makes the fact that he asked so shocking. When he asked I gave an awkward chuckle and said, aposI donapost even knowI ever want to physically have a child myself andI do, I would probably use surrogacy myselfI could, you know apos He was audibly disappointed when he responded with, aposNo, I donapost knowapos. There was an awkward pause and I said, aposYeah well... sorry but I love youapos. And we hung up. I was so shocked I thought I had entered the twilight zone and started to feel nauseous. She recalled how much it weirded her out that her dad felt comfortable asking this of her. I would like her to put the fear of God into him so he never considers even THINKING of me and surrogacy in the same sentence ever again, she continued.My dad is a selfish person. I know he didnapost consider the ramications of what being pregnant and having a child would have on me at all - evenI would not be involved with raising it. I know part of why he asked is because he was hoping to save the money a surrogacy agency costs. Itaposs grossing me out that he had to have thought about me being pregnant. Iaposd like to talk to my mum about this. She concluded her post by asking whether she should talk to her mother about it despite being told to keep it to herself or try to keep it together knowing she would have to confront her dad about it at some point. Reddit users were quick to share their thoughts on her situation, and many encouraged her to speak to her mum. One person said: Iaposm usually in the camp of donapost spill secrets, but this is a huge ask andyou need to confide in your mum, confide in her. Itaposs something that majorly affects you. If it eases your mind, you wouldnapost even qualy to be a surrogate. No legit fertility place will allow you to be impregnated, so his attempt to get around other fees would fail. Even the places with the loosest restrictions wouldnapost accept a surrogate that has never carried at least one pregnancy to term. Itaposs the most major of requirements.The original poster thanked them and said: That does ease my mind! I didnapost know that at all. Clearly, his time spent thinking about asking me was not spent wisely enough! Another person wrote: Can you imagine telling people you’re carrying your dadaposs baby  to which the woman replied saying: Right!  How would I explain that to literally anybody  A third added: If heaposs prepared to ask you to be his surrogate, he has to ALSO be prepared that people are going to find out about it.

The fed-up we got married in December, and recently invited her husbandaposs parents over to stay with them.Unfortunately, it wasnapost long until the mother-in-law began voicing her less than complimentary opinions on the decor and overall organisation of the newlywedsapos home. At first, she tried simply biting her lip and ignoring the criticism, but things got increasingly frustrating when the mother-in-law took issue with her husband being the one to serve the lunch. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here.Taking to Reddit, the unnamed woman wrote: She kept insinuating things throughout the whole lunch, saying, aposI can teach you some cooking, it is a bad omen to make your husband cookapos. I obviously do know how to cook. In fact, once I come back from work I am the one preparing dinner for both me and my husband and taking care of the undone chores . She added: When my husband was sweeping, she rushed to him as though he was a kid playing with fire or something and started sweeping for him.Every minor chore he would do during the time she stayed over, she would either glare me down until I took over or she would snidely tell him aposAsk her to do itapos.  Around three days after her husbandaposs parents ed to their own home, the poster received a stern phone call from her mother-in-law, who let her know that it really hurt her to see her son doing the chores. She recalled: She said she was feeling depressed for days because he was brought up never having to do housework at his own house and seeing aposme making him do choresapos is breaking her heart. The poster is surprised that her husband partaking in housework would be considered such a huge deal, and now wonders whether she should have simply done all the tasks during her in-lawsapos stay. However, her fellow Reddit users were quick to reassure the woman that she absolutely hadnapost done anything wrong. One person wrote: I come from a family that only let women clean and do everything. The men can order you to get water and tea and whatever they want. She brought him up to never do chores, so she made him incompetent  It doesnapost work like that anymore and I am so happy youaposre making him do something. You deserve to take it easy just as much as he does. Another advised: Honestly,your mother-in-law keeps bringing it up, assure her that, despite his upbringing to keep him completely dependent, he is a competent human being who strives to be a partner and not a burden. No parent should be proud of the fact that they didnapost teach their children how to take care of themselves.Do you have a story about meddlesome in-laws to share  We pay for stories.

Trusting Alisha Moy is unlucky in love and found herself looking for matches on online dating app Tinder, and soon she matched with Jordan Cobbold.But Alisha got cold feet after just a month when the pair failed to gel and she called it off, then, in revenge, ‘needy’ -year-old Jordan used a key to sneak into her flat while she was at work. Heartbroken Alisha ed home to find her footwear filled with beans and tinned spaghetti, as well as damaged walls, furniture, clothes and brand new electrical appliances. What do you think about Alishaaposs experience  Let us know in the comments...Alisha, from Ipswich, Suffolk, said: Things turned weird. We’d be watching a film and he’d just burst into tears for no reason. I’d ask him what the problem was, but he’d just ignore me. Then, when we got together, he started saying stuff like ‘this is the stage of the relationship when everything starts going wrong’.  We’d only been seeing each other a matter of weeks! It was so confusing, I couldn’t understand why he was being so intense and needy. Alisha messaged Jordan to tell him their fling was off. He blocked me and that was it, she says. The next morning I went to work for am and didn’t get home until pm. I knew something was wrong as soon as I walked in the hallway - I usually leave all the interior doors open, but someone had closed them all.  I opened my living room door and just burst into tears at the sight in front of me. He’d pulled my shoes out of the little cloakroom and poured beans and spaghetti in there. There were condiments splattered all over the walls and cooking sauce poured all over my vacuum cleaner. Still sobbing, Alisha walked through to her kitchen where she found brand new appliances had had their cables cut through. In her bedroom, Alisha found her make-up trashed, shower gel poured in her drawers, plus more appliances and phone chargers with severed cables.  The bathroom was strewn with red bubble bath and a shoe had been chucked down the toilet.” Alisha called her mum in floods of tears. I couldn’t even speak, she recalls. Mum had to call the police for me because I couldn’t get my words out. Officers arrived within hours and Alisha moved out to stay with a relative until a forensic team had examined her flat. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newslettershere. She told police she believed Jordan was responsible and they arrested him within days. Meanwhile, Alisha spent a day and a half cleaning up her trashed flat with the help of a relative. She had to repaint the living room, kitchen and bathroom and needed professionals to clean her carpets, and while she was able to repair the cut cables to some of her appliances, others had to be binned. The damage caused by Jordan’s wrecking spree was estimated at almost £,. It was heartbreaking, she says. It took months before I felt safe again. Alisha deleted Tinder after Jordan’s rampage and has since met someone new. Jordan appeared at Ipswich Crown Court in January after previously pleading guilty to criminal damage and one count of burglary after he took a necklace that he had given Alisha on her birthday. He got a two-year community order, with  rehabilitation activity days and  hours of unpaid work. He was also ordered to pay Alisha £, in compensation and £ in court costs, and was given a five-year restraining order.

The -year-old is now convinced the German paedophile took the three-year-old British girl in May  at Praia da Luz on the Algarve. And Post claimed Brueckner boasted of burgling holiday flats during chilling “night-crawls” across the Portuguese resort. He told how the chief suspect in Madeleine’s disappearance had up to  passports from ­properties he raided. And he admitted he regrets not tipping off police about his crimes, but insisted he is willing to try to help bring him to justice over the missing toddler.German Post, a talented musician and IT expert, became friends with Brueckner, , after the pair met in an Algarve bar in the early-s. He initially believed his fellow ­countryman could not have been behind Madeleine’s kidnap and thought his criminality was limited to burglary. But since discovering Brueckner had been convicted of child sex offences in his teens, Post said it was now “so obvious” he snatched her. He added: “Now I know about his paedophile past, his rapist past. I’m % certain it was him. “I think he found her by chance and just took her on the spur of the moment. “I think once you are a paedophile, there is a switch in your brain that cannot be turned off. If he saw a little girl asleep, alone in her apartment, he would definitely have taken her. “Thinking about what he has done in the past makes me sick, it makes me want to vomit knowing I was hanging with him. If he is convicted of taking Madeleine I hope they lock him up and take away the key.”Post was tracked down by the Mirror to a small town in southern Cambodia where he lives under an assumed name. In his first ever interview he told how he and Brueckner would go to each other’s flats after they became friends. Post said he knew his new pal was on the “fringes” of crime but had no idea of the true scale until a later visit to his ramshackle farmhouse. He said: “I was sat in the living room and noticed piles of passports on the fireplace. There honestly must have been between  and  of them, neatly stacked up in three piles. “He told me he got them on his ‘­night-crawls’ in Praia da Luz, climbing onto balconies and through windows. It shows how many burglaries he must have done. “He said he would go into rooms and take what he wanted. At the time I guessed he was talking about cash, jewellery, ­passports… but now who knows  “He would only do it at night, it was too risky being seen in the daylight.  “He also said he was trafficking a bit of weed to make cash. But there was absolutely no sign he was into children or anything like sexual crimes. “Do I have regrets not telling the police about the passports at the time  I guess I do. “But now I’m willing to go back to court, to face him again, and help convict himthey want me to.” Post only discovered Brueckner had been convicted of child sex offences after reading about them in the press. And we can reveal he has twice been interviewed by detectives investigating the suspect and Madeleine’s case. Post also gave evidence against him at his  trial for raping a pensioner in Praia da Luz in , for which he is serving seven years in Germany. He fell out with Brueckner in  after the crook asked him to go to his house and clear out anything ­incriminating while he was in a Portimao prison for stealing petrol.  Post found some porn films and binned them rather than take them to a friend’s house who had children. He said: “He thought I was stealing from him or something.” The pair met briefly again in  after Post had ed to Germany to work on a Christmas market in Solingen near Dusseldorf. But after moving to Cambodia in , he was stunned when his brother rang three years later to say German detectives wanted to speak to him. Post added: “They said he was a suspect in the Madeleine case. I was absolutely shocked.” He said he had never spoken about Brueckner publicly before over fears he would be linked to the Madeleine case. And he insisted he had nothing to do with any of the suspect’s crimes. German prosecutors named Brueckner as a suspect in June  and claim to have evidence he abducted and killed her. He denies any involvement in the case. Madeleine’s parents Kate, , and Gerry, , from Rothley, Leics, continue to believe she is alive somewhere. Last week it was reported Home Office funding for Scotland Yard’s Operation Grange investigation into the disappearance will end this year. The probe, opened in , has so far cost more than £million.

Rather than looking at who was at the table, we should look at on whose behalf they were there, he said.  Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu told broadcaster A Haber that Abramovich has been liaising between Kyiv and Moscow since the February  invasion and working sincerely to end the fighting. Of course, official talks are important, negotiations are important, but public opinion is sensitive, everyone wants to maintain their position, and there are channels that should be kept open between leaders and countries. Here, Abramovich plays a useful role, he said. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov had said Abramovich was not an official member of the Russian delegation, but acknowledged his presence to enable certain contacts. Reports said Abramovich even went to Kyiv on at least two occasions to meet President Volodymyr Zelensky But Abramovich’s critics claim he is using the talks to try and salvage his overseas assets. I’m not sure how much his involvement in this mediation is real and effective, and how much of it is a PR tool, Vladimir Ashurkov, executive director of the Anti-Corruption Foundation founded by the jailed Russian dissident Alexei Navalny told the Financial Times. He’s a creative guy, and he has creative people working for him, so it can just be a way to have a chance to ease the sanctions. A member of the military alliance NATO, Turkey shares a maritime border with Ukraine and Russia in the Black Sea, has good ties with both and has offered to mediate.It has supported Kyiv, but also opposes sanctions on Moscow, including measures against Abramovich and other Russian billionaires. Abramovich had sought to sell his English soccer club Cha, a process taken out of his hands by the British government when it blacklisted him. Superyachts linked to him, together worth an estimated . billion, have been docked at Bodrum and Marmaris in southwest Turkey since last week. Sources have said he and other wealthy Russians were looking to invest in Turkey given sanctions where.

Alina Kabaeva is rumoured to be the long-term secret mistress of the Russian president.A Russian tabloid reported on April ,  that the Moscow leader orced his we Lyudimilla and planned to wed the then -year-old ex-Olympian. Reports have claimed she’s currently hidden away in Switzerland along with Putin’s apparent twin daughters. The -year-old former Olympic gold medal-winning gymnast has a reported net worth that dwarfs the boxing legend Tyson. Thanks to Kabaeva’s work as a gymnast, politician and media mogul, she is worth a reported whooping £.million. By contrast, the two-time former heavyweight world champion has a network more than three times less than that of Kabaeva, at only £.million.Tyson made a massive £million over his glittering boxing career but into his retirement, his net value is believed to have dwindled considerably.

They work well in a sunny or partially shaded area in fertile well-drained soil.Climbing jasmine can be highly scented, with ieties that flower in summer and winter. All produce pretty flowers and are fairly easy to grow against walls or up trellis.There are some fun options for kids to plant such as sunflowers, snapdragons and the four o#clock flower.If you look at a sunflower, you can’t help but smile. Not only does it remind us of the sun, but its head will track the sun through the sky.Snapdragons are great because they come in a iety of colours and sizes, and you can pinch the blossoms so they open and shut just like a dragon’s mouth.Snapdragon flowers are specically designed for bumblebees, which are just the right weight to trip the opening mechanism of the lower lip of the flower to gain access to the nectar.The four o#clock flower, also known as the marvel of Peru, is a bushy plant with trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, yellow or white.The fragrant flowers don’t open until late afternoon, around four o’clock # so they are good for telling the time.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to start sowing tomatoes, so you can enjoy them throughout the summer.You will need rich, fertile soil or peat-free potting compost, and a good sunny, sheltered spot. Water regularly and feed regularly once the plants start to flower.Tomatoes are split into two main growing types # bush and cordon. Bush types are usually planted in containers and their stems trail around the edge. Cordon types are trained to grow tall, supported by a cane or stake and will require pinching out.Growing tomatoes from seed is best done under cover, into seed trays, then when the seedlings get to -cm tall transplant to small cm pots. Keep potting on as they grow in size.They can be planted outside with cane supports once the last frosts have gone, so around May time.For best results, choose trusted ieties like Gardener#s Delight, Money Maker or Sweet Olive.As usual, April really kick-starts the gardening season.According to the Royal Horticultural Society, spring is finally in evidence as daffodils and flowering trees start to bloom. Expect the inevitable April showers but with sunny days too, when you can turn your attention to the lawn.It#s an exciting month, with indoor-sown seeds well into growth, and it#s also time to start sowing outdoors. Just watch out for frosts.Top three jobs this month:"},{"url":null,"title":"mozart to jazz trio ecossaise delight ardrishaig","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowMid Argyll Arts Associationwas delighted to welcome Trio Ecossaise as guest performers at Ardrishaig Public Hall for the fourth concert of the season.The impact of Covid has meant that many planned concerts had to be cancelled or dates changed so it was wonderful to have Trio Ecossaise perform on March .The concert opened with the Kegelstatt Trio by Mozart. Much of the chamber music that Mozart composed was music for friends to perform and this trio is just one of these.Originally composed for clarinet, viola and piano, the viola part can be performed on cello as Harriet ably demonstrated. Very typically Mozart # easy to listen to and thoroughly enjoyable.On to the Craftsbury Trio, written by the American Gwyneth Walker. This trio has four movements, each depicting the small town of Craftsbury, Vermont.Up Country Toccata, The Lark in the Morning, You Can Buy It at the General Store, to the final movement Craftsbury Common depicting the green with a white picket fence.The movements are as descriptive as their titles and show many dferent skills on all instruments # fluttering sounds, jazz harmonies, numerous glissandos, syncopation, decorations and finishing with gentle rhythmic tapping.There is even a hint of Rhapsody in Blue in the third movement. If you only listen to one piece again this is the one and should be seen live,possible, and not just listened to.Rachmaninov’s Prelude in B minor for solo piano was Claire’s choice for the programme.This prelude, The Bell was Rachmaninov’s own favourite and was the one that he would often perform. The audience was delighted to be introduced to it by Claire.Brahms composed four chamber works which featured the clarinet later in le after a period when he wasn’t writing anything at all.This was the third trio of the evening and was again very dferent in style allowing Jenner , Harrietand Claireto demonstrate their considerable skills as a trio to a very appreciative audience.An arrangement of Consolation No. by Liszt for Trio Ecossaise was their encore.This was the second visit by Trio, and it is only a matter of time before they are welcomed back.There are two MAAA concerts planned for April # The Willow Trioand the Ugly Bug Ragtime Three.

MWh mega-battery system mounted on an articulated electric lorry.The battery would plug into specially-constructed charging points connected to dedicated wind turbines, with charging taking  hours.Fully-loaded, the mobile unit would travel to designated points around Argyll and Bute, allowing up to  cars to charge at any time, and around  in total before heading back for a top-up.Requiring simply a flatbed trailer, the transportation of the mega-battery is interesting Argyll hauliers, with some larger operators looking into purchasing electric tractor units specically for this job.With wind energy on tap # much of the time, at least # and locally produced, charging costs are expected to be signicantly lower than existing methods.A spokesperson for Argyll and Bute Council said: #The basic idea is that this simplies the charging process and broadens our options.#It will allow the council to better utilise electric vehicles, providing cost savings while saving the planet.#For residents and visitors, it will make planning journeys so much easier and stress-free, rather than wondering how far you will get before your battery runs out.#The rota for Flying Sparks has clearly yet to be finalised # though we expect it to very much utilise the same sites as mobile post offices and banks around the region.#A number of firms operating Argyll wind farms have expressed an interest, and a pilot scheme is expected to be in place by April , .Esisteinwitz Gesellschaft chief executive Olaf Prilo sees huge potential for the scheme. #You have wind to spare,# he said, #so why not use this directly, rather than sending electricity to the grid. Just roll up to the turbine, plug in and charge up the battery.#His firm is currently researching the development of the necessary equipment to enable clean, renewable energy to be utilised in vehicle charging.Mr Prilo concluded: #There is absolutely no reason why the Argyll and Bute region could not become the Saudi Arabia of electricity.#"},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert harbour open day hailed a success","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowThe trustees of Tarbert Harbour Authority say they are #delighted# with the success of a recent community day to discuss proposed improvements to Tarbert.More than  people attended the community day, held at the Templar Arts and Leisure Centre on March , to learn about and discuss early thoughts on plans to improve the range of opportunities, services and facilities available to Tarbert residents and visitors.Towards the end of  Tarbert Harbour Authority secured funding of £, through the UK Government#s Communities Renewal Fund as part of the Levelling Up agenda.This allowed the authority to appoint consultants who, over six months, will investigate and develop several major projects throughout the harbour and Tarbert village.After the design phase the projects will be taken to a further funding stage, the UK Shared Prosperity Fund, andsuccessful work will start on projects to transform and rejuvenate the village, harbour and its environs.The project team includes Leith-based John Renshaw Architects Mott MacDonald, an international civil and marine engineering consultancy and ruralDimensions a Callander-based tourism consultancy.Team members were on hand on March  to discuss concepts in detail and to discuss pros and cons, having prepared a presentation on  potential initiatives including re-organisation of the Fish Quay, creating more public paths and developing the existing boatyard.Everyone who visited was encouraged to fill in an exit questionnaire highlighting what they liked, what concerned them and to highlight alternative opportunities.Duncan Cunningham, chair of the board of trustees of Tarbert Harbour Authority, said: #We are delighted that people have taken the time to come and see initial thoughts and ideas on how the harbour and village could develop.#As with all these consultations, there are strong views on what is and isn#t appropriate.#We were delighted to get a range of other interesting ideas that we will now consider.#The next step is for the team to reflect on the feedback we have received and to build this thinking into plans. We will hold a follow-up session in May and present back updated thoughts.##If anyone would still like to comment on the initial proposals, they can get a form from the Tarbert Harbour office. The presentation can be accessed through the Tarbert Harbour website.#"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 18 2021 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 2 3 2 3 2 3 2 2","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.There are people all over Argyll and much further beyond who just want to help ease the suffering of the Ukrainian people.Well done to everyone who has opened their hearts, homes and wallets to people in desperate need.We highlight the generosity of the people of Tayvallich this week as an example of the warmth and kindness being shown across the region.Let us hope the situation in Ukraine eases in coming days and weeks, for the sake of the people.A wee bit of local knowledge goes a long way.

During this project Bill helped to find new ways of engaging with the local community.“After a particularly quiet drop-in session at a village hall, we came up with the idea to host drop-in sessions at local watering holes where we would have a captive audience,\" said Bill. \"By spending a few evenings speaking to locals in their local pub, we were able have more open discussions and from there developed links in with community groups.\"It sounds so simple, but the success of these sessions gave me the confidence that I could do the role and led to it being one of the projects I am most proud of.”Reflecting on the changes he saw with Scottish Water during the course of his career, Bill said: “There are two key things that have changed since I started.\"Firstly, the technology has come on immensely, from not using a computer until , to now where so many of our interactions are done on mobiles over social media, it really is a dferent world..remove\"Secondly, the business has become far more customer focused and caring over my career.\"We have learned to put ourselves in our customers shoes and are far more responsive to their needs – listening and engaging with customers to get the best results.“Some of my fondest and proudest memories of my le have been at work.\"My son and daughter both worked for Scottish Water at one point and excelled in their roles.\"Hearing about their hard work and talents from colleagues, made for some real proud dad moments.“Also, working alongside my own dad, I was able to share in his passion and show him my skills.\"I feel so lucky to have those memories now he is in his ’s.\"I guess you could say my family are very much a Scottish Water family.\"Peter Farrer, chief operating officer at Scottish Water, said: “I joined Scottish Water a couple of years after Bill and have worked directly with him at dferent points throughout my career.“It is people like Bill who have helped improve Scottish Water’s performance and reputation, while also making it a great place to work.

International Space Station hangs in the balance after the US, the EU and Canadian space agencies missed a deadline for the lting of sanctions on Russian enterprises and hardware.The head of Russia’s Roscosmos state agency told reporters on Saturday morning that the agency was preparing a report on the prospects of international co-operation at the station, to be presented to federal authorities “after Roscosmos has completed its analysis”.Agency chief Dmitry Rogozin implied on Russian state TV that the western sanctions, some of which pre-date Russia’s military action in Ukraine, could disrupt the operation of Russian spacecraft servicing the ISS.He stressed that western partners need the ISS and “cannot manage without Russia, because no one but us can deliver fuel to the station”.vw,vw,px, px\"Mr Rogozin added that “only the engines of our cargo craft are able to correct the ISS’s orbit, keeping it safe from space debris”.Later on Saturday, he wrote on his Telegram channel that he had received responses from his western counterparts vowing to promote “further co-operation on the ISS and its operations”.He reiterated his view that “the restoration of normal relations between partners in the ISS and other jointprojects is possible only with the complete and unconditional lting” of sanctions, which he referred to as illegal.Responding to western sanctions last month, Mr Rogozin warned that without Russia’s help, the ISS could “fall down into the sea or on to land”, and claimed the crash site was unlikely to be in Russia.Space is one of the last remaining areas of co-operation between Moscow and western nations.US-Russian negotiations on the resumption of joint flights to the ISS were under way when Moscow launched its military operation in

for some other settings such as places of worship and wedding or funeral ceremonies, however.Nicola Sturgeon said continuing to require facemasks by law for a further two weeks struck a \"sensible balance\" amid signs that the BA. Omicron wave in Scotland is beginning to peak or stabilise.The number of people in hospital with Covid fell from , to , in the past  hours The Covid threat level is expected to be reduced from medium to low during Spring, said the First Minister.Ms Sturgeon said: \"This phased approach strikes a sensible balance between our desire to remove this one remaining legal measure, and the common sense need for continued caution - not least for the sake of the NHS - while this wave of infection subsides.\"I recognize that face coverings are an inconvenience. However, given all the sacrice of the past two years, and in view of the current pressure on the NHS, I believe the vast majority of people will accept that for a further two weeks this is a proportionate precautionary measure while we pass the peak of this latest wave.\"It also provides some further protection to those who are most at risk from the virus.\"Compulsory face coverings have already come to an end in all other parts of the UK, with England - which briefly reintroduced them in December as part of its Plan B response to the Omicron wave - becoming the first to drop the requirement at the end of January.  #COVID infections continued to increase across England, Wales and Scotland in the most recent week, but decreased in Northern Ireland.These high infection levels are driven by the Omicron BA. iant https:t.co zjZZxROXBX pic CSjbiIxM In February, Northern Ireland switched facemasks from law to guidance, but still strongly advises the public to wear them in enclosed public spaces such as shops, bars, restaurants and public transport.Since Monday, people in Wales have no longer been required to wear facemasks in shops and on public transport, but they are still mandatory in health and care settings. The latest surveillance by the Office for National Statistics  indicates that the prevalence of Covid is highest in Scotland - with one in  people infected - despite the ongoing mask law. The next surveillance figures will be released on Friday.Surgical and cotton masks are known to be less effective against the highly transmissible BA. Omicron strain than previous iants, although FFP and FFP masks remain protective. Ms Sturgeon said the Scottish Governments decision to delay the lting of the mask law across the board from Monday was taken to protect the NHS. She said: \"We have taken account of the very high level of infection and the pressure on the NHS, and the fact that face coverings do provide an important layer of protection against transmission of the virus from one person to another.\"However, we are also mindful that the data may now be indicating a peaking of this wave of infection which should hopefully become more pronounced over the next couple of weeks.\"Source: Public Health ScotlandIt comes as weekly data showed a dip in Covid hospital admissions for the first time since the BA.

to make their dream a reality.A crowdfunder campaign is already under way, with the band, which now includes Sean Morrison, Stuart Neil and Gavin Lamont, offering ious incentives for people to donate.The money collected will go towards the task of producing the album, which is hoped will be released next year.Carl, who plays electric guitar, said before their departure: “That moment where we are literally holding the album in our hands, it represents eight years of being in this band.“Having something like that to look at, and everything we have learned over these years and everything that has happened – it is a huge part of our lives.“To see the real thing, a tangible thing, a culmination of that work on a disc, would be pretty special.”Carl and Scott, who also plays guitar as

to writing their own material.As to the origins of the band’s name, Carl and Scott previously lived on the town’s Woodbush Court, with three-foot-wide Logan’s Close the quickest way to High

been looking forward to heading out to Germany but revealed they had run into an unexpected problem: the studio exploded.A huge bang destroyed much of the building in the early hours of the morning at

album because before the pandemic we did a wee tour there.“On our travels, we met a guy called Dennis Rux, who was saying he had got a studio with all the analogue vintage gear. My eyes lit up and I was already thinking that was cool.“We stayed in touch and it got to the stage where we thought maybe we should pursue this. We hit him up and askedhe would be up for doing the album and we worked it out and are going over there to do it.“We cannot wait.”Logan’s Close, who headlined the Dunbar Music Festival last year, created the Crowdfunder page in a bid to raise thousands of pounds to cover the cost of the album.People can make a donation of anywhere between £ and £, in exchange for a range of incentives, including a digital download of the finished album and a live concert.The band are working alongside Creative Scotland’s Crowdmatch programme, where the national body match-funds initiatives as the band reach funding milestones.Already, more than £, has been raised.Former Dunbar Grammar School pupil Carl described the sum raised as “unreal”.He said: “We have not been up to much in such a long time [due to the pandemic].“It is nice to think that after two years, people are still supporting us.

The couple, who feature in the opening episode of the new series, bought the one-bedroom property in .: Burrell Collection:  must-see objects on show for the first time in a generationMcCartney and MacPhee, both , a solicitor and civil engineer respectively, were drawn by the possibility of a blank canvas that they could transform into a character-packed home.\"It is tucked away in the perfect spot,\" says McCartney, when asked what first caught their eye. \"It is on a nice, quiet street – but only two minutes away from the high street. It has everything going for it and we saw a lot of potential.\"It is small but there is just the two of us and the dog, so we thought, why not  We can live with a bit less space. It was a good-sized project but in terms of costs, we didnt have quite as much to do as some other people might in their first home.\"The living room of Lorne Cottage, Fort William. Picture: Ciara McCartney Not only did they draw up ambitious plans to decorate, re-style and furnish the cottage, but the pair set themselves a tricky race-against-the-clock, with the goal of getting moved into the finished house in time for Christmas – only three weeks after the sale went through.\"We gave ourselves a short time frame to get everything done, which probably made things harder, but it paid off,\" says McCartney. \"Whenever we had family and friends over helping, we reminded them of that deadline, and it pushed us all on a wee bit to get things done.\"It was November  that we bought the house. We were moved in by December with three out of four of the rooms done – the kitchen wasnt done until the February.\"Lorne Cottage, dating from the late th-century, is chocolate-box adorable, with a traditional, whitewashed stone exterior. Adding their own personal stamp, the couple painted the front door a pretty lilac shade, with matching guttering and drainpipes.\"We felt it deserved something quirky and cute,\" says McCartney. \"We knew we could get away with it because the rest of the house is so colourful. My granny always calls it the dolls house and it does make it look like a little pretend playhouse, which we like.\"A before shot of Lorne Cottage, Fort William. Picture: Ciara McCartney Inside, they have gone for a bold colour palette. With a smaller living room, the temptation might have been to plump for white or lighter shades, but McCartney says the pair had their hearts set on a statement dark blue which lends a cosy feel to the space.\"I had wanted a blue living room and a colourful sofa for ages,\" she says. \"I knew we would have that regardless of where we moved to and no matter what size the house was.\"I remember when we were testing the paint samples on the walls in the cottage, every single person who walked in said, Hmm, dont know about that, its a bit dark … but we knew we were going to do it anyway.\"Everybody was very sceptical of it. It is a dark blue, but we still managed to keep the room quite bright and light with everything  in it.\": Scotlands Home of the Year judge Kate Spiers on Skyes spellbinding charms The mustard velvet sofa adds a cheery burst of colour , while a mirror positioned above the fireplace reflects natural light streaming in from the dual aspect windows to make the room feel bigger.In fact, Lorne Cottage is a masterclass in how to make the most of every available inch in a pint-sized pad. \"We tried to save floor space by putting up floating shelves and sticking all of our nice things on there,\" says McCartney.The kitchen of Lorne Cottage, Fort William with collie Ghost. Picture: Ciara McCartney They have come up with other innovative space-saving ideas too. \"The TV on the wall in the living room we have it on a bracket, so we can push it out of the way when we are not watching it,\" explains MacPhee, talking about his favourite design elements.If there are a few people gathered in the living room, he says, that comes in handy, \"because there isnt a lot of space to socialise, but when it is just Ciara, our dog Ghost and me in the house, we can pull the TV out and watch it from the couch.\"McCartney is also a big fan of this clever feature. \"The TV forms part of the shelves when it is tucked away, right against the wall, so it doesnt take up too much space and it is not the main focal point of the room,\" she adds.Creating storage was a challenge but the pair have come up with some workable solutions. \"The hall cupboard is a total luxury space-wise because we didnt have that when we moved in,\" says McCartney. \"Before it was an open space with a washing machine.: Interior designer and TV presenter Anna Campbell-Jones on childhood sailing holidays\"We added a cupboard with bi-folding doors and lots of shelves. We have managed to hide our microwave, Hoover, dog food and all of our dry ingredients in there. Otherwise, we would have a kitchen but nowhere to store food to cook.\"Andall  fails  \"We do have a loft as well, which hopefully they didnt film for the show,\" laughs McCartney. \"That is not quite as lovely and colourful and organised as the rest of the house. If we are ever struggling for space, it gets fired up into the loft.\"One word: tiles. It is fair to say the couple have exquisite taste, from the rose pink-hued shower walls and black-and-white hexagon mosaic floor design in their bathroom to a star-patterned window ledge and luxurious, pearlescent splashback in the kitchen.\"That was definitely the most fun part for me,\" says McCartney. \"I absolutely loved it. I wish I had another  kitchens and another  bathrooms, so I could do it again. Arran is responsible for the bathroom floor – he chose those tiles to go with the pink.\"The bathroom of Lorne Cottage, Fort William.

The industrial-style shelving in the kitchen is filled with stylishly arranged utensils and knick-knacks.Cosy is the word that I keep coming back to with Lorne Cottage. \"That is the same as us, that is how we would describe it,\" agrees McCartney. \"We have lived here for a wee while now, but the novelty never wears off. Every time we walk through the door, we feel so lucky.\"The bedroom of Lorne Cottage, Fort William. Picture: Ciara McCartney When it comes to ideas, she loves scrolling on Instagram for inspiration. Is her focus on small homes and compact living  \"Not really,\" says McCartney. \"We always thought we would move to a big house first and then maybe be able to buy a small one afterwards.\"But the way things worked out, we got our small house first and it will be with us forever. The ideas we had were intended for a bigger house, but the opportunity arose, and we thought, why not  So, we used all of our ideas here.\"But even when the couple climb a few more rungs on the property ladder, Lorne Cottage will remain their first love, she insists. \"We definitely wont ever get rid of it.\"Scotlands Home of the Year s to BBC One Scotland, Monday, .pmFollow Ciara McCartney, Arran MacPhee and Ghost on Instagram @TinyWeeHoose"},{"url":null,"title":"world-heritage-status-bid-landmark-scottish-football-sites-steps","story":"With just six months to go before the th anniversary of the first ever international match staged in Glasgow, and which coincides with the World Cup in Qatar, campaigners calling for Scotland to be recognised as the birthplace of football are pulling out all the stops in their bid for UNESCO status.They have recently launched Hampdens Square Mile Alliance to help push for historic sites which have been linked to the formation of the modern game to be given their rightful place.Footballs Square Mile has been hailed by campaigners as the cradle of modern football, where some early players, known as the ‘Scotch Professors’, founded the modern passing and running game of football.Read more: Hampden site: Kick off for historic grounds Unesco world heritage bidIncluded in the square mile are the birthplaces of Queens Park, Celtic and Third Lanark, the site of Rangers first game, and the final resting place of several Scotch Professors.And now campaigners are hoping to spread the word even further as a series of walking tours will be launched next weekend and follows on from a the successful tours held last year.  The Three Hampdens Walking Tour kicks off on Sunday, April  with tours running through until September.

People are also being advised to take a test prior to visiting someone who is vulnerable.If you develop symptoms, you should continue to get a PCR test.On vaccination, the First Minister said: “The advice to everyone, of course, remains as important as ever – please do take the opportunity to get vaccinated as soon as you are able and make sure you get all doses of vaccine that you are eligible for. This remains the most important thing any of us can do to protect ourselves and others.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Now, many highly-skilled people have found themselves unemployed for the first time, and are considering new roles in new sectors.

We did not expect the extremely positive and proactive response we received from the jobcentre. The team was very helpful,# said Jordan.The support Elite got from the jobcentre was invaluable in streamlining and accelerating its recruitment process which would take up to five weeks.#Now, the jobcentre advertises our vacancies via a sector-based work academy.#Candidates attend a two-week course at Weston College, Yeovil, to gain their Scaffolding Operative Training Scheme and Health  Safety Certications, as well as to prepare for an interview. Now when we interview candidates, they already have a scaffold labourer trainee card and the basic knowledge and understanding of the scaffolding industry. What’s more, all this support via the jobcentre comes without the additional fees of private agencies.#Out of seven candidates, six were offered jobs and five have remained with Elite which has  qualied operatives.#The process was seamless and effective, providing quality candidates who were keen to learn.#Working with the jobcentre is a no brainer! As well as alleviating the burden of interviews that don’t progress into jobs, the savings in cost and time to get candidates suitably qualied are a bonus. It takes the pressure off our own resources and provides top quality candidates in the process.#‘Delighted’: Simon, Employer Adviser, Yeovil JobCentreOnce approached by Elite Scaffolding, also based in Yeovil, he set up a meeting with one of its office managers and worked out a bespoke recruitment package.As part of the programme, he contacted the local Weston College and together they “built” the course content.At the end of the two-week course, six candidates were offered a place on the apprenticeship scheme at a starting salary of £,.#Elite had exhausted all other channels to recruit and were delighted with the outcome#, he said.Moreover Elite referred other local employers to the jobcentre and Simon is running another sector-based work academy with a local roofing company.#The jobcentre has an incredible pool of talent.

Everything went through really quickly.#Continued the  year-old: “My team at JD were great from day one. They made me feel welcome and supported me. I spent six months on the placement and I got paid, too. It’s a proper job which was exactly what I needed. Day to day, I’d look after anything from HR queries and issuing contracts to payroll and pension questions. It gave me a whole picture of what it’s like to work in HR and I’ve been doing it ever since.“After six months, there was the option to stay on and I’m now doing an apprenticeship with JD. Once I’d finished with the placement I got started on a qualication – CIPD level three in HR support. It was another perfect step for me and I’ve now been there for a year.

When the space is tight, he’s good at beating the man and scoring. Steven has great space for improvement, he has to try to give continuity and to continue to work in the way that he’s doing.“For us, he’s an important player, the type whohe starts or comes in, he can change the situation, because of a specic characteristic of superiority. Create chances for himself or the other. He has to continue to believe in himself more.“He’s a young player with great space for improvement. He has to continue to work, to improve with and without the ball. To help the team at every moment because football is a team game and you have to be ready at every moment to help the team with or without the ball.”Bergwijn is likely to be on the bench again when Newcastle visit on Sunday.The Magpies are a far cry from the side that looked destined for the drop as Eddie Howe has led them up the table, though they have lost their last two games.Conte said: “I think for sure Newcastle is another team now. I know well the Newcastle manager. We played against him when he was the manager with Bournemouth.“He’s a young manager but you can see his idea about football. I think that he’s a really important prospect as a manager.“Newcastle signed good players during the transfer window and now for sure they’re another team. We have to pay great attention on Sunday.“They lost the two games but before they got points with all teams, low, medium or top teams. So for this reason we have to pay great attention.“It won’t be an easy game but we know this and we have tried to prepare very well for the game. We know that from now on, there are nine games and for us it’s very important to get three points because we want to finish as high as possible in this league.”"},{"url":null,"title":"chelsea-supporters-trust-says-members-not-support-ricketts-familys-bid  \n","story":"Data ed from the Piano meterActive meterExpired callback event.As a subscriber, you are shown % less display advertising when reading our articles.Those ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local services.

They are mining homes, mining equipment, even the bodies of people who were killed,” Mr Zelensky said in his nightly video address to the nation.“There are a lot of trip wires, a lot of other dangers.”He urged residents to wait to resume their normal lives until they are assured that the mines have been cleared and the danger of shelling has passed. vw,vw,px, px\"Mr Zelensky warned of dficult battles ahead as the Russians redeploy troops While the Russians kept up their bombardment around Kyiv and Chernihiv, Ukrainian troops exploited the pullback on the ground by mounting counterattacks and retaking a number of towns and villages.Still, Ukraine and its allies warned that the Kremlin is not de-escalating to promote trust at the bargaining table, as it claimed, but instead resupplying and shting its troops to the country’s east. Those movements appear to be preparation for an intensied assault on the mostly Russian-speaking Donbas region in the country’s east, which includes Mariupol.Mr Zelensky warned of dficult battles ahead as the Russians redeploy troops. “We are preparing for an even more active defence,” he said.He did not say anything about the latest round of talks, which took place on Friday by video. At a round of talks earlier in the week, Ukraine said it would be willing to abandon a bid to join Nato and declare itself neutral – Moscow’s chief demand – infor security guarantees from several other countries.The invasion has left thousands dead and driven more than four million refugees from Ukraine.Elsewhere, at least three Russian ballistic missiles were fired late on Friday from the Crimean Peninsula at the Odesa region on the Black Sea, regional leader Maksim Marchenko said. The Ukrainian military said the Iskander missiles were intended for critical infrastructure but did not hit their targets because of Ukraine’s air-defence forces. It was unclear where they hit.Mr Marchenko said there were casualties, but he did not elaborate.Odesa is Ukraine’s largest port and the headquarters of its navy.As for the fuel depot explosion, Russian Defence Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said two Ukrainian helicopter gunships flew in extremely low and attacked the civilian oil storage facility on the outskirts of the city of Belgorod, about  miles from the Ukraine border.The regional governor said two workers at the depot were wounded, but the Rosneft state oil company denied anyone was hurt.Oleksiy Danilov, secretary of Ukraine’s national security council, said on Ukrainian television: “For some reason they say that we did it, but in fact this does not correspond with reality.”In an interview with Fox, Mr Zelensky refused to say whether Ukraine launched the attack.Amid the Russian pullback on the ground and its continued bombardment, Ukraine’s military said it had retaken  settlements in the Kyiv and Chernihiv regions."},{"url":null,"title":"hong-kong-asks-7-4m-residents-voluntarily-test-covid-19  \n","story":"Data ed from the Piano meterActive meterExpired callback event.As a subscriber, you are shown % less display advertising when reading our articles.Those ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local services.

Raymond Gormley, Head of Energy Policy at the Consumer Council said: “It is important that consumers are made aware that their domestic gas bills will stay high for at least the next year because the wholesale price that the companies pay for the gas continues to be much more expensive than the norm. Unfortunately heating oil prices are also very high, so regardless of the fuel we use, many of us will experience extreme pressure on our household budgets. This will further increase the numbers of people in fuel poverty, as many families may struggle to find the extra money they will now need to pay for heating. “As the Winter   Emergency Fuel Payment Scheme ends today , we implore firmus energy, and the wider energy industry, to commit to financially supporting the continuation of a fuel hardship scheme in the coming financial year. For the longer term, it is clear that energy companies, policy makers, the Utility Regulator, charities and the Consumer Council must continue to work together to develop sustainable solutions to help support those in need as the problem of high energy prices will likely be with us for the foreseeable future.” Consumers who are struggling to pay their energy bills or struggling to pay to top-up their meter should contact their supplier directly for support.

The SDLP#s MP for the area, Claire Hanna, who romped home in the last general election with some , votes, around , more than the nearest candidate — expressed her shock at the turn of events. The constituency is also larger than East and West Belfast and is the most erse of all NI#s electoral areas, ing MLAs from five dferent parties: SDLP, DUP, Alliance, Sinn Fein and Greens. There is a term for this move by Sinn Fein we are all too familiar with: gerrymandering.What is most curious about this move is that, back in , proposed changes to electoral boundaries here that would seemingly have favoured the DUP were branded “gerrymandering to placate” Northern Ireland#s largest unionist party by Sinn Fein. This criticism was not voiced by one Sinn Fein representative or party spokesperson at the time, but at least half a dozen, in what was essentially a media blitz in a bid to put a spanner in the proposals.What is even more curious is that press statements on Sinn Fein#s website referring to said gerrymandering have vanished. If you simply google “Sinn Fein on gerrymandering” and click on any of the ious links which previously directed to statements from Conor Murphy, Colm Gildernew, Francie Molloy and others on the Sinn Fein website, you are greeted with the following  error message, reading: “We#re sorry, but the page you requested could not be found on our servers. We may have recently moved, renamed, or deleted certain pages.”It seems, much like the party#s previous stance on Russia, they are simply trying to avoid accusations of double standards and prone to extreme stance-switching when it suits them.Read MoreSinn Fein defend proposals to redraw Belfast’s electoral boundariesAn April Fool’s wish listDaily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Ah, April Fool#s Day. Given the state of world at the minute — war in Europe, the cost of living crisis on the tail end of a pandemic that hasn#t gone away - I was hoping we would give it a rest this year, lest we cause more unneeded distress. One humorous political wish list, however, was posted on Twitter by human rights organisation Participation and the Practice of Rights , reading: “‘Stick your hostile environment’ — Givan tells UK Home Office. ‘Mackies will be % social’ — Hargey takes action on housing rights. ‘Our policies are the problem, not you’ — Swann promises counsellors in every GP practice.” We can but dream.NI#s most unambiguous partyAn interesting press statement was released by the TUV on Friday, which declared that the party#s designation on the ballot paper for May#s poll will read: ‘TUV — No Sea Border’.Explaining the move, TUV leader Jim Allister said: “Having led where others have followed we wish every voter to see the issue identied without ambiguity on the ballot paper. There will be no doubt as to what a vote for TUV means.”Now, the TUV have been accused of being many things, but ‘ambiguous’ is definitely not one of them. Anyone with even a slight grasp of Northern Ireland politics could probably predict the party’s stance on any given issue before Jim Allister’s party has voiced its opinion. So this just seems like a needless waste of ink. I doubt anyone was going to be mistaken that they were actually voting for a bunch of liberal Europhiles.Related topicsSinn FéinSDLPConor MurphyClaire HannaMore On Sinn Féin PremiumGail WalkerOpinionThere’s an easy way for BBC NI to defend its broadcasters against toxic sectarian slurs PremiumPoles apart: politicians and experts split over election posters’ value PremiumSam McBrideOpinionA third of our MLAs weren’t put there by the voters... and it may get even worseDUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson claims Sinn Fein ‘solely focused’ on border poll PremiumCouncil concern for future of famous Derry store Austins amid fears it could collapseMost ReadSDLP MP Claire Hanna’s ‘shock’ over proposal by Sinn Fein to abolish her South Belfast seatRoy Reynolds murder suspect ‘asked mum’s ex for hedge clippers and sheeting at am’Having a laugh:  top office-themed pranks for April Fool’s DayArmagh joyrider who killed three people while making Snapchat videos and speeding at mph fails in bid to have jail time cutSacked PSNI officer guilty of ‘brutal attacks’ on his dogs narrowly avoids jailTop VideosPlayBrexit continues to ‘bedevil’ politics in Northern Ireland, Martin saysPlayPolice attend the scene of a serious RTC on the Springfield Road in west Belfast programme, which celebrates its th anniversary this year.

Credit: Graham Baalham-CurryAmy CochraneTwitterEmailApril   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailElection posters are on almost every lamppost on every corner of our towns and cities ahead of the big vote.Faces of the men and women hoping to take a seat at Stormont after May  stare down at us almost everywhere we go.But how effective are these posters as a form of advertising for would-be MLAs Some have argued they are a great way of showcasing the names and faces of candidates entering the election race, but others fear they are old-fashioned, crude and bad for the environment, with some placards also being stolen and placed on bonfires.Realistically, the only way to banish posters altogether isevery party agrees, but in Northern Ireland, consensus is a hard thing to achieve.According to PR expert Tom Kelly, posters and billboards are better at selling ideas here than in England, parts which have moved to more digital forms of canvassing.Mr Kelly, who has worked in PR for  years but also dabbled in politics as the former vice-chairman of the SDLP, told the Belfastposters could be a powerful advertising tool, even beyond facial and name recognition.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “There is a certain physical aspect to a poster or a billboard compared to just seeing the candidates’ faces on social media,” he said.“Not everyone can get to every constituent’s door, so [posters] a good way to get your face out there.“There’s also an element of competition between candidates where you may go to an area to canvas and you see your opponent’s name and face. “It makes you uneasy, and candidates really do get obsessed about how many posters they have up compared to others, so you’d be a brave man or woman to decide not to put them up. In reality, I would like to see none, but we aren’t quite there yet.”Mr Kelly used the Brexit referendum as an example of canvassing where posters and billboards influenced an outcome.“I remember crossing England in  and seeing the big Leave campaign billboard on the motorway from Manchester to Leeds,” he said. “You couldn’t not see it, and you started to notice they had a real presence.“Everyone remembers the big red bus that promised £m a week for the NHS. It may have been a lie, but it worked.“The Remain campaign, however, ignored those traditional forms of canvassing and instead focused solely on digital, whereas Leave did a bit of both.”While the PR expert sees merit in posters, they must be strategically placed.“I think most people would not want posters in their back yard but instead on main arterial routes in and out of towns and cities,” he said. “They could be a bit more effective in these areas, so as not to swamp residential areas.“For urban areas, billboards can be really effective, or a bus, whereas posters work better in rural areas.”Former Alliance party executive director Gerry Lynch believes that the colour, typeface and font of a poster can also have an impact.Mr Lynch, who was heavily involved in poster design and campaign tactics throughout his time in politics, explained: “Graphic designers have a very important job in elections that many don’t know.“Generally, Sinn Fein and Alliance would have the name of the party more prominent in the poster, and in some cases use posters with slogan words only and no photograph.“Unionist parties focus more on colour — reds and blues, which project strength — where they compete on which candidate can deliver the strongest for unionist interests.“It can come down to so many small details, even the fringing or shadowing on the image. “Graphic designers are able to express visual identity in a way most people don’t know. Even voters don’t know.”Mr Lynch, who was involved in the Alliance party for  years but is now a CoE priest based in England, said that in some areas across the water, particularly in southern counties, councils did not allow election posters in public spaces, with the tradition dying out over the years.“It’s a bit of a mix of digital canvassing and door-to-door, finding out where their supporters are and stopping voters from wavering to opponents,” he added.“While I don’t think posters with people’s heads on them make much of a dference on the campaign trail, Northern Ireland isn’t quite at the point yet where they can stop.“It requires everyone to stop — and everyone to agree.“I think a physical presence still matters, and the most impactful poster is one that resembles one of an advertising agency, more leaning towards a slogan than someone’s face.”The SDLP’s Colin McGrath has been involved in politics for almost two decades, being elected to his local council in  and becoming an MLA in . Next month’s election will be his sixth, and he believes that all posters should be banned.“They can be unsightly and many people don’t want to see them,” he said.“They’re also terrible for the environment, a waste of cardboard and plastic ties, but there is unfortunately an element of competition, which is the main motivator.“You see who has the most up where, and as soon as one puts theirs up, the others are at a disadvantage.“It can become white noise after a period of time, butyou’re a first-time candidate, you want to be part of the white noise everyone  is a part of. For things to change, it would need legislation.”Mr McGrath said posters mainly benefited new candidates but added that local media often played a bigger role.“Nine times out of , people say they recognise me from the local papers — the Mourne Observer or the Down Recorder — or sometimes social media and TV,” he explained. “Rarely do you win the election in the four or five weeks leading up to it. “People get to know you over the better part of a year or more.”TUV leader Jim Allister, however, believes that posters are “very much part of the fabric of an election”.The upcoming election will be Mr Allister’s fourth, after first being elected into the Assembly in .“Posters do serve a purpose, I believe, and an educational purpose as it shows voters who the relevant candidates are,” he told this newspaper.“They can also be a bit of a morale booster, in a sense, for each respective party.“They are very much part of the scenery of elections in Northern Ireland, and traditionally it has always happened.“There are occasions where you may see too many, but I don’t think that anyone here is going to give up on posters anytime soon.”Related topicsSDLPAlliance PartyJim AllisterSinn FéinColin McGrathTraditional Unionist VoiceMore On SDLP PremiumGail WalkerOpinionThere’s an easy way for BBC NI to defend its broadcasters against toxic sectarian slursAndrew MaddenOpinionElection briefing: From gerrymandering and an April Fools’ wish list to Northern Ireland’s most unambiguous party PremiumCouncil concern for future of famous Derry store Austins amid fears it could collapse PremiumSDLP MP Claire Hanna’s ‘shock’ over proposal by Sinn Fein to abolish her South Belfast seatSDLP leader Colum Eastwood condemns attempts to intimidate candidatesMost ReadRoy Reynolds murder suspect ‘asked mum’s ex for hedge clippers and sheeting at am’SDLP MP Claire Hanna’s ‘shock’ over proposal by Sinn Fein to abolish her South Belfast seatArmagh joyrider who killed three people while making Snapchat videos and speeding at mph fails in bid to have jail time cutHaving a laugh:  top office-themed pranks for April Fool’s DaySacked PSNI officer guilty of ‘brutal attacks’ on his dogs narrowly avoids jailTop VideosPlayBrexit continues to ‘bedevil’ politics in Northern Ireland, Martin saysPlayPolice attend the scene of a serious RTC on the Springfield Road in west Belfast programme, which celebrates its th anniversary this year.

Credit :Sinn FeinGarrett HarganTwitterEmailMarch   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailA victims’ campaigner has questioned the use of the Europa Hotel as the setting for Sinn Fein’s election launch, saying it’s a venue the Provisional IRA “systematically bombed”.On Tuesday, Michelle O’Neill gave a speech at the Great Victoria Street hotel, which was bombed  times during the Troubles.She outlined Sinn Fein’s priorities ahead of the upcoming election including the cost of living crisis and “fiercely defending” the Good Friday Agreement.“The facts are that the balance of power at Stormont has shted irreversibly and political unionism must come to terms with the fact the world is moving on fast,” Ms O’Neill said.“So, while the DUP and the TUV are trying to take us backwards, our message is clear, we are only moving forward.”Commenting on the choice of venue, Kenny Donaldson, spokesman for Innocent Victims United said: Sinn Fein clearly don#t do irony, to bleat on about upholding democracy at the very venue which the Provisional IRA systematically attacked again and again, making it the most bombed hotel in Europe is brazen to say the least.However, due to the intensity of the Provisional IRA#s bombing campaign — and that of other terrorists, few hotel venues across Northern Ireland have come away unscathed by the Troubles.”Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up TUV South Belfast candidate Andrew Girvin said Sinn Fein’s campaign launch at the Europa was a “grotesque spectacle” given the setting.“Here we had the political wing of the terrorist organisation which repeatedly bombed the hotel in which they met daring to ponticate about democracy and respecting the will of the people.“There is nothing undemocratic about refusing to operate the Belfast Agreement structures which could foist a Sinn Fein First Minister upon Northern Ireland.“The choice of venue for this republican jamboree underscores the fact that no unionist should ever agree to take up the position of deputy to a Sinn Fein First Minister.“Yet just weeks out from the election both the DUP and UUP are dodging this vital question.Will they act as bridesmaid to Michelle O#Neill  Why is there reluctance to be open and honest with the public on this point ”The DUP#s Gordon Lyons said Sinn Fein#s election launch demonstrates their priority lies on holding a border poll rather than on helping families or rebuilding Northern Ireland’s economy.The party#s director of elections said: Sinn Fein#s rally was a show of strength for a border poll.“Whilst the DUP has a five-point plan to build a better future for Northern Ireland, Sinn Fein wants to win the election to implement their plan for a border poll.“There is a clear choice on offer to people whether they want a future focused on fixing our health system, tackling the cost of living crisis and replacing the protocol, or one fixated on a isive border poll.“When Michelle O#Neill talks about making history, we know it isn#t record levels of investment into our hospitals she is referring to. Now is not the time for ision and uncertainty.That is why this election is so important.Sinn Fein has been contacted for comment.Speaking at an election launch, Ms O’Neill said that Sinn Fein will defend but not renegotiate the Good Friday Agreement.The former Deputy First Minister said those who hanker for the past need to realise that there is no going back, only forward.Sinn Fein#s Stormont leader also described the DUP#s collapse of the Executive as political vandalism, although her own party also brought Stormont down in the same Assembly mandate.She said: When the Assembly, Executive and North South Ministerial Council were restored in January  it was with a shared commitment to deliver the public services, societal reforms and future that our people need and deserve.It was ambitious to form a five-party coalition Executive, but it was achieved, getting us back to genuine power-sharing, and thankfully so, because while everyone knew there would be challenges ahead, no one could have predicted that in only a matter of weeks that our Executive would be dealing with a global pandemic that would have such devastating impacts on every part of society, community and people#s lives and livelihoods.It is to the credit of all ministers from across the five parties that they responded and have worked with a unity of purpose, and unity of leadership for the past two years.This is what the public want to see more of — co-operation and delivery.Ms O#Neill added: Sinn Fein will be defending, not renegotiating the Good Friday Agreement now, or in the time ahead.Ms O#Neill said the May  election was the most important in a generation.Related topicsSinn FéinMichelle O#NeillIRACost of LivingTraditional Unionist VoiceGordon LyonsThe Executive OfficeMore On Sinn Féin PremiumGail WalkerOpinionThere’s an easy way for BBC NI to defend its broadcasters against toxic sectarian slurs PremiumPoles apart: politicians and experts split over election posters’ value PremiumSam McBrideOpinionA third of our MLAs weren’t put there by the voters... and it may get even worseDUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson claims Sinn Fein ‘solely focused’ on border pollAndrew MaddenOpinionElection briefing: From gerrymandering and an April Fools’ wish list to Northern Ireland’s most unambiguous partyMost ReadSDLP MP Claire Hanna’s ‘shock’ over proposal by Sinn Fein to abolish her South Belfast seatRoy Reynolds murder suspect ‘asked mum’s ex for hedge clippers and sheeting at am’Having a laugh:  top office-themed pranks for April Fool’s DayArmagh joyrider who killed three people while making Snapchat videos and speeding at mph fails in bid to have jail time cutSacked PSNI officer guilty of ‘brutal attacks’ on his dogs narrowly avoids jailTop VideosPlayBrexit continues to ‘bedevil’ politics in Northern Ireland, Martin saysPlayPolice attend the scene of a serious RTC on the Springfield Road in west Belfast programme, which celebrates its th anniversary this year.

Credit: Brian Lawless PAMarch   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailThe UUP manesto has enough meat to show that the party is starting to think seriously about being a major player in the Executive once more, and enough bare bones to reveal that the process is incomplete.At , words, this document is serious in its scope and suffused with the liberal unionist tone of new leader Doug Beattie.But it is what this manesto does not say which reveals most: hard choices or unpopular proposals are either absent or presented in oblique terms — and that jars with Mr Beattie’s straight-talking style.Health is the first and the iest section — unsurprisingly, given that polling has shown Robin Swann to be Stormont’s most popular minister.The manesto indicates support for radical measures, saying that the pandemic has shown that both patients and medics are willing “to travel longer distancesit means receiving care and support in a more timely manner. It is essential that the opportunities currently before us are not lost”.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Read MoreNo united Ireland for generations to come, UUP leader insistsAndrew Madden:OpinionElection briefing: It’s battle stations for UUP, but indferent Tories need a nudgeThat seems to hint at support for implementing the decades of reports which say Northern Ireland has too many small hospitals, some of which need to be closed or downgraded to centralise expertise in centres of excellence.But the UUP is not explicit about this.There are other hints of centralising services — “a regionally consistent approach to cancer services across Northern Ireland” with “regional pathways and rapid diagnostic clinics”.The party also proposes greater evening and weekend use of theatres, but hints at the cost by saying it will mean “properly incentivising the move towards a genuine seven day a week health service”.Signicantly, the party says it would ban the use of contract agency workers — but only “once the immediate HSC pressures subside” .Health trusts are sharply criticised, with the UUP saying that for too long “sub-optimal trust performances [have been] tolerated”, something which suggests frustration at what Mr Swann has seen within the system.His solution is a new operationally independent HSC chief executive accountable to a board with political, professional and civic society membership, similar to the Policing Board.On the NI Protocol, the UUP says that “unionists cannot accept an internal border within the United Kingdom. There can be no border in the Irish Sea between Northern Ireland and Great Britain”.That simple commitment seems to prevent the UUP signing up to any revised protocol involving an Irish Sea border.Its tone is dferent to the DUP, talking about wanting to “maintain good relations with the EU”, but the content is similar to that of the ERG — pushing mutual enforcement, with a new north-south body to oversee this. A requirement to label GB goods coming into NI “for UK sale only” would only avoid a new Irish Sea borderit was enforced for all UK products.The party would ban gay conversion therapy, establish a gambling regulator, allocate overdue investment to football stadia, and examine letting private garages do MoT tests.The party opposes a Troubles amnesty and robustly says paramilitaries “need to be put out of business permanently” by focussing on their leaderships and criminal assets. It wants to curb legal aid, due to “the culture of lawfare which has been allowed to develop within our legal system and which has proved extremely lucrative for a number of firms”.The manesto is laden with more spending — new train stops, new busses, new roads, more rates relief for some businesses, spending on city deals,  more police officers, and looking at giving everyone in primary school a free meal.How this would be paid for is unclear. There is no talk of increasing rates. Water charges are ruled out. And giving Stormont more tax powers is also rejected. Changing the status of NI Waterand the Housing Executive to allow them to borrow is about as far as funding proposals go.This is a detailed document, yet many of the proposals are all things to all people – it is pro-business, but also pro-worker pro-grammar schools, but looking to review how academic selection operates, pro-EU, but anti-protocol.None of those things are necessarily contradictory, but in not being clearer about some of the most controversial or unpopular areas, the party is putting off having to take those decisions until after they’ve got the votes.Related topicsUlster Unionist PartyDoug BeattieThe Executive OfficeRobin SwannNI ProtocolMore On Ulster Unionist Party PremiumCouncil concern for future of famous Derry store Austins amid fears it could collapseAndrew MaddenOpinionElection briefing: It’s battle stations for UUP, but indferent Tories need a nudge PremiumJust £k spent as multi-million pound Northern Ireland football stadiums scheme lies idleCarrickfergus murder probe: Woman’s horror at reservoir body find PremiumSam McBrideOpinionDUP gains ground, but overall support drops for ided unionismMost ReadSDLP MP Claire Hanna’s ‘shock’ over proposal by Sinn Fein to abolish her South Belfast seatRoy Reynolds murder suspect ‘asked mum’s ex for hedge clippers and sheeting at am’Having a laugh:  top office-themed pranks for April Fool’s DayArmagh joyrider who killed three people while making Snapchat videos and speeding at mph fails in bid to have jail time cutSacked PSNI officer guilty of ‘brutal attacks’ on his dogs narrowly avoids jailTop VideosPlayBrexit continues to ‘bedevil’ politics in Northern Ireland, Martin saysPlayPolice attend the scene of a serious RTC on the Springfield Road in west Belfast programme, which celebrates its th anniversary this year.

Credit: Liam McBurneySuzanne BreenTwitterEmailApril   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailSDLP MP Claire Hanna has spoken of her shock at a Sinn Fein proposal to abolish the constituency of South Belfast.In a submission to the Boundary Commission, the party proposes the constituency is axed with its voters largely ided between two other constituencies — despite South Belfast having more voters than either East or West Belfast.Ms Hanna said Sinn Fein’s proposal “does not make any mathematical sense” and that residents would be stunned it was seeking to abolish Northern Ireland’s most politically erse constituency.Sinn Fein has been contacted for comment.South Belfast currently is the only constituency toMLAs from five dferent parties: SDLP, DUP, Alliance, Sinn Fein and Greens.Ms Hanna said: “Each of Belfast’s four constituencies has a distinct identity, community cohesion, and things they are proud of. South Belfast has for decades been known as a erse, integrated part of the city where people of all political views and none live side-by-side.“Many people chose to settle in South Belfast precisely because of that. This constituency is, and always has been, a shared space.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “It is pluralist in its politics and values, and I think residents would be very disconcerted and concerned at a proposal to break it up and to parcel bits off into other constituencies.”Read MoreTalks need to begin over scrapping mandatory coalition, says Arlene FosterThe rules for the  Boundary Commission review mean each constituency must have an electorate of between , and ,.North Belfastand South Belfastfall within the target range. West Belfastand East Belfastdo not.Ms Hanna lodged her objections to Sinn Fein’s proposal at a meeting with the Boundary Commission last month.“West and East Belfast are below the statutory electoral range by , and , voters respectively,” she said.“The high level of house-building in South Belfast, particularly in the Four Winds and Malone, together with the council’s determination to repopulate the city core, means the number of electors in South Belfast is going to rise further within a parliamentary term.“The Boundary Commission was happy for Northern Ireland to keep all its  seats. In previous proposals in , which were dropped, it had wanted to reduce to  seats, so somewhere would have had to take the fall.“Sinn Fein’s proposal is even more surprising when the Boundary Commission isn’t even looking to lose a seat.”Under Sinn Fein’s plan, Belfast would be reduced from four constituencies to three.East Belfast would remain, absorbing parts of South Belfast, and two new constituencies would be created — North West Belfast and South West Belfast.Ormeau, Rosetta, and Ravenhill would be moved into East Belfast. Malone, Stranmillis, and Finaghy would be put into the new South West Belfast constituency.Demographic trends suggest Sinn Fein would secure both the South West and North West Belfast seats at a Westminster election, with the SDLP losing out. The influx of South Belfast voters to the east of the city would help Alliance unseat the DUP there.In its submission to the Boundary Commission, Michelle O’Neill’s party says: “Sinn Fein believe that too much emphasis is placed in trying to keep Belfast as four-seater constituency which comes at the detriment to the rest of the constituencies.”Under the Boundary Commission’s plan, South Belfast remains largely intact, but gains the rural wards of Drumbo, Saintfield, and Moneyreagh to become South Belfast and Mid Down. Strangford would be renamed Strangford and Quoile.Professor Jon Tonge of the University of Liverpool said the commission’s proposed boundary changes were “fairly minimalist”.“Fermanagh and South Tyrone — very marginal — becomes fractionally more nationalist, which will please Sinn Fein. Foyle becomes a bit more nationalist, and East Londonderry a bit more unionist,” he said.Related topicsClaire HannaSinn FéinSDLPAlliance PartyGreen PartyMore On Claire HannaAndrew MaddenOpinionElection briefing: From gerrymandering and an April Fools’ wish list to Northern Ireland’s most unambiguous partySir Jeffrey Donaldson and Doug Beattie to share stage on youth mental health issues this weekendNorthern Ireland could be set to welcome Ukrainian refugees under new Home Office visa scheme PremiumJon TongeOpinionSDLP and Sinn Fein could swap unity manestos and no one would notice PremiumSDLP’s Colum Eastwood: ‘SF are focused on themselves and on securing jobs for their friends’Most ReadSDLP MP Claire Hanna’s ‘shock’ over proposal by Sinn Fein to abolish her South Belfast seatRoy Reynolds murder suspect ‘asked mum’s ex for hedge clippers and sheeting at am’Having a laugh:  top office-themed pranks for April Fool’s DayArmagh joyrider who killed three people while making Snapchat videos and speeding at mph fails in bid to have jail time cutSacked PSNI officer guilty of ‘brutal attacks’ on his dogs narrowly avoids jailTop VideosPlayBrexit continues to ‘bedevil’ politics in Northern Ireland, Martin saysPlayPolice attend the scene of a serious RTC on the Springfield Road in west Belfast programme, which celebrates its th anniversary this year.

In the meantime, we want to see  army personnel called out, just for Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, for the next eight weeks.They will help do the frisking at the security points and it will enable the airport to open all of the x-ray scanner machines in both Terminal  and Terminal  and keep the queues down,” he said.We need that combination of a dramatic recruitment drive by the DAA, we need the army in there at weekends and it’s reasonably small numbers –  army personnel would allow the DAA open up all the security things.”A DAA spokesman said the busiest time at the airport on Saturdays are between am and am when the first wave of departures takes place.He said the queues peaked just before am this morning when it was taking a maximum of  minutes to get through security. It was a busy first wave. Nobody missed a flight as a result of queuing for security,” he added.He said passengers were heeding the advice to allow more time at the airport and airlines were also opening their check-in desks earlier than usual which was helping to keep people moving.He said the airport will be busy again this afternoon and at around tea-time and urged passengers to be aware that it will be busy at peak periods.We’re doing all we can to alleviate delays for passengers, however, anyone travelling through Dublin Airport over the coming days and weeks should be aware that it might be very busy at peak periods.Our advice to passengers is to allow plenty of time. At peak times, this can mean up to three and a half hours before departure time. If parking a car, allow a further  minutes.Dublin Airport#s customer service team is working tirelessly with customers who have missed flights in recent days.Where security delays are found to have been the cause of a missed flight, DAA is issuing refunds to passengers. This process is ongoing and we ask affected passengers to bear with us over the coming days as we work through the ious claims,” he added.Read MoreTransport minister to hold daily crisis meetings over Dublin Airport queuesMost ReadSDLP MP Claire Hanna’s ‘shock’ over proposal by Sinn Fein to abolish her South Belfast seatRoy Reynolds murder suspect ‘asked mum’s ex for hedge clippers and sheeting at am’Having a laugh:  top office-themed pranks for April Fool’s DayArmagh joyrider who killed three people while making Snapchat videos and speeding at mph fails in bid to have jail time cutSacked PSNI officer guilty of ‘brutal attacks’ on his dogs narrowly avoids jailTop VideosPlayBrexit continues to ‘bedevil’ politics in Northern Ireland, Martin saysPlayPolice attend the scene of a serious RTC on the Springfield Road in west Belfast programme, which celebrates its th anniversary this year.

As humanity marks the th anniversary of continuous human presence in low-Earth orbit, a leading space expert in the UK has described the International Space Stationas an invaluable scientic resource.By Associated Press ReportersApril   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailRussia’s top space official says the future of the International Space Station hangs in the balance after the US, the EU and Canadian space agencies missed a deadline for the lting of sanctions on Russian enterprises and hardware.The head of Russia’s Roscosmos state agency told reporters on Saturday morning that the agency was preparing a report on the prospects of international co-operation at the station, to be presented to federal authorities “after Roscosmos has completed its analysis”.Agency chief Dmitry Rogozin implied on Russian state TV that the western sanctions, some of which pre-date Russia’s military action in Ukraine, could disrupt the operation of Russian spacecraft servicing the ISS.He stressed that western partners need the ISS and “cannot manage without Russia, because no one but us can deliver fuel to the station”.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news world-news fd .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_acae-d-b-a-ecff_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news world-news fd .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_acae-d-b-a-ecff_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news world-news fd .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_acae-d-b-a-ecff_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news world-news fd .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_acae-d-b-a-ecff_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Press Association Images FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueMr Rogozin added that “only the engines of our cargo craft are able to correct the ISS’s orbit, keeping it safe from space debris”.Later on Saturday, he wrote on his Telegram channel that he had received responses from his western counterparts vowing to promote “further co-operation on the ISS and its operations”.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up He reiterated his view that “the restoration of normal relations between partners in the ISS and other jointprojects is possible only with the complete and unconditional lting” of sanctions, which he referred to as illegal.Responding to western sanctions last month, Mr Rogozin warned that without Russia’s help, the ISS could “fall down into the sea or on to land”, and claimed the crash site was unlikely to be in Russia.Space is one of the last remaining areas of co-operation between Moscow and western nations.US-Russian negotiations on the resumption of joint flights to the ISS were under way when Moscow launched its military operation in Ukraine last month, prompting unprecedented sanctions on Russian state-linked entities.Most ReadRoy Reynolds murder suspect ‘asked mum’s ex for hedge clippers and sheeting at am’SDLP MP Claire Hanna’s ‘shock’ over proposal by Sinn Fein to abolish her South Belfast seatArmagh joyrider who killed three people while making Snapchat videos and speeding at mph fails in bid to have jail time cutHaving a laugh:  top office-themed pranks for April Fool’s DaySacked PSNI officer guilty of ‘brutal attacks’ on his dogs narrowly avoids jailTop VideosPlayBrexit continues to ‘bedevil’ politics in Northern Ireland, Martin saysPlayPolice attend the scene of a serious RTC on the Springfield Road in west Belfast programme, which celebrates its th anniversary this year.

Irsquod just broken up with my first girlfriend and I think it was me subconsciously expressing stuff about that.Confirming the sci-fi influence, Tim mdash who recently became a dad for the first time mdash said Girl From Mars mostly revolves around the verse and chorus.ldquoI wrote them as a slow little strummy thing and then when we worked on it as a band we rocked it out quite a lot. My little brother Pat was always my first port of call of seeinga song was good and then Irsquod bring it to [bandmates] Mark [Hamilton] and Rick [McMurray].ldquoI used to love going and knocking on his bedroom door and playing him ideas and I remember that he flipped out about the song and loved it. He had the idea for the quiet verse after the guitar solo and it was great.Tim said as soon as the band started playing it they got a really good reaction from their friends.ldquoI used to play stuff before Irsquod even fully written the lyrics wersquod play stuff at shows and Irsquod mumble my way through it. I donrsquot think I wrote the second verse until we actually recorded it two years later.ldquoI wasnrsquot too worried about lyrics back then, maybe because I listened to Nirvana so much and could never really understand them. Our manager and the record label were sure it was going to be a hit, so we put it aside until wersquod be able to promote it. We put it out as a single two weeks after leaving school and it just blew up.Meanwhile, as part of the Church Street investment plan in Downpatrick, around pound, has been earmarked for a shop front improvement scheme with the emphasis on painting and repairing existing facades.Elsewhere, it is proposed to spend pound, on what is being described as a ldquoconcept design of Church Street with the work due to be carried out by a consultant, with pound, earmarked for improving shop fronts in Bridge Street.Fteen thousand pounds has been earmarked for De Courcey Place in English Street to replace a number of heritage-style lamps and signposts, alongside the provision of new litter bins and planting out existing granite water troughs.Just over pound, is to be spent on other planting and landscaping schemes in the Church Street area, while there are also proposals for a new bus stop and power washing the area outside the former telephone exchange, with new safety railings installed outside  Church Street.There are also plans to invest pound, on new interpretation material highlighting the Tower Bell at Down Parish Church and the grave of United Irishman Thomas Russell in the church grounds.Last Christmas, new festive lighting was provided on the side of the Down Arts Centre and on trees in De Courcey Place.Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran has praised everyone involved with the work in Church Street, in particular, the talented artists responsible for the murals.ldquoCongratulations to everyone involved in the project designed to breath new le into this part of the town. Given the fact that it has missed out on major funding over many years, the pound, investment initiative is particularly welcome, he said.ldquoThe money will help property owners revitalise their respective businesses at a key part of the town where there are a number of family-owned businesses..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Ballynagross make it past Castlewellan  ","story":"BALLYNAGROSS progressed to the final of the Harry Clarke Cup after defeating Castlewellan Forest by way of penalty shoot-out at Ballyhornan on Friday night.Ballynagross arrived at the match looking for a fourth Harry Clarke final in a row, but Castlewellan Forest had momentum following a close win against Ardglass in the quarter-final.Ballynagross got off to the best start they could have hoped for after a great attack from their defence through the field found Philip Doran, who easily finished to put his side one up in the first seven minutes.Castlewellan stepped it up a gear when a throw-in close to the box found Aidan Dornan, who headed just wide.Castlewellan had an appeal for hand ball ruled out closely after in the Ballynagross box, with the referee having none of it.Ballynagross responded to the pressure from Castlewellan with a pass from Philip Doran to Shea McComiskey out on the right wing. McComiskey saw team-mate Joseph Burns in the mouth of the goal and looped the ball in, but Burnsrsquo effort goes just wide.Castlewellan had their first real chance on the th minute when their corner-kick met the head of Donagh Steele. However, the ball went just over the bar.Ballynagross got their second goal on the th minute after a throw-in from Ryan Tumelty to John Shields allowed the attacker to spray a pass to the right wing to find team-mate Doran. The lively lsquoGross forward found Joseph Burns and the chance was duly converted into a goal.With half-time nearing, it looked like Ballynagross would be going into the interval with a comfortable lead, but an error when clearing the ball from the defence enabled Castlewellanrsquos David Gilmore to close the lead to just a goal as the referee blew his whistle.Castlewellan came out in the second-half with an all out attack approach and it paid off through a corner kick in the st minute.This time Donagh Steele ensured the ball was going into the back of the net and the game was level. It was not to stay this way for long as the Castlewellan goalkeeper clearly took Ballynagrossrsquo Shea McComiskey down inside the box and a penalty was awarded.Connor Marron stepped up to take the penalty and finished well into the top left corner of the net.Castlewellan continued to push forward, but Ballynagross defence of Corey Davis, Connor Marron, Ryan Tumelty and Tom McNeill were holding strong.For the next  minutes it was pretty even, Castlewellanrsquos Sean Dornan took a chance on the edge of the box but Cathail Arnold easily saved. Castlewellan were awarded a free-kick close to the Ballynagross net, but David Gilmorersquos effort was straight at the goalkeeper.Ballynagross had a chance from a corner but it was well cleared by Castlewellan.Forest striker Shane Mooney found himself booked for his comments to the referee in the rd minute.Castlewellan were very much seeking out a goal to level and it came in the th minute after a scrap for the ball in Ballynagrossrsquo box resulted in Shane Mooney scoring with the last kick of the game to send the tie to extra-time.There were a few chances during extra-time for Ballynagross, although neither team could find a break through to escape the need for penalties. Castlewellan swapped out Brian McVeigh in goal for Sean Dornan.Ballynagrossrsquo Connor Marron, who had already scored a penalty during the game, was first to step up and easily converted.Castlewellanrsquos Shane Mooney and Ballynagrossrsquo Declan Dowie followed and both scored.Forestrsquos new lsquokeeper Dornan came out of the net and rushed his penalty, sending the ball over the bar.John Mahoney made no mistake to give his lsquoGross side a further advantage before Ciaran Stratton kept Castlewellan in with a chance.Ballynagrossrsquo John Shields walked up to take his penalty but the lsquokeeper saved to bring it level again.Eoin Travers converted his penalty and now it was sudden death.Tom McNeill confidentially scored his penalty meaning all of the pressure fell on Castlewellanrsquos Ryan Morgan to keep the game going.However, his effort was saved resulting in Ballynagross progressing to the final.Ballynagross: C Arnold, T McNeill, R Tumelty, C Marron, C Davis, J Polley, J Shields, J Burns, L Shields, P Doran, S McComiskeySubs: D Craig, D Dowie, J Mahoney, K Taggart, A Beattie.Castlewellan Forest: B McVeigh, C McCabe, C Stratton, C Burns, J OrsquoNeill, N Travers, S Dornan, D Steele, S Mooney, A Dornan, D Gilmore Subs: S Kinley, G Kidd, E Travers, R Morgan, J Murnin..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Dismal end to league campaign  ","story":"DOWN senior footballersrsquo miserable campaign reached its conclusion as they lost out on home soil to Clare on Sunday.The Mourne side entered this fixture already relegated from Division  and were hoping to gain some,any, momentum ahead of their crucial upcoming Ulster campaign.The uphill task will include having to better Monaghan on May  and then the winner of Cavan and Antrim to make the concluding stage to feature in the All-Ireland series and avoid ato the second-tier championship.Down took to the field in Newry against a Clare side who had endured a mixed bag of results within their league fixtures having won their opening three before losing the next trio of matches.For Down, the loss concludes a point-starved run of fixtures having finished with just one draw and six losses.Clare fielded what appeared to be a physically stronger outfit than their counterparts at Paacuteirc Esler and Downrsquos efforts werenrsquot aided by their lack of discipline.Both Gerard Collins and Pat Havern picked up black cards towards the end of each half while team-mate Finn McElroy picked up a red card with  minutes played.By that stage, the Mourne side didnrsquot appear to be getting anything from the game but that will be little solace to Down boss James McCartan, who has endured a nightmare beginning to his second stint at the helm.Aaron Grfin scored the first goal of the match with nine minutes played, courtesy of a smart left-footed finish which bested Kilcoo-native Niall Kane at his near post.To their credit, Down showed some resilience and managed to notch the next four from five points available with Burren man Liam Kerr kicking over a well-taken score amongst these.However, Clare continued to attack the Down goal and found their second major of the match thanks to Cian OrsquoDearsquos effort.His lowly struck shot took the wind out of Downrsquos sails and the Mourne side entered the break six points adrt at -

ndash The Government is poised to unveil an astonishing pound million scheme to replace the Strangford ferry service with a road tunnel under the lough.The scheme has already been approved at ministerial level and it is believed that the pound million originally intended for the Downpatrick bypass road will be used as start-up capital, with phase top-up grants being sought from the European Community and the Ireland Fund as the scheme progresses.Plans for the mile-long road tunnel have been drawn up by senior consultants engaged by the government and it is believed that the entry points will be manned toll booth terminals in Strangford and Portaferry.The move to replace the ferry service with a tunnel received an extra impetus recently when it was revealed that the ferry service was running at a substantial loss and villagers in Strangford vetoed plans for a new jetty for the vessels.Sources within the government say that the tunnel plan, which has been gathering dust for a number of years, has now been reactivated and local roads bosses intend erting the money intended for Downpatrickrsquos ring road to the scheme before the end of the financial year.Publicly, however, officials are remaining tight-lipped about the project. ldquoThe tunnel plan was first put forward several years ago, but as far as I am aware there are no plans to revive it, said a press

Malachyrsquos High School in Castlewellan, it has been revealed this week.South Down MP Mr Eddie McGrady said he has been informed of the commitment of the Department of Education to a new school in the town.ldquoAn investment appraisal has recently been carried out by the Department of Education to consider how best to meet the long-term needs of the pupils at St Malachyrsquos and this has come

ndash Teenagers, some as young as , are taking part in open-air drinking parties at secluded parts of Downpatrick it was revealed this week.The youth are paying adults to buy drink for them and then going to quiet parts of the town for their parties, a special meeting was told on Tuesday.The police have raided a number of these gatherings in recent months but the teenagers simply move to a dferent location and continue their drinking sprees.While the problem of underage drinking in Downpatrick has not risen in recent years it is nevertheless sufficiently worrying to prompt a group of local community representatives to get together to discuss ways of tackling the issue.Last week youth workers, headmasters, teachers, publicans and councillors met together under the auspices of the RUCrsquos Community Relations Branch and debated the causes and possible remedies of underage drinking.The end result of the discussion was that public awareness needs to be heightened, while teenagers, and their parents, should be appraised of the dangers of alcohol abuse in the young.Superintendent Ronnie Hawthorne, Downpatrick sub-isional commander explained that the problem is a province-wide concern and is not just confined to Downpatrick.He added that underage drinking is also taking place in other parts of Down District.ldquoThere is a problem throughout Northern Ireland and we cannot stop underage drinkers ourselves, we need the help of the whole community, said Superintendent Hawthorne.ldquoThere are a lot associated problems with underage drinking and we will talk to every interested body in a bid to cope with this matter, he added.The full extend of the problems were highlighted by the youth leader in charge of the Patrician Youth Centre, Siobhan Byrne, who has compiled a report on underway drinking which is to be presented to Down Council.KILLYLEAGH ndash The town of Killyleagh is set for a financial boost to help revive its economic, commercial and environmental appearance, it has been revealed.A preliminary application has been made to the International Fund for a core project to help trigger a revival in the townrsquos fortunes.And by the end of the year, plans to designate the town as a conservation area will be completed.The investment in Killyleaghrsquos future was revealed when the chairman of Down District Council, Mr Sean Quinn, officially launched proposals for the regeneration of the town.A special exhibition in the townrsquos library also features a display on the proposed conservation area for Killyleagh.Mr Quinn referred to community-led initiatives in Seeconnell and Strangford, and stressed the importance of a community coming together to take full advantage of the funding which is available to help themselves.The South Down MP, Mr Eddie McGrady, told the launch gathering that he has been delighted to assist the committee towards its goals of reviving the town.Mr McGrady said Killyleagh had recognised that it was very much an era of self-help.He looked forward to the day when Killyleagh is selected as the site for the Strangford Lough Liaison Office and is designated as the Gateway to Strangford Lough, fulfilling its tourist potential.LEITRIM ndash An  month battle to have a Leitrim footpath declared a right of way has found its way to Westminster.The Parliamentary Commissioner for Complaints has been asked to investigate Banbridge Councilrsquos handling of the matter after more than  people signed a petition asking for the adoption of the footpath as a right-of-way.The footpath, which is marked on ordnance survey maps dating from , sketches from the town lands of Slievenisky and Backaderry, through Carrivmoragh mountain and descends towards Leitrim by Heronrsquos Road.Local people claim that the path is very old and was once used to reach a Mass Rock on the Backaderry Mountain and in later times, to give a short-cut to the new church in Leitrim.It is also believed the footpath is part of the old highway system that existed before the road system was introduced, and links into a system of lanes that go to Ballynahinch.The Council first became involved in the matter in August  when the petition was formally presented, and shortly afterwards the council voted overwhelmingly to adopt the pathway, subject to legal opinions.However, for the next  months no progress was made on the matter until the council appointed a countryside officer in August . He prepared a report on the footpath, which came before the council earlier this month when it was decided not to adopt itAfterwards a statement from some of the local people seeking the right-of-way said the footpath passes over land belonging to  dferent families and only one has an objection to the council adopting it..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Good Morning Down co","story":"THE head of one of the districtrsquos leading charities is officially stepping down from her role next month.Linda Baker has been Good Morning Downrsquos co-ordinator for the past  years and has watched the organisation mdash which provides a telephone befriending service to elderly and vulnerable people across the district mdash increases its operation considerably.The charity provides a valuable leline service to many people across the district, with its hardworking volunteers in regular contact with those who feel vulnerable or at risk, making telephone calls to members at an agreed time each morning.Linda said the service was especially important during the height of the coronavirus pandemic with the deadly virus unfortunately curtailing get-togethers that were organised for clients.Working in partnership with the districtrsquos Policing and Community Safety Partnership, the South Eastern Trust and the Housing Executive, the charity has also received invaluable support from the Allen Lane Foundation and and Halax Community Foundation.ldquoWhen I joined Good Morning Down there were four volunteers making calls to around  people. Since then, the organisation has grown and the level of support we provided has widened considerably, Linda revealed.ldquoWe now have a team of  volunteers who are in contact with  people across the district. Despite the global pandemic, we continued to deliver the service from our homes with the calls even more appreciated by clients who could not go out themselves.Linda said that during the pandemic, the volunteers made an additional  calls to people, such was the need of elderly and vulnerable people across the community.ldquoWe started off calling people for a little friendly chat but the service we provided started to evolve. While chatting with clients remains at the heart of what we do to support those who are isolated, we now find ourselves helping people with a range of complex needs.ldquoThe charityrsquos work has evolved and I suppose it will continue to in the future, but Good Morningrsquos Down core principle will always remain the same.Linda paid tribute to all the charityrsquos staff and those who have supported the organisation over many years.ldquoWe are like family and I will be sorry to leave, she said. ldquoI have spent a large part of my working le with Good Morning Down and have literally lived and breathed the organisation and have been assisted by great people.Linda said it was ldquotremendous to meet clients when the charity organised its get-togethers and while these were put on hold due to the pandemic, she hopes there may be an opportunity do something before the end of the year.ldquoThat of course will be guided by the public health situation at the time as we are mindful that our clients are elderly, with a number of them also vulnerable.Linda said the charityrsquos service has never been more important and while she is leaving the organisation, she knows it will continue to be a key part of peoplersquos lives.She added: ldquoI really enjoyed my time with Good Morning Down and worked alongside really great people. They were the friendly voice at the end of the telephone who helped make a dference to peoplersquos lives.ldquoFor many, their chat with our volunteers was the only interaction they would have with others during the day and we were always conscious of that. We worked to make a dference and you build a special relationship with clients which is why it was so wonderful to see them when we all did meet up.As Linda prepares to say her final goodbyes, Good Morning Down is looking for someone to replace her at the helm of the charity.Anyone keen to take on taking on her role or interested in getting involved in the work of Good Morning Down is asked to contact her on    or email lindabakergmd@yahoo..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"History project looks back at  Jewish family’s links to Shrigley  ","story":"THE remarkable contribution of Jewish families in saving Shrigley has been recalled in a unique history project.The story of how Jews, fleeing the Holocaust and Hitlers murderous purge in Europe, started arriving in the village just before the start of the Second World War and helped transform the fortunes of villagers after the Hungry Thirties is largely forgotten.But more than  years later, Shrigleys legacy is featuring in an on-line interactive map telling the stories of Jewish families who have left a lasting impact on Northern Ireland.Steven Jaffe has been researching the heritage of the Jewish community across Northern Ireland.ldquoThe goal of the Belfast Jewish Heritage project Shared History fund is to locate, preserve, document and make publicly available material relating to the Jewish community in Northern Ireland, said Mr Jaffe.ldquoIt shows  sites across Northern Ireland, including Shrigley, Saintfield and Downpatrick.

They also cause signicant damage to wildle and the environment.Mourne Heritage Trust staff helped with the response to last weekrsquos wildfires using strimmers to create fire breaks, also helping with a controlled back burn and using its argocat all-terrain vehicle and fogging unit to extinguish one branch of a fire that was threatening some field boundaries.In addition, one of the Trustrsquos teams, along with a firefighter, used this specialist equipment to extinguish the fire at Finlieve near Rostrevor.NI Water has also warned that wildfires can have impact on drinking water supplies.The organisation controls so-called water catchment areas in the Mournes which supply water to all of Northern Ireland. The organisation said while it is working hard to deal with the problem of wildfires, it wants to assure customers that tap water quality is unaffected and is of a very high quality.But NI Water has warned that wildfires within catchments not only pose a terrible risk to all le but can remove the primary layer of vegetation, leaving the burned bare soil exposed to erosion which then makes its way into the reservoirs, from where water is abstracted for treatment to provide drinking water.ldquoThe erosion caused by wildfire increases carbon and other polluting chemicals signicantly in untreated water, with sediment accumulating in streams, lakes and reservoirs, said NI Waterrsquos Rebecca Allen.ldquoThis makes raw water especially dficult and more expensive to treat at our facilities to the stringent standards required by the Drinking Water Regulations. A signicant amount of other work by our water supply colleagues also has to be undertaken at the treatment works to ensure excellent quality drinking water during these times.Rebecca added: ldquoExtra water samples have to be collected and analysed, streams from burned areas need isolated, and other remedial measures must be taken like blocking streams to protect reservoirs.Mournes councillor Willie Clarke has praised firefighters, other arms of the emergency services and the Mourne Heritage Trust for their efforts to bring the blaze at the Bloody Bridge under control.He said firefighters in particular were overwhelmed by the support from the community.ldquoI witnessed the devastation of the wildfire first hand which impacted a site that is a protected habitat renowned around the world, said Cllr Clarke.ldquoThe emergency services, particularly local fire crews, should be commended for the professionalism they displayed when dealing with these incidents. However, malicious fires place a massive strain on very limited resources and as we approach the summer I would urge people to be vigilant and report any suspicious activity to the PSNI.Cllr Clarke said the damage caused by gorse fires has a lasting impact and that areas of outstanding natural beauty can take years to recover, calling for a co-ordinated response from the Department for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs, NI Water, health and public safety departments and the Department of Justice.He continued: ldquoWe need to see a collective response with a sharing of resources and there needs to be additional funding provided to build upon the best practice Mourne Heritage Trust has undertaken to reduce the impact of these fires in the High Mournes. Controlled burns and better land-management needs to be re-established.ldquoMeasures should include the establishment of fire breaks to reduce the fuel load and a cross-departmental strategic response to ensure that the scale of these fires should never happen again.Cllr Clarke said it is important that police proactively investigate what are environmental crimes and those responsible need to be assured that these types of crime will not be tolerated in society.South Down MLA Sinead Ennis has also praised firefighters for their efforts in battling huge fires in the Mournes which started at Hen Mountain and Spelga Dam.She added: ldquoTragically, these fires will have caused widespread damage to the environment and our wildle. This is yet another stark reminder that everyone must behave responsibly while visiting the Mournes in order to protect the environment and the safety of the local community..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Reality TV star Matthew visits ex primary school  ","story":"FRESH from Dancing With The Stars Ireland, TV star Matthew MacNabb and his new girlfriend took the chance to visit his former primary school last week.Matthew and his professional dance partner, Laura Nolan, visited St Patrickrsquos Primary School, Legamaddy, after making it to the semi-final of the top RTE show.The visit to the school, which the Downpatrickrsquos manrsquos brother and sisters also attended, coincided with the school celebrating news of receiving a sizeable grant.It has been awarded pound, which will go towards creating a pollinator garden in the school grounds.Pupils were delighted to show Matthew and Laura around the school, particularly its new outdoor learning hub which allows to have an outdoor classroom for eco projects.The schoolrsquos Eco teacher, Mrs Bronagh Reid, said the school was delighted to welcome Matthew back.ldquoHe was very friendly to all the pupils, who found him very inspiring, said Mrs Reid. ldquoIt was good that he called with us on a day off and it was down to his mother Margaret, who sits on our board of governors.ldquoWe were all hoping that Matthew would make into the final but very impressed that he cog to the semi-final.The schoolrsquos cash injection is part of the Rural Community Pollinator Grants Scheme, which is financed by the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairsand managed by the civic-pride campaign, Live Here Love Here.It is designed to allow community groups and schools across rural Northern Ireland to benefit from funding between pound, to pound, to establish, enhance or develop a local community pollinator garden.A pollinator garden is a shared space with pollinating plants, habitats, wildflowers, flowers, shrubs and trees, and the grants support new initiatives aimed at protecting and providing for pollinators.Mrs Sarah McDowell, principal, said: ldquoWe plan to use the money to create an outdoor learning space which will enhance our school grounds and the local community.ldquoWe will build an outdoor classroom and plant fruit trees to attract more wildle to our school grounds.`We are delighted to receive the support of Live Here Love Here to help us create this space which will benefit the children in our school and will help to improve bioersity in the area.She added: ldquoWe look forward to starting to create this area after Christmas and have it ready for the spring term.The pilot scheme, which made pound. million available for  , aims to cover % of costs to community groups and schools wishing to embark on the community environmental project.Successful grant applicants were required to illustrate their plans to maximise pollinator-friendly land-management techniques to increase the bioersity value of an area by planting for pollinators, and to transform unused spaces into valued community spaces, adding habitats and greening-up formerly grey areas..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Students involved in All Island lights switch off climate event  ","story":"THE lights went out at Stormont at the weekend thanks to ecologically aware local high school studentsA group of pupils from St Patrickrsquos Grammar School and Down High School, who are involved in the All-Island Schools  Climate Action programme, asked for the lights at Stormont to be switched off for one hour on Saturday evening.Local MLAs Harry Harvey and Colin McGrath helped ensure that the request was fast-tracked, with Mr Harveyrsquos we, Sharon, doing a lot of the work behind the scenes.Mr Harvey met with staff and pupils from the two schools in the grounds of Parliament Buildings to observe the dimming of the lights.Stormont joined in solidarity with the  countries from around the world that participated in the th anniversary of the global Earth Hour.

It has also generated an estimated £ million for the Northern Ireland Economy in that period.By a benign coincidence it was announced on Thursday that this summer a record  cruise ships will dock in Belfast bringing a much welcomed post-Covid wave of mass tourist spending across the Province.The waters through which the Titanic was launched and that HMS Caroline sped through to fight that decisive naval battle were in the th century the pathway circuits by which Belfast’s industrial revolution was turbocharged. In the st century these circuits are flowing back in the opposite direction, pulling millions upon millions of tourist-driven pounds into Northern Ireland’s economic heart, boosting expenditure and creating jobs after the devastation of the Pandemic. The city’s sea faring tradition both naval and merchant over the centuries is not only one to be proud of but also to take hope from. Belfast rose up around its lough and the Lagan. The news about Titanic Belfast’s first outstanding decade, the cruise ships , the salvation of HMS Caroline remind us of the regenerative power of the city’s waterway to the world.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

But when it comes to casting their ballots, up to % of people who go have hitherto gone to the polls in NI elections have voted for political parties who are primarily identied by their stance on the constitutional question.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.Even in recent elections the non-aligned centre ground, despite having surged , are doing well to get more than % of the votes.Do not be fooled by anyone who says that the protocol is only of importance to unionists, and that even many unionists do not care. Many of the people who make this point themselves care very much about the Irish Sea border — they want to keep it, either because they support staying in the EU , or because they see it as major step towards an economic united Ireland, and thus towards a more general all-Ireland.It is true that many of the more apolitical unionists are much more relaxed about the protocol than they should be, but that is typically because it is complex .It is also because such unionists heard that the protocol offered the best of both worlds .Thus unionists should have been, and should still be, trying to explain and reiterate to some of the more apathetic pro Union voters the ultimate impact of the NI Protocol. This would entail trying to revive some of the spirit of indignation that there was in the early months of , when many people across the Province were suddenly finding that they could not get deliveries from Great Britain that they had always been able to get before.The EU has been keen to agree to case-by-case exemptions to checks in part because it does not want the wider public to be troubled by the protocol. Needless to say, therefore, unionists badly need to see a large vote for parties that oppose the protocol.Doug Beattie’s approach to the Irish Sea border, of opposing it but calling for engagement in the pursuit of political solutions to the problems that it creates, has a high-wire quality. If the Alliance vote goes down, even slightly, on recent elections, and the Ulster Unionist Party vote increases, Mr Beattie will be able to say that his tactics have stemmed the decline of unionism by broadening its appeal.If Alliance continues upwards, and the UUP does not rise, he will be seen to have not only been weak on the protocol, but having failed to win over moderates in the process.l The second key thing to watch out for in the election is turnoutThere was a time in the s and early s when it seemed voters in the western world were losing interest in politics.Countries such as the UK and United States were increasingly wealthy and many bitter political disagreements of the s and s seemed to give way to a more bland, moderate politics. In Northern Ireland itself, this wider trend towards consensus seemed to be reflected in the  Belfast Agreement. But this sense of stable politics has evaporated, at home and abroad. There are now bitter ides on major issues of national and global importance, and much turbulence in voting patterns.The Brexit referendum of  had a higher turnoutthan most recent UK general elections have done.The Scottish independence plebiscite in  had an even higher turnout .The fiercely contested, and narrowly decided, US presidential election between Donald Trump and Joe Biden in November  had one of the highest turnouts of any presidential race in modern memory .In Northern Ireland, the turnout surged from % of voters in the  Stormont election to % a year later, in the more fraught atmosphere of the election after Sinn Fein collapsed the institutions.There is now keen interest in conflicts and politics at home and abroad. Before Russia invaded Ukraine, I feared people in the UK would not care much, seeing it as a distant problem. I was relieved to be proven wrong by the massive interest there was in such a serious global matter.A high turnout next month would show that the population in NI still think that Stormont and issues such as the protocol matter.l The final thing to watch is the vote shares of the two communitiesWill it be like the  general election, when the DUP and Sinn Fein dominated thingsor like  when they plunged to a combined % Will unionists get a combined vote share in the high s %, as in the  and  Stormont elections, or will they be down round %, as in  Westminster  Will nationalists combined get more than % of the vote, as they have done in some elections, or go back under that level It will be a bad day indeed for unionismthe combined vote is as low as %, as some polls have suggested, or even in the high s.ProtocolNorthern IrelandDoug BeattieBen LowryIrish Sea  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularRamadan : What is Ramadan  Ramadan dates  - and how to wish someone a happy RamadanIt’s nationalist Brit-bashing that really fuels sectarianism – not Brexiteers‘TUV - No Sea Border’ given approval for ballot papersLough Neagh is shrinking and could be gone by All Translink bus services to be ‘paralysed’ as drivers vote for industrial action over pay, union announcesMost PopularTen of the best Mother’s Day afternoon teas from UK supermarkets and online stores for Mothering SundayBest women’s walking trousers for hiking : hiking trousers reviewed, from Arc-Teryx, Jack Wolfskin, AcaiBest head torches UK : bright, reliable head torches for camping, hiking, and mountaineeringBest Aldi dupes : top perfume, skincare, beauty, makeup, cleansing balm products from Lacura to le CreusetBest air beds for camping UK : inflatable beds to keep you comfy from Outwell, Vango, and Snugpak                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-jQrDum sc-fvxzrP bUrEZo ivPtAx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisUkraine CrisisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.Provision of Covid tests by government are changing.However free testing will persist in NI for some time yet subject, to some changes. Stormont Health Minister Robin Swann says that testing will continue to play a vital role in Northern Ireland’s response to COVID- over the coming months but that a “more targeted approach” will be introduced on a phased basis from April, with the focus on supporting and protecting those at highest risk of serious illness.Under the new policy, PCR testing in NI will cease for most people with symptoms from  April - however free lateral flow tests will continue to be available to the public to use should they develop Covid symptoms.Lateral flow tests will also continue to be available free of charge to support those living in, working in or visiting a higher risk setting, such as a care home, until the end of June, with a further review then.The policy covers testing and contact tracing and takes effect from  April. No changes will be introduced in Northern Ireland until that date. The policy will be kept under review during the period of transition up until the end of June.The full range of changes to take effect from  April in Northern Ireland are as follows-* PCR testing will no longer be recommended or available for most people with symptoms. It will still be available to support the small group for whom it is recommended for clinical reasons. The PCR home ordering service will remain available for the general public to support those for whom PCR is recommended.* Publicly accessible COVID- testing sites will close. Local Health and Social Care Trusts will continue to provide PCR testing to support clinical care.* Those with symptoms will be advised to use lateral flow devicesto test instead of booking a PCR. This will be kept under review and could remain in place up to the end of June depending on disease trajectory.* Routine asymptomatic testing - testing for those with no symptoms - will continue to be advised for those living, working and visiting health and social care settings including hospitals and care homes and other high risk settings in line with public health advice. This will be kept under review.* Asymptomatic LFD testing for the wider population will cease. Access to free LFDs for this purpose will cease.* Routine asymptomatic workplace testing will cease.* Routine asymptomatic testing in most educational settingswill cease at the Easter break.* Asymptomatic testing in special schools will continue after Easter and will be kept under review. It may continue until the end of June .* Routine population contact tracing will be phased out between mid-April and the end of June.Chief Medical Officer Professor Sir Michael McBride said: “We will continue throughout the transition phase to support and protect our most vulnerable. After these changes are introduced from  April, I would urge people to check on NI Directtesting remains recommended for them - for examplethey are eligible for new treatments. In the coming weeks, the Department will also be working to provide advice and support to those eligible for treatments. It is particularly important that those who are at higher risk of serious illness follow the guidance on getting tested.”The Chief Medical Officer added: “The tools at our disposal to protect people who are at higher risk from COVID- have advanced considerably since the early days of the pandemic. Alongside the vaccine and booster programme, new COVID- treatments continue to be used by patients in Northern Ireland and new treatments are in development.“As the amount of testing across society reduces, our behaviour and actions have an even more important role in preventing transmission and keeping others safe. I urge everyone to continue to follow the public health guidance including continuing to wear a face covering in enclosed settings like public transport and when visiting hospitals and care homes.”The changes do not take effect until  April, and current testing provision will continue until then.A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityWe asked the people of Barry and Penarth on their thoughts of the reduction of the summer school holidays from six weeks to three, which could come in under plans to modernise the academic year.The Welsh Government has not said anything on when or how any changes could or would be introduced but it has been greeted with a mixed reaction.Sarah Timmins said: “Don’t confuse school with childcare. Continue with six weeks holiday in the summer at least! We get the shortest summer break in the world. State should provide free affordable childcare.”Trena Wise said: “Four weeks would be better and spread the rest throughout the year.” This was agreed with by Lisa Gerrard.Trudi Thomas said: “Five weeks and an extra week off at Christmas.”Iulia Condurache said: “These kids need this. Where is this obsession to work more is coming from  School is enough, work week is too much. Cut the bloody huge pays, tax the rich properly, educate for sustainability not waste and you will have a balance.”MORE NEWS:Kelly Crowther said: “No. By moving the extra leave to October and December is going to cost me so much more to entertain the kids. At least in the summer we can hopefully enjoy the sunshine and free stuff as parks and beaches.”Lynne Bryan said: “Yes definitely they get to many holidays as it is.”Luna Davies said: “Perhaps four weeks but the last week of school is turned over to fun activities without academic focus. Add the other week in to Christmas. If it comes after Christmas, the kids should have enough to do to entertain themselves.”Paula Chapman said: “Id rather four weeks to be honest. And let the kids have an extra week at Christmas and Easter. Six weeks is just a bit long by week four they are usually bored and craving a bit of normality and routine.”.removeMike Corbridge said: “No... probably parents wish it was shorter. I had six when I was a kid and it wasnt long enough.”Tracy Lewis said: “Yes.... six weeksis way too long.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityIt seems over the years, Barry Island seems to be the shining light of identity for the Barry and District.However, many times have I been asked this, \"Karl-James Langford, was Barry Island ever an island \"Well, I could ignore the question and reply in a sarcastic way, but one, never does. For when you look at the area today, it is dficult to think of a time when Barry Island was just that an island surrounded by water at hightide.For after  for all those dams, and bridges built across The Sound, slowly dragged Barry Island to the mainland. The water logged landscape has now been lost within a landscape of housing and other development.Barry Island until  was nothing more than a place lost in time with a rundown farmhouse, outbuildings and forgotten about sacred wells until things changed. Francis Crawshay purchased Barry Island in  a very eccentric man, who saw that his new home The Marine Hotel, was to accommodate friends visiting him on the Island.You may add that the image we examine today is of a dferent structure. The original Marine Hotel of Francis Crawshay building on the start of Friars Point, was eventually renamed Friars Point House, at which point the original name became redundant. However, as Barry Island became a focal point of day trippers, and visits for those building the dock, accommodation was required.Now, towards the end of the s, the Barry and District saw the construction of a number of Hotels, and  of which, after being opened never received the licences for the purpose they were built, such as the Sea View Hotel on Dock View Road, which became the Sea View Labour Club.One of these new purpose-built hotels one of which was on Barry Island, however opened in , and adopted the name The Marine Hotel, as it was no longer being used for the grand building Friars Point. The Marine Hotel on the corner of Plymouth Road and Friars Point, was infact a much larger building than you can find today alas some parts of it were demolished over the past few decades. However, what building still remains although it is now been converted into flats, is still impressive..removeBack in the day, in the late s you entered through a very impressive Portico entrance, with stone details picked out in Portland stone. The rest of the structure utilising locally sourced Red brick. The Marine Hotel was the place to stay on Barry Island, with an array of fine rooms to stay it, after a long summer evening eating icecream on the sands of the Bay, oryou had been visiting the Barry and District on business.Now when viewing the building facing onto Friars Road, the scroll work surrounding the lettering entrapping the words  MARINE HOTEL. This is an echo of times when we built in a much grander way. Most of the buildings of note were built to last in the late s, in such a way the Marine Hotel was constructed.One thing of final note is that one local resident told me story that The Marine Hotel was a haunt of Leguards and Coastguards from Barry Island. And then ironically inquests were held into deaths caused to drowning, and other reasons at the Marine Hotel also.Many thanks for joining us this week. More from our enigmatic Barry and District next week. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

We asked our membership whether, based on information in the public domain as of April , they had confidence that the Ricketts family would run an inclusive and successful club, and we asked whether they supported the Ricketts family’s bid.“Our members have given a clear message in this regard:  per cent of those who responded do not currently have confidence that the Ricketts family would run an inclusive and successful club, with five per cent of respondents believing they would.“Similarly,  per cent of members who responded do not support the Ricketts family’s bid for Cha FC and three per cent of respondents are in support.“It is essential that the new owners of Cha FC have the confidence of the supporter base and demonstrate an understanding of the values that we stand for.” vw,vw,px, px\"Sir Martin Broughton, pictured, is among those battling to buy Cha Abramovich put Cha up for sale on March , amid Russia’s continued invasion of Ukraine.The -year-old was then sanctioned by the UK Government on March , with Downing Street claiming to have proven his links to Vladimir Putin.Cha have been granted a special Government licence to continue operating, though under strict terms.Abramovich cannot profit from Cha’s sale, but had already vowed to write off the club’s £.billion debt.LA Dodgers part-owner Todd Boehly and British business titan Jonathan Goldstein, Sir Martin Broughton and Lord Sebastian Coe, the Chicago Cubs-owning Ricketts family and Boston Celtics co-owner Stephen Pagliuca are the four remaining contenders..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Cha Supporters u Trust says its members do not support Ricketts family us bid article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityParents and carers can arrange appointments for Monday onwards through the NHS vaccines website or by calling  from am on Saturday morning.NHS England said hundreds of sites will offer jabs from Monday, with more coming on stream throughout the week.Some five million children are eligible for the jab, following on from the success of the campaign to vaccinate vulnerable youngsters with health conditions.Most new appointments will be at local vaccination centres or community pharmacies outside of school hours, and there will be walk-in clinics available, with timings on the NHS grab a jab website.NHS England said more appointments will be added throughout the week so anyone unable to get a convenient slot should keep trying.Children will be offered two doses of the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, at least  weeks apart, at a third of the normal strength.Families will be given a vaccination record card with the name of the vaccine, batch number and the date the vaccine was given.Calum Semple, professor of child health and outbreak medicine at the University of Liverpool, told Sky News: “This is now a vaccine-preventable disease and the vaccine is safer than the disease. vw,vw,px, px\"“It’s a very unpleasant illness for children. Andthey have a weakened immune system orthey live in a family where a member has a weakened immune system, the consequences can be devastating.“So yes I am pleased.”Prof Semple, who advises the Government as part of Sage, said the vaccine will reduce days lost from education.Dr Nikki Kanani, GP and deputy lead for the NHS Covid- Vaccination Programme, said: “From today, parents of almost five million five to -year-olds can book their little ones in for a vaccine, ensuring they get their first dose of protection and helping to protect against potential future waves of Covid-..remove“Vaccines remain the best defence we have against the virus – my -year-old son has had his two vaccinations and I’ll be booking my -year-old daughter in for hers at the earliest opportunity, and would encourage all parents to read the NHS information available and consider doing the same.”Health and Social Care Secretary, Sajid Javid, said: “From Monday, the NHS will be rolling out the non-urgent offer for Covid vaccines for all children aged five to  in England.“Parents,they want, can take up the offer for their children to increase protection against Covid as we learn to live with this virus.“Children without underlying health conditions are at low risk of serious illness from Covid and the priority remains for the NHS to offer vaccines and spring boosters to adults and vulnerable young people, as well as to catch up with other childhood immunisation programmes.”.push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Covid- jabs: Children aged five to  can now get appointments article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

They are mining homes, mining equipment, even the bodies of people who were killed,” Mr Zelensky said in his nightly video address to the nation.“There are a lot of trip wires, a lot of other dangers.”He urged residents to wait to resume their normal lives until they are assured that the mines have been cleared and the danger of shelling has passed. vw,vw,px, px\"Mr Zelensky warned of dficult battles ahead as the Russians redeploy troops While the Russians kept up their bombardment around Kyiv and Chernihiv, Ukrainian troops exploited the pullback on the ground by mounting counterattacks and retaking a number of towns and villages.Still, Ukraine and its allies warned that the Kremlin is not de-escalating to promote trust at the bargaining table, as it claimed, but instead resupplying and shting its troops to the country’s east. Those movements appear to be preparation for an intensied assault on the mostly Russian-speaking Donbas region in the country’s east, which includes Mariupol..removeMr Zelensky warned of dficult battles ahead as the Russians redeploy troops. “We are preparing for an even more active defence,” he said.He did not say anything about the latest round of talks, which took place on Friday by video. At a round of talks earlier in the week, Ukraine said it would be willing to abandon a bid to join Nato and declare itself neutral – Moscow’s chief demand – infor security guarantees from several other countries.The invasion has left thousands dead and driven more than four million refugees from Ukraine.Elsewhere, at least three Russian ballistic missiles were fired late on Friday from the Crimean Peninsula at the Odesa region on the Black Sea, regional leader Maksim Marchenko said. The Ukrainian military said the Iskander missiles were intended for critical infrastructure but did not hit their targets because of Ukraine’s air-defence forces. It was unclear where they hit.Mr Marchenko said there were casualties, but he did not elaborate.Odesa is Ukraine’s largest port and the headquarters of its navy.As for the fuel depot explosion, Russian Defence Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said two Ukrainian helicopter gunships flew in extremely low and attacked the civilian oil storage facility on the outskirts of the city of Belgorod, about  miles from the Ukraine border.The regional governor said two workers at the depot were wounded, but the Rosneft state oil company denied anyone was hurt.Oleksiy Danilov, secretary of Ukraine’s national security council, said on Ukrainian television: “For some reason they say that we did it, but in fact this does not correspond with reality.”In an interview with Fox, Mr Zelensky refused to say whether Ukraine launched the attack.Amid the Russian pullback on the ground and its continued bombardment, Ukraine’s military said it had retaken  settlements in the Kyiv and Chernihiv regions..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Zelensky: Retreating Russians leave mines behind article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Her hand-painted ‘Welcome to Banbridge’ mural in Newry Street celebrates the Brontë link to the area using typography inspired by the world’s most famous literary family.Artist Friz pays homage to the town’s most famous landmark and Europe’s first ever flyover, Downshire Bridge. The mural of Irish physicist Professor Ernest Walton at Bridge Street.

Inspired by the area’s linen history, Rob Hilken’s mural at Linenhall Street depicts damask linen with a Jacquard weaving pattern that was created by local linen mills. The chrysanthemum damask design used was created by William Liddell and incorporates the distinctive pattern found on Jacquard loom punch cards, which were used to create the complex damask designs that made the Banbridge area world-famous for its linen.Belfast-based artist and illustrator FGB’smural at Bridge Street celebrates the town’s association to Irish physicist Professor Ernest Walton who was educated at Banbridge Academy Preparatory School. Friz at Downshire Place. Picture: Edward Byrne PhotographyHe won the  Nobel Prize in Physics for his pioneering work on splitting the atom nucleus. Dublin-based Decoy’s mural at Scarva Street celebrates Banbridge as a strategic river crossing point, a communication route between Belfast and Dublin and a focus for agricultural industry, trade and commerce. An ancient king’s road connecting Ulster to the rest of the island once crossed the Bann at a forging place a short distance downstream at Ballykeel.In addition to the new street art, one of Banbridge’s most iconic landmarks - a B-listed monument dedicated to Captain Crozier which memorialises his contribution to polar exploration - has undergone signicant restoration work.Holly Pereira on Newry Street.

With his ear for a good story and eye for detail, Jack, who founded the historical group in , takes readers on a mirthful trip down memory lane.       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

They gradually gained popularity with the audience and, being held on the Monday night before the annual May Fair Day, reflected the atmosphere of jollication that pervaded the town at this special time of year.An eye-catching image from Ballyclare.“The music was provided by ious groups of instrumentalists – fiddlers, accordionists, tin whistle players – and their sessions were interspersed with songs, recitations and stories by local inidual entertainers drawn from the lore and culture of the Six Mile Water region. Many of these songs and much of the material came from an oral tradition and few were available in written form.”Verses of material from local ‘balladeers’ Ernie Scott, Sandy Robinson, Jock Gilmour and Matt Meharg together with short biographical details of these and many others feature in the pages of the book.Jack continued: “Sadly the concerts came to an end when the security situation dictated that crowds gathering in halls became impossible. The Historical Society planned to celebrate the th anniversary of the founding of the society in  by reviving the Rhymes and Ructions concert in  but the outbreak of the Covid- pandemic put paid to their plans.”In his introduction to Rhyme and Ructions Jack, who is the author of a number of local history studies including ‘Stories of a Letime’, also reveals what inspired this latest publication.Author Jack McKinney with his latest publication.“What I am endeavouring to do here is to compile a collection of the ballads and anecdotes that proved so popular at the concerts. The tone and subjects of the ballads y considerably from the amusing to those of a more contemplative nature. As for their credibility I leave the readers to assess this for themselves.”Jack has pursued his interest in local history and its characters with zeal since retiring in  after a four-decade career as an assistant and principal teacher in east Antrim primary schools. The former Mossley Primary School pupil, taught at Abbots Cross, Ballyclare and Whitehead Primary Schools. And in the manner in which he inspired many pupils, Jack is keen to share his enthusiasm for knowledge with a whole new generation of readers.A founder member of the Ulster-Scots Language Society, Jack added: “The ballads are recorded in the style of language used in the originals – standard English or Ulster- Scots. The stories and other text may contain either or both. I have often followed the style of a mixture of Ulster -Scots and English as in the Scottish ‘Kaleyard’ novels, familiar to readers of Archibald McIlroy’s books, where the conversational dialogue of characters is in Ulster-Scots with the rest of the narrative in standard English.”The ‘Wreck of the Never Budge’, ‘Courting and Possible Consequences’ or ‘The May Fair and lots of Houzeldoo’ provide a hint of Ballyclare May Fairs past and possible inspiration for future balladeers and storytellers.

Dunluce Centre be reinvested in upgrading the Portrush facilities.And, the Portrush Youths management are calling on other councillors to back the proposal.DUP Cllr John McAuley, seconded by Portstewart DUP councillor Mark Fielding, has tabled a notice of motion with Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council which reads:“That Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council commits to reinvest a portion of the proceeds from the recent sale of the Dunluce Centre in order to upgrade the facilities at Parker Avenue in order to ensure that they are up to a safe and suitable standard for all

We told you that the tree used to make ballot paper – Flora Plio – was in short supply. Of course there’s no such thing as a Flora Plio, which is an anagram of April Fool. Our paper production expert, Poppy Cox, was indeed a load of poppycock, and of course we couldn’t do an April Fool about paper without mentioning foolscap. And we had to make our ‘official’ statement at midday because,we hadn’t, we’d be the fools for carrying on!  The forthcoming election is set to be postponed for a fortnight due to insufficient amounts of the correct type of ballot paper, we understand. It is believed that the specic type of tree used to make the paper - Flora Plio – has been in short supply in recent months. Paper production expert, Poppy Cox, explained why this specic type of tree was used for the production of ballot papers. “It has a special waxy quality that prevents the mark you make on your ballot paper being rubbed out,” said Mrs Cox. “That obviously adds an added level of security to the elections and stops people claiming that their ballot has been changed.” Alternatives are now being sought and the two week delay in the vote will hopefully allow for the ballot to be printed on a dferent type of paper. “It is possible that we could see a special kind of foolscap being useda secure alternative can’t be found,” Mrs Cox added.
