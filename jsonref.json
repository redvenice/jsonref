Scientists tracking the constantly-evolving virus admit the strain is \u0027difficult to track\u0027, however.Public Health England told MailOnline only two confirmed cases of the South African variant have been spotted in the UK since the pandemic began.But health bosses said they hoped that there would be an update on just how prevalent the variant has become later this week.The strain can only be identified through sequencing the genomes of samples — which would then reveal whether it had the tell-tale mutations.Only a fraction of positive tests are sent on to COG-UK for further investigation, meaning the South African variant could still be spreading. The consortium — consisting of the NHS, public health agencies and 13 universities — is considered to be the best genomic sequencing programme in the world.Standard PCR tests that diagnose Britons with Covid cannot spot the South African strain because it looks too similar to the original variants. But the Kent mutation is much easier to track because it can be spotted through the standard swabs due to its genetic make-up, experts say. There has been international panic about the South African strain because has key changes to its spike protein which open the door to it being resistant to vaccines. UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps warned today the current wave of vaccines might not protect against the South African strain of coronavirus.Mr Shapps said introducing a mandatory test and release system for travellers coming into the UK had become \u0027much more urgent\u0027 because of the threat the variant poses to Britain\u0027s mass vaccination programme.But there was confusion about the timing of his comments, which came just hours after a study by PfizerBioNTech suggested their vaccine could be just as effective against a mutation in the super-transmissible strain.The UK has made it compulsory for travellers to test negative when they arrive in the country in a bid to keep the viciously-infectious strain out. Flights to and from South Africa have also been banned.Mr Shapps told Sky News: \u0027This is an extra check and we\u0027re doing this now because there are these variants that we\u0027re very keen to keep out of the country, like the South African variant, for example. \u0027There are the concerns about the South African one in particular about how effective the vaccine would be against it so we simply cannot take chances. So today because of that variant it has become much more urgent.\u0027 The Pfizer study – which hasn\u0027t been peer-reviewed yet – tested how well the vaccine worked on the key N501Y mutation, an alteration on the virus\u0027s spike protein which is thought to be responsible for making it far more infectious than regular Covid. And because current vaccines work by training the immune system to recognise the virus\u0027s spike protein and attack it, there were fears this change could render jabs useless, or less effective. Results showed that neutralising antibodies were made against the mutation, which is also found in the highly-infectious Kent variant that is spreading rapidly across the UK. But both strains contain a catalogue of mutations, and the researchers have yet to prove that the vaccine works against them all. The researchers took blood samples from vaccinated patients and exposed them to a strain of the virus with the N501Y mutation. Phil Dormitzer, one of Pfizer\u0027s top viral vaccine scientists, said the vaccine stimulated a strong immune response against the altered virus, which he described as \u0027good news\u0027. However, the findings are limited because the research only studied the N501Y mutation and did not look at the full set of alterations found in either the new UK mutant strain or the South African one. Both strains have more than a dozen mutations, although most of them have no impact on the way it spreads and affects people.Another mutation found in the South African variant, called E484K, which is not found in the UK version, is also concerning. It also seems to help the virus disguise part of its signature spike protein.Dr Dormitzer said it was encouraging that the vaccine appears effective against the N501Y mutation, as well as 15 other mutations the company has previously tested against.\u0027So we\u0027ve now tested 16 different mutations, and none of them have really had any significant impact. That\u0027s the good news,\u0027 he said. \u0027That doesn\u0027t mean that the 17th won\u0027t.\u0027The researchers plan to run similar tests to see if the vaccine is effective against other mutations found in the UK and South African variants and hope to have more data within weeks. "},{"url":null,"title":"Irelands coronavirus cases soar record high R rate THREE","story":"Share this articleCoronavirus Ireland: R number could be as high as 3 as 6,521 new cases and 10 further deaths confirmed - Independent.ie"},{"url":null,"title":"Nurse catches Covid three weeks getting vaccine","story":"Share this articleNurse catches Covid three weeks after having first vaccine dose - as expert warns jab takes weeks to build immunity"},{"url":null,"title":"One medic reveals reality rhetoric","story":"Share this article Our schedule is based on three vaccinators working 9am to 7pm, giving a jab every five minutes. On paper, that looks do-able, until you think about the reality of dealing with elderly, sometimes frail, patients who need time to move around, remove their layers of winter clothing and so forth.Throw in the strict social distancing requirements and it becomes trickier still, especially when you consider the additional personnel in the building required by the guidelines: as well as our three vaccinators, there has to be a GP on site, two healthcare professionals and a team of five marshals to shepherd the patients around.Wed, December 16, V-Day OneThe big day arrives. My job is to take the vials and convert them into syringe-dosages, following a labyrinthine series of procedures which require such delicate handling we have taken to calling them our little ‘V-babies’.First the vials are removed from the fridge into a light-proof bag — they are light-sensitive as well as heat-sensitive.I then take out the first six vials, mark them with a special time label, and leave them for ten minutes to get them to room temperature, before inverting each vial ten times and adding 1.8 millilitres of sterile saline and withdrawing the same amount of air.They then have to be inverted another ten times before another date and time label is added.With over 20 years’ experience, I’m used to this kind of painstaking procedure, but I can’t help thinking that for many of the groups proposing to join the ‘vaccine army’ it would be somewhat daunting and time-consuming. Unlike the flu jab, which comes ‘arm-ready’ as it were, this is more complicated. If the Government’s going to hit its targets, there will need to be some swift training factored in.I’m intrigued by the instruction to only take five 0.3 millilitre doses out of each vial and throw away what’s left.Out of interest I drew the last dose out of one vial and discovered it was 0.5 millilitres, which strikes me as a dose wasted. But rules are rules.The day passes quickly, and it’s heartening to learn from my vaccinating colleagues that every single one of their patients was so grateful to receive it, although some of them expressed guilt at being at the front of the queue and said they felt key workers and teachers should have been vaccinated first.The day ends on a happy note when we learn that the traffic warden we’d spotted hovering outside wasn’t handing out tickets, but helping our elderly patients out of their cars and taxis.It’s a Christmas miracle!Thu, December 17Another change from NHS England: overnight they decide we can now take six doses from each vial. That means we suddenly have 65 extra doses spare, and can vaccinate more patients. Our team hit the phones again. Every dose used is another life protected.One step forward . . . two little hiccups back. Our IT system goes on the blink for an hour and a half, while we learn one of our marshals has called in sick with Covid.Fri, December 18Another busy day, and by 4pm, as we count the number of patients left waiting, with a handful of no-shows through the day, we realise we’ll have a few vaccine shots left over.But as the clock runs down, we’re nearing the use-by deadline. Quick! We hit the phones to rally local healthcare professionals within a one-mile radius who, unlike more elderly patients, can get here pronto. We want to ensure not a precious drop is wasted.We finish at 9pm, following an exhausting 12-hour shift: everyone had fitted the equivalent of a standard full NHS working week into three days.We’ve administered 1,031 doses, we’re all knackered, and my knees hurt, but there’s a real buzz.I spend much of Saturday morning trying to catch up on the Christmas shopping I’ve had no time to do, only to discover that afternoon that my area is to be plunged into Tier 4 rules, meaning non-essential shops will have to close. Sorry, kids, Santa’s been a bit busy.Mon, December 21It’s a return to normal business, as I try to catch up with all the patients I’ve had to cancel from my usual clinics to work on the vaccine roll-out.That means everything from smear tests to ‘frailty reviews’ — managing elderly patients’ end of life plans, and whether or not they would like to be resuscitated in the event of cardiac failure. There’s a slightly grim irony in undertaking the latter with a patient who, just a few days earlier, had been given a life-saving jab.It feels like saying: ‘We’ve helped save your life, now how would you like to die?’Wed, December 23I thought I was off for Christmas, a time to recharge the batteries, but lo and behold the holiday’s interrupted with another goalpost-moving missive from NHS England, this time informing us they are going to extend the period between the two vaccine doses from three weeks to 12 weeks.This means that any area which started administering their vaccines on or after Wednesday 16th needs to cancel those patients due their second jab, and book a thousand new patients in for their first instead.Oh, and we can’t even tell the first thousand when they should come back, as the vaccine supply is so patchy at the moment we can’t make plans that far ahead.How on earth can we make those 2,000 phone calls in time? On a good day, one ‘telephone terrier’ working flat out can reach about 120-150 patients a day.Frantic conversations between health chiefs ensue, until a pragmatic solution is reached. Huge relief!Nonetheless, given all the coverage in the media, we still have to call all 1,000 patients to reassure them their appointments are going ahead.Tue, January 5, 2021Hallelujah! The second lot of vaccines arrive at our hub on schedule. This time I’m at least expecting a man-in-a-van, not the Messiah.Wed, January 6Round two gets under way. It feels calmer this time as we’ve established a good working rhythm. With a fair wind, we’ll pick up speed, but the fiddly nature of the Pfizer jab means it’s surely going to be a huge challenge to scale-up on a national level.The Government are making promises to have administered 12 million doses by mid-Feb.As my eye-rolling teenager would say: good luck with that.Fri, January 8Another day of mixed news. Our final tranche of Pfizer jabs is marred by the IT system used to register all vaccinations — called Pinnacle — going down for most of the morning.Now all 480 patients due in will have to be logged by hand and inputted onto the database at a later date.I worry the system is struggling to cope as more and more hubs join the national roll-out.On the plus side, we get the first arrival of 400 doses of the alternative ‘Oxford’ or AstraZeneca vaccine, which are to go to local care homes as they’re more transportable and require less gentle care than our Pfizer V-babies.On paper, this is good news — if only we weren’t all so hampered by NHS England’s obsession with running all vaccinations through specific designated ‘hubs’ like ours.The reality of this is that the maximum number of front-line vaccinators we can have working from the hub at any one time is four, whereas if we were allowed to give it out at our usual local GP surgeries too, I could have two vaccinators working at each of our ten sites — taking that number up to 20.That’s a huge potential to upscale, if only NHS England would listen. Overnight, we got another missive from them saying the Oxford vaccine can at least be delivered to different sites, but still no clarity on whether it can be administered there, too.If it can’t, then I’m afraid Boris’s pledge of delivering two million doses a week doesn’t stand a chance, especially given the baffling reality that by the time you read this, our hub will stand empty and unused.At the time of writing, we have no further vaccine deliveries scheduled. And so we wait . . .After all our efforts, it’s disheartening. And very worrying."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b2d4f3c0dfb9590b02e57d619f6b13c47c28600/0_103_3776_2265/master/3776.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=17fa53b70ae47eaac33520d98d3a85dc","title":"great walls of china beijings burgeoning graffiti scene in pictures","story":"A thriving graffiti culture has been brewing for decades in Beijing, featuring Chinese characters, animals of the zodiac ... and complaints about the price of pork "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec5b0a205d01c084010913773751b3351bb54aa9/0_0_5156_3494/master/5156.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=d9d417f7128fddd360a4e36455a38d8d","title":"dont rush into rash decisions how to survive if your income drops","story":"The economic downturn has hit the finances of many in the UK, leaving them wondering how they’ll get by. Time to turn to the experts for some tips ... From pay freezes to furloughing and reduced working hours, 2020 changed the financial circumstances of many people, so it’s not a shock to find that more than a third of British people are worried about their finances as a result of the Covid-19 crisis, according to Aviva.The pandemic has shown that the future is impossible to predict, but surely that’s all the more reason to prepare for the unexpected when it comes to your money.Resist kneejerk reactionsSelling your car or leaping into a less-than-ideal job can seem like sensible moves when your financial circumstances change suddenly, but it’s not the time for kneejerk decisions. “Never rush into rash decisions because of loss of income,” says Laura Stewart-Smith, Aviva workplace savings manager, “Instead, take time to think things over before taking any action in relation to your finances.”Impulsive reactions aside, moving quickly to take stock and regain control of your finances is something Stewart-Smith recommends for anyone faced with loss of income. “Don’t delay in facing the facts – doing so sooner rather than later is likely to be better for your wellbeing, and can actually help you feel better compared with the uncertainty of not knowing your true financial position,” she says.Build a budgetIf your income drops, your first task should be to draw up a revised household budget. Cheryl Sharp, founder of the accountancy firm Pink Pig Financials, recommends analysing bank statements from the past three months to track where your money goes and identify savings you can quickly make.“Categorise everything into how important the spend is – for example, your mortgagerent is critical but a take-away coffee is a luxurynice to have,” she says.With your budget in place, you can formulate a plan to live within your means and avoid or get out of debt. But don’t start a budget and then forget about it. “Share it with someone you trust for accountability, and then track, review and adjust your budget as your circumstances change,” says Sharp.Don’t forget to include annual costs. Plan to put money aside each month towards those once-a-year bills, so they don’t come as a surprise.Pick up the phone“Talk to your bank and any other financial providers you have relationships with because they may be able to help,” says Stewart-Smith. “Ask what’s available in your circumstances, and whether you can review your package or defer payments. You might have payment protection that can kick in if you lose your job or experience loss of income, but you won’t necessarily know unless you pick up the phone and speak to those experts.”Don’t ditch insurance“Check whether you’ve got insurance policies designed to help if the worst happens, such as payment protection insurance, mortgage payment protection insurance or short-term income protection insurance,” says Jay Lee, a mortgage adviser and founder of uAcademy, which provides training for mortgage advisers. “They might be part of a bank-account package or a mortgage add-on product, so you may not even realise you have them.”It can be tempting to cut costs by ditching insurance policies when your income changes. “Don’t – your home is your castle and you should protect it, so buildings and contents insurance is a must,” says Lee.Reviewing your home insurance policy, however, does make sense when your finances change. “If you’re worried about unexpected expenses during a period of reduced income, you could invest in add-on packages such as boiler repair or accidental damage and home emergencies policies, which will cover these eventualities.”Ponder your pensionIf you make fixed monthly payments into a pension, it may be worth switching to a flexible plan if making the payments is too much of a financial stretch. “It’s also worth reviewing your pension, as you may be paying higher annual charges than you would in a different scheme,” says Lee.While paying lower charges today won’t immediately put money in your pocket, you could end up with a bigger pension pot in the future, making you better off when you retire.Start a rainy day fundHaving an existing savings pot can help soften the blow when the unexpected impacts your income. Even if you haven’t got that to fall back on, don’t make the mistake of thinking saving is only for when finances are flush. The best time to start saving is now.“Some people believe they don’t have any spare cash to put away for emergency savings, but this is rarely the case,” says Claire Roach, founder of Money Saving Central.“Even when your income is reduced, put as much as possible into an emergency fund each month – aim to save three to six months of basic living expenses so you can take control of your finances during times of illness or unexpected loss of income, and continue to meet your financial obligations.”Consider new income opportunities A loss of income can hit hard, but it can sometimes yield new opportunities. Lee lost his job in fraud investigation for a UK bank during the first lockdown, but it prompted him to launch his business running online training courses for mortgage advisers, which now turns over £5,000 a month.“It was an extremely worrying time as not only had I lost my job, but lockdown meant I couldn’t find any other work to keep me going until the situation improved,” he says.“I set up my business hoping it would cover a few of my bills, but within weeks I was making enough money to keep running my household.”Above all, remember that support is available when your financial circumstances change. “Take all the practical steps to shore up your finances and make sure your money is working as hard as it possibly can for you. Also, check whether you can apply for any benefits, speak to your tax office to see if you’re eligible for rebates, and look into tax-efficient investments and savings vehicles,” says Stewart-Smith.“Then remind yourself that the situation is not your fault. Loss of income is very often outside of an inidual’s control. But there are many organisations that can help. You’re not alone.”The views expressed in this article do not constitute financial advice.

Try not to panic, say experts, because retirement savings are long-term investmentsCovid-19 has turned the world upside down, sending Britain into its worst recession since records began. People may worry about what this means for their pension pot, wonder whether they can afford to save, or even consider raiding their retirement fund. What is the reality for pensions in a recession and how can you secure your future in uncertain times?Don’t panicSeamus Walsh, a pension guidance expert for Aviva, says that many people were spooked by the impact of the virus on stocks and shares earlier last year: “When big drops occurred in the markets back in March, some customers asked to switch funds. But ... things have been tracking upwards since.”Any panic may well be misguided as pensions are meant to be long-term investments that ride the highs and lows of stock markets. After the last financial crisis, pension funds recovered their losses when equities rebounded. This time round, while stock markets have been volatile since Covid-19 struck, news of potential vaccines has helped them, and pension funds, to recover lost ground.“Pensions investments are for the long term,” says Walsh. “The longer your money is invested, the longer it has to recover from any dips.”Where is your money? “People should know where their money is invested and be comfortable with the balance of their portfolio,” Walsh says. “Your pension provider can discuss your options. If you’re prepared to pay for advice, seek out a financial adviser.”While equities have had a volatile year, fluctuations should even out over time. Cautious investors may opt for a more balanced portfolio, with some money invested in cash or government bonds, which are regarded as a safe haven. Age is another factor – those nearing retirement may move more money into bonds as they will need to access their cash soon, while younger savers have more time to make up short-term losses.Choose the right pensionMany people struggle to understand pensions but given their importance, it’s worth spending time getting your head around the details. Final salary, also known as “defined benefit”, pensions are the gold standard, but many employers have moved away from providing such generous schemes that give a guaranteed retirement income. More common are defined contribution schemes where employees build up inidual pension pots through their contributions and those of their employer. They know what they are putting in, but the payout is less certain, as it depends on the performance of the markets and your pension provider in managing your fund.Under automatic enrolment, a government initiative to increase the number of people saving for retirement, employees are automatically signed up for the pension their employer offers. As long as you don’t opt out, you will make contributions alongside your employer, and receive tax relief on the money you pay in.Alistair McQueen, Aviva’s head of savings and retirement, says: “For employed iniduals, any money they pay in is boosted by their employer under automatic enrolment. They can’t access money until they are 55, but they do get money from their employer they wouldn’t otherwise receive.”Things are a bit different for people who are self-employed. They can pay into a personal pension set up with a provider of their choice or choose a self-invested personal pension (Sipp), which gives investors control over how money is invested. “Self-employed people should be aware of the boost a pension gives in tax relief,” says McQueen.An important source of income for most pensioners remains the state pension. For people who are uncertain how much they will receive and when, the government has an online calculator to give an accurate forecast, and help people plan ahead.McQueen adds: “From 55, you can access your pension, but there are implications for your retirement finances, plus tax issues if you take out a lump sum. Also, the amount you can save into a pension later may be affected. Seek help. You could turn to Pension Wise, the Money Advice Service, the Pensions Advisory Service, Citizens Advice or your pensions providers’ support services.”Some people may feel they cannot afford pension payments if they are unemployed, furloughed or have seen earnings slump, but it is wise not to stop payments if you possibly can as this is likely to mean you have less to retire on. McQueen says: “Pension products are very flexible, allowing you to stop, start, increase and decrease contributions. Talk to your provider to make adjustments. Before you act, check a pensions calculator online to assess the long-term implications.”Why pension saving is usually a good ideaExperts insist there is no bad time to start a pension. And be reassured savings are protected by the Pensions Protection Fund. McQueen says: “All pensions are heavily regulated by government regulators. Iniduals also have recourse to the Pensions Ombudsman if they feel mistreated.”The views expressed in this article do not constitute financial advice.

He said that recent lockdowns in the UK and across Europe may even spur further online purchases of consumer goods such as home exercise equipment and furniture for “at least for some weeks … It is really crazy how much we are moving at the moment, huge amounts,” he said.Giant container carriers left off the coast of Singapore during the most stringent coronavirus measures last spring have already re-entered the shipping market to help ship containers to Europe, according to Simon Sundboell, boss of maritime intelligence company eeSea. “Demand is back to pre-coronavirus levels, it may be even stronger. Perhaps people are buying TV screens rather than going on holiday to Thailand,” he said.However, the shipping slowdown in the early months of 2020 had made filling empty shipping containers with goods more difficult, because it had upended the complex global shipping sector, he said.George Griffiths, the head of global container freight markets at S\u0026ampP Global Platts, said the lack of empty containers in Asian ports was at the root of soaring container prices. The S\u0026ampP Global Platts index for container freight prices, which reached a record $10,000 earlier this week, was likely to rise further and may push up the cost of consumer goods, he said.“The ongoing problem is that there’s just a lack of empty containers in key exporting hubs, specifically across Asia, so there aren’t any available to export goods into the Europe and UK markets. This has created a real imbalance,” he said.The global rebound in shipping demand has been compounded by Britain’s hurry to stock up on materials and goods before the Christmas season and the severing of ties with the EU. This left many shipping containers stranded by warehouses and on the quayside of ports across the UK and Europe, after the influx of freight at the end of last year.In the past, it would have taken two to three days for a container arriving in the UK to be unloaded at the nearby warehouses and return to the port to begin the journey back to where it came from. But in recent months, in some cases it has taken the skeleton port staff, working under Covid-19 restrictions, two to three weeks to empty containers, Griffiths said.The incoming cargoes, which included 11,000 containers of medical PPE, plunged the UK’s ports into chaos, with mountains of containers piling up. Although the container stacks were beginning to shrink, rebalancing the global supply chain was expected to take months, in part because of coronavirus working restrictions.He said the “self-perpetuating cycle” posed a risk to UK exports, and also the much-needed return of empty containers to Asia, which could help to lower the cost of UK imports. The pattern was expected to last at least until after the lunar new year in the middle of next month, but could continue until the second quarter of this year.A spokesperson for Felixstowe, Britain’s biggest container port, declined to comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a19d34cf5523e9ea439668b1400767c16be4dd86/0_111_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0cd6b329c3144df2786ede070d0a7a2d","title":"hyundai value apple electric car deal","story":"South Korean firm backtracks on statement confirming ‘early discussion’ with US companyHyundai’s value surged by $9bn (£6.6bn) on Friday after reports that it could join with Apple in developing a driverless electric vehicle – despite confusion as it backtracked on a statement acknowledging “early discussion” with the iPhone manufacturer.Reports on South Korea’s Economic Daily claimed the two firms were in talks.Hyundai originally issued a statement saying: “Apple and Hyundai are in discussion, but as it is early stage, nothing has been decided.”A subsequent statement to the stock exchange from Hyundai omitted any reference to Apple, merely saying there were “requests for cooperation on joint development of autonomous electric vehicles from various companies”.Last month it was reported that Apple was hoping to launch a self-driving personal vehicle by 2024, which, a source told Reuters, could represent an evolution in electric car battery technology in the way the iPhone evolved mobile phones. It was suggested that Apple could look for a traditional manufacturing partner to help make the car.Apple did not comment on the Hyundai statement.The scramble to invest in Hyundai comes after a year in which the share price of the market leader in electric vehicles, Tesla, has rocketed – to the extent that chief executive and major shareholder Elon Musk this week overtook Amazon’s Jeff Bezos as the world’s richest man.An Apple vehicle would have the design cachet to compete with the California company, which shipped almost 500,000 vehicles last year and has pushed the boundaries of autonomous driving as well as electric car technology.Hyundai has been keen to burnish its credentials, last month announcing it would develop in-house its own electric car platform and battery systems, expecting to extend the range of a single charge to 500km.It has also had an eye on more futuristic technologies, establishing a self-driving joint venture, Motional, with car component supplier Aptiv and ploughing $2bn into the new firm. Motional has announced plans with ride-hailing firm Lyft to launch robotaxis in the US from 2023. An investor in robotics firms, Hyundai in 2019 unveiled a concept “walking” robocar for tougher terrain.Apple is notoriously tight-lipped about its product development plans but it has been reported to have been working on Project Titan, its electric and autonomous car vision, since 2014."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66f6789aebfc40cf2bf0ae15bf9de3be47df6f0d/0_0_5760_3840/master/5760.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=1f7d1beea48dff0959fedefb6bece8f6 1400w","title":"marine greatest day fa cup tottenham non league","story":"Before the historic FA Cup visit of Tottenham key people at the non-league club talk of excitement, worries and sadnessIt costs £160 to hire the Arriva Suite at Marine AFC on a Sunday – resident DJ and security included – and the club website lists weddings, family parties and christenings among options for “the best facility in the area”. The suite will not generate any income this Sunday, nor any day soon, but will serve as Tottenham’s changing room for the FA Cup tie that borders on fantasy, invokes joy and regret, and gives those who dedicate themselves to a non-league club in Crosby the greatest moment of their football lives.“I think I will shed one or two tears when we kick off,” admits Paul Leary who, as a committee member since 1978, treasurer for quarter of a century and chairman for the past 16 years, embodies the commitment on which non-league football stands. “It will be quite emotional for me.”It has been a demanding time, too, since the draw brought together clubs separated by 160 places in the pyramid, the biggest third-round disparity in the competition’s 149-year history, and brought José Mourinho to the Marine Travel Arena. The last time Spurs’ manager competed on Merseyside there was a £114m main stand with more than 20,000 seats behind him at Anfield. This time it will be the gardens of 19 and 21 Rossett Road. A small fence and netting, installed to keep balls inside the ground and reduce the number of smashed windows, are all that stand between one of the most decorated managers in the game and local residents in the three-sided ground.Marine, of the Northern Premier League Division One North West, are only the second team from the eighth tier of English football to get this far. They have won seven ties – one more than Spurs require to win the trophy – to get here. They were allowed to play friendlies when the league was suspended only after acquiring elite club status by reaching the first round. They have not played since Boxing Day, training was disrupted this week by the lockdown and freezing temperatures, their squad doesn’t stretch to a nine-man substitutes’ bench, their final Covid test results will not be known until Saturday, and £100,000 in potential revenue, vital to a club of Marine’s stature, was jeopardised when the game moved behind closed doors.The return of lockdown also denied 500 fans entry to the game of their lifetime. But try telling Leary, the manager, Neil Young, the 30 volunteers who have spent weeks preparing and perhaps even those with tickets that will never be used, that the romance of the FA Cup is a cliche. This tie has single-handedly, and despite everything, rekindled the flame.“We are very fortunate to have had the FA Cup run of our lives at this time,” the Marine chairman says. “To be quite honest, I don’t know where we would be without it. Our clubhouse has been closed since the first national lockdown in March. We were able to open for a couple of weeks in August but had to close down again very quickly. We’ve had no clubroom revenue, the stadium was shut from the middle of March to May so we had no football revenue. It was a difficult summer and here we are entering another lockdown and another period without fans. The financial uncertainty is very worrying and the income we are enjoying because of the Cup run is an absolute godsend.”Marine have lost an estimated £300,000 because of lockdown. And they pay players only £100-£300 a week. FA prize money and TV money, both cut due to the pandemic, will make up roughly £200,000 of the shortfall. Most non-league clubs have not been so fortunate. “A lot of clubs at our level are hanging on by their fingernails,” says Young. “A lot of funding has gone into the Conference North and National League and rightly so, but absolutely nothing has gone into our level. This run has been vital, it’s everything, and not only from a financial perspective. It has been vital to keeping everyone together.”Some sponsors pulled out when it was announced fans would not be allowed but Marine have felt the power of the football community. Jamie Carragher stepped in when a £20,000 advertising package fell through and his charitable JC23 Foundation will sponsor the dugouts and Marine’s warm-up tops. Everton invited the squad to train at Finch Farm on Thursday when a planned session at a leisure centre had to be cancelled. Liverpool have done the same for Saturday. The support from Tottenham – fans and club alike – has, in Leary’s words, “been quite overwhelming”.David Wotherspoon is another of those selfless supporters who keep 127-year-old clubs such as Marine alive. He was a committee member for more than 30 years, the president (like his father, William, before him), club historian, a life member and, at 81, in receipt of a ticket for “undoubtedly the biggest game in Marine’s history”. He recalls: “The first game I remember was an FA Cup first-round tie in 1947 away at New Brighton, who were a league team back then and played at the Tower. We lost 5-0 and I cried all the way home on the ferry. That was 74 years ago and I remember that ferry ride vividly.“It is very sad there will not be a full house on Sunday but I’m sad mostly for the players who deserve to experience a magical occasion. I just hope Marine’s day in the sun will illustrate to people more of what non-league is about. It’s about lots of people coming together to enjoy something special, working together and forming lifelong friendships. It is all dependent on the involvement of people.”Young has been contemplating his final message to his players having taken a week off work to study video analysis of Spurs supplied by Liverpool and to handle media requests from Australia, Russia, South America and the US. A manager at Merseyrail, he won five promotions and three consecutive league titles with Chester and took over at Marine midway through the 2018-19 season that ended with the first relegation in their history. Faith and patience have been rewarded, victories over Barnoldswick Town, Frickley Athletic, Runcorn Linnets, Nantwich Town, Chester, Colchester United and Havant and Waterlooville delivering a date with Mourinho.“People keep asking me if I’m looking forward to it and of course I am,” says Marine’s manager, who started out in the Birkenhead Sunday League with Queen’s Park more than 20 years ago. “But you’ve also got that worry that potentially, given what we are facing, we could get a good hiding. My role is to prepare my players so that we don’t embarrass ourselves on national television. I’m positive we won’t.“That’s the negative side of me. The other side of me, the one that doesn’t shout from the rooftops, is the one that knows how well these lads have done in this competition. What they have achieved so far is phenomenal. I just hope on Sunday that everyone sees a group of lads giving everything they possibly can, irrespective of the result.”Many clubs in the pyramid have sent good-luck messages, but Young’s greatest reward will be on the faces of the few people dotted around the stands."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e9a677eb6b66179439a806f6f6643a1581b7a8d/0_156_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=1ca22ae977ec4d8e3272fb608bfce168","title":"tottenhams jose mourinho gets in fa cup spirit by buying marine raffle ticket","story":"José Mourinho has bought a ticket in a raffle organised by Marine in which the top prize is to manage them in a pre-season friendly. The Tottenham manager, who visits the non-league club in the FA Cup third round on Sunday, knows that he would most likely be unable to claim the prize even if he won.But he has made the gesture out of solidarity with the Merseyside club, who have explored other means to raise money after the Covid crisis denied them the chance to welcome fans for the biggest game of their history.“I am buying,” Mourinho said. “If I win, I cannot do it normally because we have our pre-season. I don’t think I will have conditions to do that. But the meaning of it makes me say yes to buying.”Mourinho says he has bought into the romance of a tie that pits Spurs against opposition from the Northern Premier League North-West Division – the eighth tier of the English game. He intends to show his respect for Marine by doing his usual due diligence and being strong with his selection.Mourinho will have 19 first-teamers and one under-18 in his squad he includes Jack Clarke and Harvey White as they train all the time with the seniors. Gareth Bale could be involved after returning to training on Friday following a calf injury and Érik Lamela is also a possibility. Mourinho will wait until Saturday for a final update on Lamela, who has missed the past two games with an unspecified issue. The news, though, on Giovani Lo Celso’s hamstring was rather less positive.“I don’t know for how long Gio is injured but he is not playing in the next few weeks,” Mourinho said. “It is not a simple situation.”Mourinho will not tolerate the postponement of Wednesday’s Premier League game at Aston Villa, who have been hit by multiple Covid cases. Spurs had their home fixture against Fulham postponed from 30 December and they must rearrange their visit to Fulham which was scheduled for the weekend of 24-25 April because they have reached the Carabao Cup final.“To have three matches postponed is impossible,” Mourinho said. “There is no way of playing these three matches.”Mourinho said that if a club had 14 healthy players, including under-23s, they ought to fulfil their fixtures, as per the Premier League rule. The league say that it is not so black-and-white, with postponements at the discretion of its board and to be dealt with on each specific set of circumstances."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0fd81dbea41cd831e42396ea8ee936a9fb74a8b2/0_752_5400_3241/master/5400.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=fd315a5edef8211f7e8d614d9a33d2be","title":"harry potter and michael buble fuel uk online reselling boom","story":"Harry Potter, Michael Bublé and PlayStation 4 have helped fuel a boom in online sales of secondhand books, CDs and consumer technology during the pandemic.The company, which was founded in a Stockport garage in 2007 and initially traded only in CDs, now specialises mainly in secondhand technology.

It has more than 7m registered customers worldwide.With charity shops closed during high street lockdowns to control the Covid-19 pandemic, and many people short of cash after months on furlough or having lost their job, online trading of secondhand goods has boomed.

Separately, Marks \u0026amp Spencer said it was concerned that a third of the products in its Irish food halls, including Percy Pig sweets, would now be subject to import tariffs. Such taxes could spell higher prices for shoppers.DPD said new border procedures, including additional customs paperwork, needed for parcels destined for Europe were putting extra pressure on turnaround and transit times.The company said it was returning one-fifth of parcels to the sender because they had incorrect or incomplete data attached. It also blamed delays and congestion at UK ports for its decision, as well as more rigid requirements for Channel crossings. The firm said it hoped to restart the service on Wednesday.The Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, said he expected there to be “significant additional disruption” at UK borders as a result of Brexit customs changes in the coming weeks. Speaking to broadcasters, he said: “So far disruption at the border hasn’t been too profound but it is the case that in the weeks ahead we expect that there will be significant additional disruption, particularly on the Dover-Calais route.It is our responsibility in government to make sure that business is as ready as possible, and hauliers and traders have already done a lot but we have to redouble our efforts to communicate the precise paperwork that is required in order to make sure that trade can flow freely.”Although the government sealed a “tariff-free” trade deal on Christmas Eve, it has emerged that food and clothing products that do not qualify as made in Britain could be hit with levies.Boris Johnson was said to have swerved the topic of Brexit impact in a call with more than 200 business leaders earlier this week. “It was a meaningless call, it was all mottoes – we are going to build back business better, build back business greener – and a few patsy questions about how much better it would be, nothing about the realities of Brexit and Covid hitting us all hard,” said one business leader.The department store chains Debenhams and John Lewis, which recently closed its international business, are among the big names no longer serving the Irish market. Fortnum \u0026amp Mason, the famous London department store, has also temporarily ceased shipping to Northern Ireland and EU countries.The bookseller Waterstones has also suspended sales to customers in EU countries, as has the fashion chain Jigsaw.Retailers have been hit by the cost of customs paperwork that applies to all imports and exports, including goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.M\u0026ampS has temporarily cut nearly 400 products from the food and drink aisles of its 20 stores in Northern Ireland. Sainsbury’s has made a similar move and filled the gaps on its shelves with products from Spar shops. The moves are designed to simplify the business and so avoid the delays at the border amid reports of retailers having trucks turned back.A spokesperson for M\u0026ampS said it had served customers in Northern Ireland for over 50 years and its priority was to provide the “same choice … our loyal customers have always enjoyed”. Its stores had been receiving regular deliveries this week but the changes came as it moved over to new processes, he said.M\u0026ampS has also warned that more than 2,000 of its food products, including Percy Pigs, could attract new import taxes when re-exported to its stores in EU countries such as Ireland and France. The new “rules of origin” regulations dictate whether tariffs must be paid based on where a product’s ingredients come from and where it has been manufactured.The M\u0026ampS chief executive, Steve Rowe, said: “Tariff-free does not feel like tariff-free when you read the fine print. For big businesses there will be time-consuming workarounds but for a lot of others this means paying tariffs or rebasing into the EU.”Tesco said it had experienced short delays moving goods into Northern Ireland but that it had a “good supply of products coming into Northern Ireland”. It added: “There has been a short delay on certain products but we’re working with suppliers to get these back on the shelves as quickly as possible and direct customers to alternatives where we can.”Tesco said it was discussing the rules of origin regulations with HMRC and Irish Revenue and hoped “to find a satisfactory resolution as quickly as possible”.The British Retail Consortium said: “At least 50 of our members, all of them large retailers, face potential tariffs for re-exporting goods to the EU.”Dominic Goudie, the head of international trade at the Food and Drink Federation, said some product-specific rules meant exports were no longer viable, with “serious challenges for supply chains that  across the UK and EU”.He also said EU-produced food and drink that moved to other EU markets via Great Britain without further manufacturing taking place in Britain faced the payment of full EU tariffs on return to the EU.“As a result, suppliers are being forced to cancel deliveries of products to customers, particular those in Ireland,” he added.One unnamed source for a logistics business spoke of mayhem behind the scenes. He described how one truckload of parcels had to be completely offloaded and relabelled on Thursday night before export to the EU, simply because one line on the code for goods was wrong.He also told of companies hiking charges for invoices to £3.50 a parcel going to Europe, making low-value goods too expensive to export.John Arbon Textiles, a small artisan knitting wool company in Devon, said it had been told by DPD that its spools and balls of fibre would not be accepted in Europe.“I feel DPD are being cautious, but I have no confidence that I can send anything to my customers in the EU at the moment,” the business’s owner, Juliet Arbon, said.Northern Ireland’s chief vet has said goods arriving in the region, which is now following EU rules for imports, would be destroyed or returned if not compliant after a short grace period.Robert Huey told a Stormont committee that some companies contracted to do the paperwork for hauliers were “overwhelmed” and in one case a staff member had to show a major supermarket how to complete its paperwork."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/409453f0a21d9ac60da25af2366bbce9460f997d/0_172_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=6189f02994f1874b7bf8d28a1c956852","title":"england councils told to redouble efforts on housing rough sleepers covid vaccine","story":"Guidance also says rough sleepers must be able to access Covid vaccine in line with other at-risk priority groupsCouncils in England have been told by the government to “redouble their efforts” to house all rough sleepers, and make sure they are registered with a GP to enable them to receive a Covid vaccine over the next few weeks.The government also renewed existing temporary protections for renters by extending its ban on evictions for all but the most extreme cases for the next six weeks – until at least 21 February – with the policy kept under review.The announcement on Friday followed increasing pressure on ministers to step up their pandemic homelessness policy by campaigners alarmed at rising numbers of rough sleepers as the UK went into lockdown amid freezing winter weather.Issuing update guidance, the communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, said: “At the start of this pandemic we made sure that the most vulnerable in society were protected. This winter, we are continuing in this vein and redoubling our efforts to help those most in need.”The guidance says local authorities must ensure rough sleepers can access the Covid-19 vaccine in line with other at-risk priority groups outlined by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, either via a GP or “by other means if mainstream provision is unsuitable”.Friday’s announcement was broadly welcomed by homelessness charities. Jon Sparkes, the chief executive of Crisis, called it a “lifesaving intervention” at the “most dangerous moment of the pandemic for those without a home”.While local authorities welcomed an extra £10m government funding to help support efforts to house rough sleepers over the next few weeks, they warned more cash would be needed.Although thousands of rough sleepers were taken off the streets during the first lockdown, there has been a rise in numbers since the original guidance lapsed in June, with many unable to access housing help from their local authority because they have no recourse to public funds, such as immigrants.The Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government said it expected councils to consider the needs of those who may otherwise be ineligible for support because of immigration status. A spokesperson said: “Councils must use their judgment in assessing what support they may lawfully give to each person on an inidual basis, considering that person’s specific circumstances and support needs.”There was a cautious welcome for the extension of the eviction ban. The housing charity Shelter said that while the ban did not halt the evictions process entirely, it was “the minimum required to keep more people safe in their homes” for the time being.The Welsh government has also extended its eviction ban – though for a longer period, until 31 March. “Renters should not be forced out of their homes, at a time when we are asking people to stay at home,” said the Welsh housing minister Julie James.The campaign group Generation Rent said the new arrangements in England weakened the government’s original guidance, which said renters could only face eviction if they had more than nine months of arrears. This has been shortened to six months."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28ebc5ce6ef754d1ed7bea3a7ed99f3d9edd56b5/0_89_4010_2406/master/4010.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=1523ff9779e0d174fd90e8e90fc12148","title":"australia v india third test day three live","story":"52nd over: India 107-2 (Pujara 12, Rahane 13) Starc in to bowl, back over the wicket, and there’s the first boundary of the day!

Just leans minimally onto the front foot and eases a cover drive through it, short backlift and short follow-through, but timed and using Starc’s pace to zoom to the boundary. Starc sends a couple of short ones in at Rahane’s armpit in response. But when one gets a touch shorter than those, up to shoulder height, Rahane hooks a single along the ground to long leg. This is excellent batting.51st over: India 102-2 (Pujara 12, Rahane 8) Cummins in at the pads, and Rahane slants away a single behind square leg. He’s been clever at this so far, Rahane, finding a run here and there to make sure it’s not entirely a defensive exercise. Considering how hard it might become to face Lyon later, it won’t be a big help to block out the quicks without scoring. Pujara sees out the next five balls.50th over: India 101-2 (Pujara 12, Rahane 7) Now Starc comes around the wicket to angle in at the right-handers. He’s also using the bouncer approach, with a couple of fuller balls thrown in for variety. Pujara though does what Pujara does: waits, watches, endures.49th over: India 101-2 (Pujara 12, Rahane 7) Cummins now sends down a full over back of a length, in at the body of Rahane. The one proper bouncer that he bowls goes astray, down leg side and easily ducked, but the last ball of the over is nasty at the gloves, and you can see Rahane relax his back-foot defensive push at the last instant to try to make sure that the ball falls softly to ground rather than skewing into the air. It does, after smashing his top hand against the handle, but luckily it hits him flush on the padded part at the front of the fingers and doesn’t seem to have done him any damage. No run.48th over: India 101-2 (Pujara 12, Rahane 7) Now it’s Mitchell Starc to bowl, left-arm fast. Interesting, in that things already looked tasty for Lyon in the one over he bowled. Starc is similarly bowling with a leg-side field, left-arm over the wicket, with his natural swing into the pads of the right-handers. Rahane takes four balls to size it up and then works him square for a single. India’s deficit is currently 237 runs with eight wickets in hand.47th over: India 100-2 (Pujara 12, Rahane 6) Pat Cummins to bowl from the other end, and already Australia have gone with a very leg-side field. One slip in, but there’s a short midwicket and a leg gully and a short leg. Cummins bowls full at the stumps, some threatening deliveries with a bit of shape through the air. Seeing if he can get Pujara to play off the pads in the air, but Pujara bats out a maiden. Pujara did make 193 last time he was here, batting for about two days. It looks like harder work this time around.46th over: India 100-2 (Pujara 12, Rahane 6) Nathan Lyon will start proceedings for the day, Australia’s off-spinner who Ric was writing about in the previous post. He has plenty of company around the bat: short leg, slip, and a roadblock as Jim Maxwell calls it, at bat-pad on the off side of the pitch. Rahane knocks away a single and then it looks like Pujara has decided that he doesn’t want to be a duck in a shooting gallery today with those catchers waiting: twice he moves away from the line and forces through the off side, first for a brace and then for a single. Raises India’s hundred, and that was much more positive already than the defensive play – the necessary defensive play – of last night. I mean, the stat is great but the best part is seeing ABC statistician Ric Finlay adopt the usage of “shout-out”.It was especially interesting yesterday to welcome back Steve Smith to the runs list. It wasn’t like his last year and a bit was terrible – he still made three fifties in eight Tests and averaged 30. For a lot of players that would constitute a career. But by Smith’s standards it was a long stretch. Since his first Test century, the longest gap without one was four matches. Yesterday he made 131, equalling Allan Border with 27 Test hundreds. Border played 156 Tests, Smith is in his 76th.If you’d care to get into a bit more detail interspersed with a bit less seriousness about the second day, Adam Collins and I went on a giant ferris wheel to talk about it. Why? I don’t have an answer to that.For the main points of yesterday’s day of play, here’s our wires report.The communication game. Yodel from the hills, twirl the rotary telephone. Or just send me an email. Details are in the sidebar box.The Sydney Test, day three, match three, and it’s still all to play for. The Australians got themselves out on day two for a moderate kind of score of 338, but it’s going to take a lot of hard work if the Indians are to match it. They scored 96 runs in 45 overs, barely 2 per over, against some extremely good bowling. Nathan Lyon looked dangerous throughout, Pat Cummins did too, and the pitch looks pretty difficult to score on. A few bits of misbehaviour, with some balls leaping or creeping, but mostly just slow and hard to time shots. So, 338 for India is a long way away.Cheteshwar Pujara and Ajinkya Rahane make up the pair to resume, the two most reliable and senior players for India. They’ll need to do a lot of the spadework.Australia will be feeling very cheered up by Steve Smith’s return to the runs after his century on day two. India will be cheerful after another influential performance from Ravindra Jadeja, who was sensational with four wickets and the final thrill of a ridiculous run out to end Smith’s day and Australia’s innings."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/486981d3d2d4dcbc00f70f96e841b1f887e12e26/0_435_3719_2232/master/3719.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTIucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=d88468700c9b0a30a9bf866e07219c28","title":"uk bame people how has the coronavirus pandemic impacted you","story":"We’re looking to speak to people from BAME backgrounds about the impact of Covid-19In the UK, coronavirus has had a disproportionate impact on Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) communities.

They have been declared in London previously for incidents such as the Grenfell Tower fire in June 2017, and the terror attacks at Westminster Bridge and London Bridge.Greater Manchester declared a major incident in August due to the spread of Covid.The declaration does not formally give London’s authorities new powers, but provides for improved emergency coordination and gives extra impetus to any demands for help to central government. It is also seen as an important symbolic step, emphasising to Londoners the gravity of the situation and the importance of them observing social distancing rules.The formal definition of a major incident is something “likely to involve serious harm, damage, disruption or risk to human life or welfare, essential services, the environment or national security”.With Covid cases in London now exceeding 1,000 per 100,000 people, Khan urged Londoners to stay at home. In a statement, the mayor said he had declared a major incident “because the threat this virus poses to our city is at crisis point. If we do not take immediate action now, our NHS could be overwhelmed and more people will die.”He said: “Our heroic doctors, nurses and NHS staff are doing an amazing job, but with cases rising so rapidly, our hospitals are at risk of being overwhelmed. The stark reality is that we will run out of beds for patients in the next couple of weeks unless the spread of the virus slows down drastically.”Khan has written to Boris Johnson to seek extra powers such as closing places of worship, and to require masks to be worn in crowded outdoor places, such as supermarket queues. He is also asking for more financial support for people unable to work because they are self-isolating, and daily data on vaccinations.London’s director of public health, Prof Kevin Fenton, also appealed for people to stay distanced.“This is the biggest threat our city has faced in this pandemic to date,” he said. “In order to ease the burden on our hospitals, we must first stop the spread. That means we have to stay at home. Cut your contacts, reduce your movements, do as little as possible.“A lot has been asked of Londoners over the past 12 months but your decisions and actions right now have never been more important.” London has been the worst-hit area of the UK so far in the winter peak of Covid-19 cases.The London ambulance service is taking up to 8,000 emergency calls a day, compared with 5,500 on a normal busy day.Speaking alongside the prime minister at a Downing Street press conference on Thursday, Simon Stevens, the chief executive of NHS England, said hospitals in London were receiving 800 Covid patients a day, the equivalent of the entire capacity of St Thomas’, one of the capital’s leading hospitals."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b18bd1eceb52870d6736473a360df1afb0c2c48/0_87_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=beef5b4f54a0ac9366dbb8f218e4750e","title":"why the delay the nations waiting to see how covid vaccinations unfold","story":"Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and Japan are among those that won’t start vaccinating for months, in part to see how other populations react to the jabThey are the nations that have been held up as shining examples of coronavirus management. In Australia, New Zealand and Taiwan, daily Covid infections are in the single digits and outbreaks are quickly suppressed.But there is one area where these nations lag well behind the pack in vaccination. Countries with some of the most enviable healthcare systems in the world – including Australia, New Zealand, Japan and South Korea – will not begin to inoculate until the end of February or later.The delay is deliberate. The millions of people already being vaccinated against Covid-19 will provide valuable data to those countries who have – for various reasons – decided to wait for more information about the vaccine, its efficacy and side effects before rolling it out to vulnerable populations and the public.Australia’s health minister, Greg Hunt, said on Thursday that Australia was proud to be part of this group of “the most successful countries in the world in dealing with” Covid-19, and that he would not be pressured to bring forward the start of vaccination.A significant driver of the expedited rollout in some countries is the severity of their situations. The US registered a record 3,900 coronavirus deaths on Wednesday, with numbers surging in almost every state. On Thursday the UK’s death toll rose by 1,162, its second-highest increase since the pandemic began. The urgency for the vaccine in those countries is palpable, with hospitals and morgues struggling to manage the number of deceased, and healthcare workers who were burning out months ago.By comparison, most Australian states and territories have had no local cases of the virus for months, while there has been no community transmission in New Zealand since 18 November.Prof Jennifer Martin is a physician in Australia who is also a member of the pharmacology and therapeutics advisory committee of Pharmac, the sole purchaser for pharmaceuticals in New Zealand. She said people often asked her about the pace of the rollout. “The reason it’s such a prolonged approval process in Australia and New Zealand is because there is lots of double checking and reexamining of the statistics, because if we make an error, it will become an error on a big scale by the time the drug is rolled out across a large population,” Martin said. “It’s not that uncommon that the regulator might look at the data and say, ‘Well, it looks OK in terms of how it works in European people, but we’re quite worried about how this might affect Indigenous people, and the Asian population seem to respond differently too’.“Australia and New Zealand are saying ‘Why would you put people at risk when if you wait a bit longer, you can get more information?’”Regulators are already learning from those who have been vaccinated. On Wednesday, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published data on allergic reactions to the Pfizer BioNTech mRNA vaccine seen in the US between 14 and 23 December. That data will prove useful to countries such as South Korea, which has ordered enough vaccine doses to inoculate all of the country’s 52 million people, but is delaying mass vaccination while it observes possible side effects elsewhere. Meanwhile, New Zealand’s health ministry said regulators were waiting to “take into account the assessments of trusted regulators, such as in Australia, the UK, Europe, Canada and the USA”.An infectious diseases and vaccine expert from the University of Sydney, Prof Robert Booy, said the PfizerBioNtech mRNA vaccine, which is being issued first in many countries, has “five incredible advantages” over other types of vaccines.“mRNA vaccines can be quickly developed, they’re cheap, they’re effective, they appear safe, and you can adjust them by putting in a slightly different antigen if the virus changes its spots,” he said. “But the overarching concern is, we’ve never used this type of vaccine before, so we have to do our darnedest to do the surveillance to check that it’s well tolerated.”Booy said there was always a country that needed to be first with introducing any drug or medical device, and that no steps had been skipped, such as conducting phase-three clinical trials. This meant the vaccines were very likely to be safe, he said, but some countries, forced to choose between exponential deaths and overwhelmed health systems, or introducing a vaccine before having time to analyse the full results, had made the logical decision to issue the vaccine, starting with vulnerable populations.Even Japan, which on Thursday reported a record 2,447 new cases and declared a state of emergency in Tokyo, is not rushing the rollout. Japanese media have reported that vaccinations will not begin until late February, with the first going to about 10,000 frontline health workers. Those over 65, care home workers and people with underlying health conditions will follow in March.There is a particular need to first build public confidence and trust in the Covid-19 vaccine in Japan. While Japan doesn’t have an anti-vaccination movement comparable to the UK and US, there is a relatively high level of vaccine hesitancy. There are other benefits to countries moving steadily with vaccination. Health authorities will have more time to sort the logistics of transporting vaccines, some of which require cold-chain storage, across vast landscapes including deserts, forest and bushland. Technology can be established to track doses across the supply chain and monitor for wastage. There is more time to train staff to administer the vaccine and run education and safety campaigns to ensure public trust.Martin said people living in those countries waiting for more data before approving and distributing the vaccine should feel gratitude to those receiving it in places such as China, the US and UK.“These people are helping us to get data, in the same way as any patient that’s in a clinical trial, and that’s really going to benefit everyone,” she said. “But at the end of the day, when I speak to my colleagues in these places like the UK, they say they’re so desperate for the vaccine that they would take it in their eye if they had to.“They’re just so stressed, they’re on the frontline, they’re worried about catching and spreading it. So they’re just so unbelievably grateful to be among the first.”"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Company delivered 14m parcels in December, double the level of same period in 2019About 335,600 people will receive the benefit this week"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4452695.1610052917!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus search how has covid 19 spread in your area during the third wave","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBelmullet, Co Mayo, suffered from the highest 14-day incidence rate of coronavirus cases in the State. Photograph:  Eamon O’BoyleOne in every 50 people in Belmullet, Co Mayo, and Adare-Rathkeale, Co Limerick, had Covid-19 over the past fortnight, with the two areas suffering from the highest 14-day incidence rates in the State.The latest data from the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, published on Thursday, examines the 14-day Covid-19 incidence rate between December 22nd and January 4th in each of the State’s 166 electoral areas.The rate for the period was 674.4, which was more than double the 245.6 observed in the previous 14-day period.The worst affected area was Belmullet, where 266 people had the virus out of a population of 12,600. That amounted to an incidence rate of 2,111.1 per 100,000 people, which was more than three times the national rate.The next worst affected area was Adare-Rathkeale, Co Limerick, where there were 557 cases out of a population of 27,710. That gave it an incidence rate of 2,010.1 per 100,000 people.Another badly affected area was neighbouring Newcastle West, where there were 404 cases in a population of 27,416. That gave the region an incidence rate of 1,473.6 cases per 100,000 people.A number of areas close to the Border also recorded incidence rates among the highest in the State. The worst were Dundalk South, Co Louth (1,982.4) Ballybay-Clones, Co Monaghan (1,674.9) Carrickmacross-Castleblayney, Co Monaghan (1,376.2) Ardee, Co Louth (1,196.8) and Belturbet, Co Cavan (986.2).The area that was worst affected in the State in the previous 14-day period was New Ross, Co Wexford. It had an incidence rate of 998.6 – more than four times the national incidence rate at the time. During the latest period, its incidence rate has climbed further to 1,092.3 with 303 cases from a population of 27,739.Many parts of Dublin also continued to suffer from high rates. The worst hit area was Tallaght Central, where there were 523 cases out of a population of 43,215, giving it an incidence rate of 1,210.2.The picture was not much better in neighbouring Firhouse-Bohernabreena, where there were 405 confirmed cases from a population of 34,202. That gave it an incidence rate of 1,184.1.Two other areas in the south of the county with high rates were Rathfarnham-Templeogue (1,133.4), and Kimmage-Rathmines (1,160). In north Dublin, Howth-Malahide was the worst hit area, with an incidence rate of 999.3.Elsewhere , Tramore-Waterford City West continued to struggle, with 226 cases from a population of 22,372, giving it an incidence rate of 1,010.2. Tramore GP Dr Austin Byrne has traced the spike in cases in the area back to “several events” that occurred indoors in the town over Christmas week.One area which suffered a spike in cases since the previous 14-day period was Cahir, Co Tipperary. The region had less than five cases recorded in the period between December 15th and 28th. However, the latest data shows there were 57 cases in Cahir between December 22nd and January 4th from a population of 14,717, giving it an incidence rate of 387.3 per 100,000 people.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4453609.1610137931!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"more than 54 000 people flew into state over festive period","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe bulk of the 54,311 people who arrived through the airports between December 21st and January 3rd – some 52,638 – came through Dublin Airport (pictured).

Photograph:  Ulet IfansastiGetty ImagesIndonesian Islamic cleric Abu Bakar Bashir, the suspected mastermind of the 2002 Bali bombings that killed 202 people, was released from prison on Friday after serving 10 years for setting up a militant training camp.Authorities said Bashir (82), who was never convicted of a direct role in the bombings, would enter a deradicalisation programme amid concerns over his continued influence in extremist circles.Photographs showed him dressed in white and wearing a mask as he left the prison in Bogor, south of the capital Jakarta, before being driven to his home at an Islamic boarding school near the city of Solo in Central Java. “Abu Bakar Bashir was released from Gunung Sindur prison at 5.30am,” Rika Aprianti, a spokeswoman for the corrections department, told reporters.Bashir (82), who is regarded as the spiritual leader of Jemaah Islamiah (JI), a jihadist network with ties to al-Qaeda, was imprisoned in 2011 for 15 years for his links to a militant training camp in Aceh province.After periodic cuts in his jail term, he served 10 years.Although Indonesian police and intelligence agencies say Bashir was linked to the 2002 Bali attacks and a 2003 attack on the JW Marriott hotel in Jakarta, he was never convicted of direct involvement and denied any ties.A conviction for being part of a conspiracy to carry out the Bali bombings was later overturned.The Bali bombings killed 88 Australians, and the country has pressed Indonesia to ensure Bashir does not incite more violence.‘Very distressing’On Friday, Australian prime minister Scott Morrison said Bashir’s release was “very distressing to the friends and families of the Australians, the 88 Australians, who were killed in the Bali bombings”.Thiolina Marpaung, an Indonesian wounded in the 2002 attacks, said she wanted authorities to keep supervising Bashir.“We don’t know what he was doing in prison,” she said by telephone.Bashir pledged allegiance to the militant group Islamic State in 2014 while in jail.A spokesman for the Coogee Dolphins rugby club in Sydney, which lost its president and five members in the Bali attacks, said Bashir’s release would be difficult. “Some will never forgive, there will be others who will be just angry today,” said Albert Talarico. “Others will stay silent because they don’t wish to have the old wounds opened again.”Some Indonesians defended the release of the cleric, saying he had served his time and was a practising Muslim.“There are many people who discredit Muslims, thinking that we are related to terrorism, but . . . we are not,” said Asqar Kustiwa (63), a resident of Depok, near Jakarta.Deradicalisation programmeBashir will undergo a deradicalisation programme, Eddy Hartono of Indonesia’s anti-terrorism agency said in a statement, adding that he hoped the cleric, after his release, “can give peaceful, soothing preachings”.In the wake of the Bali attacks, Indonesia set up an elite anti-terrorist unit that weakened JI and resulted in scores of suspected militants being arrested or killed.But other extremist groups have since formed and conducted attacks in the world’s biggest Muslim majority country while only last month police arrested 23 militants.Ahead of the release, Abdul Rohim, Bashir’s son, told Reuters his father would return to the Al Mukmin Islamic boarding school, which Bashir founded in the 1970s and whose graduates have been linked to militant networks and attacks.“He has completed his term,” Rohim said. “This is purely over.”JI’s prominence is fading, say analysts, to be replaced by other Islamic State-inspired groups blamed for new attacks.They say Bashir does not wield as much power over JI or other groups, but could still influence other militants.“Bashir is an ideologue, his words will be followed and made examples of,” said analyst Stanislaus Riyanta. – ReutersStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4453559.1610132657!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"biden s message of unity has never seemed so relevant","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPresident-elect Joe Biden speaking in Wilmington, Delaware, on Wednesday. He  abandoned his prepared remarks and addressed a shocked nation as the attack on the Capitol was unfolding. Photograph: Doug MillsThe New York TimesIn the midst of this week’s anarchy and destruction at the US Capitol, there was a moment of clarity, a moment of dignity.Joe Biden, who will become US president in less than two weeks, had been scheduled to deliver remarks about the economy in Wilmington, Delaware, on Wednesday afternoon. Then the assault on the Capitol started. Biden quickly abandoned his prepared remarks, and instead addressed a shocked nation as the attack was unfolding in real time.“This is not dissent it is disorder, it is chaos. It borders on sedition, and it must end – now. I call on this mob to pull back and allow the work of democracy to go forward,” he said, before turning his attention to Donald Trump. “I call on President Trump to go on national television, now, to fulfil his oath and defend the constitution and demand an end to this siege. It is insurrection... the world is watching.”Trump’s response was to tweet a short video, in which he made a half-hearted call for his supporters to leave the Capitol and told them he loved them. “I know your pain, I know you’re hurt. We had an election that was stolen from us.”It was quickly taken down by Twitter.Biden, whose strategy since the election has been broadly to ignore Trump’s ramblings in a bid to avoid stoking any more ision, will now take the helm at the White House in the wake of an almost unthinkable attack on the nation’s democracy.The message of unity that underpinned his presidential campaign, even when he appeared unlikely to win the Democratic nomination a year ago, has never seemed so relevant.Even before this week’s shocking events Biden’s task in leading the country had been fundamentally transformed by two Senate elections in Georgia on Tuesday. \u0026nbspIn any other week the Democrats’ victories in the twin contests would have dominated the news cycle. Two Democratic challengers, Jon Ossoff, a 33-year-old filmmaker, and Raphael Warnock (51), a pastor at the historic Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta where Martin Luther King jnr once preached, dislodged incumbent Republicans David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler. Hand-pickedLoeffler, who is married to the head of the New York Stock exchange, had been hand-picked by Georgia governor Brian Kemp in 2019 to fill the seat vacated by retiring senator Jonny Isakson. Trump was furious about the decision at the time, but Kemp believed Loeffler would appeal to middle-class female voters in Georgia’s suburbs who were deserting the Republican party in droves. Instead she embraced Trumpism and ran further to the right in a desperate and ultimately unsuccessful attempt to secure her seat.There is also poetic justice in a week where a white-majority mob overran the Capitol, that Georgia, a state with a shameful history of racial injustice and segregation, is sending its first black senator to Washington.“Welcome to the new Georgia,” Warnock said on Wednesday. “It is more erse. It’s more inclusive. It readily embraces the future. And I’m the product of that.” Though his words were spoken on Wednesday morning before the storming of the Capitol, they could have easily been directed at the lone Trump supporter who was photographed marching through the Capitol rotunda carrying a confederate flag, an inflammatory symbol of a lost era of white supremacy in the south.But the real significance of the elections is that Biden begins his term with a Democratic majority in the House and Senate.While the Senate majority will be the narrowest possible – the party will hold 50 seats in the 100-member chamber, with incoming vice-president Kamala Harris permitted to cast a tie-breaking vote in her capacity as president of the Senate – it significantly eases Biden’s path to governance. Partisan cornerDemocrats will be obliged to keep Democratic senators from Republican-leaning states, like Joe Manchin from West Virginia, in line. Manchin was the lone Democrat to vote for Trump’s second supreme court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, though he voted to remove Trump a year ago during the impeachment trial.But Wednesday’s events, which saw some Republicans censure Trump’s claims of election fraud, gives hope that several Republicans are not wedded to their partisan corner and will be prepared to work with Democrats.Biden, who still believes in bipartisanship based on the experience of his 36 years in the Senate, had been dismissed as naïve. But the shocking and destructive end to Trump’s presidency may now act as a catalyst for Republicans to work with Democrats to ensure Congress does what it is supposed to do and legislate for the American people.Four people have died after supporters of outgoing US president Donald Trump invaded the US Capitol in an extraordinary attack on the heart of American democracy on Wednesday.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4453150.1610103091!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"put the coffee on the rioters who stormed the us capitol","story":"More views from inside the mayhem, confusion and chaos at the Capitol as Trump supporters entered and disrupted certification of the Electoral College results.

Photograph: Jim Lo ScalzoEPAThere were infamous white nationalists and noted conspiracy theorists who have spread dark visions of paedophile Satanists running the country. Others were more anonymous, people who had journeyed from Indiana and South Carolina to heed President Donald Trump’s call to show their support. One person, a West Virginia lawmaker, had only been elected to office in November.All of them converged on Wednesday on the grounds of the US Capitol, where hundreds of rioters crashed through barricades, climbed through windows and walked through doors, wandering around the hallways with a sense of gleeful desecration, because, for a few breathtaking hours, they believed that they had displaced the very elites they said they hated.“We wanted to show these politicians that it’s us who’s in charge, not them,” said a construction worker from Indianapolis, who is 40 and identified himself only as Aaron. He declined to give his last name, saying, “I’m not that dumb.” He added: “We’ve got the strength.”As the US sifts through the shards of what happened in Washington on Wednesday, what comes into focus in the storming of the Capitol is a jumbled constellation of hardcore Trump supporters: a largely white crowd, many of them armed with bats, shields and chemical spray some carried Confederate flags and wore costumes of fur and horns inspired by QAnon they were mostly men, but there were women, too.Those who stormed the Capitol were just one slice of the thousands of Trump supporters who had descended on Washington to protest against the certification of Joe Biden’s victory in November over Trump. Their breach came with a confused and frenzied energy, fuelled by the words of Trump just minutes before and the fervour of the mob standing behind them.Washington’s politan Police Department said it had made no additional arrests on Thursday connected to the rioting, during which one woman was fatally shot by the Capitol police and a Capitol police officer suffered injuries from which he later died.On Wednesday, the politan Police detained 68 people, plus the 14 picked up by the Capitol police during the unrest. Dozens more people were still being sought by federal authorities.Rotunda selfiesTheir number included a 60-year-old gun rights activist from Arkansas who was pictured sitting in speaker Nancy Pelosi’s office, men in tactical gear taking selfies in the rotunda and a woman in the House chamber, carrying a QAnon-inspired sign about children.Some of those who had also surged forward in the crowd seemed to show a bewildered wonder at what they were seeing in front of them. A few remarked on the opulence of the Capitol building and offices, a quality that seemed to confirm their suspicions about the corruption of Washington.“Yeah look at all this fancy furniture they have,” said a man in a winter parka and red hat, standing on the west side of the Capitol and peering through the glass at empty desks, computer screens and ergonomic chairs. Several people banged on the windows with their fists, including one man who shouted, “Put the coffee on!” One man hit his head, not seeing the outer layer of glass was there, it was so clean.As people rushed inside, there was a strange mix of confusion and excitement, and the almost complete lack of police presence in the beginning amplified the feeling of lawlessness. They gawked at a place of wealth and beauty, adorned with art and marble, a domain of the powerful, and for a short while on Wednesday afternoon, the rioters were in control. For once, they felt, they could not be ignored.Aaron, the construction worker from Indianapolis, and his two friends had heard people talking about going to Pelosi’s office. So once inside they decided to instead find senator Chuck Schumer’s office. Both are Democrats.“We wanted to have a few words” with Schumer, he said. “He’s probably the most corrupt guy up here. You don’t hear too much about him. But he’s slimy. You can just see it.”Smoking cigarettesBut they could not find Schumer’s office. He said they asked a Capitol police officer, who tried to direct them. But they appeared to have gotten nowhere near the minority’s leader’s office. They ended up smoking a few cigarettes inside the building – “We can smoke in our house,” Aaron said – and one of his friends, who would not give his name, joked that he had gone to the bathroom and not flushed.A woman in a coat sat on the couch in a small room with a blue carpet and watched as a man ripped a scroll with Chinese lettering hanging on the wall. “We don’t want Chinese bullshit,” the woman said. Nearby, six men sat at a large wooden desk. A lamp with a white shade was knocked over and broken.Someone was smoking pot. “This is the pot room!” a young man said.In the Crypt, people walked around taking photographs of the statues and themselves with their phones. One man had a selfie stick, like a tourist in a foreign land. A woman in baggy jeans and a blue puffer jacket was shouting chants into a megaphone, while a man in a black T-shirt that read “Not Today Liberal” ran around the central columns in what looked like a frenetic victory lap.As authorities try to identify those in the mob, some will be less hard to pin down than others. The group included some well-known figures from the conspiratorial right, including Jake Angeli, who has pushed the false QAnon claims that Trump was elected to save the US from deep-state bureaucrats and prominent Democrats who worship Satan and abuse children.He was pictured sitting in Congress in a Viking helmet and furs. Angeli, who is known as the “Q Shaman”, has been a fixture in the pro-Trump protests in Arizona since the election, and there are indications that he and other right-wing activists had planned to spark a confrontation with authorities before Wednesday’s rally.Murder the MediaThere were also leaders from the Proud Boys, a far-right group whose participants have espoused misogynistic and anti-immigrant views, such as Nick Ochs, a failed Hawaii state legislature candidate and member of a collective called “Murder the Media”.Chris Hood and members of his National Socialist Club, a neo-Nazi group, posted photos on Telegram from outside the Capitol on Wednesday. And the Three Percenters, a far-right armed group, were seen gathered in Washington’s Freedom Plaza on Tuesday night, most wearing helmets and Kevlar vests adorned with the group’s symbol, a Roman numeral three.The mob came from the broader crowd, tens of thousands of Trump’s most loyal supporters, many of whom had driven through the night, or taken buses with friends and neighbours, to watch him speak and be part of a day that many hoped would finally hold some answers to what had been months of false claims that the election had been stolen. A number of people interviewed said they had never been to Washington before.In interviews on Wednesday, protesters in the broader crowd expressed a sense that something would happen – something that was bigger than they were. What exactly it would be no one could say. Before the Capitol was stormed, some hinted darkly about violence and the looming threat of civil war. But when pressed for what that might mean, they tended to demur, saying simply that, if called, they would serve their side in a conflict.“There’s been lots of people talking about this day coming for a long time,” said Brian Sachtleben (40), an asphalt truck driver from a small town near Sheboygan, Wisconsin, who was looking at the sea of people spreading from the Washington Monument to the Ellipse, marvelling at the numbers, shortly before Trump began to speak.When asked what he thought might happen, he said: “I don’t know. I really don’t know.” He referred cryptically to the Thomas Jefferson quote: “The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants.” Then he added: “I don’t think anything is going to be back to normal ever again.” He left town before the violence began.‘We stopped the vote!’When those who entered the Capitol later re-emerged after their rampage, many were welcomed like returning heroes. “Yeah, we stopped the vote!” screamed a man in a navy-blue zippered jacket, as he emerged, hands held high, from a tall yellow wooden door, as people outside whooped and cheered. “Murder the media” was scrawled in black marker across the other part of the double door.Many said they would not have tried to go in, but they sympathised with those who had. “I’m not going in there, but, yeah, I’m kind of okay with it,” said Lisa Todd (56), a high school teacher from Raleigh, North Carolina. She was standing with three friends, all fellow teachers.Others expressed some regret. Storming the Capitol was “probably not the best thing to do”, said Eric Dark (43), a truck driver from Braman, Oklahoma, who was tear-gassed when he got to the top of the steps to the building but never made it inside.He had been standing with Brian Hobbs, mayor of Newkirk, Oklahoma, near the top of the steps on the western side of the building around 4.30pm when officers in riot gear started moving to clear out the thousands of people who had gathered.It could have been a lot worse, he said. “We had enough people we could have tore that building down brick by brick,” he said. – New York TimesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons january 2021","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlTo order The 2020 limited-edition Matt Christmas jigsaw, go to telegraphcartoonjigsawsOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514. To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178US Capitol riots: Democrats draft article of impeachment to remove Trump - latest newsDuke and Duchess of Cambridge tell their children about NHS workers \u0026#39every day\u0026#39BBC’s Persian branch ‘used homophobic slurs in blog’Joe Biden says US Capitol \u0026#39terrorists\u0026#39 must be hunted down as FBI launches nationwide searchComment: Trump’s greatest mistake was to undermine the legitimacy of the stateCrackdown planned as Covid deaths hit record highExclusive: GP surgeries offered £1,000 to cancel second dose Covid jab appointments in roll-out chaosInauguration Day 2021: When is Joe Biden sworn in as US president, and will Trump attend?BBC’s New Year fireworks broadcast received 500 complaints for Black Lives Matter tribute Nancy Pelosi urges defence chiefs to stop Donald TrumpComment: Covid\u0026#39s fallout will plague children for years, consigning many to a life of povertyMartin Bashir expected to hand over second letter from Princess Diana showing her \u0026#39closeness\u0026#39 to himComment: The new British military mission in Mali has a worrying deficiency – a lack of air supportTest-free holidays could be on cards because some nations lack facilities for Covid checksBritish troops on Mali peacekeeping mission left without military air supportChildren\u0026#39s mental health referrals hit record high as lockdowns and school closures biteCelebrities and social media stars told to stay away from second homes in Devon and Cornwall by policeDonald Trump and the future of conservatism: What impact has the outgoing \u0026#39Agent of Chaos\u0026#39 had on the Republican Party?Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"amsterdam mulls enforcement ban foreigners coffeeshops","story":"Lost weekends in Amsterdam may be about to go up in smoke after the city’s mayor on Friday announced she wanted to ban foreign tourists from cannabis coffee shops.The proposal, one of a number included in a plan to shrink the local cannabis market and boost transparency, will be initially put to the city council at the end of January and would include a transition period if eventually adopted.In recent years, concerns have escalated about millions of tourists who visit Amsterdam to drink and ‘blow’, driving out locals in the Red Light District. The extent of overtourism was starkly illustrated during the first coronavirus lockdown, when locals reported that the popular nightlife area was completely empty.Since then, tourism chiefs, local businesses and groups of residents have all called to change the image of Amsterdam, partly by enforcing a 2013 law that bans non-residents from coffee shops. Now, mayor Femke Halsema, the public prosecution and the police have written to councillors to formally include the measure as part of a plan to bring the cannabis trade to a “manageable” level and reduce nuisance and criminality in the city centre.“This is a very positive step,” local ChristenUnie politician Don Ceder told The . “The coronavirus lockdown showed that a lot of people come to Amsterdam for drug tourism. Those that came back at first were not coming for congresses or culture. “This is really important to reduce the magnetism of the coffee shops because we need to change the international image of Amsterdam as the drugs capital of the world.”Although the coffee shops come under the mayor\u0027s jurisdiction, he expects councillors to debate the measures more fully soon and implement them at the end of the year. “We need to focus on making sure there is enough policing capacity so that we don’t create street dealing,” he added.Although cannabis is illegal in the Netherlands, its sale is tolerated. The mayor denied that this move would change that.“We are absolutely not heading for a cannabis-free Amsterdam because coffee shops belong to the city,” Ms Halsema told local newspaper Het Parool. “But there is a huge desire to change the tourism. “Our freedom should not be a license for large groups of young people to throw up in the canals because they have smoked and drunk too much.”In the last 20 years, the number of coffee shops in the capital has been cut from 283 to 166, however, city research shows that 57 per cent of tourists visiting the centre name coffee shops as an important reason for their travel. In 2019, the city had 15.5m overnight stays.Joachim Helms, from the BCD association that represents cannabis traders, said that the plans would be bad for the liveability of the city.“People want to smoke their joints and if they can’t do it in a coffee shop then they will buy it on the street,” he told the ANP.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"bath oliver biscuits back beloved british icon saved coronavirus","story":"Bath Olivers, one of Britain’s favourite biscuits has been granted a reprieve, as production has restarted following an outcry over their disappearance.Eagle-eyed Daily  readers spotted their curious absence from supermarket shelves in October with owner Pladis, formerly known as United Biscuits, saying the pandemic had caused it to cease production of the British stalwart.But fans of the buttery snack, once famed for its qualities as a medical digestive, are in luck as the factory lines are now back up and running.Pladis said that with staff shortages caused by coronavirus it had been forced to prioritise its production lines, leading to a halt for Bath Olivers. But, a spokesman said: We\u0027re pleased to report that production of Bath Oliver biscuits continues as usual. “We are aware that the COVID-19 pandemic has presented a supply chain challenge to all food manufacturers and as a consequence availability of Bath Oliver has been limited we would like to thank all our dedicated fans for their patience as we get them back on supermarket shelves.The biscuits have a colourful history after being created in around 1750 by renowned physician William Oliver in the city from which they draw their name.He used to give them out to patients who were having problems with their digestion.On his death he is said to have bequeathed the recipe, along with £100 and a sack of wheat flour, to his coachman, who became rich from manufacturing and selling them for wider consumption.They have long been seen as a British icon, and make an appearance in novels by Rudyard Kipling and Evelyn Waugh, as well as in the story of Paddington bear. Leader of the House of Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg, the MP for North East Somerset, which includes Bath, has been quoted as saying they are his personal favourite.But it was during the Second World War in which they arguably proved most useful. According to reports, the Crown Jewels were placed in a Bath Oliver tin and then buried in Windsor, with the grass allowed to grow over, to keep them safe in the event of a Nazi invasion.According to a report by the Times in 2018, when the story emerged, the smoke and mirrors operation to protect the jewels was ordered by King George VI and only discovered just over two years ago in confidential correspondence from the time seen by a BBC documentary team.Other famous biscuits became a victim of the pandemic, but normal production is now understood to have resumed.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"british troops mali peacekeeping mission left without military","story":"British troops in Mali have been left without military air support on their UN peacekeeping mission, as the Ministry of Defence has been accused of taking “unnecessary risks” with soldiers\u0027 lives.Last month British troops, primarily drawn from the Light Dragoons and Royal Anglian Regiment, began deploying on the mission in the Sahel. However, The  understands that soldiers on the ground have expressed concern that there is no immediate RAF air cover, with contracted helicopters currently supplying the UN’s aero-medical evacuation capability. The contractors took over from the Romanian contingent, when its commitment concluded in October 2020.Colonel Richard Kemp, a former commander of British Forces in Afghanistan, urged the MoD to deploy the Royal Air Force to provide air cover, rather than using contractors.He said: “I think they are taking an unnecessary risk with our soldiers’ lives. It’s the most dangerous UN mission that’s ever been attempted and there is a risk it will undermine confidence in our ability to properly evacuate troops from a scene of attack, or accident, if we aren’t prepared to make the commitment of having proper military forces that can be relied on in a way civilian contractors cannot.”Col Kemp added that if the UN mission remains unable to “find another nation to fill that gap, then Britain should fill it themselves”. Meanwhile, Robert Clark, Defence Research Fellow at the Henry Jackson Society and former soldier, said “it doesn’t wash” that the MoD were relying on contractors for air cover, as he said the three RAF Chinooks, which are separate to the British Task Group, were currently “occupied” by supporting the French operation.Writing in The , he said: “It is inconceivable in any modern conflict zone for British forces to operate effectively over long range without dedicated helicopter support.During this mission British troops will routinely operate hours if not days from the base at Gao with its medical facilities. Absence of helicopters to evacuate casualties given these time-frames could easily cost soldiers’ lives.”Mr Clark cautioned that the “deficiency cannot be due to misappreciation of the threat or environment in northern Mali but to economic constraints”. An MoD spokesman said: “UK personnel supporting the UN’s mission in Mali have access to a wide range of air and land assets for medical evacuation, including the UN’s helicopter capability.“Arrangements also exist for use of the British Chinook helicopters and other French assets operating under Operation Barkhane. Medical evacuation is a priority consideration for all UK operations and the UK task group in Mali will only operate within the bounds of access to medical support.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"exclusive gp surgeries offered 1000 cancel second dose covid","story":"GPs are being paid £1,000 to cancel second dose appointments for Covid jabs and given a script to follow to deal with angry patients amid growing chaos in the roll-out of the vaccine programme.Practices have been offered the payments to cover the workload of postponing hundreds of patients who were set to have their second dose and booking new ones in their place.The Department of Health and Social Care said updated guidance had been issued on December 17, made available in a pack called Information for UK Healthcare Professionals. However, it is understood that some healthcare staff were unaware of the changes.NHS sources said the shift has contributed to delays in rolling out the programme. Some GPs have refused to postpone the appointments, with practice managers saying it was too cruel to dash the hopes of those who were booked for a second jab.Ministers have promised to offer almost 15 million people jabs by the middle of February, with hundreds of doses a day administered by the end of next week. In December, everyone given a first vaccine by Pfizer was told to come back for their second dose three weeks later. But the strategy was changed 10 days ago in a bid to get a first dose to more of the population more quickly.Patients are now being told they will have to wait 12 weeks for the second dose, with a reassurance from health officials that the longer gap could strengthen its effectiveness.By the time the plan was changed, around one million people had already been booked in for their second dose. GPs are now under orders to postpone such appointments and instead give the slots to those awaiting a  first dose. A letter from senior NHS officials, seen by The , reveals that centres that are running the scheme have been offered £1,000 towards the costs of cancelling and rebooking patients. The letter from Dr Nikita Kanani, the medical director for primary care, and Ed Waller, the director of primary care, dated December 31, says the changes in the strategy mean the system will now be delaying second doses and cancelling large numbers of appointments next week onwards.While the moves are critical to protect health for more patients, they have significant administrative implications, it says. It directs GPs to a script produced to support these challenging conversations and promises financial support for those following the instructions.Many GPs have refused to carry out the orders, with Nadhim Zahawi, the vaccines minister, saying this week that they have discretion to honour existing appointments. On Friday, Boris Johnson\u0027s father, Stanley, said he was about to have his second dose of the Pfizer jab. One NHS source said the changes had contributed to delays in GPs receiving deliveries of vaccine. The source said shipments originally planned for second doses have been erted to other practices, sometimes with little or no warning. Jo Wade, the director of the Institute for General Practice Management, which represents GP practice managers, said many surgeries had decided not to cancel appointments for second doses rather than be cruel to patients.GP surgeries are under unbelievable pressure, so to be asked to phone 975 elderly people to cancel their appointments was unfair on us, and really cruel to them, she said. It\u0027s led to people phoning up the surgeries in quite a nasty way wanting to know when they\u0027re having the vaccine, even though it\u0027s not under our control.On Friday night, health officials announced that all NHS staff and social care workers will be offered jabs over the next five weeks as hospitals come under increasing pressure. Until now, the Government had said only front line staff would be included in the early priority groups. The change means clerical staff and managers working for the health service will be able to receive jabs months before they are offered to most people under the age of 70, including key workers such as teachers and police. Ruth May, the NHS chief nursing officer said: As we move to the next phase of the roll-out, it is only right that we prioritise the NHS staff who have been on the frontline of this global pandemic. We will be prioritising the nurses, doctors and other frontline staff who continue to work tirelessly, before administering the vaccine to almost all health and social care staff by mid-February.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"exclusive luxury property firm offered gps 100000 give workers","story":"Doctors across the country were offered up to £100,000 by a luxury property firm to vaccinate its workforce amid fears of an emerging black market for jabs.The Hacking Trust, a London-based property investment firm, sent an email to NHS surgeries today offering a “reward” for vaccinating its “frontline staff”, the  can disclose.The company told GPs it would pay £5,000 for every jab administered to its 20 workers. “This can be paid either as a charitable donation or to the staff member directly,” the email said.In November the government vowed that private companies would not be allowed to purchase the vaccine before everyone in the country was offered the jab for free on the NHS.The disclosure will fuel fears of a black market for Covid vaccines with companies willing to offer thousands of pounds for single doses of the vital jabs.In the email seen by the , the Hacking Trust introduced itself as a “private medical company who is looking to vaccinate their front-line staff as soon as possible”.With the subject line “Unused vaccine reward”, the email continued: “We require approx 20 vaccinations and we understand you are operating a Covid-19 vaccination centre. We have been informed that many appointments are not kept and some do not attend at all. “On this basis we would like to be informed as soon as possible of any “no shows” or cancellations on any given day which would result in unnecessary wastage of the vaccination. “We will donate to the inidual the sum of £5,000 for each successful vaccine for our staff members. This can be paid either as a charitable donation or to the staff member directly. “We are able to attend within a few hours following a telephone call email response. I look forward to hearing from you as a matter of urgency to discuss.”It is understood the email was sent to other GP surgeries including one in Worthing, West Sussex.Based in Wandsworth, south London, the Hacking Trust describes itself on its website as “specialists in purchasing residential and commercial properties” and a “market leader in its sector”. “Our skill is structuring deals with expert legal and financial backing enabling us to get things done professionally and efficiently,” it says.The email, which claimed to be from a “private medical company”, was sent from the company’s Hacking Health Trust ision, which on its website specialises in “looking to buy commercial medical properties on a nationwide basis”.“In this difficult time of raising capital it is proving to be a very successful and creative way of creating cash flow for practitioners. You may be looking to raise equity to expand the surgery or to buy equipment. You may be looking to buy out retiring partners,” the website tells prospective clients.Robyn Clark, a director of the Institute for General Practice Management, which represents NHS GP practice managers, said: “The IGPM are appalled that this company would offer money to practices to essentially jump the queue. “Practices are doing their utmost to ensure vaccine is given to the priority groups as laid out by the JCVI, as these are the most vulnerable in our society. These patients have been waiting for vaccine and many of them are willing to attend sites at short notice to get the chance to have it. “We are astounded that anyone would think offering money is appropriate in these circumstances. The NHS is free at the point of access for patients and always will be.”Covid-19 vaccines are licensed by Public Health England and owned by the UK government, and are not available for private sale.The Government has previously insisted there will be no queue-jumping for a Covid-19 vaccine and “every single person in the UK” will be offered one for free on the NHS before any private providers will have a product to sell.Professor Jonathan Van-Tam, the deputy chief medical officer, has previously said:“I am giving you my views as a clinician that I think these vaccines need to be prioritised to those who need them, not those who can afford to pay for them privately.”Last month it was reported that wealthy people were offering huge sums of money to skip the queue for the coronavirus vaccines.Several private British doctors said they had been bombarded with requests from wealthy iniduals offering to pay to have theirs ahead of time.Dr Roshan Ravindran, owner of Klnik, a private clinic in Wilmslow, Cheshire, claimed some clients had offered £2,000 for injections.Greg Clark MP, chairman of the science and technology committee, said vaccines left over at the end of the day should be reserved for frontline health workers.“It is important that vaccines should be given in order of the age and vulnerability of patients. If there are ever any unused vaccines that need to be deployed by the NHS at the end of a day they should be offered first to critical workers,” he said.A spokesman for the company said: “The Hacking Health Trust has offered in open correspondence to some GPs charitable donations to staff or surgeries in this difficult time for any vaccines which were unused. We had heard that some vaccines were being unused due to missed appointments.“We would apologise that our good intentions have been misinterpreted.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"martin bashir expected hand second letter princess diana showing","story":"Martin Bashir is expected to hand over to an inquiry a second letter from Princess Diana showing her closeness to him.The letter to Mr Bashir is separate to an earlier one the princess sent to the BBC in which she insisted she had willingly given the interview to Panorama.The second letter – handwritten by Princess Diana on official headed notepaper – is understood to heap fulsome praise on Mr Bashir and was written some time after the Panorama interview. Sources have told The  they expect Mr Bashir, now the BBC’s religious affair editor, to cooperate with the ongoing inquiry and that the letter will be produced as part of his argument. Mr Bashir, 57, has not been seen on television screens since going off sick with Covid-19 and then undergoing a quadruple heart bypass.He is accused of tricking Princess Diana into giving the interview in 1995 that sent shockwaves around the world. In the interview she told Bashir: “There were three of us in this marriage, so it was a bit crowded” in reference to the Prince of Wales adulterous affair with Camilla Parker-Bowles.The existence of the second much more personal letter is understood to show a closeness between Mr Bashir and the princess and offer further evidence that she was happy the interview had gone ahead and pleased with its outcome.Mr Bashir has admitted faking two bank statements that falsely showed payments to the former head of security of Earl Spencer, princess Diana’s brother, from a tabloid newspaper and an offshore company.Earl Spencer said Mr Bashir used the faked statements to wrongly gain his trust and subsequently secure a meeting with Diana that led to the interview. The allegations are deeply damaging for the BBC’s reputation prompting its new director-general Tim Davie to order an independent investigation into events more than 25 years ago.The inquiry, begun in November, is being chaired by Lord Dyson, a former Master of the Rolls, and is expected to take six months to complete. Mr Bashir (although still on sick leave) has indicated he is willing to cooperate with the Dyson inquiry and to give his version of events. Sources have suggested that with his career under such scrutiny, Mr Bashir has nothing to lose by doing so.The  understands the second letter will be submitted by Mr Bashir to Lord Dyson to show that Princess Diana still trusted him, even after his deceit over the bank statements was made public in a Mail on Sunday expose in 1996.Earl Spencer kept notes of his meetings with Mr Bashir, including one where he introduced the journalist to his sister. His notes from the time allegedly show 32 false claims and smears made up by Mr Bashir to persuade Princess Diana to give him the interview.Princess Diana wrote a letter to the BBC after the interview, confirming she was not shown any faked bank statements by Mr Bashir and “that these documents played no part in her decision”.The letter went missing (it is understood a member of the BBC staff had taken it home as a keepsake) but has been handed back to the corporation and supplied to Lord Dyson.The second letter from Princess Diana is understood to be much more effusive and was sent directly to Mr Bashir. It shows the pair remained in touch after the interview.Mr Bashir has been accused of showing the letter to Michael Jackson and his entourage to persuade the pop singer, now dead, to give him an exclusive interview in 2002.Jackson’s former bodyguard Matt Fiddes said Mr Bashir had used “the Princess Diana handwritten note to convince Michael he could be trusted”.Alan Waller, the former head of security whose bank statements were faked by Mr Bashir, has now made an official complaint to the politan Police. Scotland Yard has said it will examine the complaint before deciding whether to launch a criminal investigation.Neither Mr Bashir nor Lord Dyson were available for comment.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"republican party must follow labours deradicalisation attempts","story":"The distressing scenes in the US Capitol on Wednesday evening saw many left-wing commentators leap to project the broken extremism of the American radical right onto mainstream British Conservatism.In doing so, they misrepresent an optimistic Prime Minister, whose obvious temperamental and intellectual differences from President Trump are also borne out in his policy agenda. The PM lobbied for the Iran deal, pushed for a London migration amnesty and made climate change a cornerstone of British foreign policy. He has spoken up for free trade while Trump has touted tariffs. Arguably, the challenges facing the Republican Party reflect Labour’s recent struggles far more than these lazy comparisons.Mainstream British Conservatives rejected the toxic creed of Trumpism long before the attempted coup. Away from the Twittersphere, the nation agrees. In October YouGov found that not only supermajorities in every region of the UK, but also majorities of both Leave and Remain supporters, Tory and Labour voters, would not choose Trump. The Tories, who after all returned to power with an 80-seat majority, no doubt understand this too. As the Prime Minister said at PMQs in November, after becoming the first world leader outside of North America who President-Elect Biden spoke to on the phone, he found it “refreshing” to speak to a partner who agreed on the need to “stick up for our values around the world – to stick up for human rights and stick up for free trade, to stick up for Nato... and to work together in the fight against climate change.”By convention, office holders rightly do not interfere in foreign elections while they take place. Parliamentarians who no longer hold high office, however, have made their views clear. Former Chancellor of the Exchequer Sajid Javid wrote powerfully in this paper of his admiration for Reagan-era Republican Party - a hopeful, forward facing, optimistic conservatism that appeals to best instincts not base fears.Former Foreign Secretary Lord Hague noted that “British Conservatives, even those of us with decades-long friendships among Republicans” are forsaking international party alliances for the sake of common decency. Conservative parliamentarians who recently held great offices of state were clear. No doubt freed from the constraints of office many more would have said the same.As a US Senator, Biden tabled a resolution to back the British in the lead up to the Falklands War in 1982 – when the White House was reluctant to declare a side. Meanwhile Trump’s touted pro-British credentials on the other hand never materialised in policy terms.Today’s Conservative Party is clearly not in the same ballpark as the Trump-led Republicans, but that wayward organisation could, however, perhaps learn from the other main party on this side of the Atlantic. In both cases, an aging protectionist crank hijacked and radicalised the base of his red party. He promised simple (though expensive) solutions to complex problems, called violent racists either his “friends” or “very fine people”, fired up his extreme supporters at rallies, and despite all this was deified by his base.In the space of one year in the United Kingdom, Jeremy Corbyn has gone from being idolised within the Labour Party membership, to polls showing only a minority believe he should even continue to sit under the Labour whip. The Labour Party is slowly attempting to prove that it is possible to deradicalise a party. When the time comes to clear the swamp once again, establishment Republicans should perhaps give Keir Starmer a call.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"test free holidays could cards nations lack facilities covid","story":"Grant Shapps, the Transport Secretary, has exempted countries without the infrastructure available to deliver the pre-departure negative test certificates, which all travellers are now required to have to enter England and Scotland, from the Government\u0027s new border regime.The Department for Transport refused to name any countries or define the criteria on Friday, but travel experts suggested destinations in the Caribbean, sub-Saharan Africa and tropical islands such as the Males and Pacific Islands could be exempt.It would mean travellers from those countries would be able to bypass the requirement to prove they are negative for Covid with a pre-departure test taken within 72 hours of arrival in England or Scotland. They would, however, still have to quarantine on arrival if the country was on the red list.Under the rules, which come into force next week, anyone making it to the UK without a test faces a £500 fine, while airlines will be required to refuse boarding to any passenger without a Covid-negative test certificate. They face £5,000 fines for any transgressors they bring to the UK.The need for infrastructure exemption was highlighted by Heathrow\u0027s chief executive, John Holland-Kaye, who said the rules would present a real challenge for some passengers due to varying testing facilities in other countries.He said Heathrow had the capacity to test up to 25,000 people a day, but other airports around the world lacked such facilities.So, if you\u0027re caught out in one of those countries, and you now have these new requirements, then you\u0027ll find it quite difficult to get the tests that are needed in order to come back home again. And that\u0027s going to be a real challenge for a lot of passengers, Mr Holland-Kaye said.He urged the Government to take the lead in creating a common international standard for testing to replace current confusing differences between nations.Paul Charles, the chief executive of travel consultancy The PC Agency, said the Government needed to urgently publish a list so that travellers returning to the UK could plan their trips. Travel companies and airlines are already considering or offering discounted tests as part of packages and flights as they negotiate deals with testing companies.Alan French, the chief executive of Thomas Cook, said: We\u0027re already starting to look for partners across our main holiday areas to build connections so we can help our customers get the best deal and service for their test. We would urge the Government to provide more clarity on when they intend to introduce this and under what circumstances they will lift it.The new scheme means a holidaymaker could face a bill of more than £300 for an outbound test, a pre-departure return test and then a test on the fifth day of quarantine to be released from self isolation early.Henry Smith, the chairman of the all-party Future of Aviation group, said the introduction of pre-departure testing meant quarantine was probably unnecessary and should be ditched as soon as feasible. He called for screening of incoming passengers from China a year ago. It is incredible it has taken so many months to introduce Covid-19 screening for incoming passengers. The lack of that testing has caused the Covid pandemic to be worse in the UK and caused unnecessary damage to our aviation industry, he said.Research published on Friday from Oxford and Edinburgh Universities showed that coronavirus was introduced to the UK well over 1,000 times in early 2020, with the majority of transmissions coming from Spain, France and Italy.  More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"zero gravity rooms hazmat suits like getting covid security","story":"I knew re-entering South Korea wouldn’t be easy. I just didn’t realise it would take over 24 hours to get back home from the moment I landed.No sooner had I arrived in Seoul than my temperature was checked.I had to submit multiple quarantine forms asking whether I had symptoms, and that I agreed to quarantine rules during my upcoming 14 days of self-isolation. In recent months, those who have breached compulsory self-isolation have been imprisoned, or even deported.I was told to throw away my mask and replace it with a tighter one kindly provided.A quarantine official had my name on a list of incoming passengers from the UK and South Africa, meaning I had to get tested immediately for Covid-19 - despite already producing evidence of a negative test issued in the UK. (If not at the airport, other arrivals must get tested at their local health centres.)I was escorted by a man in a full hazmat suit onto the windy tarmac to get tested. Officials were clearly taking no chances during the few seconds I lowered my mask while they inserted a swab deep into my nose and throat.Next, I was required to install a self-quarantine app on my smartphone to diagnose myself three times a day for two weeks.This alerts authorities of any symptoms such as fever, cough, or shortness of breath. They then called my phone to make sure the number worked.Finally through immigration, those of us who were tested at the airport were brought to a quarantine facility to await our results, which came out nine hours later.In my case, I was told my test needed to be re-analysed, which would take another 10 hours. And so I was brought to a negative pressure room to sleep the night, meaning that air inside the room could not flow out.The test, meals, and quarantine were all free of charge. After lunchtime the next day, I finally received the negative result I was waiting for.A nurse, again in full PPE gear, came to collect me and gave me gloves to wear. I was then taken by bus back to the airport with others who had just been discharged.Police officers were waiting for us and took the register. I was exhausted, but the end was in sight. We were allocated inidual quarantine taxis, where the driver was sealed off from the back seats. I was driven to my doorstep, and haven’t left my house since.Meanwhile, my local district’s health centre calls me daily to check up on my physical and mental condition. I’m only allowed to open the door to pick up online shopping, groceries and food deliveries placed on my doorstep.I’ve also received a hygiene care kit which includes sanitiser, masks, and medical waste bin bags, the latter to protect waste collectors from potentially coming into contact with the virus.I’ll be able to throw out my waste after the 14 days are over, when specialised waste disposal workers will come. I’ll then also need to get re-tested for the third time, having come from the UK.My experience in South Korea was in stark contrast to the one I went through at London Heathrow a few weeks back.No temperature checks, no screening, no testing, no negative PCR results, no request to present passenger locator form, little social distancing, many passengers with masks under their noses, and some staff without masks.It was the first time in one year after leaving South Korea that I felt exposed to the virus.The measures taken in South Korea may seem excessive, but the view here is that they are necessary to contain the spread of the virus. I am grateful to live in a country where the government cares for those it governs.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"so hows nobel peace prize","story":"NewsopinionSo how’s that Nobel Peace Prize for pal Trump looking now The violence at the Capitol this week was something most sane people feared from the day Donald Trump was sworn in and spent hours in front of his TV raging at comments about the smallness of his inauguration crowdmirrorShareCommentsByBrian Reade:,  JAN NewsopinionRight-wing mob storms the Capitol at the behest of Donald Trump \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Because he, and the rest of the mad-eyed, far-right posse, backed up something I wrote a few months ago: That Donald Trump was looking increasingly like Adolf Hitler in his final days. There he sat, paranoid, in his Washington bunker, denying reality while sycophants pretended all was well. The big dference, I argued, was that Trump would never take a cyanide pill as he was too cowardly. Say what you like about Hitler but he didn’t try to get out of World War One by claiming he had “heel spurs”. When he incited that mob in Washington to attempt to destroy democracy by pandering to their basest prejudices, the Hitler parallels stood up. As Germany’s Foreign Minister, Heiko Maas, said, watching it unfold: “Seditious words turn to violent actions – on the steps of the Reichstag, and now in the Capitol.” It’s something most sane people feared from the day he was sworn in and spent hours in front of his TV raging at comments about the ­smallness of his inauguration crowd. Then ordered his staff to doctor ­photographs to prove his audience was bigger than Barack Obama’s. It signposted a war against anyone who refused to buy into his cult of narcissism. All non-believers were dismissed as fake news peddlers, ­Marxists or deep-state enemies, as he drugged his followers with lies and conspiracy theories. What we saw on Wednesday night in Washington was merely the culmination of his deliberate play to far-right groups, everyday racists and the not very bright that he would make America Great Again. With ‘Great’ being an unsubtle codename for‘White’.  Buthe was so dangerous, why did the major figures in successive British administrations not see it  Andthey did, why did they pander like the worst kind of s appeasers to an out-of-control monster sowing ision and hate  It’s yet another indictment on these recent gutless Tory governments. Remember Theresa May holding his hand in Washington, and promising a full state visit soon after he was elected, when he was openly demeaning her to anyone who listened  Michael Gove grovelling to him in Trump Tower, Jacob Rees-Mogg saying he would definitely vote for himhe were American and Boris Johnson demanding he be given the Nobel Peace Prize. This despite the object of their flattery mocking their incompetence over Brexit and publicly claiming the NHS was broke and London had become a racist hellhole.

The new TV ad, fronted by Englandaposs Chief Medical Officer Professor Chris Whitty, urges people to stay at home and “act like you’ve got it.”  The latest aposStay Home, Save Livesapos campaign came on a day the UK recorded its highest daily death toll in the pandemic, and a record number of new infections.

The couple founded Urban Outreach  years ago and last year they helped thousands of local people - including redistributing , unwanted first class airline dishes to those in need. David is modest about his work and is keen to point out that it was the donations from the public that got  off to a flying start. “We have people donating food all the time, but in the Christmas of  we had the largest amount we’d ever seen in all the years we’ve been doing this,” he says. “We had so much, we were storing supplies in a church building, offices and food bank. “When Covid- hit, we had enough food from people’s generous donations to survive for the first four weeks of the original lockdown. It was a remarkable thing and it gave us a whole sense that we could cope with whatever was ahead. “Once, we had a delivery of , first class airline meals and we didn’t have any room for them, so a pasty manufacturer cleared a whole freezer so we could support other areas of Manchester. Of course there were tough times as David, , Christine, , and their team of volunteers worked around the clock to deliver what was needed – including providing , lunches in the school holidays, , food hampers at Christmas and , meals for the homeless over the winter period. “We’ve encountered some of the saddest parts, as well as the happiest bits during the pandemic,” says David.“We had volunteers who were really struggling, then we were sending food out and finding people had died. At one point we had  people delivering food, that was quite magnicent. “Furlough was the answer to our problems because we had so many people volunteering and their companies let them use their vans. It was remarkable. We put on barbecues, Caribbean meals and non-alcoholic cocktail bars for the drivers.” David and Christine are just two of the erse group of people who were awarded MBEs in the New Year Honours list. It’s a powerful way to say thank you to people on the frontline, who have supported the nation through the unprecedented times of the Covid- pandemic. Anyone can nominate someone that they believe has made an exceptional contribution to UK society.People are honoured for achievements such as making a signicant dference to their community and improving le for others, long-term voluntary service and remarkable innovation and entrepreneurship. The Bagleys were both surprised to be awarded MBEs and are clearly humbled by the honours. “I just happened to be at home one afternoon and I was going through some emails and I went in and said to Chris: ‘I’ve just got this email about a MBE thing.’ I read it through and realised it wasn’t a hoax!” says David. “Later, she got an email too and we had  hours to accept it. I guess at some point we’ll collect them, but we haven’t been given any sort of date yet. But getting to call my mum and tell her was the best thing. I’m adopted, so my parents made it all possible. I said: ‘I’ve got a gt for you.’ This MBE is theirs, too.“If we take an MBE, it’s not ours. It belongs to thousands upon thousands of people who have volunteered, given and supported us – children who have ridden their bikes up and down the street and got their neighbours to donate. It belongs to them. We only created a space and people filled that space.“The one thing to come out of all this is people pulling together. Evenyou only have one thing to give, it’s added to somebody ’s one thing and together we have an abundance.”Vital support for those with sensory loss  Jacquie Winning MBE, , from Falkirk is manager of the Forth Valley Sensory Centre and her work with people with sensory loss has been more important than ever during the pandemic. “Covid- has been challenging for everyone, but more so for people with sensory loss,” she explains. “Those with hearing loss are facing extra challenges due to face masks and social distancing interfering with their ability to lip read. There are also signicant challenges facing people with sight loss in maintaining physical distancing while undertaking essential trips out. “I identied these challenges and provided support with Braille copies of essential Covid- information for people with sight loss, a telephone, text and email befriending service to support those who were isolated as a result of lockdown. As well as podcasts providing the most up-to-date Covid- information for people with sight loss.” Jacquie’s dedicated and hard-working team are also supporting people living with sensory loss so they can pay their bills remotely. She shares the recognition her MBE gives with the rest of her team. “This award recognises the achievements of everyone at the Sensory Centre in what has been an exceptionally challenging year,” says Jacquie. “Thanks go to the dedication, enthusiasm and willingness to adapt by our team, volunteers and partners, and the tremendous support of our board of directors. Together we have been able to continue to provide essential services for our vision and hearing-impaired centre users, who continue to be some of the most vulnerable and hardest hit by the pandemic. I am privileged to work with such an inspiring group of people.”  Critical care on the frontline and pivotal research and tutorials in the background  Critical care consultant at Royal Gwent Hospital Dr Tamas Szakmany was made an MBE after he led the response of the Welsh Critical Care Network during the pandemic. He looked after  patients, doubling his normal clinical time spent at the bedside. On top of this, Dr Szakmany, , from Newport, South Wales, spent hours on conference calls, online tutorials and webinars to share his experience of working in ICU and rapidly built up a research programme. He also took part inthe Oxford vaccine trial. The last thing he expected was to be honoured for his work, so he was surprised to get the email informing him of his MBE. “I was completely astonished, touched and humbled. I thought I was doing my job like everybody . I didn’t think for one minute it would result in this,” he says.  “Once I was allowed to talk about it, the first thing I said was how fortunate I was to work with this team: the clinical and managerial team, the civil servants and the research team at my hospital and across the UK.  was dficult professionally. Personally, I had many successes. It was a double-edged sword. The MBE is recognition for the enormous effort everyone has made to get us through the first wave and I hope we have similar success again. “We will get through this together.

Appalled RSPCA inspectors said German shepherd Saskia had one of the most horrendous skin conditions and infections that we’ve ever seen after concerned members of the public raised the alarm about her welfare.The emaciated canine weighed just kg and had extremely overgrown claws - and painful infections in both ears, LancsLive reports.She has been left with emotional scars to go with the physical ones following her ordeal which has made her nervous around new people. Would you adopt Saskia  Let us know in the comments section  Hannah Kirrane, from RSPCA Blackpool  North Lancs Branch, said: “Saskia had one of the most horrendous skin conditions and infections that we’ve ever seen.She was missing almost all of her fur down her legs and over her rear end, and her skin was covered in weeping sores and scabs. “On her back and bottom, the skin was raw and hardened and looked like barnacles. Her skin was hard like stone. She must have been so uncomfortable. We believe it was caused by untreated fleas which, over time, escalated and became infected.”  The eight-year-old arrived at Longview Animal Centre in Poulton in April  after being rescued by the RSPCA inspectors. She underwent an intensive programme of treatment, being fed drugs to relieve her pain and antibiotics to fight infections. Medicated baths helped treat her wounds and soother her agony. “She began an intensive course of treatment including pain relief, antibiotics and daily medicated baths. She was weighed daily and, at one point, was on six feeds a day to build up her weight, Hannah added. She is still receiving regular baths which will need to be continued in her new home but all of her other medication has since stopped and she is on a standard diet having gained an incredible kg since arriving. “Her ears will need close monitoring in her new home and she would benefit from regular ear cleaning.”  Saskia, described as an absolute joy, has amazed her rescuers by making an amazing recovery after nine months in care. She looks like a completely dferent dog to the skinny, frightened animal which caused such alarm to people who saw her suffering. But due to her emotional trauma, staff are looking for an adult-only home for her with confident owners who have experience owning German Shepherds. “We’d really like Saskia’s new owners to live near to the centre so that they can come in and meet Saskia multiple times to get to know her before taking her home,” Hannah added. “This will need to be done once government guidelines allow. “Unsurprisingly given her history, Saskia can be unsure of new people and barks to show she’s nervous. Once she knows you she is extremely affectionate but she needs time to build up her confidence around new people.

And I do feel like shouting Hurray. It’ll take up to  days for me to develop full immunity but of course I already have substantial immunity from the first injection. I was determined to be first in line when the vaccine was offered to me which happened fairly quickly because I’m considered extremely vulnerable on account of my age, , and my medical conditions which involve my heart, my lungs and my kidneys. So I had my first vaccination three weeks ago today. There’s no keener advocate of vaccination in the UK than me. I believe in the protection it gives us with all my being and I beg anyone who is offered the vaccination to take it up. It’s our best hope. It’s the only way that we’ll get out of the pandemic and it’s essential that as many people as possible get immunised. To my mind the risks are infinitesimally small when compared to the phenomenal benefits. Of course my vaccinations are courtesy of our truly amazing scientists who have made an effective and safe vaccine in record time. Also to the people in charge of logistics distributing the vaccine and the frontline workers who actually injected the vaccine into my arm. I’m inexpressibly grateful. On the occasion of my first vaccination I became friendly with others who were waiting, some in their s, some with Zimmer frames and some in wheelchairs.

Moon River, in Holderness Road, east Hull, was deemed as an imminent risk to public health and an order for immediate closure was secured. An investigation found cooked foods were stored in close proximity to raw food creating a cross contamination risk. Food was also found stored in dirty cardboard boxes, according to Hull Live. The takeaway was first shut down using a Hygiene Emergency Prohibition Noticeon March  last year after an inspection found a series of potentially dangerous hygiene breaches. It had not long bounced back from a previous zero hygiene rating – gaining a top rating of five – before falling foul once more. The visit in March by Hull City Council inspectors found a series of damning breaches. They included:being filthy throughout evidence of cross contamination from raw foods to cooked foods in both storage and preparation food handlers not wearing protective over-clothing and failing to wash their hands after handling raw food several areas of the premises were poorly maintained no antibacterial surface cleaner.The problems were severe enough to be considered an imminent risk to public health and Hull Magistratesapos Court issued a Hygiene Prohibition Order which forced the closure of the takeaway until the Food Safety Team was satisfied it no longer posed a health risk. The business was allowed to reopen after meeting the necessary standards. However, officers ed on May  to investigate a food complaint they had received.  Their investigation found:flies were found to be crawling on cooked foods food handlers were not wearing protective overclothing cooked foods were stored in close proximity to raw food creating a cross contamination risk high risk foods were stored out of temperature control food was stored in dirty cardboard boxes there was no date labelling system in place to ensure stock control access to the hand basin was very dficult so that food handlers could not easily wash their hands.Once again, officers deemed there was an imminent risk to public health and an order for immediate closure was secured. At a hearing on December  at Hull Magistratesapos Court, the hygiene breaches found during both visits were taken into account. A guilty plea to nine separate offences was entered and the court fined the limited company which owns the takeaway, Ying  , £, and £ costs be paid. Additionally, the director, Mrs Ying Ni was fined £ and ordered to pay £ costs and £ victim surcharge. The fines were imposed for failure to implement and maintain a food safety management system with no separate penalty for the other offences.  The food business operators were previously prosecuted for serious food hygiene offences in . Michael Fish, principal environmental health officer at Hull City Council, said: “Food businesses must have in place a documented food safety management. It is imperative that the controls highlighted in this document are fully implemented into the business to ensure food safety is maintained at all times. “Officers have worked closely with this business for a number of years giving food safety advice. “Where businesses fail to act upon this advice and the result is that there is a risk to public health then we have no other alternative but to consider formal action in line with the graduated approach to enforcement.” "},{"url":null,"title":"grandad tears left lying ice","story":"NewsGrandad in tears left lying on ice in pain for three hours waiting for ambulanceGeorge Arnold was eventually taken to hospital lying on a fishing bed in the back of a van as North West Ambulance Service say they were battling  emergencies waiting in the Merseyside area alonemirrorShareCommentsByJonathan HumphriesJoseph WilkesReporter:,  JAN NewsThis is what George Arnolds son found when he went to where his dad had fallen \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Our free email newsletter sends you the biggest headlines from news, sport and showbizWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

George Arnold, , suffered a bad fall while walking his dog, Cappie, on slippery footpaths on Wednesday, before making a distressing phone call to his son when he knew there would be no use in trying to get up.Son Ian rushed to the scene assuming his dad would have been in the ambulance and on his way to hospital, reports the Liverpool Echo.But by the time her got there he was shocked to find his old man still lying where he fell, chilled to the bone and developing hypothermia, which can be fatal. Have you experienced a long wait for an ambulance due to stretched resources  Email webnews@mirror Ian and a pal were forced to peel George off the ice and carefully place him onto a fishing bed and into the back of a van. His embarrassed dad looked at him in distress and fear he was going to cry in front of everyone before screaming in agony with eyes rolling his head.  Ian told the Echo: My dad called me and just basically said he had a fall and couldnapost get up. He said a man and a girl who where nearby had called him an ambulance and they said theyaposre on their way. A little old lady who lived nearby had brought him a blanket. I said shall I come down and he said there wasnapost much point because the ambulance was coming. I phoned my sister and she said we should go down anyway just in case, so I got a few bits together and we drove up. I turned up fully expecting him not to be there, but he was literally just lying on the ice.   The North West Ambulance Service was battling  other emergencies at the time, waiting in the Merseyside area alone, a spokesperson said. The pensioner from St Helens was suffering from hypothermia by the time he was rushed to hospital. The ambulance service has apologised and vowed to investigate after the -year-oldaposs traumatic ordeal in St Helens, in an area between Clock Face Road and Cranshaw Avenue. The ordeal began when the pensioner slipped on the icy ground, which was some distance from the roadside, and knew instantly he had seriously injured himself.  Ian said he received a call at around .pm from his distressed dad - who is diabetic and has twice suffered from cancer. Ian said he tried to lt his dadaposs leg to place something underneath him but the smallest movement was agonising. He said: He was in that much pain he was literally crying. The  operator said donapost move him because it could cause more damage, and just to keep him as warm as we could. Ian says he was told an ambulance would be on the way as soon as possible but as time dragged on his dad began to deteriorate. He said: After about two and half hours my dad was shaking like a leaf, and he said he was feeling sick. He started telling me he could not feel his left leg any more. He kept saying, aposI donapost think I am going to make itapos. I phoned the ambulance again and said aposlook, you are going to have to get here nowapos. Ian said the  operator could say nothing more than an ambulance was on the way and eventually a manager was brought over, who asked to speak to his dad. But as Mr Arnold was conscious and able to respond, the severity of the  call was not escalated and the pensioner was left on the ice. Ian said he knew at this stage he could not wait any longer, and called his aposbest mateapos John Jenson, who drove as close as possible with the van and the fishing bed. He said Mr Arnold was struggling to remain conscious, and had been lying on the ice so long his clothes were stuck to it. Ian said: I told my dad aposIaposm sorry, we are going to have to lt you onto this fishing bedapos. He said aposbut I am going to cry in front of everyoneapos, as there were quite a few people there by then. We had to literally peel him off the ice and he was screaming in agony. We managed to carry him over to the van and all the way to the hospital his eyes were rolling in his head. Fortunately Ian and Mr Jenson managed to get Mr Arnold to AE at Whiston Hospital where he was treated for hypothermia and began coughing up blood - which Ian says he was told may have been related to exposure to the cold. The pensioner underwent surgery to his hip today and is recovering well, said Ian. He said: I understand that there is a pandemic and there must be a lot of pressure, but just because he wasnapost bleeding and was conscious does not mean he wasnapost an emergency. Ian also added he wanted to praise the amazing community spirit of the passers by who helped including Reese Jones, the man who called  and waited with him for over two hours. He said: There was quite a lot of concerned people that brought him blankets and stuck around in the bitter cold, and I was cold too, probably -°, thataposs what my car said when I got in it later.

The bombshell blindsided the Queen and threatened to destabilise the very fabric of the monarchy. In the days that followed, the Queen and her heirs, Princes Charles and William, ordered a series of crisis talks to deal with the wantaway couple, forcing Harry to a Sandringham Summit at the royals’ Norfolk estate. What is your view on Harry and Meghan, one year on  Have your say in the comment section The emergency meeting ended with the Queen reluctantly granting her grandson and his we permission to step down as senior royals. Agreements were put in place alongside a -month review of the thrashed-out agreement, in which they promised to “continue to uphold the values of Her Majesty” while getting their independence. Here we look at what has happened to the couple and -month-old son Archie in the  months since, and what lies ahead... Three moves  Three house moves between three countries – from Frogmore Cottage in Windsor to the Canadian wilderness and on to the paparazzi capital of the world a stone’s throw from Hollywood.Harry and Meghan plotted their escape from The Firm from a remote estate on Vancouver Island in British Columbia, Canada – a far cry from where they would end up putting down roots in the millionaire’s playground of Montecito, Calornia.As coronavirus lockdowns were enforced around the world, the couple fled the Commonwealth country to stay rent free at movie producer Tyler Perry’s £million mansion in the US. They soon bought a £million home near celebrity pals Oprah Winfrey and Ellen DeGeneres. Making millionsWith a reported £million from Netflix and £m from Spoty, the couple have more than achieved the financial independence they sought.But courtiers are privately concerned by the rate at which they are signing deals, and whether they will be able to “uphold the values of Her Majesty” and the institution as they vowed last year. Meghan’s personal investments have also “raised eyebrows” in royal circles. The vegan coffee Meghan invested in was advertised by Oprah Winfrey to her  million Instagram followers, with a cryptic caption including a crown emoji.A royal source said: “It’s hard to see how any of this fits in with the promises and there’s a lot up for discussion.” Charity work After months of largely operating away from the spotlight, Harry and Meghan announced the launch of their new charitable foundation Archewell.  Described as “an impact-driven non-profit” whose “core purpose is to uplt and unite communities”, it has an arm connected to their Spoty deal, Archewell Audio, understood to have netted them £million. The couple were also seen in Los Angeles last year handing out food parcels during several public outings with a privately hired photographer. Relations with the royals Harry and Meghan’s dealings with the royals they left behind have been limited to phone and video calls amid the pandemic.  The couple have kept in touch with the family and exchanged gts between William and Kate’s three children and their son Archie. Prince Charles has also worked hard to keep in touch with his son, although royal sources have suggested it was “noted” how he was not mentioned on the couple’s new Archewell website. The home page features a picture of a young Harry on the shoulders of his mother Princess Diana, alongside an image of Meghan and her mum Doria with the text: “I am my mother’s son. And I am our son’s mother.”  Harry was due toto the UK before the -month review deadline on March , but his plans have been dashed with the new coronavirus lockdown. The prince still plans toin the spring for several major events, including the unveiling of a commemorative statue at Kensington Palace of Princess Diana on July . He has worked on it with William since . Meghanaposs miscarriage bravery  In November the -year-old duchess bravely opened up about losing her second child while pregnant in July. In a heart-wrenching letter in The New York Times she described how she was changing Archie’s nappy at the family home in Los Angeles when she “dropped to the floor” in pain. She wrote: “I knew, as I clutched my first-born child, that I was losing my second.” She told how she watched “my husband’s heart break as he tried to hold the shattered pieces of mine”.  The article was widely praised for its searing honesty and ability to connect to millions of women and men around the world who have experienced baby loss. The tragedy reportedly helped bring Harry and William closer, as the Duke of Cambridge reached out to his brother following the news. Baby loss charity Tommy’s praised Meghan’s “honesty and openness”, saying that it had sent a “powerful message to anyone who loses a baby: this may feel incredibly lonely, but you are not alone”. Legal cases Meghan’s legal costs have soared to nearly £million as she sues Associated Newspapers, publisher of the Mail on Sunday and MailOnline, over a series of articles connected to a letter she wrote to her estranged father Thomas Markle. She is awaiting a decision on January  at the High Court where her lawyers will argue for a summary judgment. The ex-actress has also recently won a privacy case against a news agency that photographed her and Archie.

The couple said they had spent months considering the le-changing move, but a source said it came as a bolt from the blue for the rest of The Firm, who were reportedly furious.Princes Charles and William were reportedly given just  minutes warning of the Sussexesapos Instagram statement, and Harryaposs grandmother the Queen was said to be hurt. However, according to experts the Queen played a blinder and took back control of the scandalous situation with two perfectly constructed statements. The first, released shortly after Meghan and Harryaposs bombshell post, was short and snappy, explaining that there was a lot of work to be done. In just  words, she acknowledged the development and warned working out an agreement would be complicated. It read: Discussions with The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are at an early stage. We understand their desire to take a dferent approach, but these are complicated issues that will take time to work through. Speaking on Channel  documentary, The Queen: In Her Own Words, speech writer and former British Ambassador Charles Crawford said: When the Queen makes a statement, itaposs a statement with a capital aposSapos. Thataposs because there is something which needs to go on the record.  The tone was flawless, and above all it was very short. However it was with her second statement on the subject, which she shared after an emergency summit at Sandringham with Charles, William and Harry, that she really took back control. She explained that talks had taken place ands the logistics were being worked out. It read: Today my family had very constructive discussions on the future of my grandson and his family.  My family and I are entirely supportive of Harry and Meghan’s desire to create a new le as a young family. Although we would have preferred them to remain full-time working members of the Royal Family, we respect and understand their wish to live a more independent le as a family while remaining a valued part of my family. Harry and Meghan have made clear that they do not want to be reliant on public funds in their new lives.It has therefore been agreed that there will be a period of transition in which the Sussexes will spend time in Canada and the UK. However, experts claim it was the final line that really sent a message. It read: These are complex matters for my family to resolve, and there is some more work to be done, but I have asked for final decisions to be reached in the coming days.

It also sent a public message to the people advising Harry and Meghan - aposthis is over, letaposs get down to an agreement and move onapos. It was a nicely phrased but firm statement saying this is where things stand, just so you all know, and thataposs it.

Elaine Maltby, , regularly attended eye tests at the opticians due to a history of glaucoma in her family, a common eye disease. The gran-of-three never suffered any problems with her sight, so was left horried when staff told her something wasnapost right at an appointment in August . The gran-of-three was rushed to the Gartnaval Hospital in Glasgow for tests. Days later, Elaine, from Largs, North Ayrshire, was diagnosed with uveal melanoma, a form of eye cancer.That same month she had emergency surgery to remove her left eye and replace it with a prosthetic one, report the Daily Record. Medics said they had no choice as her tumours were too aggressive to be treated, and warned that despite the operation being a success, there was a aposhigh-riskapos of her cancer ing. In November , their worst nightmare became a reality. Elaineaposs cancer ed, but it appeared in her liver. She received immunotherapy followed by early phase trials of chemotherapy. After two rounds of failed treatment, the Maltby familyaposs last hope for the dental health worker is Chemo-saturation Therapy. The therapy saturates the liver, helping to deter further tumours from growing and prolongs le expectancy. Treatment is currently unavailable on the NHS in Scotland and can only be accessed privately in Southampton where six sessions cost £,. Without treatment, doctors have given Elaine just two years to live.  Her devastated daughter, Natalie Maltby-Lemon, said they are now in a race against time. The -year-old told the Record: Our world as we knew it has fallen apart. Mumaposs never had any health issues, she loves hill walking, her job and keeping busy. Itaposs so unfair that there is a treatment out there but unless you are extremely well off it is unavailable. Weaposre all devastated. Natalie, her husband, Clint, , and their one-year-old daughter Raemy, packed up their le in Cooktown, Australia to move back to Scotland to help Elaine, after eight years down under. Elaine is supported at home by her -year-old husband, George, who is semi-retired. She is also mum to family support worker, Jenna, , from Bishopton, Renfrewshire and Suzanne, , a primary school teacher who lives in Largs. A doting gran to Raemy as well as one-year-old Roan and Olivia, , Elaine hopes to see her daughter Suzanne get married to her fiancé in Fe this April. Scotlandaposs coronavirus lockdown has prevented the active grandmother from ticking off things on her bucket list like going on safari in Africa.The Covid- pandemic also limits the Maltbyaposs fundraising opportunities. Her daughters are hoping to secure the almost a quarter of a million pounds funding for her therapy treatment in Southampton. Since Tuesday almost £, has been raised. Natalie added: My mum says that sheaposs never felt so special in her le.

The statement comes two days after Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol in a violent attempt to thwart the democratic process which left five dead. The rioters - inflamed by Trumpaposs  claims of election fraud - smashed windows, sent lawmakers into hiding and looted federal property including a laptop which was stolen from Pelosiaposs office. Pelosiaposs call to stop Trump from ordering a strike before he leaves the White House came just before congressional Democrats began a conference call to discuss whether to impeach Trump for an unprecedented second time. The situation of this unhinged President could not be more dangerous, Pelosi said. The House of Representatives speaker said she had discussed the matter with Army General Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Milleyaposs office said that Pelosi had initiated the call and that the general answered her questions regarding the process of nuclear command authority. A US official, speaking anonymously, said that any use of nuclear weapons is a highly deliberative process. In opening the conference call, Pelosi called Trump an insurrectionist and said the members were there to discuss how we go forward, according to a source on the call.Trump praised his supporters on Twitter after yesterday promising in a video to ensure a smooth transition to President-elect Joe Bidenaposs administration.On Twitter, he said of his fans: They will not be disrespected or treated unfairly in any way, shape or form!!!  Trump also confirmed he would not attend Bidenaposs inauguration, departing from a time-honoured tradition that typically sees the outgoing president joining his successor at Capitol Hill for the ceremony. The practice is seen as an important part of the peaceful transfer of power. At least one Senate Republican, Ben Sasse of Nebraska, has said he would consider supporting an impeachment proceeding. Sasse, a frequent Trump critic, told CBS News on Friday he would definitely consider any articles of impeachment because the president disregarded his oath of office.

His uncle had asymptomatic coronavirus and passed it onto his baby nephew unaware, it has been reported. His parents Cristina and Jose rushed him to AE where doctors diagnosed him with the virus.

It is one we are delighted with as a coaching staff and I am sure the fans will also be delighted that he has signed for another couple of years.“Hopefully, we will get the benefit of his progression.“Marsh was one we have been speaking about for a while to make sure he gets tied down.#He has been outstanding for us since he came in.“Left-back is always a tricky position to fill. If you do lose a player in that position, it is notoriously dficult to get a good one in and we have a very good one.“So we are delighted that he has committed his future to the club.“I am sure there are other players who will get tied down in the coming weeks and months.”Also signing a new contract was young goalkeeper Harrison Sharp who himself signed on for a further two years.Meanwhile, Mackay is delighted to have signed a proven Championship performer in Paul McMullan.He said: “He is a player we have admired for a long time. He had a fantastic season at Dundee United last year, helping them win the Championship with the amount of assists he gets.“He adds pace and quality.“He ticks all the boxes and it is an area where we are maybe a little bit short on numbers. Declan McDaid is the only out and out wide player that we have.“In attacking areas we have some great options but we probably don’t have that out-and-out winger with real pace.“He loves attacking defenders, running at them and his deliveries are dferent class as well.”AskedDundee are keen to bring in more new faces this month, Mackay replied: “If players come available in the window who we think are going to improve us # which is important as there is no point bringing in players just to make up a squad # then we are always open to it.“That’s budget permitting as we are in the middle of a pandemic and we don#t have loads of cash to throw about butthere are players who become available that we think are going to help us then we will always be open to that.”Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/01/2.56216951-4-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/01/2.56216951-4-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/01/2.56216951-4-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/01/2.56216951-4-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"dundee player self isolating after testing positive for covid 19 as dark blues inform authorities","story":"Dundee have confirmed that a Dark Blues player is self-isolating after ing a positive Covid- test.The news comes ahead of Saturday night’s Scottish Cup clash at Dens Park against Bonnyrigg Rose – and there is no suggestion that the fixture is in doubt.Dee have notied the relevant football authorities.They said: “The club can confirm that a member of our playing squad has tested positive for Covid-.“He is currently-self isolating in line with all government guidelines.“In accordance with current Covid regulations both the SFA and SPFL have been informed.”It’s not the first time the virus has had an impact on the Dundee squad.In November, defender Lee Ashcroft and midfielder Graham Dorrans – who has since departed Dens – self-isolated after ing positive coronavirus tests.Meanwhile, Cammy Kerr and Declan McDaid missed a pre-season clash with Peterhead after a member of the latter’s family tested positive for Covid-.The duo share a house so both had to go into isolation.Paul McMullan compared to former Dundee ace and flying Hibs internationalist by James McPake after pre-contract capture from Dundee United\" title\"#Paul McMullan compared to former Dundee ace and flying Hibs internationalist by James McPake after pre-contract capture from Dundee United# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp paul-mcmullan-hibs-dundee-james-mcpake-dundee-united embed # secretuXFrzSJip\" data-secret\"uXFrzSJip\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/01/2.57440217-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/01/2.57440217-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/01/2.57440217-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/01/2.57440217-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"scottish spca reports 134 increase in people looking to give up unwanted animals","story":"The Scottish SPCA have reported a % increase in people looking to give up unwanted animals.The animal rescue charity said between September   and January  , they had received  calls to its helpline from people looking to give up their pets, more than double from the same period the year before, which saw  calls.Calls about unwanted dogs increased by % from  to  and calls from people looking to give up cats jumped from  to .Chief superintendent of the charity, Mike Flynn said: #We predicted an increase in unwanted animals last year after an explosion in demand for pets among people at home due to the pandemic.#Whilst not such a big issue for kittens, a generation of pups will have grown up in a household where the family is often around.#Once that situation changes it can be hard for a dog to adjust and this can lead to behavioural issues and separation anxiety.#These issues can lead to dogs being destructive and it is at this point many owners considering giving their pet up.“What they don’t realise is that the dog is acting this way because of its own experiences not because of any ingrained issue.#Despite the increase in calls about unwanted animals the charity has not seen an increase in abandonments.Mike added: #A rise in abandonments is something we’ve been worried about since last March.

She has travelled and trekked throughout the world but now lives in Argyll amongst the scenery she loves. www.heatheryheightsDuring wintry weather and shorter days it can be tricky fitting in longer walks and time for exploring the outdoors.What is fantastic about Knapdale and Kintyre is that we only have to go a short distance to gain truly spectacular views. The three walks in this edition y from relatively short, using tracks and paths to the lovely viewpoint of Castle Dounie, to challenging, where the terrain is tough underfoot and good route finding skills are required. All three start at Crinan harbour before climbing up through oak and birch woods to gain open vistas with views to Jura, Scarba and Mull. The convoluted ridge walks are rugged and wild, the steep sides sweeping down to the Sound of Jura where tides race and swirl. If you are lucky you may see pods of dolphins or even whales.. At the car park a signboard shows the Crinan Trail. This is the shorter of the routes but all three start and finish together. Leave the car park and turn left. Keeping to the road by the shore you will see a trail marker post ahead leading you briefly along the shore before the path heads into oak woods. After m the path bends sharply left. To the right a faint trail heads west towards the Sailor’s Grave but your route starts its steep muddy ascent to the forestry road above.. On reaching the road turn right, after m you will reach a bench and the first junction to your left. Here you have a choice either come back from the track ahead or to your left. All routes can be undertaken in either direction. I suggest for the longer routes you go straight on and for the Crinan Trail you go left.. For the Crinan Trail follow the waymark posts and arrows. After .km the route turns right onto a path and winds up and down with glimpses of views to come. Turn left at a sign for a viewpoint. This will take you up to the knoll atop which the remains of Castle Dounie, a prehistoric dun, command spectacular views over the sound towards the Gulf of Corryvreckan. There it is said the Cailleach Bheur, a giant witch, once washed her plaid in its whirlpools. Enjoy the vista before ing down to the junction and turn left. The path now meanders down to the forestry road. Turn right and head north round the coast above Adnoe Point and back to your path down to Crinan harbour.. For the longer walks, go straight ahead at the bench . Follow the track for nearly km, which leads you round a couple of hairpin bends and above Adnoe Point, before turning south. Keep your eyes open for the waymark posts and turn left onto a path. Head uphill for m. At the viewpoint sign turn right up to Castle Dounie and enjoy. To your south is the ridge that leads to Creag Mhor.. Immediately after dropping from Castle Dounie you will see a broken down wall on your right. Follow this for a short distance until you can start to work your way up onto the ridge to your right, by a couple of birch trees with coners on the skyline above. The ridge walk is convoluted, airy, rough and summits numerous lumps and bumps with fantastic views. Keep to the crest or east side as the drop-offs to the west are impressive but not to be dallied with. The highest rocky bump of Creag Mhor is parallel to the north end of the rocks offshore.. After  minutes of knobbly and exposed ridge walking #you do not fancy tackling navigation along walls in woods # this is now the time to keep an eye out for an obvious wide firebreakin the trees, below to your left. This leads you at a ° angle straight to a forestry track in the valley below. To check you have the right point look across from the firebreak and you should see a wall continue the line on the other side. Head down the firebreak to the track and turn left. This will take you back to the junction by the bench where you can turn right on the forest road then left todown the path to Crinan harbour.. If you wish to adventure on* and are confident with your route finding then continue south on the ridge # crossing over an old wall not on the map # to where it suddenly drops to a tiny col with forest directly ahead. Ahead is a steep little rise with walls on it. One drops to the right but it is the one going southwest into the forest you need to follow, for the next m. Keeping the wall directly on your right, circumnavigating the odd boulder and ducking the odd branch, you will see that the deer have created quite a path and that the way is often clear. Eventually it drops you very steeply down to a stream with another wall directly ahead. Turn left, southeast, up the stream with the wall on your right # it is boggy # until you reach a quaint waterfall on your left. A small break in the wall to your right allows you to escape the trees that have fallen across the wall higher up. Continue with it on your left across a tree harvested area and up the bump ahead. You will pop out onto a track end.. Follow this short track down to the forest road below. Turn right and almost immediately turn left onto a grassy track that crosses a stream and heads east up into the forest. After m you will come to a sharp left-hand bend. Directly in front of you a wall goes steeply up into the trees. This is your route up to Bealach na Moine. It leads up slippery, mossy rock for m, over a barbed wired fence , up a very rough and eroded track for nearly m, past a spring hidden with fallen trees, then over more pleasant grass and moss to the col. This last section makes you realise why it is worth the effort as views open up east and west. Turn right over a couple of steep little hillocks on the ridge. Suddenly ahead you will see your goal, the trig point and the summit of Cnoc Reamhar, also known as Gallachoille Hill and a Marilyn to boot. It really is a fantastic view.. Toeither descend the way you came or drop down from one of the breaks in the ridge to the north end of the small lochan on the west side of the summit, and follow the faint Landover track north to the spring. Re-join your ascent route, taking care on the way down. Turn rightat the forest road it is now an easy km back to the junction with the bench. Turn right then left after m, following the path back to Crinan harbour.*You can also drop down the firebreak and turn right on the track to join the route up to Cnoc Reamhar,continuing along the ridge does not appeal.The described routes and accompanying information are there to be used as a guide and do not replace the use of map and compass and the skills required to use them.

The sector in Scotland accounts for around  per cent of UK production and is worth about £ million annually.One fth of these exports go to the EU, amounting to more than , tonnes a year.This is clearly a disastrous Brexit outcome for Scottish farmers and like all other aspects of Brexit, foisted on Scotland against its will.A terrible negotiating failure on the part of the Tory government, and a devastating blow to an extremely valuable part of Scotland’s farming industry, I am sure it will not be the first damaging impact to be highlighted once the deal is fully analysed.Alex Orr, EdinburghSir,The report on the Piers and Harbours Asset Management Plan and Fees and Charges –  , submitted to the Argyll and Bute Council Harbour Board meeting of December ,  makes interesting reading.At a time when budgets are tight and councils have had to make hard decisions about where to cut services, it is dficult to understand why the council budget should be used to supplement the funding of dedicated ferry infrastructure for which CMAL should be responsible.The asset management plan allocates £,, for planned marine infrastructure works for the year  , of which only £, , is devoted to multi-use facilities. The remainder, £,,, is mostly allocated to single-use ferry facilities, and a huge proportion of that is to provide overnight parking for CalMac ferriesreaders will have to make up their own minds about the merits of spending £,, for an overnight berth at Fionnphort, and £, on a feasibility study for a breakwater at Lismore.CMAL pay back around half of the £,, to the council through harbour dues for the use of council-owned piers, however, that still leaves a whopping £ million gap in the required funding.If past experience of other CMAL projects is anything to go by, the planned eight per cent increase in council harbour fees and charges up to   is not going to cover it.Fergus Gillanders, KilmelfordSir,Last year, , was challenging and, although many people like to give generously to charity at Christmas time, it may have been dficult to make a donation this festive season.It#s not too late # you can still help support the Royal National Institute of Blind Peopleby collecting and donating used stamps from cards and parcels you may have received.Your stamps will be recycled and turned into vital funds that will help RNIB support children with vision impairment.

These additional consumers will need more food while Scotland’s multial land can also meet, at the same time, the growing demand for a range of goods and services that hits targets on climate change, the environment, renewable energy, bioersity, and the wider and hugely important rural economy.#To move forward urgently, let us identy all the means and mechanisms we can put in place.  Let us have credibility for farmers by investing in bioeconomy, bioenergy, agro-forestry, precision farming, and shorter food chains – support for which is within the Government’s gt.#NFUS has been promoting our industry as one that can change to meet public goods for public money requirements, with an upbeat forward-looking mindset. This outlook will empower our farmers and crofters and drive us forward to the holy grail of sustainable profit with all the environmental, welfare and standards the public expect as thefor their investment and support for our industry.#In , the black cloud of COVID- needs swept away, a process driven by the vaccines that our scientists have developed, and lessons learned on the things we should do better but also how we have adapted and adopted new methods for good.#People should be more accepting of others’ views with ambition to work collaboratively for mutual benefit. There is a belief binary tribalism is ‘the norm’ and the use of social media to promulgate the “yer either for us or agin us” culture is acceptable. It is not hard being considerate and kind.#Agriculture also urgently needs delivery of an ambitious coherent policy delivering a sustainable profitable industry that addresses climate change, bioersity and an increasing demand for nutritious high standard and welfare food. Procrastination has a price.#Brexit will go by, like foot and mouth, the oil crisis, and the great depression, but we need enough freedom and flexibility to be able to innovate and chose our own paths through it as well.#We need to throw open our doors to the public and build trust on what we do and how we do it. There is huge potential from selling our story both on farm and in the food chain. We also need to encourage more ersity in our industry across the piece it can and will add value both financially and culturally.#To quote Shihab Kazi: #The moment you need to get started is called #now#.##I wish everyone health wealth and happiness for the coming year.#"},{"url":null,"title":"golf club responds to covid restrictions","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Among the deserving recipients are leading lights who have battled to save lives and keep the NHS afloat and those who have kept the country smiling by spreading kindness.The list includes medical experts as well as volunteers working with youngsters, the elderly and those with disabilities. Those working in libraries, education and community arts also received recognition. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “In a year when so many have made sacrices to protect our NHS and save people’s lives, the outstanding eff orts of those receiving honours are a welcome reminder of the strength of human spirit and of what can be achieved through courage and compassion. “The  New Year Honours offer us an opportunity to salute their dedication and recognise many who have gone above and beyond in their contribution to our country. “As we begin a new year and continue to come together to fight this virus, may their service and stories be an inspiration to us all.”"},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week january 8 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

And it includes nursery schools, as well as primary and secondary schools.Ms Sturgeon said: \"I want to be clear that it remains our priority to get school buildings open again for all pupils as quickly as possible and then keep them open.\"However, right now, two factors mean that it is not consistent with a safety-first approach for all children to attend school in person.\"First, the overall level of community transmission is too high. We need to get transmission down before schools can safely reopen.

Thorne Security says it could have a system in operation for £,, less than half the amount the  previously thought it would cost.The system would include four cameras to cover Main Street, Longrow, Burnside Square and the area around Hall Street and the cross.Four special television screens at Campbeltown Police Station would allow the police to watch the pictures from the cameras. The images would be recorded on an industrial-quality video recorder at the station. The pictures could alert the police to trouble or help them trace offenders.The team from Thorne Security will be visiting Campbeltown at the end of January to demonstrate the equipment.The secretary of the , Sergeant Douglas Reid of Campbeltown police, has already contacted the Scottish Office for more details about the funding package. Sergeant Reid said: ‘The  is fully committed, following the tremendous public response, to go in as far as possible along this road.’The  is already planning to apply to other local and national bodies for contributions towards the cost of the system.The Scottish Office’s challenge competition will make funds available for groups representing local communities to bid for money to fund CCTV systems.Applicants from dferent areas will bid in competition with each other for a share of the government cash.The first town centre security camera system in Scotland was set up in Airdrie three years ago. New research shows that in the first two years after the system was set up, the crime rate plunged by  per cent.The Scottish Office says there is no evidence that crime was simply being shted to areas outwith the reach of the cameras. Instead the total amount of recorded crime actually fell.FIFTY YEARS AGOMcCartney again!Mr Paul McCartney, ex-bass guitarist with the Beatles, has recently purchased from Mr A Revie, Loch Ranachan Farm, which comprises  acres and adjoins his other farm, High Park.Mr McCartney has been spending a few days on the farm with his we and family over the festive season.One happy Rangers fanMr Crawford Morans of  Albyn Avenue, who is employed with the Ministry of Social Security, has had a good ending to the old year.

In the Clyde, however, the Board of Trade did not insist on this in respect of vessels trading exclusively within what is known as the smooth water area.This area was within an imaginary line drawn from Skipness Point to Fairlie. On the date in question, the accused conveyed a cargo from Glasgow to Tobermory via the Crinan Canal.As soon as he had left Crinan, he was in contravention of the regulations, having entered the more hazardous waters off the west coast.On behalf of the accused, an agent stated that he had traded with the Bloodhound for nearly  years. During the war, the ship had been requisitioned by the Ministry of Shipping, and under the orders of that department had been sent outside the limits of the smooth water area.The accused had naturally thought that what he had been doing during the war, when he traded to ports on Islay and the Ayrshire coast, he was free to do now.Sherf Macmaster Campbell imposed a penalty of £."},{"url":null,"title":"leader january 1 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Many people will have been blessed by her words over the years. Our thanks go to her at this time.We are all pleased to see the end of . A year that saw so many things we took for granted taken from us – our normal family events, our employment and our interaction with our friends.In true Kintyre style, we found ways of minimising the effects of these disruptions by using technology, supporting the vulnerable and keeping in touch by telephone. But it was a scary time for all of us.When this #Thought for the Week# was in the planning stage, we imagined that in our corner of Scotland, in Kintyre, we would be well rid of strict lockdowns, have a low position on the tier system and le would be getting back to some sort of normality. We are not there yet.When parents are bringing up children, they teach them by repetition – clean your teeth tidy your bedroom I love you, you are special.God, as our Father, does exactly the same. In the Bible, more than  times He says: #Do not be afraid# or phrases that mean this. Let us take this truth into the New Year with us.Let us all pray that soon we can say we are not afraid and what a dferent year  is.#Away, then all fears.

Here we spotlight some of the deserving stars that Prime Minister Boris Johnson applauds as “an inspiration to us all”.Last year brought to the fore a new breed of community champions# including those working in the NHS to treat coronavirus patients, scientists developing effective vaccines and key workers keeping essential services operating.These “ordinary people” who continue to go above and beyond have been recognised for sterling work delivered in extraordinary circumstances.The  New Years Honours has recognised champions of sport as well as stars of stage and screen but this year, more than ever, it is ordinary people who have been recognised alongside them. Among the deserving recipients are leading lights who have battled to save lives and keep the NHS afloat and those who have kept the country smiling by spreading kindness.The list includes medical experts as well as volunteers working with youngsters, the elderly and those with disabilities. Those working in libraries, education and community arts also received recognition. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “In a year when so many have made sacrices to protect our NHS and save people’s lives, the outstanding eff orts of those receiving honours are a welcome reminder of the strength of human spirit and of what can be achieved through courage and compassion. “The  New Year Honours offer us an opportunity to salute their dedication and recognise many who have gone above and beyond in their contribution to our country. “As we begin a new year and continue to come together to fight this virus, may their service and stories be an inspiration to us all.”Jacquie Winning’s award “recognises the achievements of everyone” at Forth Valley Sensory Centre following “an exceptionally challenging year”.The  year-old from Falkirk was recognised for going the extra mile to manage “wraparound” services to people with sensory loss during the pandemic “COVID- has been challenging for everyone, but more so for people with sensory loss. Those with hearing loss face challenges due to face masks and social distancing interfering with their ability to lip read.“Those with sight loss face signicant challenges managing to maintain physical distancing while undertaking essential trips out,” explained the MBE recipient.Jacquie’s support included providing Braille copies of virus information, establishing telephone, text and email befriending lelines to address isolation and producing podcasts providing vital updates.“The impact is that some of the most vulnerable people in society have been incredibly well supported during the most challenging of times. Thanks go to the dedication, enthusiasm and willingness to adapt by our team, volunteers and partners, and tremendous support of our board of directors.”Cabinet Office confirmation of Dr Tamas Szakmany’s award made him “astonished, touched and humbled”. The  year-old from Newport explained: “I thought I was doing my job like everybody . I didn’t think for one minute it would result in this. I’m really surprised. Once I was allowed to talk about it, the first thing I said was how fortunate I was to work with this team. “ was dficult professionally. Personally, I had many successes. It was a double-edged sword. The MBE is recognition for the enormous effort everyone has made to get us through the first wave. I hope we have similar success again.”The Royal Gwent Hospital critical care consultant, recognised for exceptional service to the NHS, spearheaded Welsh Critical Care Network response during the pandemic, rapidly disseminating information on lessons learnt via traditional and social media s. Filming his personal and professional le, he helped produce an emotional deeply personal documentary “Critical: Inside Intensive Care Coronavirus” episode, broadcasted by BBC Wales and included among American Society of Chest Physicians and Society of Critical Care Medicine teaching materials.A Belfast community worker is celebrating “the surprise of his le” after being honoured. Michael Briggs’ MBE was rewarded for services beyond the call of duty in the voluntary sector and community.“Even though we’ve hardly moved out of the office, it’s all been pretty busy,” explained the EastBelfast Community Development Agency Executive Director.“We’ve been managing our COVID programme, buying bulk food to get out to groups we support. We developed a network of groups delivering small packages to people who are vulnerable, shielding or in financial need.” The  year-old continued: “There are so many stories from older people who say ‘it’s just good to know people are thinking about us.”Thinking the honour email was promotional, Michael initially “didn’t actually take it seriously”.He revealed: “I nearly didn’t open it.

More than £ million of this we have been grateful to receive at Sightsavers.Money raised by players has been indispensable in helping Sightsavers to fund, in  alone, eye services for more than , people and more than  sight-saving cataract surgeries.In , funding also helped us to support the Covid- response. Children with disabilities kept learning throughout the pandemic, thanks to distance learning equipment and teacher training, PPE and hygiene kits.Children like Marie in Sierra Leone, who is blind and was in danger of being left behind when schools closed, until she was given a typewriter, a radio and assistance so that she could keep studying.So, once again, a big thank you to all the players in Scotland for your generosity.To find out about some of the lives being turned around by players# support, please head on over to www.sightsavers.org ppl or give Sightsavers a call on   .Dr Caroline Harper CBE, Sightsavers CEO.Scots have taken to online technology like never before to keep in touch during this dficult time.When we first went into lockdown, there were concerns on whether our networks would cope with this big increase in online traffic. But, although customers’ usage of data more than doubled during the period, our networks were able to stand up to the demands.I’m immensely proud of the role my colleagues have played in keeping the country connected during this crisis. From the engineers who keep our broadband and mobile networks connected, to the vital contact centre staff in Glasgow, Dundee, Greenock, Edinburgh and Thurso, helping people when they need it most.I’m proud also of the role our people played in supporting the NHS in Scotland during the crisis, including working with Scottish Government to quickly provide communications to the temporary hospitals.The pandemic has shown the vital role digital technology and internet connectivity now plays in all our lives. If all homes and businesses are going to stay ahead, we know that fast and reliable broadband and good mobile coverage is going to be essential for the post-Covid recovery.While BT Group continues to invest billions in these networks, we know that we can’t do this alone. We’ll continue to work with governments and local authorities to make sure that no areas are left behind.Jane Wood, BT Group Scotland director.The  Covid crisis has prompted a greater sense of social cohesion and solidarity but it also exposed and exacerbated some of the barriers that blind and partially sighted people still face.Access to online shopping slots, a lack of essential health information in formats such as audio and braille, and confusion over whether social distancing allowed for blind and partially sighted people to still be guided added to the distress many felt.The first lockdown came out of the blue when we had little real-le experience of managing a national emergency, but it is now more essential than ever that we learn the lessons and ensure no one falls through the safety-net. Another period of enforced confinement during the winter months could hit some particularly hard.During the first lockdown, RNIB Scotland and other charities worked extremely hard to ensure the needs of the most vulnerable were met # at a time when even the most able in society were thrown by the suddenness and uncertainty the crisis had created.We negotiated set online shopping slots for people with sight loss, worked with public bodies to ensure the often vital information they put out was available in formats accessible to everyone, and claried the rules on guiding people with a visual impairment.These gains must be reinforced  we are ing to another nationwide lockdown.Currently, around , people are living in Scotland with signicant sight loss. Although most are over the age of , around , children and young people also have a visual impairment.The RNIB Helpline remains available on    and information continues to be broadcast on RNIB#s Connect Radio station. The RNIB Talking Book library posts and downloads thousands of titles in audio and other formats.Find out more at www.rnib.org.uk scotlandJames Adams, director, RNIB Scotland.As always in such matters, the UK-EU Brexit deal will iniably throw up more than a few surprises aside from the usual headlines heralding a British #victory# in negotiations.The fact that, for example, seed potatoes are not to be included in the deal will be deeply damaging to our rural economy. Scottish seed potato farmers are one of the biggest exporters of potatoes, used in the production of chips and crisps, in the world.The sector in Scotland accounts for around  per cent of UK production and is worth about £ million annually.One fth of these exports go to the EU, amounting to more than , tonnes a year.This is clearly a disastrous Brexit outcome for Scottish farmers and like all other aspects of Brexit, foisted on Scotland against its will.A terrible negotiating failure on the part of the Tory government, and a devastating blow to an extremely valuable part of Scotland’s farming industry, I am sure it will not be the first damaging impact to be highlighted once the deal is fully analysed.Alex Orr, Edinburgh."},{"url":null,"title":"meet kintyres heroic davids","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Following enforced shut-down in March , CPH was able to re-open from September to December, one of very few cinemas in the UK to do so.At CGS, Mr Fyfe had to consider the iety of needs of the school#s children and their parents, his own needs and those of his family as he supported the entire network of staff, which includes several more Davids # music teacher David Cosgrove and maths teachers David Hamilton and David MacDonald.The heroic work of all the school#s staff through lockdown ranges from supervising vulnerable and key workers# children in the HUB and the challenges of online learning, to packing and distributing food parcels and delivering hot lunches in the community.As leboat coxswain, Mr Cox leads a crew which includes several heroic Davids # David Mullen, David Ward, David Campbell, David Colville and David Reid.Despite still having to attend all call-outs, in full kit and PPE, the team#s training came to a halt soon into the first lockdown, but they were eventually able toto training on a two-week rotation, one week on land, the other offshore.Having to physically distance proved incredibly hard for the crew, with multiple people required to safely carry out some tasks.Even small rescues using the Y-Boat # the vessel on top of the Severn-class leboat, not to be confused with the inshore rescue boat which is towed on a trailer # presented challenges given the amount of space on the boat.Masks were, and continue to be, worn inside the wheelhouse at all times and when working closely together outside on the deck.These Davids # and, of course, so many other people in the community # helped navigate the community through unprecedented and challenging circumstances in many dferent ways.If you know of a heroic David who deserves a shout-out, please let us know by emailing editor@campbeltowncourier or telephoning  .CAPTIONS:David Cox.

There was heavy traffic and, needless to say, Irsquod never driven a bus before and hadnrsquot expected to at this moment either.ldquoYou mean drive the bus  I foolishly asked.ldquoThatrsquos why you are here, isnrsquot it  he replied.I was on the bus with two other learners, as well as the instructor. We had been given some rudimentary instructions by him as hersquod driven the bus into the busy city centre, but I hadnrsquot realised we would actually have to drive the bus through busy streets.That was the first time I had driven a bus. It was, of course, an assessment of my capabilities. I negotiated as best I could and quickly learned what a tail swing was, as I nearly shaved off the nose of a woman who was standing on the edge of a pavement waiting to cross the road!The gearstick felt like it had been cemented to the vehicle, making changing gears a Herculean effort, with the engine roaring as I struggled to crunch it into gear. I drove slowly and cars began honking their horns in frustration.There was a big L on the rear of the bus, but I think when people see a bus in the city centre they assume the person driving actually knows how to drive a bus!It was a stressful  minutes and, when I finally pulled over, the instructor looked at his notes shaking his head. I cannot repeat what he said, but it was a generally negative assessment with lots of adjectives.Yet I wasnrsquot written off and was told I needed six full days of lessons as a minimum before sitting my test. Against everyonersquos expectations, including mine, I passed first time.I had done it and realised one of my lersquos dreams.There was a specic reason I needed a bus driving licence: I wanted to be a driver guide and take people around Scotland on tour. My le had undergone some dramatic changes and my le ambitions had changed as a result.It wasnrsquot, of course, about money or climbing a career ladder, but about the hopeful expectation it would make me rich in experiences and give me a new angle on le.My head and heart were full of Scotlandrsquos stories, and this seemed a perfect way to use my love of history and folklore, and share my passion for the landscape that held so many personal memories for me. I felt my le was about to be transformed and indeed it was.So that day I passed my bus driving test was a day of utter joy. Although over  years ago now, I can still feel the elation.I worked for dferent tour companies at dferent times in my le over the following  years. It was something I couldto whenever I needed it. During the last period of my time as a driver guide, a transport manager called Ronnie worked miracles as he juggled my rota to fit round my very complicated childcare arrangements. I will be forever grateful to him for his understanding.Were my expectations of the job realised or did I have an over-romanticised image of it  Irsquod say a bit of both. I tried my best to showcase Scotland, but I quickly understood people travel for dferent reasons with dferent interests.But it opened a window on the world for me. I met so many people from dferent walks of le and dferent countries and cultures. It taught me so much about the way humans behave towards each other and how we handle and respond to experiences in dfering ways.We were all on mini le journeys together, usually three days, sometimes five. In this brief fleck of time, a small group of people would be together amidst the splendour, and sometimes challenging conditions, of Scotland. When connections were made, it was because of shared values, regardless of cultural dferences.I began to see the tours as a metaphor for the way we live our lives, not just in observing others but myself as well. I had never thought the job would be a lesson on the philosophy of le, but that is partly what it became for me.It revealed to me that happiness, enjoyment and appreciation is a default within us, not something to be found, bought or acquired, or even weather dependent!That now seems so obvious but it took years for me to truly understand how we can become so easily trapped in the hedonic treadmill. I know thatrsquos a fancy term, but its meaning is simple: that as we go through le, we quickly take things for granted and so seek new and higher levels of satisfaction which we believe will give us happiness. While we can get a rush of pleasure and satisfaction in new things or experiences, we soon then take those for granted as well. So the cycle continues. We become like dogs chasing our tails in pursuit of what we think will make us happy or give us a more fulfilled le.The tours taught me that appreciation is the key to this. You donrsquot have to be a tour guide to learn this lesson, of course, as we all have our lersquos experiences that teach us. But that treadmill is so easy to fall into, even when you know it offers a  dawn. It can take a conscious effort to climb out of it.That is when we need what is called a hedonic reset: another fancy term for stopping that chase of our tail and taking time to appreciate what we have. This can be done by temporarily depriving ourselves of things we take for granted and so regaining our appreciation of them.A simple example could be when we go camping. I love it, but when I get home I appreciate my bed, my shower and central heating in ways I didnrsquot before we left on our camping trip!The virus has forced a reset on all of us it has taken away many things we took for granted: travel, staying with friends, family meals, a coffee and blether with a friend, hugging loved ones, being with loved ones, browsing in a bookshop. We will all have our list.It has been heartbreaking, with devastating consequences for so many peoplersquos livelihoods and emotional wellbeing, as well as a tragic loss of le.Itrsquos an unwanted, brutal and forced reset, but the le lesson I learnt on the tours has helped me understand that appreciation is the key to resilience and getting through this as best as we can.When times relax, as they hopefully will soon, I know how much I will appreciate hugging my daughter I havenrsquot been able to hug for  months, being able to tell stories to a live audience and have a coffee with a friend in a real cafe. And travel to the places I love within my own country.Perhapsthere is any positive out of this, I hope it will be that I will never again fall into that treadmill of taking things I have for granted.So I say Happy New Year to you, and I mean it in a heartfelt way I never meant before."},{"url":null,"title":"vet-column-consider-welcoming-new-pet","story":"ONCE your new puppy or kitten has settled into your household, there are several things to consider, ensuring your new pet is kept fit and healthy.Register with your veterinary surgeon. This gives immediate reassurancea problem does arise with your pet.At Dunedin Vets, we offer free puppy and kitten checks and for all new pets as soon as you acquire them this may be carried out by telephone during these Covid- times. Lots of advice is given by vets, qualied veterinary nurses and reception staff.Everyone is thinking about vaccination against coronavirus for humans just now. Vaccination has been the major controller of lethal diseases since the process was developed by Edward Jenner centuries ago.We must vaccinate our pets to prevent several fatal conditions. Pups can be vaccinated from six weeks of age. However, vaccinating at  and  weeks of age is the new normal during this Covid- pandemic, when most vaccinations are given.Pups should be kept isolated until two weeks after the first vaccination, then limited contact with other dogs until after the second vaccine. Boosters are given annually against parvovirus, distemper, hepatitis leptospirosis and kennel cough.It is advisable to vaccinate your kitten against cat flu, feline enteritis and feline leukaemia. Two vaccines are usually given three weeks apart from nine weeks of age. Kittens should be kept isolated until one week after the second vaccine. Boosters are given annually against cat flu, feline enteritis and feline leukaemia.Rabbits can be vaccinated against myxomatosis and rabbit haemorrhagic disease , of which there are two strains. One vaccine against the two agents can be given from six weeks of age. Boosters are given annually.Everyone loves a new puppy or kitten, but please be aware of unscrupulous dealers who take advantage of the kind and loving nature of the majority of people.Recently, Kimberly Mackie visited Dunedin Vetsrsquo Tranent surgery with her new puppy Poppy. Poppy is a Jack Russell cross Chihuahua, so is a very small pup. However, Poppy arrived with diarrhoea and very dehydrated, weighing only a few hundred grams.Poppy was examined by vet Chris Monk, who immediately saw how ill little Poppy was.Mum had bought her in all good faith from a family home. It was soon discovered that Poppy had been microchipped and had a vaccination in Eire. Poppy was an import from Eire, a victim of the illegal puppy farming trade.It is so dficult for new owners to know the origin of their pup, especially when the sellers can seem so plausible. Ask to see the parents or at least the mother and other pups in the litter, although they find many ways to circumvent these questions. It is also so dficult toa puppy or kitten once you have cuddled them and instantly fallen in love.The good news is that Poppy, after fluid therapy and medications, and lots of loving care from Dunedin Vets staff and, of course, his forever mum, has made a full recovery and is developing her own special character.We must also consider other preventable conditions which our pets may be susceptible to.Most puppies and kittens are born with a roundworm infestation. Worms are passed to them before birth by their mothers and through motherrsquos milk. This is obviously not very pleasant and potentially these worms pose a risk for humans, especially children.Tapeworms are rarely a problem in puppies and kittens, although one type is actually transmitted by fleas.We recommend worming puppies and kittens at eight,  and  weeks of age with a quality wormer in tablet or liquid form, which will kill most worms.Remember, there may be no obvious signs of worm infestation.Worming should be carried out every three months for the rest of your petrsquos le.Many puppies and kittens arrive at their new home with a population of external parasites. These include fleas and mites.Fleas are passed from one animal to another. Although there are dferent types of dog and cat fleas, they donrsquot mind what they jump onto to feed!Fleas are two to three millimetres long and move quickly through the coat. Flea droppings are black and gritty, and turn reddamp cotton wool is applied to them.Fleas can transmit several diseases, cause allergies and general irritation. Fleas live on your pet, and in the house.You must use a suitable insecticide spray to destroy flea larvae, which can survive for months in the environment. Your veterinary staff can advise what is best for your pet and your home.The rabbit flea is unusual in that it doesnrsquot move very fast. They are often found along the edge of catsrsquo ears and are dficult to remove, so are called lsquostick tightrsquo fleas. Cats pick them up when hunting wild rabbits.Walking dandruff mitesare very common in puppies, kittens and bunnies. They are too small to see but occasionally skin scurf appears to move, which is actually the mites, hence the name.Mange mitesare minute parasites which bury into the skin. Some are passed from mother to young and some spread from pet to pet. Some cause intense scratching, some cause hair loss. Some can be very dficult to treat, requiring specialised anti-parasitic washes or spot on treatment.Ear mites live in the ear canals, causing irritation, lots of wax production and a smell.At Dunedin Vets, we strongly recommend taking out insurance for your pet at a young age. Many breeders will provide initial insurance cover, and many vets will offer free insurance with certain companies for a few weeks. This gives peace of mind whilst you are considering which insurance to purchase. We suggest you look for a lsquolelong coverrsquo policy so your pet will always be covered.Consider a pet health club for your new arrival. Many veterinary practices, including Dunedin Vets, offer this type of scheme. Basically, you spread the cost of your petrsquos preventative healthcare over the year rather than being faced with large bills at booster time, so allowing you to budget monthly for this.Dunedin Vetsrsquo pet health club offers many other benefits and discounts. During these dficult times, many people are finding this a great way to ensure the best care for their pets without burdening themselves financially.Puppies, kittens and bunnies bring so much love to a family and help so much in your wellbeing ndash choose wisely, and look after them well, and you will have a friend and companion for le."},{"url":null,"title":"dunbar-rnli-crewmans-children-write-touching-thank-message","story":"Jamie Forrester, who has been a volunteer at Dunbarrsquos leboat station for  years, and his children Erin and Lochlan were chosen by the RNLI to send out thank you cards to people who had donated to the charity.In the card, nine-year-old Erin and Lochlan, five, wrote: ldquoThank you for helping to keep our daddy safe.ldquoEvery year we have a lot of thank you cards to write.ldquoWe send a thank you to Santa and to our parents and to our family and friends who give us presents.ldquoWe feel very lucky.ldquoBut the first card we wanted to write this year is to you, because you sent a present that helps keep leboat crew members safe.ldquoOur daddy is one of them hellip We are so proud of our daddy and we love him very much.

I will set out our decisions shortly.However, I can confirm now, in summary, that we decided to introduce from midnight tonight for the duration of January, a legal requirement to stay at home except for essential purposes. This is similar to the lockdown of March last year.However, before I set out Cabinetrsquos decisions in more detail, I want to explain in some detail why they are so necessary.In the last few weeks, there have been two signicant game changers in our fight against this virus.One, the approval of vaccines, is hugely positive and offers us the way out of this pandemic.But the other - the new faster spreading iant of the virus - is a massive blow.Possibly the most simple way of explaining the challenge we face right now is to compare it to a race.In one lane we have vaccines - our job is to make sure they can run as fast as possible.Thatrsquos why the government will be doing everything we can to vaccinate people as quickly as possible. I will say more about that later.But in the other lane is the virus which - as a result of this new iant - has just learned to run much faster and has most definitely picked up pace in the last couple of weeks.To ensure that the vaccine wins the race, it is essential to speed up vaccination as far as possible.But to give it the time it needs to get ahead, we must also slow the virus down.And because it is now spreading faster, that means even tougher restrictions are necessary.The evidence is now compelling that the new iant is up to % more transmissible than previously circulating strains, and that it may add as much as . to the R number.And according to recent analysis of PCR test samples, it appears that the new iant already accounts for almost half of all new cases in Scotland.That increased and faster spread is undoubtedly driving the very serious situation we now face.Todayrsquos case numbers ndash , new cases, with % of tests being positive - illustrate the severity and urgency of the situation.No new deaths were reported today ndash because yesterday was a Sunday and registration offices were largely closed ndash but since I updated Parliament before Christmas,  deaths have been recorded in the daily figures. That again reminds us of the continuing grief this pandemic is causing.But this is not just about one dayrsquos numbers.We are now seeing a steeply rising trend of infections.Indeed, it is no exaggeration to say that I am more concerned about the situation we face now than I have been at any time since March last year.In the week from  to  December, the seven day incidence of cases per , of the population increased by % - from  per , to  per ,.Test positivity has risen sharply too.The next update on the numbers of Covid patients in hospital and intensive care will be published tomorrow.I would expect these to show that, nationally, the total number of Covid patients in hospital is close to its April peak. And in some boards, the pressure is already very real.For example, in terms of hospital beds, NHS Ayrshire and Arran is currently at % of its Covid capacity, and three other health boards - Borders, Greater Glasgow  Clyde and Lanarkshire - are above % of their capacity.The number of people in intensive care is still signicantly lower than the April peak ndash which partly reflects the fact that treatment of Covid has improved signicantly since last spring.But even so, the total number of patients in intensive care in Scotland is already above normal winter levels. Indeed, all mainland health boards have now exceeded their normal intensive care unit capacity.And it is important to be clear that people who are in hospital and ICU now are likely to have been infected  days to  weeks ago.That means that these numbers reflect what the level of new cases was around  weeks ago.Given that the number of cases has increased signicantly since then, we can expect to see signicantly increased pressure on the NHS over the course of this month.Contingency plans remain in place to double and then treble ICU capacitynecessary.And the NHS Louisa Jordan continues to be available to help meet demand - as indeed it has been doing in recent months. , patients have attended there for scans and outpatient appointments nearly , NHS staff and students have been trained there and it is currently being used for Covid vaccinations.In short, NHS services are coping at present ndash although the pressure on frontline staff is considerable - but already in some areas the position is fragile, and getting more challenging.Andthe rate of increase in case numbers that we have seen in past two weeks was to continue unchecked, there would be a real risk of our NHS being overwhelmed - even with contingency plans in place.In fact, our modelling suggests that without further intervention, we could breach inpatient Covid capacity within  or  weeks.And, of course, a sharply increasing number of cases, in human terms, means many more people becoming ill and dying.All of that explains why we have to act quickly and decisively.The situation in some other parts of the UK - where case numbers are already much higher than here, and where the contribution of the new iant is already greater - shows what may lie aheadwe donrsquot.As things stand, we estimate that we are possibly about four weeks behind the position in London and the south east.The rapid acceleration in London began when it was at about  new cases a week, for every hundred thousand people. Thatrsquos the level Scotland was at a week ago.London is now seeing  new cases a week per ,. Test positivity is around %. And pressure on NHS services is acute.We have an opportunity in Scotland to avert the situation here deteriorating to that extent.But we must act quickly.The advice of our clinical advisers is clear that the increased transmissibility of the new iant means that the current level  measures may not be sufficient to bring the R number back below .It is essential that we further limit interaction between dferent households to stem the spread and bring the situation back under control, while we vaccinate more people.In short, we mustfor a period to a situation much closer to the lockdown of last March.Let me therefore set out in more detail the decisions Cabinet has reached.It is important to stress that these are not decisions taken lightly. I am acutely aware of the impact they will have and I know they will not be welcome.But they are in our judgment essential.As government, our clear and overriding duty right now is to act quickly to save lives and protect the NHS.We know that delay or preication in the face of this virus almost always makes things worse not better - evenit stems from an understandable desire that we all share to wait for more data or evidence.To turn to the decisions in detail. The decisions I will speak about a bit later on schools, let me be clear at this stage, they will apply to all parts of Scotland. However other decisions that I will outline will apply to those parts of Scotland currently at level , which of course is all of mainland Scotland, and they are effectively an enhancement to level .The island areas currently in level  will remain there for now, although we will continue to monitor them very carefully.These additional level  restrictions - essentially ing us to a position similar to the lockdown of last March - will be in place for the whole of January. We will keep them closely under review.However, I cannot at this stage rule out keeping them in place longer, nor making further changes. Nothing about this is easy.The first measure is that our fundamental advice, for everyone, is to stay at home.That is the single best way of staying safe.We consider that this stay at home message and advice is now so important that, from tomorrow, it will become law, just as it was in the lockdown last year.This means it will only be permissible to leave home for an essential purpose.This will include, for example, caring responsibilities, essential shopping, exercise and being part of an extended household.In addition, anyone who is able to work from home, must do so. It will only be a reasonable excuse to leave your home to go to work,that work cannot be done from home.We are asking people and businesses to take this really seriously ndash as we all did in March, during the first lockdown, - because the situation is at least as serious now as it was then.The law already requires many businesses in certain sectors to close in Level . We now need every business to look again at their operations, and to make sure that every singlethat can be done by people working at home, is being done in that way.Businesses have already shown a tremendous capacity to adapt during this pandemic and Irsquom very grateful to them for that - and we need them to consider their operations again, as we all work together to reduce transmissions.The Economy Secretary will be speaking to business organisations about this, including this afternoon. We will also engage with unions on these issues. And we will continue to considermore regulatory action is required.We are also providing new guidance for people who are in the shielding category.If you were shielding and you cannot work from home, our clear advice now is that you should not go into work at all.The Chief Medical Officer is writing to everyone who falls into this category, and his letter will count as a Fit Note for those who need it.Unlike the lockdown last year, the frequency of outdoor exercise is not being limited.It is important for physical and mental health that we can get outdoors for fresh air and exercise as much as possible.However, from tomorrow, the rule on outdoor gatherings will change.As of now, up to six people from two households are able to meet outdoors. Given the greater transmissibility of this new iant, we consider it necessary to restrict that further.From tomorrow, a maximum of two people from up to two households will be able to meet outdoors.Children aged  and under will not be counted in that limit, and they will also be able to play outdoors in larger groups, including in organized gatherings.However, for everyone  ndash including  to  year olds - outdoor exercise should only take place in a way which is consistent with the  people from  households rule.In addition, strict travel restrictions remain in place across Scotland. From tomorrow,you live in a level  area - as the majority of us do - you cannot leave your home except for an essential purpose. When you do go out, stay as close to home as possible and stay away from crowded places.And it remains the case ndash and let me stress this point - that no-one is allowed to travel into or out of Scotland unless it is for an essential purpose.Presiding OfficerA number of other measures will come into effect on Friday of this week.It is with real regret that we consider it necessary for places of worship to close during this period for all purposes except broadcasting a service, or conducting a funeral, wedding or civil partnership.I am well aware of how important communal worship is to people.But we believe that this restriction is necessary to reduce the risk of transmission.While up to  people will still be able to attend funeral services, wakes will not be possible during January. And a maximum of  people will be able to attend wedding and civil partnership services.Presiding OfficerI know how devastating restrictions like these are and I give an assurance that we will not keep them in place for longer than is absolutely necessary.There will also be additional measures in relation to businesses, in addition to the tightening of the essential retail definition that took effect from Boxing Day.The current  metre exemption for workplace canteens will end ndash so canteens will have to ensure that employees sit  metres or more apart, rather than  metre.The number of non-essential services which remain open will be further restricted.Premises which will need to close as a result of these changes will include, for example ski centres, showrooms of larger retailers, and clinics offering cosmetic and aesthetic procedures.I know that many businesses have already been hit by the restrictions which were put in place on Boxing Day.And of course I know that the vast majority of businesses have taken their responsibilities seriously, and have invested in Covid safety measures.In addition, the move to home working has brought challenges for workers and employers. I am hugely grateful for the way in which businesses and their staff have responded to those challenges.Grants are of course available for businesses required to close as a result of restrictions. That support is in addition to support through the UK wide furlough scheme.The Scottish Governmentrsquos financial support for businesses during the pandemic currently totals more than pound. billion.However, we will continue to assess what more the Scottish government can do ndash either in closure grants or other forms of support - to help businesses and those who work for them.We will also work with councils to ensure community and social support for those who need it, including for parents balancing work and online learning.We will confirm additional resources later this week.Presiding Officer,The final substantive issue I want to address - before giving an update on vaccination - relates to schools.We announced before Christmas that most school pupils would learn remotely ndash rather than in school ndash until Monday  January.I can confirm that we have now decided to extend that date and keep schools closed to the majority of pupils until  February. We will review this again in mid-January.The change will apply to all pupils - except vulnerable children, and children of key workers. And it includes nursery schools, as well as primary and secondary schools.There is no doubt that of all the dficult decisions we have had to take today, this was the most dficult of all and its impact is of course the most severe.The evidence to date makes clear that thanks to the hard work of school staff and pupils, schools in Scotland have been low-risk environments for Covid. We will work with our partners to ensure that remains the case.That will include ongoing work on testing in schools and discussions about when, in the context of the overall programme, it will be possible to vaccinate school staff.And I want to be clear that it remains our priority to get school buildings open again for all pupils as quickly as possible and then keep them open.However, right now, two factors mean that it is not consistent with a safety-first approach for all children to attend school in person.First, the overall level of community transmission is simply too high. We need to get transmission down before schools can safely reopen. A period of online learning will also, in turn, help us do that.The second reason is that there is still signicant uncertainty about the impact of the new iant on transmission amongst young people.We therefore have to adopt a cautious approach at this stage.So most pupils will be learning online for at least the rest of the month.We will review on  January whether they can - as we hope -to school on the  February.I know that remote learning presents signicant challenges for teachers, schools, parents and young people, and we will work to support children and parents throughout this.The Scottish Government, Education Scotland and local authorities are working together to further improve the remote learning options which are available for schools.And it is also worth highlighting that since schools ed after the summer, more than , devices ndash such as laptops ndash have been distributed to children and young people to help with remote learning. More devices are being distributed by councils on a weekly basis, and in total we expect our investment ndashwhich builds on existing local authority action - to benefit around , disadvantaged children and young people across Scotland.I also want to stress one final point.Just as the last places we ever want to close are schools and nurseries - so it is the case that schools and nurseries will be the first places we want to reopen as we re-emerge from this latest lockdown.They remain our priority.That is why we are considering whether and to what extent - consistent with our overall duty to vaccinate the most vulnerable first in line with JCVI recommendations - we can achieve vaccination of school and childcare staff as a priority. Many teachers will of course be vaccinated over coming weeks as part of the JCVI priority list.The fortnightly review will not simply be a choice between opening and closing schools - we will always seek to maximise the number of pupils we can safely get back to classrooms and nurseries.Sothe evidence tells us we can get some pupils back safely, we will do that.However ultimately, the best way of enabling more pupils tomore quickly is by reducing community transmission of the virus as much as possible.And all of us ndash by accepting and abiding by the wider restrictions I have set out today - have a part to play in achieving that.Before I leave the issue of education, let me remind the chamber that we already had plans in place for the staggeredof universities and colleges. We will be considering this week whether any further change is necessary.Presiding OfficerBefore I close today, I want to give a brief update on our current expectations around vaccine supply.The Health Secretary will give a more detailed update on vaccination in a statement the chamber next week.However, I can confirm today that well over , people have now received their first dose of the vaccine.The first doses of the Astra Zeneca vaccine are being administered today.In total, over the period to the end of January - including the more than , already administered - we expect to have access to just over , doses of vaccine. Obviously, we hope that increases.These will be split roughly equally between the Pfizer and Astra Zeneca vaccines.However, we anticipate that some of the Astra Zeneca portion will be available only in the last week of January.We do not yet have certainty on supply schedules beyond January but will keep Parliament updated as these become firmer.However, our current expectation, based on assumptions about supply and the new advice on doses being administered up to  weeks apart, rather than , is that by early May everyone over , and people under  with specic underlying conditions, will have received at least the first dose of vaccine.That is everyone who is on the JCVI priority list, and comprises more than . million people.Once everyone on the priority list has been vaccinated, we will start vaccinating the rest of the population, and will do this in parallel with completing second doses for those on the priority list.Those timetables are of course heavily dependent on vaccine supply. And for that reason, they are at this stage cautious.However, I have tasked our vaccination team with exploring and keeping under ongoing review all options to speed up the rate of vaccination and bring these timescales forward as far as possible.I am grateful for the many offers of assistance we have received and while many of them may not prove possible or practical to take up, they will be consideredThe Health Secretary will say more about all of this in her statement next week.Presiding OfficerTo conclude, this is most certainly not the new year statement I wanted to give.And I know it is a statement no one wanted to hear.But as I said at the beginning, we are now in a race between the vaccine and the virus.The Scottish government will do everything we can to speed up distribution of the vaccine.But all of us must do everything we can to slow down the spread of the virus.We can already see ndash by looking at infection rates where ndash some of what could happen here in Scotlandwe donrsquot act.To prevent that, we need to act immediately and firmly.For government, that means introducing tough measures ndash as we have done so today.And for all of us, it means sticking to the rulesIt means continuing to follow the FACTS guidanceAnd it means ndash above all ndash staying at home.That is again our central message.Stay Home. Save lives. Protect the NHS.If we do this, we give the vaccine the time it needs to get ahead and ultimately win the race.I know that the next few weeks will be incredibly dficult.Irsquom sorry to ask for further sacrices, after nine long months of them. But these sacrices are necessary.And the dference between now and last March is that with the help of vaccines, we now have confidence that these sacrices will pave the way to brighter days ahead.So ndash for everyonersquos sake and safety - please stick with it and stay at home."},{"url":null,"title":"new-lockdown-rules-scotland-covid-restrictions-explained","story":"First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced the new rules on Monday afternoon, asthe latest restrictions came into effect from midnight today in all Level  areas of the country andwill continue throughout the month.Speaking at Holyrood, Ms Sturgeon said: \"I can confirm now, in summary, that we decided to introduce from tomorrow, for the duration of January, a legal requirement to stay at home except for essential purposes.

It was also commended for including a system that brakes the car following a crash. The only real negative was that it could cause higher damage to other vehicles in a crash.Seat LeonThe Leon shares a  with the A and therefore scores similarly. However, it did marginally better in adult occupant protection, despite near-identical comments on injury protection. It also received a small penalty for the damage it could cause other vehicles, but otherwise received good marks for protecting passengers from injury.Volkswagen ID.Volkswagens new electric vehicle also underwent testing this year, getting full marks. It performed well in preventing injuries to its passengers, but was also noted for not causing excessive damage to the crash barrier, indicating its also quite friendly to other vehicles in a crash. The main negative was the fact that the dummy moved too far across the vehicle in the side impact test.Toyota YarisThe Yaris might be small but it scored well across the board, receiving maximum points for protecting critical body parts in the side impact test. It also gained praise for having clear information on the front airbag system, which can be disabled for rear-facing child restraints. However, an unclear manual meant it failed on the installation check for some child restraints.Honda JazzAnother small car that performed well is the Jazz, which demonstrated a stable passenger compartment in the offset frontal test. Protection of the passengers was generally good, but was rated as weak for the drivers chest. It was noted that the centre airbag protected passengers colliding with each other in a side impact.Mazda MX-Another electric car, Mazdas new MX received top marks, doing particularly well in adult occupant protection, where it scored %. The report notes that protection of passengers was strong, scoring top marks in both the side barrier test and more severe side pole impact. It was knocked for not having an advanced emergency call system or post-collision braking.Land Rover DefenderLand Rover will be pleased to learn that one of the most highly anticipated new cars of the year scored top marks in testing, despite not being outstanding in any department. Euro NCAP noted that the femur protection score was penalised, as was chest protection of the rear passenger in the full-width rigid wall test. It was also considered an aggressive partner to other vehicles in the event of a crash.Kia SorentoAnother large SUV and another five stars, the Sorento was another that didnt stand out in any particular area but did well overall. Its central airbag, whiplash protection and driver assistance were all rated highly. However, its protection of the drivers chest and right femur was rated weak, with occupant protection rated marginal in this test because structures in the dashboard could cause a risk to occupants of dferent sizes.Isuzu D-MaxThe surprise of the year was the Isuzu D-Max pick-up, which scored top marks despite competing in a segment that is not famous for highlighting safety. It received similar occupant safety comments as the Sorento in the offset frontal test, and was also penalised for how it interacts with other vehicles in a crash. However, it typically scored highly for occupant protection in a iety of crash scenarios, as well as for having an emergency call system."},{"url":null,"title":"agenda-glasgow-pupils-connected-ever","story":"MANY aspects of our lives have changed because of the pandemic, but signicant effort has been put into keeping things as normal as possible for our young people.

Learning, rather than technology, was at the heart of our ambitions.Wersquove accelerated our plans because of the pandemic and completed the rollout a year ahead of schedule, partly out of necessity but more importantly because of a strong partnership between teachers, parents and young learners. However, this was a journey we were already on, and its effects will be felt for generations to come.Our focus should be on what technology allows our learners and teachers to do ndash and how education can be enriched through digital learning. Consider the young people with additional support needs, or those whose first language may not be English. Using an iPad, which was chosen specically for its accessibility features, we are able to engage with those young people on an even footing.The application of technology should be viewed in the context of delivering long-term socio-economic benefits which connect our young people to new opportunities, create a level playing field, and allow far greater flexibility both in and out of the classroom. Technology breeds creativity ndash and attainment is known to improvea young person feels more engaged and able to tailor their learning.We also recognised that the plan would not work based solely on new equipment but ensuring that our dedicated teachers and supportive parents and carers were on board. We created Digital Leader of Learning roles in each school, who are now working together across the city, sharing knowledge and experiences in a way like never before. We also created easy-to-use guides for parents so learning and teaching can continue just as easily at home as it can in the classroom.Our approach is being noticed across the world as an example of how we can support children and young people to become digital citizens and develop skills for the future.

This is not the work of crusty French bread or a rogue brazil nut, but a soft-centred chocolate which, when bitten into, put up a fight. In size, this hand-made cherry brandy fondant, decorated in pink icing, was less a piece of confectionary and more a magicianrsquos top hat. Its neighbours were half its girth, whereas the lid bulged over this beauty. It was absolutely delicious but next time ndash and there will be a next time ndash Irsquoll use cutlery.Irsquove been eating a lot of chocolates lately. Turkey, stuffing, and panetone too, and a surfeit of other festive fare. In my defence, these caloric treats are balanced with seasonal side dishes of brussels sprouts, carrots and kale. Irsquove had a fondness for brussels sprouts since we had to boil a saucepan of them in my first domestic science class. It was the only lesson in this subject where I excelled. Back then, I seasoned with pepper.Today, a drizzle of olive oil turns them into the food of the gods. Thus, as I reach for a mid-morning biscuit, eyeing up the snow clouds outside and thinking of the energy required to get me through to lunch, I refuse to feel guilty. Others, however, seem hell-bent on pricking the nationrsquos conscience and turning an innocent cooked breakfast or buttered scone into a source of shame.There are many reasons to dread the start of the new year, not least the dark and cold. One unfailing, ill-timed and unnecessary scourge is the avalanche of advice doled out around January  by nutritionists and dieticians. Even worse than the tips of health professionals is the enthusiasm of former junk food addicts who, after a Damascene conversion that usually involves a near-death experience, are messianic about their new habits.My idea of weight control is whether or not I can tuck a T-shirt into my jeans after theyrsquove been in a -degree wash. The battery on my bathroom scales died years ago, since when theyrsquove been gathering dust under the bed. This is not something to boast about , but while I can face up to many things in le ndash a leaking roof, mice under the eaves, a looming taxdeadline ndash knowing how many kilos Irsquove gained is not one of them.There seems something sadistic about exhorting people to give up comfort food at precisely the time of year it was designed for. It might be fine to start January with a health kickyou live in Alice Springs or Calornia. In Achiltibuie or Crail, however, it feels cruel. When sleet is whistling around the windows, and the streets are coated in ice, the idea of following a meagre, challenging or carefully calibrated diet does not appeal.All of us know, by now, that Covid does not just love a crowd, it is also drawn to love handles. Being clinically obese is thought to raise the risk of coronavirus complications. The unfailing appearance of New Year diets, however, seems more a lestyle adjunct than a serious medical intervention. They fall into the same category as making resolutions to give up fags or booze, or to pound the pavement, clocking up steps like a hamster on a wheel. This year, however, therersquos not even the incentive of needing to be beach-ready by summer. I doubt many of us will be mentally prepared to launch ourselves into a warmer climate and inviting sea in July, evenwe are enviably lithe and toned.Obviously,I felt I was getting too heavy, Irsquod feel obliged to knuckle down and deal with it, whatever the date. It is true also that the majority of us could probably benefit from tweaking our menus around the margins. But the longest, blackest and dreariest month of the year is not the time to begin. It is counterintuitive, and possibly even self-defeating, to ask us to turn ourselves into a new and better version of ourselves, ldquothe best me I can be, when our internal clock is on perpetual snooze, coming alive only at the smell of roasted potatoes. When night descends by mid afternoon, and we have barely enough oomph to empty the dishwasher, let alone turn the kitchen into a MasterChef set, our willpower is posted missing.Perhaps I ought simply to bypass the magazine features that show vegetable slurries greener than a David Hockney landscape, or chargrilled chicken served with an acre of al dente field. Yet it is not the promise of slimness that lures me in but the ever-changing science of food. That, and the thought of the guinea pigs who allow themselves to become living laboratories. One such group is the cohort of older women cited in the German science writer Bas Kastrsquos new book, called The Diet Compass.These grandmothers were each given a muffin a day for seven weeks. One lot was baked with sunflower oil, the other with palm oil. Unsurprisingly, everyone gained weight, but those in the second category grew fattest.

And the woodpecker, running up the tree, and the nuthatch, running down it. And the guest stars: a jay, magpies, doves, corvids, and the wagtails that nested in a hole in my wall. And finally, the A-lister: a robin who poses on the bench like itrsquos a throne.In the last couple of weeks, there have been some newcomers too. A linnet with a breast almost as bright as the robinrsquos and the dowdier female with her go-fast stripes on her chest. And there have been a few house sparrows too, which is a new thing for me in the middle of the country. House sparrows tend to stick to towns, but I can see a few of them checking out the hebe by the window as a potential holiday home. Theyrsquore very welcome to it. I hope they stay.I hope, too, that their presence is a good sign. Sixty years ago, the house sparrow was the most numerous bird in Britain, but the population has declined by  per cent. Fortunately, the situation appears to have stabilised more recently and part of that may be down to more of us putting out birdfeeders in our gardens: sales of feeders and food have increased big-time during the lockdowns.Obviously, all of this is good for the birds, but itrsquos good for us too. A study was published in Germany a few days ago showing a connection between birds and human happiness ndash the more birds you can see and hear around you, said the report, the more satisfied yoursquore likely to be with your le. It also concluded that the effect of more birds is as great as the effect of more money. But then I could have told them that.Irsquod also like to tell you about some of the things Irsquove learned about helping the birds: a few of the tips that experts in the RSPB and other organisations have passed on to me over the years. The first of them is that you should keep your feeders filled all year round, not just in the winter. In the summer, a lot of the birdsrsquo diet will be made up of insects, but even then every little extra bit helps.The second tip could be more dficult: donrsquot be so neat and tidy. A lot of birds feed on the scraps that humans leave behind, and use the hedges in our gardens as shelter, and for food, and for nesting ndash the ordinary garden is a birdrsquos fortress and kitchen and nursery. So donrsquot leave your hedges too trim and neat ndash leave spaces for the birds to get in and out. And put scraps and leftovers out on the birdtable. It will all be appreciated.Maybe we could check our attitudes too. We know the British people love birds, but we also know we have a confused attitude to them. We put up bird tables but put spikes on buildings to discourage pigeons. We celebrate the robin but decry the gull. The hen harrier is killed to protect the right to kill the grouse. Perhaps we could stop trying to impose our rules on the birds. Perhaps we could step back and realise they are all the same. Perhaps we could look at the birds and learn.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

If properly resourced, there is no reason why those leaving secondary school cannot have a formal extension of one or two years to continue their lost education and take their exams in further education colleges. This would require strategic organisation involving all sectors of education and I believe this would be a better solution than to allow our elderly, in which I have a vested interest, to wither away.It is clear Mr Tait does not care for Nicola Sturgeon or her regular media updates, for which there is an off switch as an immediate cure. Many of those living alone and perhaps infirm and unable to get out will depend and look forward to up-to-date information delivered with a clarity unmatched where. To describe the general NHS as effectively destroyed and the Scottish Government ldquotrapped in a failure whirlpool of its own making is beyond the description of hyperbole.Alan M Morris, Blanefield.CAN WE LEARN FROM THE CHILDREN GAVIN Tait favours vaccinating teachers who fear catching the disease from children ldquoalthough the risk is very small\". He echoes what seems to be accepted generally and without question that for some reason children are at low risk of virus infection and of passing it on. If that is the case, do children have some inherent immunity, which presumably diminishes as they grow up, which should be researched, identied, isolated and passed over to adults as an alternative or additional treatment to vaccination Alan Fitzpatrick, Dunlop.PUBLISH DAILY VACCINE FIGURESTHE Covid vaccination programme is probably the most vital and important public health exercise in modern history. Notwithstanding, given comments made be either Nicola Sturgeon or Jeane Freeman over the last  hours, I have heard or read at least six dferent versions of their expected Covid vaccination timetable in terms of who will be vaccinated and by when. This is a disgrace. Once again, like the flu jab fiasco, John Swinneyrsquos education mess-up last year and other examples too many to mention here, this indicates this SNP administrations complete inability to manage anything effectively or efficiently.Since March last year, Ms Sturgeon has managed to find ample resources to both compile and produce her daily political broadcast ndash sorry, Covid update ndash so why can she now not find resources to deliver a daily update on vaccination progress against a clearly articulated timetable  This is what we want to hear from her, not her ongoing, daily, repetitive political jibes, nor her monotonous and very isive independence monologue.Paul McPhail, Glasgow G.JAG ROLL-OUT MUST NOT FAILI WAS more than pleased when my -year-old brother contacted me yesterday to advise that he had just received his first Covid vaccination. He lives in Essex, where NHS England has commenced the roll-out of a major vaccination programme which is intended to immunise the entire top four priority groups by mid-February this includes all the over-seventies, NHS workers, care home staff and care home residents in addition to people with underlying health problems, amounting to more than  million people. This is an exceptionally ambitious target, but one which the Prime Minister is confident of achieving.Under the circumstances it is not unreasonable to expect that here in Scotland we can achieve similar success with a vaccination roll-out that includes the most vulnerable groups over a similar time frame. Should the Scottish Government fail to deliver a successful vaccination programme, at speed, and without similar problems to those experienced with last yearrsquos flu vaccine debacle, then it will never be forgiven by the Scottish public.Christopher H Jones, Gfnock.TRAINING IS A LONG SLOGI READ with real concern in your front-page report todaythat a number of health care staff in Glasgow yesterdayhad been unable to get their Covid- vaccine as had been originally scheduled.Undoubtedly such a mass immunisation programme requires a considerable amount of planning and effort, including recruitment of vaccinators. I have been practising as a GP for  years and I first offered to be a vaccinator as part of the hospital community hub vaccination programme on December . I received an email on December  inviting me to complete the online training, which I did ndash this taking me six hours, but which unlike as has been reported to be the case in England, did not include compulsory modules in de-radicalisation or equality and ersity. On December  I submitted my completed application and currently await to find outmy skills can be useful to the vaccination effort. Cases of Covid- continue to rise, but at this point Irsquom not too sure that the vaccine is outrunning the virus.Dr Alan Mitchell, Motherwell.WHY MESS WITH THE PROGRAMME NICOLA Sturgeon has stated that no one would be receiving a first dose of the Pfizer vaccine and a possible second dose with the Oxford vaccine. Surely no one in the health boards had even considered that scenario  I am also at a loss as to how they can suddenly change the period gap between jags, from  days to  weeks, without any check on the effect of same.There have already been some doubts on the suitability of the existing vaccines for keeping the Covid iant at bay, let alone the now additional one appearing on the scene, so why mess with the initial vaccine programme George Dale, Beith.HOW HAS IT COME TO THIS WHEN you are into ldquoextra-time in the game of le as I am, lockdown is a disaster. I know thatI catch Covid- the chances are it will kill me. Like many old fogies Irsquove been in what is essentially self-imposed lockdown for the best part of a year and as of now even that regime will be ramped up. Gone completely will be the already-infrequent outdoor visits to kids and grandkids, even a daily walk which is already compromised by being compelled to walk on the road to avoid groups of adolescents who ignore social distancing or ignorant berks who feel it more important that their dog-on-a-string walks on the pavement than a pensioner, will be threatened. Heaven forfend one runs out of milk the risk of premature death has to be balanced against having a decent cup of tea.Just how badly managed the response to the pandemic has been is encapsulated by the fact that almost a year into things only now are they considering closing the door to the country. For heavenrsquos sake we live on an island, it should have been the first thing they did. How is it possible that groups were shuttling back and forwards to European ski resorts recently  Air-bridges pathetic. Now we have a virus iant that got here from South Africa on a plane and another highly contagious mutant domestic form of Covid- that appeared in the heavily-populated south-east of England, its development and transmission facilitated by Government policy of trying to keep le as near normal as possible to protect the economy rather than the population.Less than a year into the pandemic the UK seasonally adjusted level of deaths is nearer , than the official Covid- statistics, mainly elderly poor or BAME casualties. The economy has tanked with personal debt escalating along with rising unemployment and rent arrears, but at least the rich are getting richer.I suppose depending on where you stand Government policy could be deemed to be right on target.David J Crawford, Glasgow G.ELECTION WILL NO DOUBT COME FIRSTI ENJOYED reading my mothers letter , agree with its content and admire her idealism.

Although the population of the UAEs cosmopolitan city is largely expatriate, foreigners were still subject to strict laws. Lockdown was fierce: leaving the house, even for exercise or dog walking, was forbidden, and police permits were required for collecting groceries or medical prescriptions. Refusing to wear a mask could result in a penalty of pound.But strict measures have delivered successful results and although the virus hasnt completely disappeared, the , new cases recorded on January  are a blip compared to the rest of us.Firstly, every traveller must present a negative PCR test to enter the country, although anyone entering the UAE from Britain can do their test on arrival for free.

He said: ldquoWe have MPAs. We do need space where we can harvest food.ldquoWe have not had a dialogue about which areas should be designated for food production.The academic said much of the debate on scallops had become ldquopolarised.He said: ldquoAt the green end of the spectrum a considerable number of NGOs [non-governmental organisations] would like scallop dredging banned outright because of the damage it does to dferent habitats.ldquoFrom a more scientic perspective, scallop fisheries can be considered to be sustainable because they are clams and they feed at the bottom of the food chain.There are environmental impacts but they can be managedwe control its footprint.Industrial fisherman use drag nets to scrape scallops out of the seabed.Green groups such as sustainable seafood charity Open Seas say this does huge damage to the marine environment.Fishermen, who deny ploughing through sensitive areas, counter that they focus on areas where they do not snag their gear.Mr Kaiser said more work was needed to find out where damage would be least ndash such as sandy flat areas where plants and animals are already resilient to disturbances from heavy waves or storms.Adult scallops, clams in Scots, do not move much and tend to grow in the same places year after year. So he believes areas could be set aside for their cultivation, leaving much of the sea out of bounds to dredgers.ldquoHaving a good understanding of what is on the seabed and what is located where, is fundamentally important, he said, stressing the dficulty of mapping under the sea.ldquoThat is something we donrsquot have or we have in a very patchy way. It is not like looking at farmland ndash you canrsquot just send a drone up and take a nice picture and see where all the fields and forests are.Both commercial fishers and groups such as Open Seas ndash as the name suggests ndash see the seas as a common resource and space.But Mr Kaiser also suggests that, with full Brexit on the horizon, the UK could look at setting up a system of quasi-ownership over what would become scallop fields.Essentially, he is talking about giving local fishers rights to exploit a patch of the seabed ndash infor agreeing to a range of conditions.The scheme, he said, would work like common grazing on land.He said: ldquoAt sea, as soon as you have some form of ownership, people tend to change their behaviour over time because they feel they have control over their future.ldquoAnd their rights are not likely to be taken away by somebody  who has no vested interest.ldquoThis is a very current discussion at the moment, particularly with Brexit now here.ldquoThere is an opportunity for the UK to look again at what in the jargon are termed co-management systems where groups of fishers from a defined area ndash with interests in a particular fishery ndash are given ownership and responsibility and stewardship of that resource.ldquoThat can have all sorts of conditions.ldquoThey have to participate in the science. They have to be part of the management. They have to be responsible for setting limits."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12207860.jpg?type=article-full","title":"scotlands-r-number-1-3-10-000-daily-infections-estimated","story":"New modelling data published by the Scottish Government found that it is estimated that there was a  per cent increase in ldquocontacts within the home over the festive period.The modelling data sets out that the reproduction rate, R, is now estimated at being between . and ..

It will give rise to understandable concerns about the likely impact on education, mental health and access to health services as well as on jobs and businesses.#However, the rapid rise in COVID cases across Scotland in recent weeks left the government with little choice. With vaccines now being rolled out, we need to allow time for these to take effect.

I am also determined that any support is over and above what is already being made available.“Once these details and the options have been fleshed out, I will work with the council and the finance secretary to ensure arrangements are put in place as quickly as possible.#Promises of funding are all very well, but many businesses are on a kne-edge right now and urgently need access to this support”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

As ordinary folk, none of these three ‘coves’ come with the egotism associatedwith this level of stardom. Their down-to-earth attitude, gentle humility and self-confessed naivety of the wider music industry is part of their unique charm and connects them to their fans across the generations who reward them with unwavering loyalty.“The Barrowlands was booked but that sold out just as quickly. Suddenly all the venues sold out, including gigs in London and Manchester. It was unbelievable.”“We are not the type of band that can sit down and invent new materials,” said Innes.“Everything comes out of Boydie’s head and, until it’s ready to be released, it’s not coming. You don’t ask him to do anything. He has a heart of gold and means well to everyone but,you ask him to do something, and he’s not ready for, it will not get done. We are waiting to see what happens with live gigs next year.”Innes confesses to feeling nervous about the uncertainty of the future of live performances. He said: “Over the summer, a lot of people believed the situation with the pandemic would be better but I realised things were getting worse for live music. I really wondered whether Peat  Diesel would ever play live again.“I am, however, a positive person who always sees good things in bad situations. Watching pre-Covid TV programmes where people are sitting closely together does put fear through us though. Until maybe everyone takes this vaccine and Covid goes away, I think live music is really going to struggle.“When we are playing, the crowd sucks up the atmosphere we have created.“If that atmosphere is not there, I don’t think people will enjoy it. For the  tour, I am not sure whether people will be ready to gather or whether they would rather wait that extra while to attend a gig. We will have to wait and see how it goes.”The  tour has been rescheduled for next year, with a gig booked for Skye in the autumn.Innes says he is looking forward to coming back to Skye: “We have played on Skye before and were not sure how they would get us. It was an amazing experience for us, though, as people sang along to the words and really enjoyed the performance.“Despite the sea between us, Skye people are very like us and understand our music.“We decided the tour had to include a venue on Skye as we feel they are our friends and family and a place where we feel at home to be ourselves and enjoy our time there.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3574441.jpg--.jpg?1609941600000\n","title":"cllr mccaughey gifts kells and connor primary school newly refurbished computers","story":"KELLS and Connor Primary School were given an early Christmas gt last week, as DUP Cllr William McCaughey presented two refurbished computers to the school.The computers were refurbished by GSC Computers who were delighted to help.

The Church of Ireland, Presbyterian Church, Methodist Church in Ireland and Roman Catholic Church made similar statements this afternoon. It follows a meeting this afternoon of the Northern Ireland Executive’s ‘Faith Leaders’ Forum’, which was convened by Junior Ministers, Gordon Lyons MLA and Declan Kearney MLA. Church leaders and other faith leaders received advice during the meeting from Dr Michael McBride, the Chief Medical Officer , and Professor Ian Young, Chief Scientic Advisor , regarding the worsening Coronavirus situation. Speaking on behalf of the Presbyterian Church, the Clerk of the General Assembly and General Secretary of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, said, “Our churches are part of the local community and we recognise the very serious situation that Northern Ireland finds itself in today. With the extremely high level of transmission of the Covid- virus, combined with the numbers in hospital and intensive care, the very clear warning from the CMO and CSA this afternoon was that over the next number of weeks this situation is going to worsen signicantly.” Mr Gribben continued, “In light of our ongoing consultations and the current serious and worsening situation, and in line with unequivocal public health guidance that people should stay at home, we have written to our congregations in Northern Ireland, informing them that all in person Sunday gatherings for worship, along with most other in person church gatherings, should cease in all PCI congregations from midnight tonight until Saturday,  February . “It is of course regrettable and disappointing that over these next few weeks our congregations will no longer be physically gathering for worship. However, because of the alarming rise of Covid- infections in the community, this is the right decision to take, both for the safety and protection of people and also to contribute to the overall reduction of inter-person contact in line with the government’s ‘stay at home’ message.” The Clerk concluded by saying, “In these dficult days, as we continue to look to God, and encourage others to find their hope in Him, let us help and pray for one another, lting up all those on the frontline, those in authority making dficult decisions and especially all who mourn and miss loved ones.” Church of Ireland Archbishop of Armagh, John McDowell, said in a statement with his fellow bishops that the escalation of numbers in hospital and intensive care is placing immense pressure on our healthcare staff. He added that the number of deaths and warnings from officials is of grave concern. We recognise that clergy and parishioners have together worked steadily to implement protocols which have ensured that public gatherings for worship have been as safe as possible since the re–opening of our buildings in early summer, said their statement. We also appreciate that the Northern Ireland Executive has acknowledged over the last  months the importance of people being able to gather in person for worship. The ongoing engagement between faith communities and the Northern Ireland Executive is warmly welcomed and is something which we believe has been, and continues to be, of benefit to wider society. However, in light of the current serious and worsening situation and in line with clear public health guidance that people should stay at home, we have decided that all public gatherings for worship and all other in–person church activities should cease for our particular denomination, until Saturday th February , subject to review in late January, with the exception of weddings, funerals, arrangements for recording and or live–streaming, drive–in services and private prayer . We note and welcome the fact that the same position has been adopted by the Presbyterian Church, Roman Catholic Church, Methodist Church and others in Northern Ireland. In making this decision for the ‘greater good’ of all within our community we continue to remember in our prayers the sick and bereaved, all who are suffering, those whose lives have been directly impacted by Covid–, praying too for those in positions of responsibility who are faced with making dficult decisions at this challenging time. A statement issued on behalf of Archbishop of Armagh, Eamon Martin, said the Catholic Church was very concerned at the current serious public health position in which Northern Ireland finds itself: with the extremely high level of transmission of the Covid- virus the continuing escalation of numbers in hospital and intensive care the number of associated deaths and, the increasingly unsustainable pressure on our healthcare staff. The statement, which was also signed by the other Catholic bishops from dioceses within Northern Ireland, added: The clear message from health officials is that this situation is going to worsen signicantly over the coming weeks. We recognise the efforts of so many in our parishes who have been working to ensure that our gatherings for public worship are as safe as possible and we welcome the continuing engagement between the faith communities and the NI Executive which has led to consensus between us on the importance of people being able to gather in person for worship. At this time, however, we acknowledge and support the unequivocal message from public health authorities that the movement and gathering of people should be minimised and that as many people as possible stay at home for the sake of health, le and the Common Good. In light of our ongoing consultations and of the current serious and worsening situation, and in line with clear public health guidance that people should stay at home, we have decided that for a limited period , the celebration of the Eucharist and other liturgies should take place without the physical presence of the faithful - with the exception of marriage, funeral, baptismal liturgies and drive-in services . Arrangements for recording and or livestreaming, and making inidual visits for private prayer are also permissible in accordance with regulations. We encourage parishes, where possible, to continue to broadcast the celebration of Mass - and other devotions and prayer services - online and on other media, knowing that faith and prayer can be a tremendous support to iniduals and society during these dficult times. We make this decision reluctantly, conscious that not being able to gather for public worship can cause pain for all the faithful, but in the hope that this limited period of sacrice will be for the protection of le and health and for the greater good of all. We once more ask for prayers for the sick, the bereaved and all those whose livelihoods have been particularly impacted by the pandemic. We keep in our prayers all health workers, carers, chaplains and other essential workers. We welcome the announcement that a similar position is being taken by the leaders of the Church of Ireland, the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, the Methodist Church in Ireland and many other denominations and faith communities in response to the unequivocal message from public health authorities that as many people as possible stay at home at this time. President of the Methodist Church,Rev Dr Tom McKnight, commented, “We made this decision in light of the clear advice from health officials that this action would be of benefit to public health and for the sake of the ‘Common Good’. As this Pandemic continues we are particularly mindful of those here and around the world whose lives are most profoundly impacted, people who are isolated, who are suffering or worried because of economic concerns, young people who carry a particular burden, those who are ill, and those who have lost loved ones. The church continues to be committed to doing all we can to support and stand with those in most need. As a church we continue to pray for those leading our country at this time."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1610110925376.jpg--uk_approval_for_moderna_vaccine.jpg?1610110925000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20210108newsuk approval for moderna vaccine","story":"The Moderna coronavirus vaccine has been approved for use in the UK.

This most consequential of acts resulted in the partition of Ireland. The genesis of the Government of Ireland Act  came in . Home Rule had been on the statute book since  and could no longer be postponed. It was scheduled to come into operation automatically when hostilities were formally concluded with the signature of the last of the peace treaties after the First World War.To prevent this, the Prime Minister, David Lloyd George, set up a committee, chaired by Cabinet member Walter Long, to draft the Government of Ireland Bill. The make-up of Long#s committee was unionist in outlook. There was no nationalist representation whatsoever, nor was the advice of any nationalists sought. Leading Ulster unionist James Craig and his associates were the only Irishmen consulted.Long#s committee proposed to create two distinct legislatures for Ulster and the southern provinces, linked by a common council, comprising representatives from both. This was the first time a British government proposed a separate parliament for Ulster.Before the end of the war, the exclusion of Ulster, or at least some of Ulster, was the only option being considered in terms of special treatment for the province. Ulster unionists desired for direct rule to remain from Westminster.The common council proposed in the Government of Ireland Bill was a Council of Ireland to be composed of  members from each parliament, which the British stated could lead to the peaceful evolution of a single parliament for all Ireland.Initially, there were many objections from Ulster unionists. The main problem was with the area to be included in the Ulster parliament: Ulster unionists sought the six counties of Antrim, Armagh, Derry, Down, Fermanagh and Tyrone, and not the nine counties of Ulster proposed by Long#s committee, as this was the maximum area they felt they could dominate without being outbred by Catholics.This decision of the Ulster Unionist Council was deeply unpopular among the , Protestants of counties Donegal, Cavan and Monaghan, who were sacriced to the southern administration.Belfast unionist MP Thomas Moles explained that the three counties had to be abandoned in order to save the Six Counties: In a sinking ship, with leboats sufficient for only two-thirds of the ship#s company, were all to condemn themselves to death because all could not be saved Even though the Ulster Unionist Council endorsed the Government of Ireland Bill reluctantly, many Ulster unionists eventually concluded that the scheme proposed in the Government of Ireland Act would cause the least diminution of their Britishness. Some, such as James Craig#s brother, Charles, began to see the great benefits Ulster unionists would garner from having their own parliament: The Bill practically gives us everything that we fought for, everything we armed ourselves for.It has often been cited that the Government of Ireland Bill was allowed to pass relatively unchallenged due to the vacuum in nationalist representation at Westminster. With Sinn Fein abstaining, there were just seven Irish nationalist MPs remaining in Westminsterafter the  general election, instead of .It could be argued that even  nationalist MPs would have made little dference, considering the make-up of the House of Commons after the election. The Conservative Party, Lloyd George#s Coalition Liberal Party and Irish unionists won over  seats, an overwhelming majority. It is doubtful that Sinn Fein#s presence would have made a dference.What little voice the seven nationalist MPs had was further diminished by the Catholic Church#s belief that they should not participate in the committee stages, nor suggest amendments to the Government of Ireland Bill.The Catholic Church was virulently opposed to partition and believed that participating in the framing of the Partition Bill would be seen as a sign of its acceptance. The Bishop of Derry, Charles McHugh, claimed Catholic Ulster would never submit to become hewers of wood and drawers of water for Sir Edward Carson.The leading nationalist MP left in Westminster, Joseph Devlin, condemned the Bill as conceived in Bedlam, ridiculous and fantastic. He voted against it, but did not contribute to its final shape. With Sinn Fein#s policy on partition almost non-existent, it chose to ignore the Government of Ireland Bill. As the Bill was making its way through parliament, the British government was waging a war with Sinn Fein and its military wing, the IRA.Sinn Fein leaders stuck steadfastly - and naively - to the view that Ulster would readily come into an all-Ireland parliament once Britain was removed from the island.That the Government of Ireland Act came into law as Britain was at open war with Sinn Fein, supported by a considerable majority on the island, shows the total air of unreality that surrounded the Act.In granting the royal assent to the Government of Ireland Act , King George V expressed the hope that it, the fruit of more than  years of ceaseless controversy, will finally bring about unity and friendship between all the peoples of my kingdom.This was a wildly optimistic reading of the environment in Ireland in  and of the likely fallout from its impending partition.Cormac Moore is the author of Birth of the Border: The Impact of Partition in Ireland Belfast Most ReadTributes to Ballymena man Alan Henry who died days after we shared emotional plea to take Covid- seriouslyCoronavirus: NI may neverto normality despite success of vaccine, warns Professor YoungDUP#s Paisley defends Donald Trump in wake of US Capitol riotsCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Theatre capacity to be allocated to those most in need as  deaths and , new cases reportedNI#s new Covid lockdown explained: More cops on the streets, the #reasonable excuses# needed for being out and what shops are open Latest Northern IrelandPrivate hospital in Belfast steps in after NHS operations are cancelledInternational arrivals into NI will have to prove they Covid- are virus-freePoots in storm as Gove warns border chaos will get worseMan shot in leg in suspected paramilitary attackMan shot in leg in second paramilitary-style attack this week in DerryLatest from Belfast Snow and ice set to hit UK over bitterly cold weekendNuno Espirito Santo calls on Wolves players to be more clinical in front of goalJurgen Klopp relieved to progress after Liverpool preparations ‘went in the bin’Damien Duff steps down from Republic of Ireland coaching roleFrank Lampard not expecting any player power problems despite Cha struggles,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Companies sending goods to Northern Ireland are required to complete new customs paperwork under the NI Protocol, which came into force as the transition period came to an end last week.While guidance from HMRC published on New Year#s Eve introduced a three-month grace period for parcels being sent to consumers, many companies had already decided to put Northern Ireland deliveries on hold before that point. A Belfastreader said they had tried to order a Peloton bike to be told by a worldwide company they cannot fulfil orders to Northern Ireland due to the Brexit situation.I tried to explain we are part of the UK but with no luck, they added.The hi-tech exercise bike, which costs around £, for the original model, has become a sought-after item for exercise at home - tapping into the surge in popularity of cycling and the closure of gyms during lockdown.The company, which was founded in the US, enables users to tune into intense spin classes or other forms of exercise online using a touchscreen integrated into the equipment.A spokeswoman for Peloton said: We have temporarily paused new sales of the Peloton Bike and Peloton Bike+ whilst we update our systems and processes in response to Brexit. Customers who placed an order on or before December ,  will still have their Peloton Bike or Peloton Bike+ delivered. We are working to resume full service and sales in Northern Ireland as soon as possible.She added: Our existing members in Northern Ireland are not affected by this pause to new sales and still have full access to our service, as well as the ability to arrange a service appointment or a refund for their Peloton Bike or Bike+.

During this time, we will work with our customers to validate and correct the data we have in our system, to reduce the delays and enable us to resume normal service.“This pause in our operation will be as short as possible and we intend to recommence this service on Wednesday January .”🔈STATEMENT, Thursday th January, :pm pic gGqOksKw— Seafood From ScotlandJanuary , Donna Fordyce, chief executive at Seafood Scotland, said exporters faced “new bureaucratic non-tarf barriers” with no one body able to fix the situation.“It’s a perfect storm for Scottish seafood exporters. Weakened by Covid-, and the closure of the French border before Christmas, the end of the Brexit transition period has unleashed layer upon layer of administrative problems, resulting in queues, border refusals and utter confusion,” she said.“IT problems in France meant consignments were erted from Boulogne sur Mer to Dunkirk, which was unprepared as it wasn’t supposed to be at the export front line. There have also been HMRC IT issues on the UK side that need to resolved ASAP regarding certication.“A lack of knowledge and understanding of the required paperwork means some companies are ill-prepared for the new checks, which are taking far longer because of the mistakes being uncovered. When the systems settle down, checks should be carried out on samples from each load but now entire consignments are having to be checked to satisfy requirements.”MS boss Steve Rowe warned that the trade agreement between the UK and the EU is causing problems with “potential tarfs on part of our range exported to the EU, together with very complex administrative processes”.Ministers have to get a grip on this and make sure essential workers are actually able to do their jobs, or we risk seeing a repeat of the chaos on our roads at ChristmasJim McMahon, shadow transport secretaryHaulier industry body Logistics UK said deliveries were being delayed as lorries arrived in Belfast with incomplete paperwork.In order to avoid a hard border with the Republic, Mr Johnson agreed Northern Ireland would remain in the EU single market – but that has meant checks on goods arriving from Great Britain.Irish customs authorities said they would temporarily relax regulations around goods moving from Great Britain.Labour accused the Government of failing to properly prepare for the end of the transition period on December .Shadow transport secretary Jim McMahon said: “The Government promised it had a plan to make sure things ran smoothly for businesses and hauliers post-Brexit.“It’s clear the problems caused by its poor preparation and delaying tactics have not gone away. Ministers have to get a grip on this and make sure essential workers are actually able to do their jobs, or we risk seeing a repeat of the chaos on our roads at Christmas.”A Government spokesman said: “Businesses and hauliers have made huge strides to get ready but we were always clear that there would be some disruption at the end of the transition period.“Although many businesses have moved goods successfully since January , we are aware of some issues, and are providing guidance and support.“Hauliers can use our ‘Check a HGV is ready’ service to make sure they have correct paperwork, and must obtain a Kent Access Permitthey plan to travel via Dover or Eurotunnel.”PAMost ReadTributes to Ballymena man Alan Henry who died days after we shared emotional plea to take Covid- seriouslyCoronavirus: NI may neverto normality despite success of vaccine, warns Professor YoungDUP#s Paisley defends Donald Trump in wake of US Capitol riotsCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Theatre capacity to be allocated to those most in need as  deaths and , new cases reportedNI#s new Covid lockdown explained: More cops on the streets, the #reasonable excuses# needed for being out and what shops are open Latest Northern IrelandPrivate hospital in Belfast steps in after NHS operations are cancelledInternational arrivals into NI will have to prove they Covid- are virus-freePoots in storm as Gove warns border chaos will get worseMan shot in leg in suspected paramilitary attackMan shot in leg in second paramilitary-style attack this week in DerryLatest from Belfast Snow and ice set to hit UK over bitterly cold weekendNuno Espirito Santo calls on Wolves players to be more clinical in front of goalJurgen Klopp relieved to progress after Liverpool preparations ‘went in the bin’Damien Duff steps down from Republic of Ireland coaching roleFrank Lampard not expecting any player power problems despite Cha struggles,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

trading update, chief executive Steve Rowe explained how the sweets are a typical example of the problems facing retailers, as several report dficulties with new red tape.But the problem is not confined to Percy Pigs and other retailers are already reporting struggles in understanding the new rules.Mr Rowe said: “Essentially, there is about a third of the product in our food business that is

Percy Pig is actually manufactured in Germany, andit comes to the UK and we then send it to Ireland, in theory, he would have some tax on it.“So we’ve got a lot to do in terms of composition and rerouting, but it’s really important that we continue to be focused on trading the business.“And, at the moment, making sure we’ve got constant continuity of supply in our Irish business.”The British Retail Consortiumsaid that “at least ” of its members face potential tarfs for re-exporting goods following the agreement of the Trade and Co-operation Agreement .“We appreciate that the rules of origin in the TCA were designed to be facilitative on trade in goods, but we need a solution which genuinely reflects the needs of UK-EU supply and distribution chains for goods,” said William Bain, trade policy adviser at the BRC.“We are working with members on short-term options and are seeking dialogue with the Government and the EU on longer-term solutions to mitigate the effects of new

at Rosslare Europort in Co Wexford, Ireland Following the agreement of the withdrawal deal, a raft of retailers including John Lewis and TKMaxx suspended deliveries into Northern Ireland amid uncertainty over new Irish Sea trading arrangements.To try and combat the envisaged problems, MS launched a new distribution centre in Motherwell exclusively to deal with supplying products to the island of Ireland, rather than from a warehouse that previously supplied Ireland and Britain.But eight days into the new arrangements between the EU and UK, the centre is said to be struggling to cope with the new rules.One problem for MS is that many of its products sold in Ireland, like Percy Pigs, are sourced to the UK before being shipped out.However, EU rules say “point of origin” must be declared on products going into member states.Percy Pigs may find a workaround over time, but, bigger concerns will be with MS’s myriad of ready meals or prepared dishes, which tend to have a long list of ingredients from around the world.Meats, dairy and vegetables point of origin must be declared, meaning butter in one dish must be accounted for from one country, alongside a separate form for the meat and another for the vegetables, eventhey are all in the same ready meal.PAMost ReadTributes to Ballymena man Alan Henry who died days after we shared emotional plea to take Covid-

Those working in libraries, education and community arts also received recognition. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ldquoIn a year when so many have made sacrices to protect our NHS and save peoplersquos lives, the outstanding efforts of those receiving honours are a welcome reminder of the strength of human spirit and of what can be achieved through courage and compassion. The  New Year Honours offer us an opportunity to salute their dedication and recognise many who have gone above and beyond in their contribution to our country.

Once I was allowed to talk about it, the first thing I said was how fortunate I was to work with this team. ldquo was dficult professionally. Personally, I had many successes. It was a double-edged sword. The MBE is recognition for the enormous effort everyone has made to get us through the first wave. I hope we have similar success again.The Royal Gwent Hospital critical care consultant, recognised for exceptional service to the NHS, spearheaded Welsh Critical Care Network response during the pandemic, rapidly disseminating information on lessons learnt via traditional and social media s.

Both Deery and McCann ed to the Brandywell when Devine was appointed manager for a second time at the conclusion of the  season following the departure of Kenny Shiels. The club have refused to confirm the departures although it is believed that the pair were informed of the decision a number of weeks ago. In their absence, Mark McChrystal, who is part of the underage coaching set-up at the club, could well be in line to move up to the first team coaching  this coming season. googletag.cmd.push Meanwhile, Scottish defender Darren Cole has signed a new deal with the club to extend his stay at the Brandywell. Cole, signed by Shiels back in , has made  appearances and scored  goals for the club and has now agreed to stay for his fth season on Foyleside.

Michael OKane took on the role at St Colmcilles Primary School in Claudy after Easter this year, with schools already closed by the first Covid- lockdown. He was nominated for the award by parent Fiona Garrett, who told presenter Stephen Nolan that Mr OKane had helped her children with two particularly tricky transitions. “My son Matthew was transitioning from P to big school and my daughter Oacuterlagh-Janetransitioning from nursery to P,” she said. “My daughter has a statement of special educational needs. During lockdown, she became very distressed at the sudden change of routine and Mr OKane really helped with this. googletag.cmd.push “He did this by doing videos to show her where her new classroom was going to be, what it would look like, who her new classroom assistant was going to be and how to sanitise your hands properly. “He also helped my son with the P leaving transition. My son started becoming distressed at not seeing his friends and the fact they wouldnt get a last opportunity to all be together. “Mr OKane arranged a wonderful Year  leaving mass, where he shot a beautul photo and video of the group together with his drone. “Matthews short, but positive experience of Mr OKane actually inspired him to want to become a teacher now.” googletag.cmd.push Miss Garrett said Mr OKane had gone beyond the call of duty to make sure parents were looked after too, and said he was a special person. “He is so good with children who have special educational needs. He goes above and beyond, going that extra little step just to make everything run smoothly. That takes a special person,” she said. “He goes out of his way to be so approachable and friendly. “Hes in the thick of it with the children, showing them how to use their talents and getting the best out of everyone, including his staff. “He really cares for his school family. Absolutely anything is possible with the right support and Im so grateful.”     Michael admitted it was a shock to receive a call from Stephen Nolan, initially askinganything was wrong, but he regained his composure to pay tribute to the schools staff. “I only started here at Easter and I inherited a fantastic school with fantastic staff and I dont think Ive done too much myself – everybody in the school has really pulled together,” he said. “Im just looking out the window here on a dreary Monday morning and thats the sort of thing we need to hear. Im in shock here, but Id just like to thank the staff, and in particular Fionas childrens teachers. “Theres a fantastic team in Year  who made children feel comfortable in coming back to school. “Its been tough, but everybody has gone above and beyond from teachers, classroom assistants, our building supervisors and cleaners. “Im going to relay this to all the staff because it will lt everybodys spirits,” he added.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I was fully booked and had to turn people away, and people have rebooked, so that means a lot,” she told the County Derry Post. “I didnt really know what I wanted to do until I left school, but I always knew I wanted to work with animals. “I wanted to be a vet, but after a bit of work experience I changed my mind!” googletag.cmd.push Clionas mum Joanne has supported her throughout her move into dog grooming, and said the former St Patricks College, Maghera student had an early introduction to animals. “There have always been animals around her,” she said. “Shes had dogs all her le and used to do horse riding lessons at Laura Browns in Magherafelt. When she was two and a half she asked Santa for a moo, neigh and a quack! “Her uncle built her a stable and Santa brought her a first Shetland pony when she was two and a half.” Dogs have always been part of Clionas le. After leaving school, Cliona completed a Diploma at Wizards of Dogs in Cookstown, where the experience was immersive. googletag.cmd.push “When I was training,a dog comes in that was biting or anything, we had to do it ourselves, to help us learn how to cope when we qualy,” she told the County Derry Post. “That prepared me for going out on my own when you get dogs like that you know how to deal with it. You just try your best to work with them and find a way that works better than what youve tried. “I couldnt have done it without the Wizard of Dogs, Ive learned so much. You do your first aid and start off grooming two dogs a day.     “By the end it was loads more, and I covered all the dferent cuts, so I got plenty of experience there,” she added. While dog groomers have been able to remain open throughout the latest raft of Covid- restrictions, Clionas sister, Nicole, hasnt been so lucky. “Her sister has a salon in Maghera and we were laughing that Cliona has only started and she can stay open whereas Nicole has to close,” explained Joanne. “We could maybe get her an odd dog to bath.” You can follow Fairy Tail Dog Grooming by visiting their Facebook and Instagram pages.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Derry City and Strabane District Council is now looking to set up the new  to ask their opinion on the design quality of any planning applications which are made for these sites. One of the sites expected to be discussed is the derelict site of the former Tillie and Henderson shirt factory at the cityside end of the Craigavon Bridge. googletag.cmd.push It emerged recently that the current owner of the site is to apply for planning permission to build an apartment complex on the land. Speaking at a meeting yesterday of the local councils Planning Committee, Eamon Molloy, the councils Head of Planning Performance and Improvement, outlined the proposal for the new advisory . He said the creation of such  had been put forward as part of a review of the Planning Service. Mr Molloy said the  would offer advice to councillors on important gateway sites in the council area.

He said he would bring a report on the matter to next months meeting of the Planning Committee. There has been much debate in recent years about the development of gateway sites in Derry. The Tillie and Henderson site, in particular, has been at the forefront of the discussions. The site has been unused since the derelict factory building was destroyed in a fire in . The owners of the site, Belfast-based Andras House, had originally planned to build a hotel on the site.     However, those plans never came to fruition and it emerged last month that Andras House has now teamed up with local developers, the Martin Property Group, to build an apartment complex on the site. Director of Andras House, Rajesh Rana, said a residential development is the most appropriate use that can be delivered at this time. Just across the road from the Tillie and Henderson site is another derelict piece of land which was also previously home to a shirt factory. This would also be regarded as a gateway site in Derry.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Caitlin Kelly, from Bellaghy, decided to take on the run to raise funds for the Magherafelt Adult Centre, where her uncle Gerard attended for over  years until his death last year. The centre provides day care for adults who have been assessed as having a learning disability, and Caitlin said she wanted to show her gratitude. “He loved it and they loved him,” she told Derry Now. “He spent most of his time there and they really looked after him, especially in the latter years, because he developed dementia and had more dficulties than he had previously. googletag.cmd.push  “They couldnt have done enough for him and I wanted to show recognition of that by raising some money for them. They work really hard. “They had so much time for him and we are so grateful he had that to go to every day. Other than seeing his family, he wouldnt really have seen anyone . “Its where he was stimulated and able to learn and develop.” Gerard was one of ten Devlin siblings, and made sure he shared his considerable love equally among them. “He was the centre of everybodys lives. They were just mad about him,” said Caitlin. googletag.cmd.push “There were nine brothers and sisters and he would have gone round each house and made time for everybody. “He was such good craic. During the lockdown, we only got to see him through the window or in gardens, but we were so glad to have him in our lives for so long. “When he turned  in April, during lockdown, we were able to have a wee Zoom birthday party for him.” It was a signicant birthday of her own that prompted Caitlin, whose beauty salon is currently closed due to Covid restrictions, to take on this fundraising challenge. “I turned  on New Years Eve, so I wanted to do a wee fundraiser, especially now because Im off. I thought I could challenge myself and raise money at the same time,” she said.     “Ive been running and walking it. Id planned on running most of it but the roads have been that bad I havent been able to run as much as I liked. “I started running during the first lockdown, back in March. I generally would just go to the gym but this was a challenge for me now to do it. “I love where I live we have such lovely scenery and thank God for the weather as well. Apart from the icy conditions, it hasnt rained, so its helped for seeing the views.” Caitlin has been braving the icy pavements to raise the funds. Since launching the fundraiser, Caitlin has surpassed her initial pound target with ease and has already amassed almost pound, for the Magherafelt Adult Centre. She said the huge generosity was testament not only to how loved her uncle was loved, but to how he himself interacted with others. “The Devlin family are so well known and because its so personal to the Magherafelt Adult Centre as well, people want to help out,” she said. “He was really well known too. He had a big smile for everybody and shook hands with everybody he met.” Caitlin will complete her K with a final run on Sunday, January , and you can donate to her fundraiser by visiting her Go Fund Me page - K for Uncle Gerard .  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It started off with the sporting fields thronged with activity, hopes and dreams. Until Covid- reached into our communities and pushed the pause button on everything. Sporting activity ed in a format nobody really recognised, before we were forced into a cycle of close, open, close, open...until we put up the Christmas stocking, sat down – inside our bubbles - and fogged mountains of turkey and champ into ourselves. One great positive of the lockdown was nostalgia and how we were able to revisit the past. Through the eyes of former players and managers, we lted the lid on their journey. Both in print and via the broadcast media, the heroes and heroines of yesterday became icons again. A reminder of where we came from and the importance of sport. googletag.cmd.push It gave them an identity and got the tongues wagging again. A is for attacking mark. Christy Young will be remembered as the first in the Derry championships. Lets hope someone in authority makes a move to bin it. It offers nothing but more hassle for overworked referees, cheap scores and shafts defenders. B is for break. The water break that was brought into our games is now a coaching break and a momentum changer. If your team is struggling, it is a Godsend, whereasyou are on a roll its as useful as an ashtray on a motorbike. Surely water bottles, clearly marked, can be laid at points behind the goals and along the sidelines for players to grab during a break in play. googletag.cmd.push C is for classic. One of the joys of this season was being present in Paacuteirc Esler in January to witness Slaughtneils All-Ireland hurling clash with Ballyhale. It is the best game, by far, that I have had the pleasure of reporting on. It had absolutely everything. Atmosphere. Passion. Skill. And entertainment by the lorry load. It was one of those days that makes sport so worthwhile. D is for Desertmartin. With the fruits of their underage coaching paying off, they made it through to the U and minor finals, on top of their seniors qualying for the junior decider with Craigbane. Then, with the second lockdown, all three games were put on the back burner. A season that couldve been the springboard for future progress was soon one of frustration.     E is for equality. One thing that  has given us, is the split season and the chance for club and county to be given an equal slice of the pie. Players know where they stand and managers can plan accordingly. If it can eradicate the lazy Derry suffer because of club rivalry myth, it will go a long way to getting Oakleaf county teams climbing back to the top. And it gives more media attention to the club game. In an interview before Christmas, Derry dual player Aine McAllister was hoping for a split season to allow her to play both football and camogie for Derry. F is for Faughanvale. After an entertaining clash with Limavady, they won a second intermediate ladies title in three seasons, thanks to Ellie McCaffreys clinching goal. Steelstown took the senior title with victory over Ballymaguigan. Coleraine were junior champions after their victory over Ballerin. G is for game...or in this case, more than a game. Local soccer club Draperstown Celtic continued to offer a sporting outlet to the youth of Ballinascreen and beyond. Its their insistence on all players getting their chance to shine – including their girls diamonds team – that deserves much credit. There is also their link with local mental health group STEPS, helping to reach out to the person inside the player. Their grassroots football club of the year award was well-deserved. H is for Hugh. In August this year, the Ballinascreen and Derry sporting community was rocked by the death of Hugh McWilliams. Derry GAA Chairman Stephen Barker said Hugh was a giant of generosity. He was Managing Director of HA Mechanical Services, who sponsored all Derry and Ballinascreen teams. I is for internet streaming. With restricted access to games, Derry GAA streamed a chunk of their games live, with the rest uploaded by midweek for subscribers to view. It raked in poundk to the Owenbeg coffers and offered those at home and overseas the chance to watch from the sofa. Alan Gunns commentary was a testament to his research and attention to detail. Along with a host of guests, the Derry PR team delivered a great service. J is for Josh. Following in Callum Devines footsteps, Kilreas Josh McErlean kept the local theme on the Irish motorsport front. McErlean was named as Irish Young Driver of the Year and recently made his mark on the international scene and made his World Rally Championship debut at Monza in December. K is for Kilrea – When you talk about reaching something into the pockets of the local community, Kilreas input was unrivalled. The GAA club clubbed together to raise poundk Chest, Heart and Stroke from a -hour relay. Then, when FIFA came calling with a pound, fine on Kilrea United, the community had it paid off inside  hours via a crowdfunding page, with the surplus used to buy kits for the local primary schools. L is for Lavey minors. After winning the Derry hurling and football championships in , they conquered Ulster last Christmas and carried on there they left off to defend their football title, but were denied a chance for another tilt at Ulster. With flawless ball retention and a maturity beyond their years, they have a bright future. M is for marathon. With a time of :., local athletics icon Tommy Hughes and his son Eoin officially became the fastest father and son marathon running duo in the world at the Frankfurt marathon. If that wasnt enough, Tommy smashed the world Over-s record at the Danny McDaid km event in Letterkenny. N is for needy. The local sporting clubs excelled this year in helping those stranded at home, in need of the essentials. They simply cant get enough praise. There was a great photo doing the rounds on social media of Ballyronan Marina centre, laid out with foot parcels as Loup delivered to the needy. Their neighbours in Ballymaguigan did something similar and it prompted one of the clubs senior citizens to write a letter of kindness to the committee, saying it was more important than any trophy. O is for Oz. Conor Glass made hisfrom a five-year career in Australia with AFL side Hawthorn and has made his debut for Derry already. He needs time to grow into the game before hopefully becoming a leader in the countys future. On the flipside, Callum Brown and Anton Tohill signed one-year deals with GWS Giants and Collingwood respectively. P is for Paddys Day. Once the year trickled into March, our sporting calendar shuddered to a halt, just as St Patricks Maghera and St Pius Magherafelt booked their places in the showpiece MacRory MacLarnon Final double header. The excitement in the schools was electric, as the players looked forward to one of the best days of their lives, only for all be pulled from their grasp. Being awarded their joint titles later in the year was a tiny consolation. Q is for quiz. With the social scene virtually non-existent,  became the year of the online quiz. We were lucky to have Joe McCloskey compiling an hour of goodness every week. Glen forward Paul Gunning, with help from his father and former Derry PRO Sean, ran online quizzes to engage club members. I am sure there were other clubs reaching out to their members in similar fashion. By the sound of recent Covid figures, we could be back to the video-conferencing mode of entertainment. R is for Rogers. It seems like ages ago when St Johns Swatragh boxer Paddy Rogers defeated Newrys Dennis Boriskins to become the Ulster Elite champion in Belfasts Ulster Hall. The affable Paddy joined his brother, Slaughtneil dual player Brendan, in the Ulster champion category, but joked that he didnt have an entire team to help him. Paddy was a very popular champion. S is for sin-bin. The black card forces a team to play with a player less for  minutes. It can lead to a tactical move, where teams can take the sting out of a game and leave it fragmented until they are back to the full . A better solution would be a  metre free regardless of where the cynical play took place. It would make teams think twice and clean the game up as a whole. T is for treble. After looking on from the outside, Slaughtneil senior footballers had their hands on the John McLaughlin Cup and took their tally of Derry championships to six. It sealed the treble. Just  hours earlier – with the hurling already won in September - the clubs camogs retained the Martin Mulholland Cup to secure another treble. U is for underage structures. Following a ruling that slipped through unchallenged to Croke Park, clubs all over Ireland have been told they must organise their teams in U, U and U gradings. And with it comes the huge void from the undeveloped underage player until the senior ranks and the physical challenges it will bring. V is for virus...and for vaccine. Covid- came along and robbed us of any degree of a normal le, tore our sporting landscape to pieces and left us going around in circles to stamp it out. Hopefully the vaccine will help  take a more familiar shape. W is for wheelie bin. There wasnt a home in the country that didnt have balls peppering towards them. Dungiven U player Ryan Moore was the king. Bouncing on a trampoline, he performed a backflip, with the ball between his legs before releasing it into the wheelie bin. Take a bow Ryan. There was also the example of McNicholl family of Glenullin, taking videos of three generations playing hurling camogie, before knitting it all into one nty movie. A lovely touch. X is for x-factor...well, this is close enough. What a year it was for county Derry. Dara McNicholl was wowing viewers on The Voice Kids. If that wasnt enough, Johnny Brooks and Brooke Scullion also took the Saturday night entertainment by storm, getting all the way to final of The Voice. They have all played on the sporting fields of Derry and it was amazing to see them put the county on the map. Brilliant. Y is for yelling. Once crowds began toto games, worryingly in more numbers than permitted, so too did the vitriol being yelled over the fence. The time away from sport didnt make one iota of dference to the level of respect on show. It was open season again, with referees, players and mentors labelled as fair game for those who paid their money to watch. Z is for Zoom. This time last year, we thought it was something you did in a car or on a camera. Now, its in every facet of our working and personal lives. And sport is no dferent. It became a tool for club AGMs, meetings and training sessions. Sideline View would like to wish all our readers, advertisers and contributors a happy new year. Lets hope we can kick Covid into touch and get back to thriving sporting arenas across Derry and beyond.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It started off with the sporting fields thronged with activity, hopes and dreams. Until Covid- reached into our communities and pushed the pause button on everything. Sporting activity ed in a format nobody really recognised, before we were forced into a cycle of close, open, close, open...until we put up the Christmas stocking, sat down – inside our bubbles - and fogged mountains of turkey and champ into ourselves. One great positive of the lockdown was nostalgia and how we were able to revisit the past. Through the eyes of former players and managers, we lted the lid on their journey. Both in print and via the broadcast media, the heroes and heroines of yesterday became icons again. A reminder of where we came from and the importance of sport. googletag.cmd.push It gave them an identity and got the tongues wagging again. A is for attacking mark. Christy Young will be remembered as the first in the Derry championships. Lets hope someone in authority makes a move to bin it. It offers nothing but more hassle for overworked referees, cheap scores and shafts defenders. B is for break. The water break that was brought into our games is now a coaching break and a momentum changer. If your team is struggling, it is a Godsend, whereasyou are on a roll its as useful as an ashtray on a motorbike. Surely water bottles, clearly marked, can be laid at points behind the goals and along the sidelines for players to grab during a break in play. googletag.cmd.push C is for classic. One of the joys of this season was being present in Paacuteirc Esler in January to witness Slaughtneils All-Ireland hurling clash with Ballyhale. It is the best game, by far, that I have had the pleasure of reporting on. It had absolutely everything. Atmosphere. Passion. Skill. And entertainment by the lorry load. It was one of those days that makes sport so worthwhile. D is for Desertmartin. With the fruits of their underage coaching paying off, they made it through to the U and minor finals, on top of their seniors qualying for the junior decider with Craigbane. Then, with the second lockdown, all three games were put on the back burner. A season that couldve been the springboard for future progress was soon one of frustration.     E is for equality. One thing that  has given us, is the split season and the chance for club and county to be given an equal slice of the pie. Players know where they stand and managers can plan accordingly. If it can eradicate the lazy Derry suffer because of club rivalry myth, it will go a long way to getting Oakleaf county teams climbing back to the top. And it gives more media attention to the club game. In an interview before Christmas, Derry dual player Aine McAllister was hoping for a split season to allow her to play both football and camogie for Derry. F is for Faughanvale. After an entertaining clash with Limavady, they won a second intermediate ladies title in three seasons, thanks to Ellie McCaffreys clinching goal. Steelstown took the senior title with victory over Ballymaguigan. Coleraine were junior champions after their victory over Ballerin. G is for game...or in this case, more than a game. Local soccer club Draperstown Celtic continued to offer a sporting outlet to the youth of Ballinascreen and beyond. Its their insistence on all players getting their chance to shine – including their girls diamonds team – that deserves much credit. There is also their link with local mental health group STEPS, helping to reach out to the person inside the player. Their grassroots football club of the year award was well-deserved. H is for Hugh. In August this year, the Ballinascreen and Derry sporting community was rocked by the death of Hugh McWilliams. Derry GAA Chairman Stephen Barker said Hugh was a giant of generosity. He was Managing Director of HA Mechanical Services, who sponsored all Derry and Ballinascreen teams. I is for internet streaming. With restricted access to games, Derry GAA streamed a chunk of their games live, with the rest uploaded by midweek for subscribers to view. It raked in poundk to the Owenbeg coffers and offered those at home and overseas the chance to watch from the sofa. Alan Gunns commentary was a testament to his research and attention to detail. Along with a host of guests, the Derry PR team delivered a great service. J is for Josh. Following in Callum Devines footsteps, Kilreas Josh McErlean kept the local theme on the Irish motorsport front. McErlean was named as Irish Young Driver of the Year and recently made his mark on the international scene and made his World Rally Championship debut at Monza in December. K is for Kilrea – When you talk about reaching something into the pockets of the local community, Kilreas input was unrivalled. The GAA club clubbed together to raise poundk Chest, Heart and Stroke from a -hour relay. Then, when FIFA came calling with a pound, fine on Kilrea United, the community had it paid off inside  hours via a crowdfunding page, with the surplus used to buy kits for the local primary schools. L is for Lavey minors. After winning the Derry hurling and football championships in , they conquered Ulster last Christmas and carried on there they left off to defend their football title, but were denied a chance for another tilt at Ulster. With flawless ball retention and a maturity beyond their years, they have a bright future. M is for marathon. With a time of :., local athletics icon Tommy Hughes and his son Eoin officially became the fastest father and son marathon running duo in the world at the Frankfurt marathon. If that wasnt enough, Tommy smashed the world Over-s record at the Danny McDaid km event in Letterkenny. N is for needy. The local sporting clubs excelled this year in helping those stranded at home, in need of the essentials. They simply cant get enough praise. There was a great photo doing the rounds on social media of Ballyronan Marina centre, laid out with foot parcels as Loup delivered to the needy. Their neighbours in Ballymaguigan did something similar and it prompted one of the clubs senior citizens to write a letter of kindness to the committee, saying it was more important than any trophy. O is for Oz. Conor Glass made hisfrom a five-year career in Australia with AFL side Hawthorn and has made his debut for Derry already. He needs time to grow into the game before hopefully becoming a leader in the countys future. On the flipside, Callum Brown and Anton Tohill signed one-year deals with GWS Giants and Collingwood respectively. P is for Paddys Day. Once the year trickled into March, our sporting calendar shuddered to a halt, just as St Patricks Maghera and St Pius Magherafelt booked their places in the showpiece MacRory MacLarnon Final double header. The excitement in the schools was electric, as the players looked forward to one of the best days of their lives, only for all be pulled from their grasp. Being awarded their joint titles later in the year was a tiny consolation. Q is for quiz. With the social scene virtually non-existent,  became the year of the online quiz. We were lucky to have Joe McCloskey compiling an hour of goodness every week. Glen forward Paul Gunning, with help from his father and former Derry PRO Sean, ran online quizzes to engage club members. I am sure there were other clubs reaching out to their members in similar fashion. By the sound of recent Covid figures, we could be back to the video-conferencing mode of entertainment. R is for Rogers. It seems like ages ago when St Johns Swatragh boxer Paddy Rogers defeated Newrys Dennis Boriskins to become the Ulster Elite champion in Belfasts Ulster Hall. The affable Paddy joined his brother, Slaughtneil dual player Brendan, in the Ulster champion category, but joked that he didnt have an entire team to help him. Paddy was a very popular champion. S is for sin-bin. The black card forces a team to play with a player less for  minutes. It can lead to a tactical move, where teams can take the sting out of a game and leave it fragmented until they are back to the full . A better solution would be a  metre free regardless of where the cynical play took place. It would make teams think twice and clean the game up as a whole. T is for treble. After looking on from the outside, Slaughtneil senior footballers had their hands on the John McLaughlin Cup and took their tally of Derry championships to six. It sealed the treble. Just  hours earlier – with the hurling already won in September - the clubs camogs retained the Martin Mulholland Cup to secure another treble. U is for underage structures. Following a ruling that slipped through unchallenged to Croke Park, clubs all over Ireland have been told they must organise their teams in U, U and U gradings. And with it comes the huge void from the undeveloped underage player until the senior ranks and the physical challenges it will bring. V is for virus...and for vaccine. Covid- came along and robbed us of any degree of a normal le, tore our sporting landscape to pieces and left us going around in circles to stamp it out. Hopefully the vaccine will help  take a more familiar shape. W is for wheelie bin. There wasnt a home in the country that didnt have balls peppering towards them. Dungiven U player Ryan Moore was the king. Bouncing on a trampoline, he performed a backflip, with the ball between his legs before releasing it into the wheelie bin. Take a bow Ryan. There was also the example of McNicholl family of Glenullin, taking videos of three generations playing hurling camogie, before knitting it all into one nty movie. A lovely touch. X is for x-factor...well, this is close enough. What a year it was for county Derry. Dara McNicholl was wowing viewers on The Voice Kids. If that wasnt enough, Johnny Brooks and Brooke Scullion also took the Saturday night entertainment by storm, getting all the way to final of The Voice. They have all played on the sporting fields of Derry and it was amazing to see them put the county on the map. Brilliant. Y is for yelling. Once crowds began toto games, worryingly in more numbers than permitted, so too did the vitriol being yelled over the fence. The time away from sport didnt make one iota of dference to the level of respect on show. It was open season again, with referees, players and mentors labelled as fair game for those who paid their money to watch. Z is for Zoom. This time last year, we thought it was something you did in a car or on a camera. Now, its in every facet of our working and personal lives. And sport is no dferent. It became a tool for club AGMs, meetings and training sessions. Sideline View would like to wish all our readers, advertisers and contributors a happy new year. Lets hope we can kick Covid into touch and get back to thriving sporting arenas across Derry and beyond.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The -year-old met with City boss Declan Devine last weekend, and it seemed that a move to the Brandywell was on the cards, but he has opted to stay on at Finn Park. The winger appeared  times for Harps last season, scoring two goals. Speaking after the signing, the Kerry man told club media he was keen to repay the faith shown in him by the management team and help the club kick on “I enjoyed my time with Harps last season, there were a great bunch of players with a lot of togetherness in the group. I suppose a lot of us felt we probably underachieved last year with the team we had so hopefully we can manage to kick on again next year. googletag.cmd.push “Ollie and Paul took a chance on me last year and gave me an opportunity to play in the Premier Division again so I owe them a lot. Overall, the players, staff and everyone at the club make you feel very welcome and Im looking forward to pushing on again this year.” Ollie Horgan said: “Karl is a good lad with a lot of talent. He was unlucky with a couple of knocks last year that kept him out of a few games especially towards the end of the season. Hopefully now he can get a good preseason under him and that will set him up well for the year ahead.

I thought this group without doubt deserved more.

We want to be able to develop our coaching set-up, particularly in urban centres like Downpatrick, Newry, north Down, the Down parts of Belfast. Hopefully those opportunities will come up.Mr McAteer said the implementation of a Down training hub at Ballykinlar was a key aim when it comes to considering where spending will take place in Down GAA.ldquoThe development at Ballykinlar is a huge thing, both for Down and the community in Ballykinlar. That is one of the key fronts we are working on, he said.ldquoOf course though, we cannot take our eye of the importance of development in urban areas. We can see how much Dublin for example have benefited from utilising their urban areas, and the rewards they have reaped from that in recent years on the pitch, as well as financially.He did caution that, as ever, the availability of funding is major issue.ldquoThe GAA took a huge hit financially in  - that is likely to happen to some degree at least, again this year.ldquoIn terms of us here in Down though, we are in a stronger position to deal with the climate I would like to think, certainly when compared to other northern counties.ldquoWe have big urban centres which is vitally important. We can also explore the possibility of greater cross-border development with counties like Louth, and the use of the Dublin Institute of Technology. There is, going forward this year, a lot of potential for imaginative funding that we can use to our advantage here in Down.Another cornerstone of the approach to keeping Down GAA in good health is continuing to appeal to the younger generations coming through in the Mourne county.ldquoWe need to try to make Gaelic Games the number one sport of choice for young kids in Down, Mr McAteer said.ldquoIf you look at our record from July of  to the end of the year, we staged , games. A lot of those games were at an under-age level. Some clubs have got very very strong groups of kids at very young ages.ldquoWhat we need to do is to ensure that those young people who come into the GAA in Down at that stage stay with it into adulthood.ldquoOur games need to be attractive and innovative going forward.ldquoThat means we all need to keep pushing, keep the facilities as good as possible and promoting ourselves as well as we can..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th January 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Brexit deal is ‘best of both worlds’ for local fishermen  ","story":"THE Brexit fisheries deal with the European Union is good news for the Ardglass fishing industry.Thatrsquos the view of former fishermenrsquos leader Dick James, who says Ardglass and the other Co Down fishing ports can look to the future with confidence.Mr James, former chief executive of the Northern Ireland Fish Producersrsquo Organisation, says an increase in quotas for key catches will benefit fishermen.At the same time the non-imposition of tarfs on exported fish to EU markets, will underpin the future of the processing industry.Mr James that while some areas of the UK had done badly from the Brexit deal, local fishermen should be pleased with the outcome.ldquoThe deal is good news for our fishermen and should secure investment and new jobs in the industry, he said.In the Irish Sea the amount of herring which can be caught by UK fishermen will rise from the current figure of % to % in  and % in .In the crucial prawn sector, the UK quota for Area , which includes the Irish Sea, will go from % currently to % in  and % in .There will also be increases in the UK quotas for other types of fish, including haddock, cod and whiting.Mr James said: ldquoWe have got the best of both worlds. Our fishermen can land more fish and we can continue to trade with the Continent relatively unfettered.ldquoThis is particularly important when you consider that most of the prawns we catch locally are exported to Spain.Mr James said the deal has already boosted confidence. ldquoI know of one new boat coming to Ardglass and we are looking at another two, he said.ldquoThe increase in the herring quota secures the future of two herring processing factories in Ardglass and another in Kilkeel.ldquoThis deal guarantees the future of fishing in Ardglass and should encourage more local people to seek employment in the industry.Mr James said it would also add impetus to the campaign for improvements to the harbour in Ardglass.These include deepening the harbour, improving berthing and landing facilities and providing berthing pontoons for smaller vessels..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th January 2020 Call.jpg","title":"Calls on public to take coronavirus vaccine  ","story":"A KILLYLEAGH man has become one of the first student nurses in the UK to receive the Covid- vaccine.James Savage is now urging local people and fellow health professionals to take up the offer of the potentially le-saving jab as soon as itrsquos made available to them.The  year-old student nurse got his vaccine over the weekend while working part-time as a senior staff member at Ringdufferin Nursing Home near Killyleagh.The former Member of the UK Youth Parliamentfor Strangford, James has recently been elected to the Students Committee of the Royal College of Nursing.He represents the North West region as he attends Liverpool John Moores University where he hopes to qualy in a few years time as a mental health nurse.His call to encourage others to take up the vaccine also comes from his own experience of contacting the virus last March and his sadness over losing his grandmother to Covid- last April, as well as some patients.James, who has worked as a carer in nursing homes since he was , said: ldquoThe vaccine is the best hope for us to overcome challenges currently facing the country.ldquoIrsquove worked in a nursing home during a major outbreak here after which I volunteered as a student nurse to take up a post in the NHS working on the wards helping to care for mental health patients.ldquoDuring my time working in health care and as a student nurse over the last five years, I have had to face many challenges.

Patients in care homes have been severely affected from Covid- during the pandemic and residents and their staff were chosen by the government to be amongst the first to be vaccinated.He explained: ldquoWhen it came to my attention that I was one of the few student nurses to have received the vaccine at this stage so with my new role as a student ambassador I believed it was important to encourage all student nurses and all NHS workers and of course, all local people, to take up the opportunity to have the vaccine.ldquoThese vaccines are the best chance we have to tackle this pandemic head on. I have personally seen the dedication and strength of our NHS and health care staff across the country.ldquoTheir fortitude and courage have propped up the country in what are indeed dire times. The ability of the nursing profession to overcome adversity is truly great. I am truly thankful for those who cared for my grandmother.James, who often dresses up as Santa Claus at Christmas to brighten up the lives of the care home residents, highlighted the reliability of the vaccine.He said: ldquoThis vaccine has been approved by an independent body here in the UK along with many other countries and has been well tested at every stage.ldquoI have received the vaccine here in Northern Ireland and I feel % confident taking it, having my family take it and encouraging others to take it.ldquoIt will protect our most vulnerable and help our NHS to cope when it is so close to being overwhelmed.

Ellen had a close friendship group of about nine or ten girls who all grew up together and went on holidays together, she said.ldquoWhile the grief hit us all in dferent ways over the years, I was helped dealing with it as I had a lot of friends who were all going through the same thing as we all understood what we were going through.ldquoWe are a tight group of friends and now when we all come together itrsquos not about feeling sad about Ellen, itrsquos about look backing and being happy for her being there. Her father, Bartley, is happy that we have remembered Ellen in this way.Mairead, who now runs her own business, explained why she chose a mental health charity to support.ldquoI chose MYMY as itrsquos a brilliant local charity and while the fund-raising has taken off, it was more about raising awareness, she said.ldquoThere are a lot of people who suffer grief in silence. Ellen, of course, was still going through grief from the loss of her mother. There are people who can get up and get on with things but there are people, such as some of my friends, who did not cope so well, so MYMY provides services for people who are not coping ldquoWhile raising money was not the objective, the real reason was to get people out and about and moving in January as the month is grim enough, but even more so with the tight lockdown.ldquoI wanted it to be something that everybody could take part in, old or young people and you can run one day or walk the next.Cllr Laura Devlin, chairwoman of Newry, Mourne and Down Council, is just one of the local people taking part in the initiative.She said she was delighted to hear of Maireadrsquos challenge in memory of Ellen and her mother.ldquoEveryone locally knows the Finnegans and what a tragedy it was to lose two amazing people from our local community.ldquoThis challenge is great for a number of reasons.

Supermarkets have received a three-month grace period until April  meaning that there is not yet enforcement of that aspect of the new border.Rather, the problem is understood to be the complexity of customs declarations for every product crossing the Irish Sea, which has led to MS deciding that in the short term it is better to keep most of its more than , food products flowing by reducing the complexity of each load.Other supermarkets and food companies have seen entire lorry loads unable to make it through the new border this week.Earlier this week the News Letter revealed that Sainsbury’s has withdrawn hundreds of products from sale in Northern Ireland as a result of the Irish Sea border.However, while Sainsbury’s says that it hopes the decision is temporary, it appears to be more signicant than what MS has done because Sainsbury’s has signed a contract which will see Spar-branded products replacing many of the items no longer being sent across the Irish Sea until at least April.Read More Read MoreDays after Brexit, many products vanish from Sainsbury’s in Northern Ireland and...MS – which set up a new distribution centre to service its stores on both parts of the island of Ireland ahead of Brexit – emphasised that it is firmly committed to remaining in Northern Ireland.An MS spokesman said: “We have served customers in Northern Ireland for over  years and our priority is to make sure we continue to deliver the same choice and great quality range that our loyal customers have always enjoyed.“Stores have been receiving regular deliveries this week, however following the UK’s recent departure from the EU, we are transitioning to new processes and we’re working closely with our partners and suppliers to ensure customers can continue to enjoy a great range of products.”: Top customs expert admits: New Irish Sea border is ‘cumbersome’ and hugely complex – even for me, with  years experienceIrish Sea border which Secretary of State Brandon Lewis claims doesn’t exist empties shelves and ends business in Northern Ireland——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

We had to spend the night on sandbars where we took turns to keep watch, as the crocodiles were very keen to join us.Since he joined the crew, Mike has combined his volunteering with his paid job in the South Wales Fire and Rescue service. He joined the service back in , at just , and progressed from his position as a firefighter, to the lead instructor for recruit training, finally finishing his career in  as Chair of the Water Rescue group, and a member of the servicersquos all Wales flood response team.Over the past four decades, -year-old Mr Kingston has seen huge changes in the way the RNLI operates.He has seen Penarth leboat station move from its original home in the deck chair store underneath the current Coffi Co building on the Esplanade, to its current location just up the road in a purpose built, modern leboat station.ldquoIrsquom sure the people of Penarth will remember the hand held maroons that were fired off by a leboat crew member to call the rest of us to the station for a launch, he said.ldquoBut even before that, I remember when the Pier Master would get us down to the station by firing the maroons out of a small cannon.ldquoNowadays, technology has moved on and we use pagers, mobiles phones and computer systems to respond to a shout.ldquoThese systems are a lot more sophisticated, but itrsquos still the same feeling when yoursquore called out of bed in the early hours of a freezing cold January morning.ldquoNo matter how times have moved on, one thing that remains constant is the unbelievable commitment of the whole RNLI team.ldquoThere have been so many highs and lows over the past  years. As all the team will know, itrsquos good to feel that yoursquore part of a team, giving something to your community.ldquoBut there have also been some sad times when people have lost their lives. Irsquom proud to have been a part of Penarth RNLI family.Thanking him for his  years of service, Jason Dunlop, Penarth Leboat Operations Manager said: ldquoOn behalf of all at Penarth leboat station, I would like to congratulate Mike on this fantastic achievement and thank him for his commitment and support to saving lives at sea over the last  years. We are all volunteers at Penarth RNLI, we give our time freely to support our local community.ldquoMikersquos contribution to the charity over the years has not only been volunteering his time, hersquos also been happy to share his wealth of experience with the crew as we train and work together when someone needs our help. Hersquos been a fantastic mentor to many and for that we thank him. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We can no longer be complacent.We know from the first and second waves that as case numbers increase, more people get seriously unwell, and we will inevitably see more deaths from Coronavirus - many of which can be avoided,we act now.We are deeply concerned that hospitals and primary care services across Cardf and the Vale of Glamorgan are now under unsustainable pressure due to COVID-, and sadly, but inevitably, the number of people who are becoming very sick is increasing daily.Each and every one of us has a responsibility to act now. We must all follow Welsh Government coronavirus regulations, butyou can also take further actions to protect those you love, then we urge you to do so.We should not meet with anyone outside our household bubble and keep contact with people outside our household to an absolute minimum until the current threat has passed, but especially in the run-up to Christmas.We know that staying away from loved ones will be painful for many, especially at this time of year, butwe do this now, we will be doing everything we can to protect our family and friends for the months to come.We know many people think that the vaccine is going to become more widely available, so everything is going to be okay. Regrettably, that is simply not the case. If we donrsquot change our behaviour now,many people will die before the vaccine is rolled out, people who donrsquot need to die, possibly people who you know.The full roll out of the vaccine will take many months, so now is not the time to be complacent. Very few of us are immune and the virus is still prevalent in our communities and our hospitals. By practising social distancing, washing our hands regularly and wearing face coverings we will all be doing our bit to help.So, our message is simple.Wash your hands regularly oryou canrsquot do that use sanitiser hand gel.Please try and stay at home and only go out for essential reasons andit is essential to go out, please do so in quieter periods.If you do go out, wear a mask when required and keep socially distanced by at least  metres, wherever possible.Please do not mix with other households or your friends.Work from home,you can do so.If you develop symptoms such as a new and continuous cough, a temperature, or a loss of taste or smell please self-isolate with your household and arrange a test.These small steps can really help us all to keep our communities safe.As a Health Board and Council, we are fully mobilised in the fight against COVID-. Doing so continues to be a huge challenge and is one that we will best achieve,we do it together, just as we did in the Spring.We are asking every one of you to achieve this challenge together.Letrsquos stop the spread, and letrsquos keep the Vale of Glamorgan, the NHS and our loved ones safe.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Hospitality businesses would have joined them on pm Christmas Day, with a level four lockdown coming into place on Monday, December . The five day lsquorelaxationrsquo period would have still been in place according to these rules, but a change from three households mixing to two.But on Saturday, December , all this changed as prime minister Boris Johnson held a press conference to update the UK on the rapid spread of the new strain of coronavirus and announcing that the South East of England, including London would be moved into tier four.Tier four means residents must stay at home with some limited exemptions ndash which includes workunable to do so from home, however, working from home is strongly advisedit is possible. Non-essential services must also close. People also must not enter or leave a tier four area.This also saw a change to Englandrsquos Christmas restrictions, with households banned from mixing, apart from single households, which would be allowed to form a bubble to avoid isolation.Areas in the lower tiers were still allowed to continue to mix with up to three households ndash however, only on Christmas Day.So, what did this announcement mean for Wales The announcement by the prime minister was focused specically on England, but it was followed by Walesrsquo first minister making an announcement of his own the same evening. He announced that the tier four lockdown would come into place from midnight on Saturday, December , meaning businesses had a matter of hours to come to terms with the news and people rushed out to do some last-minute Christmas shopping before all the non-essential retail closed.Some of the supermarkets across Wales have now taken their lsquonon-essentialrsquo items off sale.The festive period bubble rule has also changed, with a maximum of two households allowed to mix on Christmas Day.MORE NEWS:Mr Drakeford said in a statement on Saturday evening that the pattern of transmission in London and the South East of England, which is linked to the new iant of coronavirus, is ldquoremarkably consistent with the rapid acceleration of transmission in Wales in recent weeks.Also in the statement, the first minister said that latest evidence had suggested the new strain is present throughout Wales and that it needed an ldquoimmediate response.After meeting with the Welsh Governmentrsquos Cabinet on Saturday and taking into consideration advice from senior medical and scientic advisors, he said: ldquoThe situation is incredibly serious. I cannot overstate this.ldquoWe have therefore reached the dficult decision to bring forward the alert level four restrictions for Wales, in line with the action being taken in London and the South East of England.Dr Chris Williams, incident director for the Novel Coronavirusoutbreak at Public Health Wales said in a statement: ldquoAs indicated by the Welsh Government, the immediate introduction of new restrictions is related to the identication of a new more transmissible iant of Coronavirus. Public Health Wales has been working with UK partners to investigate and respond to this iant.ldquoIt is normal for viruses to undergo mutations, and we expect this to happen. Although the iant is easier to transmit, there is currently no evidence that it is more severe.ldquoWe are reminding people that all current guidance relating to Coronavirus continues to apply to the new iant, including advice relating to symptoms, social distancing, self-isolation, and vaccination.ldquoThe new iant shows up as positive in Public Health Walesrsquo existing Coronavirus tests, and people must continue to seek a test in the usual waythey develop Coronavirus symptoms.ldquoIf you or a member of your household develop a cough, fever or change in sense of taste or smell, you must self-isolate immediately and book a free Coronavirus test by calling .ldquoPublic Health Wales urges everyone to follow the rules, to avoid transmission of Coronavirus and to protect everyone in our communities, including the most vulnerable. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Across the Commonwealth, my family and I have been inspired by stories of people volunteering in their communities, helping those in need.ldquoIn the United Kingdom and around the world, people have risen magnicently to the challenges of the year, and I am so proud and moved by this quiet, indomitable spirit.

Not just from the virus but the isolation our response to it creates.So the Penarth Times will publish, online and in print, a list of support services - public organisations, charities, community groups and local volunteers - who are there to help in whatever way through this dficult time.And we are asking you to play your part by doing three things.First,you know an organisation or group that should be on our list, let us know and well add them so more people can benefit.If you know of a group doing good in your community, tell us so we can share their story and provide hope and inspiration.And, most importantly, think about who the people are in your community who you might be able to help, be it a card through the door or dropping off some shopping. In short, look out for each other.More NewsSecond coronavirus vaccine approved for use in the UKPenarth nativity delights audiences despite lockdown challengesFigures on police use of force and tasers on childrenThe campaign has been welcomed by Vale of Glamorgan Senedd member Jane Hutt said: \"The Penarth Times has continued to serve our community throughout the pandemic and I am pleased to support its Were in it Together campaign.\"Teams of volunteers, including family, friends and neighbours, have directly supported vulnerable members of our local community and I am pleased that the Penarth Times is highlighting these efforts and sharing offers of support.\"You can take share your suggestions or stories by emailing us at penarthtimes@penarthtimes or calling  .You can share ideas on social media too using #InItTogether. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Itrsquos dficult to maintain that motivation to keep going and keep balancing le with home-schooling.ldquoButitrsquos what we have to do then so be it. Itrsquos so important we protect the NHS.

She felt really ill on New Year’s Eve and she knew time was running out.“We got organised in two hours and married at pm.“She then fell asleep the same evening and never woke again.“She slipped away in her sleep,” said Lee.Writing on Facebook he revealed that the couple made the choice to bring their wedding forward.“She knew in herself that her time was getting shorter. We got married at home surrounded by close friends and family in a very intimate ceremony.“Jade passed away peacefully at home early on the nd of January with myself and Billyholding her hand. Our hearts are broken but at peace knowing Jade is no longer suffering,” wrote Lee, thanking everyone for their support.Before Christmas, Jade was not just planning her wedding but also her funeral.Lee said: “She has banned black from her funeral and she hates being the centre of attention,”Jade’s struggle started in November  with headaches and doctors said she had nasal polypsand gave her antibiotics.Later she was given an appointment with the ENT unit at Craigavon Hospital but the COVID- pandemic hit and all appointments were cancelled.Lee explained that she began to get very bad headaches and the polyps started to grow, so much so that her eyes were bulging from her head.After a CT scan in April last year, they diagnosed a tumour and Jade had an operation the following week.“About five weeks later the tumour came back and after a second operation they removed as much as they could.“She has had four blocks of chemotherapy, three times a week. “At the end of her chemo she started radiotherapy in September. She had to be kept in hospital for seven weeks and couldn’t see the boys.“She missed our six year old son’s birthday,” said Lee.“She finished that treatment on November  but we had to go back to Craigavon Hospital when she started to get extreme pain in her legs and couldn’t move.

As a result, Cllr Baxter’s proposal passed with  votes in favour, eight against and one abstention recorded.However, upon discussion of the committee meeting’s minutes at December’s meeting of full council, Councillor Liam Mackle proposed that Council did not accept the recommendation put forward by the committee.This proposal was seconded by his party colleague Councillor Paul Duffy.Councillor Pope said it “was very important” that the occasion is marked and noted the need for education and cultural events to be spread throughout the borough.He also expressed his concerns about budgets and the idea of a large event taking place giving the current pandemic.“I would propose we accept the original recommendationfrom the November committee that listed the programme, including the £, budget,” said Cllr Pope. This proposal was seconded by his party’s group leader, Councillor Eoin Tennyson.Speaking about the issue, Cllr Tennyson said the programme had been discussed atand explained, from his perspective, initialdiscussions were constructive.“All parties engaged with a view to marking the centenary in a way that was inclusive and respectful,” said Cllr Tennyson. “I think the original recommendation that was presented by officers to the committee was one that did that.“It would allow us to mark the centenary in a way that was inclusive and reflective of the entire borough and also balanced against the need to be prudent in terms of the financial situation we as a council and indeed many of our rate payers are in.“I can’t in good conscience support a proposal that would see this council commit to an additional £, unbudgeted spend. The reality is that money is going to have be found through the estimates process.“We could end up in the situation where that money will have to be found through a rates hike or cuts to services. I think Councillor Pope’s proposal is an eminently sensible one and I hope all parties can see it in themselves to support that approach.”DUP councillor Darryn Causby sought clarity on what was being proposed andthe proposals tabled complied with standing orders.“Under standing order .. there should only be one amendment moved and discussed at one time, the same applies for proposals on the floor,” said Cllr Causby.“There was one on the floor, Cllr Pope then put a second one on the floor but can I please get clarity on the first one [Cllr Mackle’s proposal] it seems to be a direct negative of what is in the papers and under standing orders I am not clear on whether that is acceptable.“The other point I would raise is the budget was actually agreed at the November council meeting and we just ratied that a short time ago.“If someone is not happy with that, I suggest they look through standing orders and bring a rescinding motion to change that decision.”At this point Council’s Lord Mayor, Councillor Kevin Savage informed members he needed to speak with Council’s Chief Executive Roger Wilson and muted his microphone.Following his confidential discussionwith Mr Wilson, the Lord Mayor confirmed the budget had already been agreed before putting Councillor Mackle’s proposal, to reject the recommendation put forward by the committee, to the floor.All unionist councillors present voted against the proposal as did the three members of the Alliance Party. The members of Sinn Fein and the SDLP voted in favour of the proposal.With the votes totalled, the proposal was defeated with  members voting against the proposal and  voting in favour.The Lord Mayor then explainedthat as the recommendation of the committee stands, a rescinding motion would be requiredbefore Cllr Tennyson’s proposal could be heard.Councillor Tennyson said he was not sure he agreed with this interpretation.“The proposal was that we proceed with the programme originallyproposed by officers not the budget,” said Cllr Tennyson.“The budget may have been agreed, the programme has never been agreed therefore a rescinding motion is not required.“We have proposed that we proceed with the originalprogramme as proposed to the economic development and regeneration committee, it just so happened to be at a cost of £,.“I would be quite keen for that to be voted on as I do not share the analysis that a rescinding motion is required for a decision that has never been taken.”Councillor Baxter then said that as a matter of process given that Cllr Mackle’s proposal has fallen by “default the recommendation goes through”.“I do note Alliance are quite clearly trying to claw back as they could not bring themselves to vote for the celebration of Northern Ireland at the last committee meeting,” said Cllr Baxter.“By the very fact Cllr Mackle’s proposal has failed this recommendation from the committee is going through.”The Lord Mayor said that was his understanding as well and the recommendation as it stands has now gone through.A proposal to accept the minutes of the committee was put forward by Councillor Brian Pope and seconded by SDLP group leader, Councillor Thomas O’Hanlon.Editor’s message:Thank you for reading this article.

This advice is consistent with advice that is in place for CEV people in England, Scotland and Wales. Whilst England has announced a formalto shielding, this is slightly dferent from the form of shielding that was introduced at the outset of the pandemic, with CEV people still being able to exercise outdoors. In practice, the advice in place in England mirrors the advice in Northern Ireland. The updated advice was placed online at nidirect at https:www.nidirect.gov.uk articles coronavirus-covid--guidance-clinically-extremely-vulnerable-and-vulnerable-people.  In addition, the Chief Medical Officer has written to all people who had previously been shielding to advise them of the change in advice re: attending work. The letter can be used as evidence for employers for evidence of entitlement to Statutory Sick Pay. Letters are in the process of being issued to patients via their GP or secondary care clinician as appropriate. Patients can use their old shielding letters as evidence in the meantimenecessary.  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_ceaccccb   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_becdbfdbbbbaa   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1610110925376.jpg--uk_approval_for_moderna_vaccine.jpg?161011092500","title":"uk approval for moderna vaccine ","story":"The Moderna coronavirus vaccine has been approved for use in the UK.
