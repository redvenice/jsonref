His other exes include American comic Sarah Silverman and actress Rachel McAdams.Others who have returned or rejected honours include John Lennon, who was awarded an MBE in 1965 but returned it in protest at Britain\u0027s foreign policy and the Vietnam War. Alan Bennett turned down a CBE in 1988 and rejected a knighthood in 1996 as it wouldn\u0027t \u0027suit\u0027 him.The actor\u0027s OBE decision was prompted by researching the history of his native Wales and its relationship with the British state for his 2017 Raymond Williams lecture.In the lecture he called for Welsh Independence, saying: \u0027Who speaks for Wales?Nobody\u0027, adding:  \u0027Wales has suffered and is suffering acute economic, political, and cultural strains, and by the fact of history has to try and resolve them in a world of crude power relationships and distant parliaments\u0027.He also said that Wales\u0027 history is 1,500 years of outside interference.\u0027It is the story of a nation that never was, struggling to be. The story of a people continually shocked and shaped and acted upon from outside.  \u0027From the Romans to the Anglo-Saxons to the Normans, they all came to fracture us, to control us, to subdue us. To bend us to their will. They built their roads, they built their walls, they built their castles.\u0027They changed our language, they changed our faith, they changed our sense of ourselves. And all the while, we tried to live in the shadow of their powers\u0027.  Michael Sheen has previously revealed his relationship with Sarah Silverman indirectly ended because of Brexit and Donald Trump\u0027s presidency.In the lecture he argued that Wales had voted to leave the EU because of a slanted view fed to them from England.He said: \u0027It was in the face of being disconnected from its own history, and denied opportunity to explore its own modern identity in the context of that history. The dragon had no voice so it spoke through the mouth of St George. \u0027When it comes to the Brexit vote - ‘For Wales - see England\u0027. That, infamously, was all that was written as the entry for Wales in the 1888 edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica. ‘For Wales - see England.’"},{"url":null,"title":"Hilaria blames decade long Spanish grift people misrepresenting me","story":"Share this articleHilaria Baldwin Talks Spain, Boston, Alec and Instagram - The New York Times"},{"url":null,"title":"Prince Harry Meghan Markles episode 30m podcast ranked whale noises","story":"Share this articleHarry and Meghan\u0027s £30million Archewell Audio podcast series beaten by show that sends people to sleep in Spotify charts"},{"url":null,"title":"Bulgaria uses hot dog trucks deliver Covid vaccines","story":"Share this articleCongressman-Elect From Louisiana Dies of Virus - The New York Times"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/985419beccc11cef173a4f833e0c3f5840372c50/0_120_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=1f589c9f57b31e43f88e17d8254e06c4","title":"aldi spend uk produced food drink","story":"More than 1,000 small firms in grocer’s supply chain expected to benefit from cash injectionAldi is boosting its support for British suppliers by announcing it aims to spend £3.5bn more on UK-produced food and drink annually within the next five years.In a move that will benefit more than 1,000 small businesses in its supply chain, the discount supermarket is also extending by a year to the end of 2021 an agreement to pay smaller suppliers without delay.The company has already announced it is investing £500m in new and upgraded stores, distribution centres and its supply chain in 2021, which will create more than 4,000 jobs. Aldi is Britain’s fifth largest supermarket with more than 900 stores and 36,000 employees.Giles Hurley, the chief executiveof Aldi UK, said: “We are expecting significant sales growth in 2021 as we open new stores and bring Aldi to more locations across the UK. With the vast majority of our grocery products now coming from British suppliers, our growth will lead to additional jobs and investment in our UK supply chain.”Aldi, which sources its core range of fresh meat, eggs, milk, butter and cream from British suppliers, said the new commitment would create opportunities for hundreds of UK-based food and drink producers.It singled out Manchester Drinks Company, whose partnership with Aldi began in 2015 to supply a range of gins and gin liqueurs. Its new site in Yorkshire employs 19 people.Richard Benjamin, a co-owner of Manchester Drinks Company, said: “Our new contract with Aldi is a fantastic opportunity to showcase our flavoured gins and liqueurs to shoppers across the country, and will help to provide stability for our business in an uncertain climate.”Aldi introduced the immediate payment terms for small suppliers at the start of the coronavirus crisis and will now continue until the end of next year. This means it will continue to process payments for suppliers with an annual turnover of less than £1m with Aldi as soon as they are submitted.Aldi announced in September that it planned to create another 4,000 jobs with the opening of 100 stores and the trial of a click and collect service as part of a big investment drive in the UK.The new jobs are in addition to 3,000 permanent roles it created this year after grocery sales surged during the pandemic. Its long-term target is to have 1,200 stores by 2025, including more than 100 upgrades."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a55254d37da4340e737662f6fe79b23393d7886/0_108_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cb8a4e6a4345383011699e2295b17975","title":"countrywide sale looms after 130m takeover offer is accepted","story":"Move brings together two of UK’s biggest estate agency groupsConnells has struck an agreed offer for Countryside, the owner of Hamptons International, after raising its bid to £130m, bringing together two of Britain’s biggest estate agency groups.The boards of Connells, which is part of Skipton building society, and Countrywide, the UK’s biggest listed estate agency group, said they had agreed terms of a recommended cash offer at 395p a share. Connells made an initial offer of 250p a share in early November and raised this to 325p a share a month later. The shares traded at 145p before the initial bid was made.The deal will bring together Countrywide’s 60 well-known high street brands, including Gascoigne-Pees, Bairstow Eves and King \u0026amp Chasemore, with Connells’ 25 brands – Allen \u0026amp Harris, Bagshaws Residential, Fox \u0026amp Sons, and Barnard Marcus in London. Countrywide has 651 branches, while the Connells group has 581.The takeover is backed by the majority of Countrywide’s shareholders and is a lifeline for the business, which has struggled under debts of £91.9m and has been closing branches after years of mounting losses. The deal is expected to complete in the first three months of 2021.It scuppers a rival move made by the UK private equity firm Alchemy, a Countrywide shareholder which proposed a £90m cash injection into the firm in October in return for a controlling stake, and had the support of Peter Long, Countrywide’s executive chairman. Long quit in late November after opposition from shareholders to the plan, and the former William Hill boss Philip Bowcock was appointed chief executive.Before Alchemy’s move, LSL Property Services, which owns Your Move, abandoned a planned all-share merger with Countrywide in March.All of Countrywide’s lenders will be repaid in full, said Connells, pledging to invest in the group’s technology and branch network to turn the business around. It said there would be some job losses as the two head offices in Leighton Buzzard and Milton Keynes were merged, but vowed to retain staff in the branches.The offer is far below Countrywide’s £750m valuation when it floated on the stock market in March 2013 amid a buoyant property market. The company amassed debts when it went on an acquisition spree in 2014 and 2015, buying up high street brands at a time when others invested in online estate agency services. Long blamed its woes on the “completely wrong” strategy pursued by the former chief executive Alison Platt, who sought to run the estate agent like a retailer from a central base, triggering an exodus of middle management.David Livesey, Connells’ chief executive, said: “We have the right management team, strategy and investment firepower to work with the talented teams at Countrywide and lead Countrywide into a bright future.”David Watson, the acting chairman of Countrywide, said: “Following a thorough evaluation of options and extensive consultation with the company’s major shareholders, we have been encouraged by their recognition of the need to put in place a sustainable capital structure and a willingness to support the company, which is a great business that has been constrained by too much debt.”The UK housing market has been surprisingly buoyant this year despite the Covid-19 pandemic. It ground to a halt for a few weeks during the first national lockdown but bounced back in the summer, helped by a stamp duty cut.Demand from buyers looking for bigger homes in leafy locations has surged as many office workers switched to working from home. But forecasters expect the market to cool next year, when the stamp duty cut expires, with unemployment expected to rise sharply."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7fa3c1ea38b933ed3dd6233a2d6120fb36939c99/0_36_7807_4686/master/7807.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=14693b4b80319b455a993939f063287a","title":"covid winners losers pay uk year in business","story":"From the decimation of several industries amid the Covid pandemic to the rise of Zoom, 2020 has been an unprecedented yearIt was an unprecedented year that none of us will forget. The coronavirus pandemic shook the world of business and economics to its core and continues to have profound, often unpredictable effects, some of them permanent. It hasn’t all been about Covid-19 though. 2020 also witnessed the usual corporate chicanery, deal-making and scandal. There were world-changing cultural and political moments, landmark departures and arrivals as well as, of course, some pocket-stretching pay packets. Here is a review of the year in business.The shift to buying goods and services online accelerated during the pandemic. Any company that could deliver essential goods to the door or provide digital services became instantly indispensable. Supermarkets moved quickly to increase online delivery slots, and took on thousands of extra workers to help meet the additional demand.Amazonwas a big beneficiary as non-essential shops were forced to close and people stayed at home. Skyrocketing demand helped its founder-boss, Jeff Bezos, increase his net worthby $13bn (£10bn) in a single day to take his personal wealth to an unprecedented $189bn.. His workers didn’t fare quite so well.It was an even better year than normal to be a multi-billionaire, in fact. Ten of them increased their combined wealth by $400bn.Increased hygiene protocols paid off for Dettol-maker Reckitt Benckiser, although it did have to warn people against ingesting its disinfectant to combat Covid-19 after the US president Donald Trump floated the idea.The video-conferencing service Zoom emerged from relative obscurity to become a household name valued at about $100bn. “You’re on mute!” became a pandemic catchphrase.Online gambling companies ended 2020 worth more than they were at the beginning of the year. After an initial hit caused by the suspension of sports, bored punters flocked to online poker, roulette and slot machines.Many homebuyers were handed a boost, thanks to the chancellor’s stamp duty holiday.Other winners included some of those with political connections and contacts with a Chinese face mask supplier. Hundreds of millions of pounds of contracts were handed out, with next to no scrutiny, sparking allegations of cronyism.Several industries are facing an existential threat, putting hundreds of thousands of jobs at risk.Hospitality has borne the brunt, prompting warnings that tens of thousands of pubs, restaurants, bars and hotels could disappear. Pub groups such as Marston’s and Greene King cut jobs, while the nightclub firm Deltic filed for administration. Worse could follow with the lucrative Christmas period ruined for many.The picture is similarly bleak in travel, tourism and leisure. By early October, more than 40 airlines had gone bust. Refused a government bailout, billionaire Sir Richard Branson had to prop up Virgin Atlantic with a £1.2bn rescue package, including £200m of his own money. EasyJet denied it faced collapse.British Airways lost a staggering £5bn in the first nine months of the year, while tour operator TUI announced losses of £1.8bn. In entertainment, Cineworld shut UK and US cinemas indefinitely, while many live music and theatre businesses face oblivion.Deserted high streets wreaked havoc on retailers, particularly those deemed non-essential, triggering a string of administrations. The billionaire Philip Green’s retail empire Arcadia collapsed into administration, as did Debenhams, Edinburgh Woollen Mill, Laura Ashley and Cath Kidston.And let’s not forget the estimated 3 million people, such as some self-employed, who have seen limited or no benefit from government measures to support businesses and jobs.This all made for some mind-blowing and unwelcome economic and financial milestones.As global trade slowed, so did demand for oil, with mind-boggling results. The price of US oil briefly moved into negative territory, as traders paid to be rid of unwanted barrels rather than incur storage costs.The pandemic allowed some businesses – and their staff in particular – to shine. Supermarket workers, cleaners and delivery drivers emerged as some of the true heroes of the crisis.In the early days, industrials rallied round in a wartime-style effort, with the likes of Airbus, Rolls-Royce and McLaren joining the Ventilator Challenge to produce thousands of medical ventilators that, thankfully, have not been needed in the quantities feared.Fashion firms including Burberry made PPE, while the likes of the chemicals firm Ineos and craft beer firm BrewDog churned out hand sanitiser.You don’t often hear three cheers for Big Pharma but the likes of Pfizer and AstraZeneca have won public goodwill thanks to swift work producing vaccines.Retailers paid back £1.8bn in state support that they did not need, including Sainsbury’s, Asda, B\u0026ampM, Aldi, Tesco and Morrisons.Away from coronavirus, the Black Lives Matter movement led many businesses to engage more seriously with racial discrimination and inequality, but progress has been slow and critics have warned firms must wake up to race issues.2020 spawned tales of skulduggery worthy of the late John Le Carre. In January, fugitive former Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn told of his dramatic escape from incarceration in Japan. Accused of financial misconduct, Ghosn was smuggled to Lebanon thanks to an elaborate plot that involved him hiding in an audio equipment box.Tidjane Thiam, one of the stars of banking, was ousted as boss of Swiss bank Credit Suisse after a saga involving corporate espionage, an alleged car chase and bitter personal vendettas.The payment processing firm Wirecard enjoyed the backing of the entire German financial establishment as it tried every trick in the book to discredit Financial Times reporters who eventually unmasked the company as a fraudulent house of cards.British firms played their part, too. Aston Martin was revealed to have close links to a “sock puppet” PR firm questioning the green credentials of electric vehicles.Then there was the furore over fast fashion firm Boohoo and its ties to garment factories in Leicester and Pakistan, where workers were allegedly underpaid and exposed to unsafe working conditions.The fallout from the collapse of London Capital \u0026amp Finance, costing investors £236m, cast significant doubt on the efficacy of the financial watchdog, the FCA.Covid-19 subdued merger and acquisition activity but the US graphics card specialist Nvidia swooped for Cambridge-based chipmaker Arm Holdings, in a $40bn deal that sparked concern about the future of a rare British tech world-leader.The ticket resale firm Viagogo announced a $4bn takeover of rival StubHub, only to see the British Competition \u0026amp Markets Authority step in and threaten to scupper the whole thing. The deal hangs in the balance.After months of uncertainty, British Steel was eventually sold to the Chinese firm Jingye, securing the future of steelmaking in Scunthorpe.As the UK considers a crackdown on gambling, the US is opening up. The Las Vegas casino firm Caesars grabbed William Hill with a £2.9bn takeover. Meanwhile, the Paddy Power owner, Flutter, completed a $12.3bn merger with Canada’s The Stars Group, creating the world’s largest online gambling company.As the year drew to a close, the security firm G4S accepted a £3.8bn offer from its US rival Allied Universal Security Services.Tesla’s founder, Elon Musk, took the first steps on the road towards a controversial $55.8bn pay bonanza. It hinges on some tough targets, including Tesla reaching a market value of $650bn. The electric car firm zoomed through that barrier earlier this month following a remarkable and sustained rise.In the UK, Matthew Moulding, the chief executive of the e-commerce firm The Hut Group, was in line for £830m in performance-related shares thanks to its strong performance since listing. He claims to have made 74 staff millionaires too.Even before the pandemic boosted Ocado’s fortunes, its boss, Tim Steiner, scooped £54m in share price-related bonuses.It’s hard to believe that Rishi Sunak only became chancellor of the exchequer in February. He was briefly flavour of the month when handing out more than £210bn in Covid relief to fund the furlough scheme and initiatives such as eat out to help out. His star has fallen a little since then and he faces the tough task of managing the finances during a recession.As Sunak arrived, the Bank of England governor Mark Carney bowed out after seven years overseeing a post-banking crisis British economy, with his reputation pretty much intact. Andrew Bailey succeeded him at Threadneedle Street.Sharon White became chair of John Lewis Partnership in February. Joining at a challenging time for the retail sector, White quickly made major decisions, including the closure of eight of its 50 department stores, including big outlets in Birmingham and Watford, with significant job losses.IAG’s boss Willie Walsh timed his exit to perfection, leaving the British Airways owner just as global aviation entered the biggest crisis in its history. As he retired, so did BA’s fleet of 747 jumbo jets.Speaking of goodbyes, there was the small matter of Britain bidding adieu to the European Union on 31 January 2020. Sadly, the tourism world said goodbye to John Hays, of travel agency Hays Travel. He and wife Irene stepped in to rescue the Thomas Cook stores in 2019.

He has been unable to receive answers from his state unemployment agency to try to resolve the issue.“I have a family to feed, a mortgage to pay, a car payment, and I’m a single father of two small girls who rely on me to provide for them,” said Comas, who cannot afford to find other work because his family’s health coverage is still being covered by his employer. “I’m going to lose everything, probably going to be evicted and will start to go to the food banks for food for my family.”2020 has been a most dramatic year in the markets - with the worst slump in decades followed by a strong recovery as economies began to recover from the pandemic.Just before Christmas I asked Tom Stevenson, investment director for personal investing at Fidelity International, what lessons we could take from this year. Here’s his advice:Dozens of the UK’s best-known newspapers, including The Scotsman and The Yorkshire Post, have been bought by David Montgomery’s National World for just £10.2m in the latest round of consolidation of the ailing local newspaper market.JPI Media, which owns 100 local newspapers across the country including the Edinburgh Evening News, Lancashire Post, Sheffield Star and Sunderland Echo, has reached a deal with National World, and will take control on 2nd January.Montgomery, the former chief executive of the parent of the Daily Mirror, has been aiming to strike a takeover deal since launching National World as a publishing consolidation vehicle on the London stock market in 2019.“JPI ‘s historic publishing brands represent the best in journalism and have reliably served their communities and supported local businesses, in some cases for centuries, and never more than in the last year,” said Montgomery.“National World will uphold this tradition and implement modern technology to grow the business across a wider footprint based on high quality, unique content.” JPI Media, formerly known as Johnston Press, has been seeking a buyer since late 2018 when it put itself up for sale to try and pay debts of £220m. JPI rejected all the offers made for its assets - including one from rival publisher Newsquest valuing the business at up to £120m, with no pension deficit obligation - instead choosing to enter administration.A day later JPI agreed a rescue and restructuring plan tabled by its biggest lenders that involved writing-off £135m of debt, leaving it with £85m of debt. In November 2019, JPI agreed a £50m deal to sell crown jewel the i newspaper to Daily Mail and General Trust, the owner of the Daily Mail, Mail on Sunday and .In October, JPI Media sold its printing plants, at Portsmouth, Dinnington and Carn, to DMGT.Last year, Publicly-listed Reach, which owns national and regional newspaper titles including the Daily Mirror,  and Manchester Evening News, offered £50m to buy JPI Media but subsequently pulled out of the deal.Earlier this year, Norwich-based Archant, which publishes more than 50 local titles including the Eastern Daily Press and Ham \u0026amp High, sold a majority stake to private investment firm Rcapital in a bid to shore up its finances.In 2012, DMGT sold its local newspaper operations to Montgomery’s Local World, a joint venture comprising more than 100 regional titles, which was valued at £100m at the time. Three years later Reach, owner of the Mirror and Express titles as well as local titles including the Birmingham Mail and Manchester Evening News, took over Local World in a £220m deal.The decline in the regional newspaper industry has been precipitous. In 2005, Johnston Press - now JPI Media - paid £160m to buy the Scotsman newspaper group from the ’s owners, the Barclay Brothers. During the administration process in 2018 the titles were assigned a value of just £4.3m by creditors acting for Johnston Press. Meanwhile in America, the number of people filing new jobless claims remains worryingly high.The number of new ‘initial claims’ for unemployment benefit dipped to 787,000 (seasonally adjusted) during Christmas week, down from 806,00 in the previous seven days. That’s still more than at any time before 2020, and shows that the US labor market is suffering from the pandemic raging in America.Another 308,000 people filed fresh jobless claims under the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance Programme, meaning that around 1.1m people sought jobless support last week.The Spanish economy was extremely badly hit by the pandemic, of course, particularly its tourism industry. The UK’s Footsie index has certainly underperformed against other big stock market indices this year, while the technology-focused Nasdaq has raced ahead.It’s official, 2020 was the worst year for the FTSE 100 share index since 2008.In 2020, the UK stock market was hit particularly hard by the Covid-19 pandemic, with Brexit concerns also weighing on the market.With Germany’s stock market back in positive territory, and the US at record highs, Britain’s stock market has been a clear laggard (as shown in previous post).The FTSE 100 closed out the year on the back foot, with the value and cyclical nature of the UK markets ensuring significant underperformance compared with their US counterparts. That underperformance of UK stocks is never more apparent than seeing the Dow reach record highs in the same week as the FTSE 100 could secure its worst annual performance since 2008.With 2020 behind us, traders will be looking forward to a period of increasing stability and prosperity. Despite ongoing upheaval and suffering, the swift actions taken on a governmental and central bank level have helped avoid what could have been a year filled with bankruptcies and economic collapse. Instead, UK businesses are looking towards Spring as a target to blossom once again. The current April deadline to end the furlough scheme coincides with Matt Hancock’s prediction that the UK could be out of this crisis by spring, with the vaccine roll-out boosted by the news that the AstraZeneca inoculation effort begins next week.While short-term fears over the Covid restrictions and Brexit implications will understandably ensure volatility over the months to come, the prospect of a reopening effort in Q2 should provide the basis for a much better 2021 for UK stocks. This chart from CMC Markets shows how the UK’s FTSE (in grey) has lagged behind the US, German and Japanese stock markets this year:CMC’s Michael Hewson reckons the FTSE 100 could rebound in 2021, if the world economy recovers, writing that:It’s notable that once again the S\u0026ampP 500 has managed to outperform, hitting new record highs, despite the economic shock of the pandemic, while the Nikkei has also seen a decent rebound. The response of the US Federal Reserve has certainly helped in this regard, with a number of new monetary policy interventions which almost stray into the realms of fiscal policy. Various lending programmes, along with the purchase of so-called “fallen angels” corporate debt have almost acted as a put against bankruptcy of a number of large US companies. It is also interesting to note how different the pace of the respective bouncebacks has been, and how much harder the FTSE 100 has been hit relative to its peers, though if you dig deep enough below the surface it’s also easy to understand why the FTSE has struggled. So, while the FTSE 100 has clearly struggled this year, it also stands to reason that it could also be the most susceptible to a strong rebound, if the UK and global economies see a normalisation in 2021, with the prospect of a move back above the 7,000 level a likely possibility, and higher towards 7,400.The rebound in the German DAX has also been fairly impressive, however there are concerns as we look ahead to 2021. Wine and spirit makers may not feel like popping champagne corks tonight, after the US announced it’s raising tariffs on certain European Union products, including wines, and cognac from France and Germany.Last night, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) said it was adding tariffs on aircraft manufacturing parts and certain non-sparkling wines as well as cognacs and other brandies from the EU’s two largest members.The USTR did not say when the tariffs would take effect but noted that additional details would be “forthcoming.”.The French wine exporters’ federation said the move was “a real sledgehammer blow in a fight which has nothing to do with us”.Ben Aneff, president of the US Wine Trade Alliance, said the move would hurt US restaurants and small businesses (as they’d have to pay these tariffs on the imports)Gold has had its strongest year in a decade.Record-low interest rates, a weaker US dollar, and predictions of higher inflation have all encouraged interest in gold.The growth at Chinese factories this month (see earlier post) is an encouraging sign for next year, says Jamie Rowlands, partner at international law firm Gowling WLG.“It is reassuring to see that China can now continue to build on this success as business returns to normal in 2021 as a result of Covid-19 vaccinations across the world.The subsequent rise in consumer demand likely to arise from this will positively impact Chinese manufacturing levels further and help begin to redress the global disruption of the past 12 months.”Stocks in London are recovering some of their earlier losses, but still ending 2020 on a low ebb."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/13a0af37cfa9285eefa6859554e13b060af5a273/0_141_4956_2974/master/4956.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026s=a23ee648b494eafb1dbb9d7566c6e7b2","title":"parents in england tell us what you think of the new rules on primary schools reopening","story":"We’d like to hear from parents about their thoughts on the varied reopening of primary schools in EnglandAs the start of the new term approaches, primary schools in England are to be subject to different rules according to the rates of coronavirus in their area.

People were utterly spellbound in anticipation of the next startling leap of these huge, metallic-silver creatures from beneath the ocean waves, and many simply couldn’t believe this was happening just off the English coastline.”An extremely rare sighting of a spectacular sea slug, Placida cremoniana, which measures just millimetres in length and resembles an orange glowing lump of coal covered in spikes, was spotted by a sharp-eyed volunteer in Cornish waters. It is more usually found in the Pacific or Mediterranean.In Northern Ireland, two orcas were seen on Strangford Lough, the first sightings since 1962.More than 30 bottlenose dolphins were seen “partying” off Saltburn pier on the Teesside coast for weeks during the summer. “This partying pod of dolphins were highly visible, playing, breaching vertically, racing along at top speed, with fin after fin arcing through the waves,” said Jacky Watson, of Tees Valley Wildlife Trust. There was rare evidence captured of a baby Risso’s dolphin born in Welsh waters off Anglesey.There was bad news, however, with disposable personal protective equipment, plastic, nurdles (plastic pellets roughly the size of lentils), litter and discarded fishing gear putting marine wildlife in greater peril.Attenborough, the president emeritus of the Wildlife Trusts, said the UK seas were marine protected areas, “but sadly this does not prevent damaging activities still occurring in these special places. Bottom-towed dredging and trawling destroys fragile sea fans and soft corals on the seabed, while dredging to install cables to offshore windfarms changes the seabed and its wildlife forever.”He said: “For too long we have taken from the sea with little regard for the consequences. We are all aware of the problems presented by plastic litter, but some pollutants and impacts are hidden from view beneath the surface of the waves. Our government needs to tackle these problems but we can all do our bit too.”Many people visited the UK coast after lockdown restrictions were lifted. “People delighted in seeing marine life and it lifted the hearts of millions in this difficult year,” said Joan Edwards, the Wildlife Trusts’ director of living seas. “However, we have taken these wonders for granted for too long and it’s vital we recognise that the future of life on earth is inseparable from the health of the sea.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92f482c7025e8df26c56746cc58b76969ad86e90/0_0_4489_7000/master/4489.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=65045789d1e2523903b5e01585afb27f 700w","title":"kolasinac on verge of schalke loan as arteta targets arsenal clearout","story":"Mikel Arteta has revealed Arsenal’s priority in January is to trim the numbers in their squad. Sead Kolasinac is one of several players who have barely featured this season and the defender has joined Schalke on loan until the end of the campaign.“We have a large squad and we knew that,” Arteta said. “A lot of things that should have happened in the summer, we cannot accomplish for different reasons. There are some players that are going to go on loan and going to leave and that is the priority at the moment. We cannot sustain the numbers that we have in certain positions and we are looking to do that, and then we will see if we have the right opportunity in the positions where we need some more help.”Mesut Özil and Shkodran Mustafi are among others who do not feature in Arteta’s plans but one player the manager said he would like to keep is Reiss Nelson, whose absence from the squad in recent weeks fuelled speculation that he could be on the verge of a move.Arteta says he is confident that increased testing of Premier League players will help to ensure that the season can continue without interruption despite rising Covid-19 infection rates.Arsenal’s next match is on Saturday against West Brom, whose manager, Sam Allardyce, called this week for a “circuit-breaker”. The latest round of testing returned the highest number of positives since the start of the season, with 18 of 1,479 players and staff found to have the virus. Two matches had to be postponed this week owing to high infection rates.The Premier League has increased the frequency of testing from once to twice per week for clubs in tier 4 areas, including Arsenal. Arteta says he believes that measure will help to tackle the rise.“I think we are all concerned with our own health and with what is going on around us,” the manager said. “But all the protocols we have in place, everything we do around the training ground and around matches and the fact that we play our sport outdoors all minimise the risks a lot. If you see the record since we started to test, it is incredibly positive and as long as we can we have to carry on doing that but obviously without putting anyone at risk.“I think we have shown the system is working. In the last week or so something has happened and we will have more restrictions and more tests to try to be as efficient as we were before and we will see, but I think it can work and we can carry on.”Arteta said football had a crucial role to play in keeping people’s spirits up during lockdown. “The importance of football to this society is massive. When you ask around and talk to people and ask them what it means to have football in this difficult period for everybody when there is not so much to do, it is really, really important. What we have to do is try to do it in a safe way.”Arteta also hailed the influence of Bukayo Saka, the 19-year-old who has come to the fore at a time when more established players have crumpled under pressure. “He’s a great example for any young player: to play with that commitment, that passion and also that courage.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a3a3f537494851be400e100c62609b300836168e/0_209_6589_3954/master/6589.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=58dcc17d21547ed4bcdb48f1d3943a03","title":"wuhan covid china anniversary who coronavirus","story":"As China’s leadership celebrates national triumph over virus, some residents want an investigation into the start of the pandemicJianghan Road in Wuhan throngs with shoppers and strollers bundled up against the late December freeze. Bells ring out on the hour from the landmark Hankou Customs House where the road terminates near the wide banks of the Yangtze River.Restaurants along the city’s main pedestrian thoroughfare are packed, even on an icy weekday night, and resound with loud conversation.The bustle, bright lights and din of the street appear to show a city back to some normality one year on from 31 December 2019, the day that health authorities in the city reported an unknown pneumonia outbreak to World Health Organization (WHO) colleagues in Beijing.But under the surface a struggle continues between residents of the city that was the first to feel the pain of the coronavirus pandemic and authorities over how to remember the initial response to the crisis.“In the coming days I think people will have a bit of fear,” said 22-year old Zhou Xiangning, a Wuhan resident who caught the virus in mid-January. “Not a fear of the virus returning, but fear from the memories of that time,” he said over a steaming bamboo tray of soup filled thin-skinned dumplings.Wuhan and its roughly 11 million residents were abruptly locked down on 23 January after weeks of being told that the virus was controllable, preventable and not contagious. The aim was to limit greater spread of the disease that has since become known as Covid-19, and that has spread around the world and killed almost 2 million people.In Wuhan, many people are still guarded about what they can and cannot say about what happened a year ago and the lessons they learned.In April, after 76 days, Wuhan emerged from lockdown. Aided by thousands of local volunteers who delivered and distributed scarce PPE and food supplies and drove ill people to hospitals by doctors and nurses working until collapse or until the virus overtook them by workers who built temporary hospitals in a matter of days to relieve inundated facilities, Wuhan made it through.The memory the Chinese Communist party wants people to keep, though, is of the larger national effort to control the outbreak. The inrush of medical staff and People’s Liberation Army soldiers from provinces across China and the emergency response from the central government after 23 January get key billing.A three-month exhibition showcasing China’s coronavirus response, nearing its end in Wuhan, captures all this and more. It paints a China triumphant over the virus, with inconvenient narratives left out.But there is no mention of Dr Li Wenliang, the ophthalmologist hailed as a whistleblower after being reprimanded by police for warning colleagues about a “Sars-like illness” on 30 December last year, and who later died from Covid. Anything gaining traction on Chinese social media not supporting the correct collective memory is swiftly censored.What still irks some Wuhan residents is the downplaying of the seriousness of the virus in the weeks before the lockdown, when people such as Li were trying to sound the warning.One of those was Zhang Hai, who lost his 76-year old father on 1 February. Zhang believes the death could have been prevented if it was known the virus was contagious in mid-January, before he decided to return to Wuhan from Shenzhen after his father broke a leg.“They want to sell a story that they effectively controlled the virus here, but they also try to wipe out the cause,” Zhang said. “The cause is concealing and covering up the information early on, but they seem to only focus on the results afterwards. That does nothing to wipe the pain out of the hearts of those who lost family members.”Han, still grieving from the loss of her father to the virus in February, does not want her full name used out of fear of retribution by authorities. She also wants the mistakes from that period exposed with a proper investigation.Her father became infected a few days before the lockdown but was not given a test for Covid, so he was not counted in the death toll. Han said authorities could have done more to warn residents.Zhang and Han said they hoped the forthcoming investigation by the WHO into the virus outbreak would also take into account the actions by the local government during the first three weeks of January 2020.WHO officials have said the investigation, which will commence after the team arrives in January 2021 and undergoes a 14-day quarantine, will focus strictly on determining possible zoonotic sources of the virus.The starting point for the WHO team is expected to be the South China Seafood Market, where a large quantity of virus samples were detected after it was closed and sanitised on 1 January 2020.There appears to be little to look at now. Wet snow mixed with a biting wind swirls around the shuttered market. A 8ft-high wall covered in placid scenes of misty mountain tops blocks any view inside the now soundless building.Han hopes that one day the world will know what happened at the start of the outbreak. “Before the pandemic I had faith in the government, but after this it feels like telling the truth is so difficult,” she said. “I hope more people can speak up and tell the truth without fearing someone will come after them.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e8872545149e16a627399162d8087e052388fe2/0_0_4928_2956/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4bf51d22f2dab2dc80ded2522884f9eb","title":"tell us how you are celebrating new years eve in the uk","story":"We’d like to hear how people in the UK are celebrating New Year’s Eve under coronavirus restrictionsWith the majority of the UK unable to mix with other households indoors, most traditional New Year’s Eve plans will be cancelled.From Zoom parties to social distanced walks at midnight, we’d like to hear about your plans for New Year’s Eve this year.You can get in touch by filling in the form below.

The government said it hoped the approach would mean as many people as possible soon have some protection against the disease.The announcement caused controversy, however, and Pfizer and BioNTech warned that two doses of their vaccine were required for maximum protection against Covid and that they did not have evidence that the first dose alone offered protection after three weeks.Azeem Majeed, a professor of primary care and public health at Imperial College London and a practising GP, said he was shocked by the change of plan.“We’ve got thousands or perhaps tens of thousands of people who have already booked their second jabs, and these are people who are all elderly, so they often have to make special arrangements for their care or have someone to bring them down. Someone is going to have to ring all these patients to cancel their appointments and rebook them, so it is going to create a lot of work for people as well,” he said.“Clearly the people making these rules are not the ones having to enforce them. I understand the rationale that the government wants to increase the vaccine supply to make sure more people are immunised, but I think that could have been done for people starting from now, rather than cancelling the ones who have already been booked in, which is very disruptive.”One doctor who spoke to the  on condition on anonymity said they hoped to continue with the original schedule for the second dose rather than cancelling appointments, saying that to do otherwise would put their most vulnerable patients at risk and break promises to patients.Alison Bolam, a GP at Horfield health centre in Bristol, said her practice would take a similar approach. “If anyone gets the first vaccine now, the second one will be 10 to 12 weeks later, but for anybody who has already had it, they will get their second vaccine as originally scheduled.”The British Medical Association said it was unreasonable and unfair to expect practices to cancel and rebook appointments for patients to have their second dose.The chair of the BMA’s GP committee, Dr Richard Vautrey, said: “Local leaders are telling us that is unprofessional and impractical to amend the appointments for thousands of frail, elderly patients, particularly those booked and who have already made arrangements to have their second vaccination in the next two weeks.”Vautrey called on the government to publish a scientifically validated justification for the new approach, adding that rebooking appointments would cause huge logistical problems. “The BMA believes the existing commitment made to these patients by the NHS and local clinicians should be respected. If GPs decide to honour these booked appointments in January, the BMA will support them,” he said.Dr Helen Salisbury, a GP and medical adviser to the health experience research group at the University of Oxford, tweeted that the health secretary Matt Hancock, should help to phone her elderly patients and explain why their second jab has been delayed. She said her primary care network needed to cancel and rebook 1,160 appointments.“At 5 mins per phone call, that’s 193 hours work. Not to mention the grief \u0026amp anger,” she tweeted.Salisbury asked the General Medical Council to give advice. “I have been instructed to break my promise to my elderly patients \u0026amp use a vaccine outside its evidenced and approved schedule, probably placing them at risk. Please advise.” Her comments unleashed a flurry of responses from other GPs, with some questioning whether it was ethical to delay a second dose when patients had given consent for the first dose on the premise that they would receive the second three weeks later.The Doctors’ Association UK said it had sent a letter to Hancock and others involved in the change of strategy regarding the Pfizer vaccine. “A patient can’t consent for a treatment then have the treatment changed without their permission, especially when the evidence for change is lacking,” it said.Dr Vinesh Patel, a GP partner and spokesman for the DAUK’s GP committee, said using the Pfizer jab outside the trialled vaccination regime was a huge gamble.Others, however, welcomed the change in approach. Dr Ed Turnham, a GP in Norwich, said the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency should be congratulated for its “brave, pragmatic decision”.“I think most of our elderly patients will be happy that this will reduce the delay in protecting their friends and relatives, and reduce the risk of hospitals being overwhelmed,” he tweeted.Prof Martin Marshall, the chair of the Royal College of GPs, sympathised with GPs and their patients but said the new strategy had merits.The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation “have put forward a compelling case that this is the best way to protect as many people as possible from the virus, and this is the decision that has been made,” he said.But he added: “NHS England’s guidance does allow for some clinical discretion for practices to go ahead with second vaccinations where necessary, and if a practice uses this it is important it is respected.”.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc2972389b5c3d5ea9cac6d91775694276ca2772/0_138_4287_2572/master/4287.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8878299448369e00b0f5b3027a05c5fd","title":"record number of britons to take part in dry january","story":"Sales of no and low alcohol alternatives rise during lockdown yearA record number of Britons are planning to forego booze during so-called dry January, after re-evaluating their home drinking habits during lockdown and as sales of “no and low” alcohol alternatives soar.The charity Alcohol Change UK said its polling shows more than 6.5 million adults intend to participate in dry January – up from 3.9 million last year. That is the equivalent of one in five of people who drink alcohol.With drinking now largely home-based, the Portman Group – the social responsibility and regulatory body for alcohol in the UK – said ongoing Covid restrictions and curfews had increased consumers’ thirst for hangover-free options from the supermarket and corner shop.The Dry January campaign to encourage abstinence at the start of the New Year was launched in 2013 in the UK by Alcohol Change UK – initially attracting just 4,000 people – but has since expanded, with Public Health England as a partner, to become a major fixture on the post-Christmas binge calendar.“2020 has been a year like no other,” said Dr Richard Piper, chief executive of Alcohol Change UK. “Many of us have spent the year stressed, scared and tired. When things get tough, we can find ourselves slipping into drinking habits we wish we could break, but Dry January can help. It’s our chance for a reset – 31 days to try something new, and to see some amazing benefits like brighter skin, a fuller wallet, a calmer mind and a better night’s sleep.”Its poll also showed that one in four adults who drink alcohol are aiming to cut down generally in 2021. People who download its free app, Try Dry, are twice as likely to have a totally alcohol-free month and drink more healthily in the longer-term.“Lockdowns and the tier system have given Britons cause to consider their alcohol consumption, with many drinking less than ever before,” said the Portman Group chief executive, John Timothy. “Low and no alcohol alternatives offer the perfect balance of replicating the atmosphere created by alcohol without any of the associated risks.”Diageo has just unveiled an alcohol-free version of its popular Gordon’s gin – already on sale in Tesco and Amazon and in other supermarkets from 3 January, although its hotly-anticipated alcohol-free Guinness was recalled in November, two weeks after launch, due to contaminationEmma Heal, managing director of British alcohol-free beer brand Lucky Saint – the UK’s first non-alcoholic lager on draught, said: “The step change in product quality on offer is driving such huge interest in the no and low category. We see dry January 2021 as a great opportunity for people to try these drinks to help them moderate their drinking and start the year in a positive way.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7490c8c1eda9a3ebe08990d04b6580764819a7ae/35_345_976_585/master/976.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=a276c98bb56c8477be6bfb54c02cec66","title":"arise sir lewis hamilton given knighthood in new year honours list","story":"A stunning 12 months for Lewis Hamilton on and off the track, which included equalling Michael Schumacher’s record of seven Formula One titles and becoming an increasingly powerful voice for ersity in his sport, has ended with a knighthood in the new year honours list. The 35-year-old becomes the fourth F1 driver to be knighted after two fellow Britons, Sir Stirling Moss and Sir Jackie Stewart, and Australia’s Sir Jack Brabham.There had been a question mark over whether Hamilton, who also surpassed Schumacher’s record of grand prix victories in 2020, would be knighted given he lives in the tax haven of Monaco. But it was reported that the prime minister, Boris Johnson, had personally intervened to ensure Hamilton would be rewarded for his sporting achievements.It was confirmed on Wednesday that Hamilton, who in September also set up a commission to analyse the lack of ersity in motor racing, had been recognised through the “diplomatic and overseas” list rather than the domestic list to avoid controversy over his tax returns.Hamilton was congratulated by Stefano Domenicali, the new CEO of F1, who praised him as a “true giant of our sport”.“His influence is huge both in and out of a car,” he added. “What he has achieved is phenomenal with still more to come. All of us at Formula 1 congratulate him on this well-deserved recognition of his achievements and look forward to seeing more of his brilliance in 2021.”The Exeter director of rugby, Rob Baxter, was awarded an OBE, meanwhile, and the team’s captain, Joe Simmonds, an MBE after the Chiefs won the Premiership title and the European Champions Cup. There were also MBEs for Jimmy Greaves, the former Tottenham and England striker, and the former Wolves midfielder Ron Flowers, who become the last surviving members of England’s 1966 World Cup-winning squad to be honoured.In women’s football Gill Coultard, the first to win 100 senior England football caps, received an MBE – a gong that was also given to Great Britain’s Billie Jean King Cup tennis captain Anne Keothavong.The former Leeds Rhino scrum-half Rob Burrow, who has motor neurone disease, was also granted and MBE in recognition of services to his sport and in raising MND awareness during the coronavirus pandemic. His former teammate, the Leeds director of rugby Kevin Sinfield, ran seven marathons in seven days to raise funds for the MND Association on Burrow’s behalf, with the total now more than £2.5m.Burrow said “2020 has taught us all to appreciate the gifts we have and it is my honour and privilege to accept this award on behalf of all the MND community”, and added: “I hope it gives people hope that we are not ignored and the drive for more research and support to end MND will not stop.”Bob Champion, who won the 1981 Grand National on Aldaniti after recovering from cancer, has been awarded a CBE for his charitable work at the Bob Champion Cancer Trust.Matt Hampson, who was paralysed from the neck down during a training session with the England Under-21 rugby union team in 2005, has been given an OBE for services to charity. Matchroom chairman Barry Hearn was given the same award for services to sport after a 40-year career.

Normally, if it was seven months out from an Olympics, that wall – in a room called the performance lab – would be a hive of activity. Instead it looks like the Mary Celeste.“I’ve not been in that room since last March, so I don’t know whether the wall has a nice layer of dust or is being brushed down by the one person who still checks the office,” the UK Sport chair, Katherine Grainger, says. “I think it’s fair to say that there’s probably more question marks going into a Games than we’ve ever had.”How could there not be when the Covid-19 pandemic has wrecked so much of the sporting calendar and, in many cases, forced athletes to train differently? For every Adam Peaty, who was able to break the 100m breaststroke world record in November, there is a Dina Asher-Smith, who did not compete at all on the international stage.The new variants of the virus have only added to this swirling uncertainty. Normally in January and February many British athletes would go away to warm-weather training camps. Instead they are having to slog away in temperatures barely above zero. What effect might that have come the summer?One thing may surprise you, though. Both UK Sport, which funds Britain’s Olympic sports, and the British Olympic Association, which is responsible for preparing and leading Team GB at the Games, are convinced that Tokyo 2020 will go ahead in July.It’s not just the rollout of various vaccines that gives them confidence. The BOA’s chif de mission, Mark England, is on a key International Olympic Committee working group and is able to see at first hand the work organisers are doing to make sure the Tokyo Games take place.And if they do, the BOA believes Team GB will be one of the most well-prepared squads, despite the difficulties created by the pandemic. When, in March, Tokyo 2020 was postponed by a year, the BOA was forced to renegotiate hundreds of contracts, ranging from the operation camp and the performance facilities in Japan to freight, travel, transport and catering. It was, says one insider, “a huge challenge”. Yet it was one that was quietly overcome.As Andy Anson, the BOA chief executive, says: “We’re confident the Games are going to go ahead and we’re fully focused on making sure we provide the athletes with the best performance environment we can in Tokyo. The timings of the Games might have changed but that won’t have lessened the ambitions of our athletes. And after a five-year wait from Rio I sense there’s now a growing fervour for the Games to happen.”So how might Team GB fare? A year ago the former UK Sport performance director Chelsea Warr said she was “quietly confident” Britain would do better than the 2016 Rio Games, where 27 gold medals and 67 podium finishes lifted them to second in the medal table. Understandably no one is being as bold or bombastic with their predictions now.Grainger, who was a five-times Olympic rowing medallist before retiring after 2016, says: “In terms of performances, it is so hard to predict because we haven’t had the international competition that we would normally have in the year before the Games. We’re still way off knowing what the Olympics and Paralympics team is going to look like, never mind what their performance will be.”It is also worth noting the analytics company Gracenote, which has a decent track record of predicting Olympic medal tables, has warned Great Britain’s medal tally at the Tokyo Games will fall “significantly” from 2016. “Their best hope is to break into the top five rather than the top three where they landed in the last two Olympics,” the company said in February, pre-pandemic, pointing to rowing, athletics, gymnastics and cycling as events where Team GB would not do as well this time around.Certainly within Team GB there remains a quiet confidence that Britain will do well and that the big stars such as Peaty, Asher-Smith and Laura Kenny will deliver. “I genuinely feel our athletes are in a good place,” says Grainger. “Some have benefited from a break in the training regime, or trying a new approach to doing things. Like all of us we’ve all learned different ways of working.“So I think there’s a general positivity about next summer. For a long time it was ‘will it or won’t it happen’. Now it feels like it is on – and our athletes are ready to show how good they can be.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16a94f2b1ac0a638892517cd7f7127e4d81c4639/0_45_1948_1169/master/1948.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8c14fec03568e49a26575ed8903e0dc8","title":"roger federer perfect excuse walk away 2020 wants to go on tennis","story":"After two arthroscopic knee surgeries and a year away from tennis the 39-year-old is showing remarkable grit to continueIn July 2018, during times when rooms could still be safely filled with people, Roger Federer was at Wimbledon for a pre-tournament press conference as he prepared to defend his title. For half an hour he fielded questions in three languages from a packed room, but suddenly things took a left turn. An unfamiliar reporter was handed the microphone and without missing a beat, she opened her question with a simple, direct statement: “You look even more handsome than last year.”As onlookers cackled and Federer responded with a timely injection of humour, that cringe-inducing moment felt as if it was a reflection of the way Federer is discussed in general. Even before he marked himself as one of the all-time greats, Federer took on a mythical status in the sporting world. He is the maestro. He is peRFect. He is often described as some otherworldly being. There are those interminable jokes from commentators about his inability to sweat, even when his headband is clearly soaked through. Such a comment from a professional journalist seemed as if it was a natural progression.Detractors of Federer and some neutrals argue there is far too much fawning over him, while his fans would point out that a once-in-a-lifetime talent who has won so much and attracted so many fans to the game is worthy of that adulation. What is clear is that with so much of the focus on his effortless style and bottomless toolbox of shots, it often belies the many other qualities that make him great.On Sunday night, Federer concluded his year by announcing he will not be competing at the Australian Open in February. After previously undergoing surgery for a torn meniscus in his left knee in 2016, this year Federer had two arthroscopic surgeries on his right knee. He did not recover satisfactorily from the first surgery in February, so he decided on a second attempt in June. He is now working his way back up to full intensity in Dubai and he will eventually decide on his first tournament back.For much of his career, Federer’s evasion of injury has been a pillar of his game, allowing him to preserve his body and remain competitive for so long. Now the reality of being 39 years old with 1,513 ATP singles matches under his belt has arrived. Federer’s withdrawal means his injury layoff will last longer than a year. His mortality as a professional player has naturally been on his mind. “It is already clear that I am near the end of my career,” he said in July to the Swiss broadcaster SRF. “I can’t tell what’s in two years. That’s why I plan year after year. I’m still happy right now. But when the cogwheels no longer work, I stop.”The most interesting aspect of these final years of Federer’s career has been what he is willing to do to keep those cogwheels turning. It has taken far more than just a wave of his magic wand. Eighteen months ago, he was so close to one of his great achievements, leading Novak Djokovic by double match point in the Wimbledon final before falling in a fifth-set tie-break.For Federer, memories of that match should also include the 10 months of work it took to return to that spot. After defeats at Wimbledon and the US Open in 2018, his powers waning, Federer responded by adding more tournaments to his schedule. He spent a long winter with his head down, slowly grinding through uncertain patches of form. There were many ugly matches, balls thrashed in bursts of anger, and he was still searching for his level by the 2019 Australian Open. It was engrossing to see him resolutely work through his issues before he finally soared again.The only sighting of Federer in 2020 came at the Australian Open after a shortened off-season. Despite never really finding his best, he dragged himself into the last four, engineering two breathless five-set escapes against John Millman and Tennys Sandgren. By the semi-final, his body was finished.At any age, recovering from a serious injury is difficult. Surgery is physically painful and mentally draining. Rehabilitation is the height of tedium. The uncertainty of if and when it will be possible to return to competition can be suffocating enough as a 20-year-old, let alone in a brittle body after decades of competition. Since February, Federer will have had to navigate all of those emotions.In that same Wimbledon press conference two and a half years ago, Federer was asked about Serena Williams’s comeback after her pregnancy. He noted his happiness at her decision to take the route back to sport after such a long time away. “Why not?” he said. “After everything she’s done, it would have been the perfect excuse and exit to say: ‘I’ve had it.’”After two knee surgeries and a year away from tennis at 39 years old, 2020 produced the cleanest excuse and exit route for Federer to vanish into the night. Instead, he has not had it. He has been consistent and resolute in his determination to compete at the highest level again. Age eventually comes for us all, but he has impeded its effects by complementing his ability with grit, resolve and an enduring motivation that remains more than 22 years since his first professional match and so long since most of his contemporaries let go. In the end, that feels even more meaningful than his talent alone."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8b808dba3579dc021a7419407e80b8769e7e1096/0_177_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=7f0ff7356ab40162b9a807557f682fe4","title":"we started selling bikes to key workers how londons friendliest bicycle shop coped with the lockdowns","story":"Winston Farquharson’s passion for cycling has already seen him survive a recession – and he’s determined to make it through this challenge tooWinston Farquharson’s 30-year passion for cycling started with a rugby injury. “My doctor advised me to take up riding to help with my recovery, and I really got the bug for it,” he says as he tidies his cycle shop in Penge, south-east London, ready for the morning rush. “I joined a local cycling shop’s racing team, and travelled up and down the country to race. Sadly, though, I never quite made it.”He retrained as a sports therapist, but a subsequent accident caused him to have a career rethink. “I got involved with a charity which helps disabled people back into work, and realised what I really wanted to do was run my own business. The charity supported me as I wrote my business plan,” he says.The result was SE20 Cycles, a repair and custom-build cycle shop on Penge High Street, which opened in September 2008. Since then, SE20 Cycles has become a hub for the local cycling community – so much so that in 2019 Farquharson converted the shop’s waiting area into a coffee shop.“I wanted to create a friendly place for new cyclists and enthusiasts alike,” he says. “A lot of novice cyclists don’t like to ask questions in case they’re being silly. We wanted to avoid that, and plenty of customers have told us we’re less intimidating than many cycle shops.”When Covid-19 hit, Farquharson made the tough decision to close the repair shop to walk-in customers, putting his mechanic on furlough for six weeks, and prioritising bookings from local emergency and key workers.“As we were suddenly deemed an essential service, it felt natural to prioritise key workers in a bid to help the national effort,” Farquharson says. “For the first two weeks of lockdown, key workers could jump the queue and receive repairs at a heavy discount, or for free, which they really appreciated,” he says.“They could buy bicycles from us at trade price, too, which we started selling as a reaction to Covid-19. It meant the early weeks of lockdown saw us mostly used by NHS and other key workers.”Later, worried about his customers having to queue alongside shoppers waiting to go into a local supermarket, Farquharson developed an online booking system so they could book a slot for a service or repair, drop their bike off, and go.“Having two queues running side by side just wasn’t safe, so after two weeks of mayhem I spent a few hours each evening adding to and testing the booking system,” says Farquharson. “Adding stock to the site for sale was also prioritised, so people wouldn’t have to travel to us,” he says.“Initially, the system created as many problems as it solved – we had to get the message out that we were going online for booking and sales using an A-board outside the shop and social media. Online bookings are also quite hard to manage because we’re busy with the shop, and it means we don’t have the social interaction we used to with customers, which is a shame.”Customers can book and pay online, or use payment cards in store or at their doors. Other safety measures include disinfecting bikes when they’re dropped off and before they’re collected, and offering collection and delivery for customers who don’t live within walking distance. Both Farquharson and his mechanic have their own sets of tools, and spray down larger, shared pieces of equipment between each use.Even when lockdown eased, Farquharson kept his online booking system in place, but looked forward to more people being able to visit the shop in person so they could benefit from one-to-one attention. He’s also passionate about encouraging those who took up cycling during lockdown to continue as things return to some sort of normal.While Farquharson might have missed the camaraderie of customers stopping by for coffee during the lockdowns, he’s grateful to his army of loyal locals for the support small businesses like SE20 Cycles so vitally need.“A lot of shops on the high street will struggle getting people back through the doors, and small shops might find it especially hard to adapt. Local support is so important – and with Visa’s help, we can start getting people back on to the high street again.”But despite having to evolve his business in line with a constantly changing retail landscape, Farquharson is confident it will continue to thrive. “I have no doubt we’ll come out the other side of this,” he says. “I’m a plucky fella. I started out with nothing, at the height of a recession – and if I survived that, I can survive this too.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/740b25da7bc47b480325a91111e98257c779d099/173_549_2973_1783/master/2973.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ec7c6a96bdb831be3e935bbffe76735c","title":"britons urged to stay home on new years eve as covid cases soar","story":"Scientists say virus rampant in UK and advise people to avoid meeting up with family and friendsScientists, police and the prime minister are urging people to welcome in the new year in their own home, with an NHS chief warning it is “absolutely vital” to avoid meeting family and friends because “Covid loves a crowd”.Prof Stephen Powis, the national medical director of NHS England, told Wednesday’s No 10 press conference that the new UK coronavirus variant was fuelling a steep rise in infections, and said any plans to meet with those from other households should be postponed.“Its absolutely vital that this year everybody continues to follow the guidance by staying at home and not mixing,” he said. “Covid loves a crowd so please leave the parties for later in the year.”The prime minister, Boris Johnson, also instructed people to follow local restrictions and see in the new year at home.“That means not meeting up with friends or family indoors, unless they are in the same household or support bubble, and avoiding large gatherings of any kind,” he said.Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, the deputy chief medical officer for England, told the briefing: “I know new year is coming up, I know it is normally a time of great festivity and enjoyment, but you have just got to play your part now in bringing us back from this very dangerous situation that we find ourselves in.”The UK reported another 981 Covid-related deaths on Wednesday, the highest daily toll since April, and a further 50,023 infections in the last 24 hours. The number of patients in hospital with Covid in England is higher than recorded during the peak of the first wave. Prof Peter Openshaw of Imperial College London, a member of the UK’s Sage scientific advisory sub-group Nervtag, said the situation was very worrying.He added that the impact of Christmas mixing was expected to become apparent in case numbers and the death toll in the coming weeks.Prof Kamlesh Khunti, of the University of Leicester, who sits on Sage and is also a member of the Independent Sage group of experts, said the virus was rampant and the situation severe.Khunti added that no one should be complacent, noting Covid had also affected young people, and urged people to forgo meeting up in person to welcome in 2021.“Please do not go out and celebrate,” he said. “Some people have managed really well having celebrations virtually. There is a way to do this,” he added, noting that technology meant people could chat, drink and socialise together safely.“We have got now the vaccine, we shouldn’t really mess this up now,” he said.Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, urged Scots to avoid traditional celebrations for Hogmanay on Thursday, including “first footing” neighbours and relatives on New Year’s Day and holding house parties to welcome the new year. “We should bring in the 2021 in our own homes, with our own households,” she told MSPs. “This new strain is very serious. I can’t stress that enough.”Police have said most people were obeying the restrictions in their areas, but across the country they had discovered a number of raves, large-scale parties and businesses including hairdressers trying to stay open.Police say they will concentrate on the biggest breaches of the Covid rules on New Year’s Eve, such as ticketed events and unlicensed music events including raves, with sources adding officers will not be going “house to house” looking for breaches. Officers will try to encourage people to comply before issuing fines.Martin Hewitt, the chairman of the National Police Chiefs’ Council, said that while many people may want to celebrate after a difficult year, it was necessary to stick to the restrictions to prevent the spread of coronavirus."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0fcee6a1c984b48f45326a213fe6ecfaea069a4f/174_0_5220_3132/master/5220.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=f8d97b95373ec4c0a25f1c709ff9c5cb","title":"coronavirus covid live news updates vaccine lockdown","story":"Latest updates: only 2.6 million Americans inoculated when target was 20 million by end of 2020 London mayor seeking urgent clarification on schoolsMexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said the main part of the vaccination drive against the coronavirus in Mexico will have be completed by April.I think that by April, the majority of us Mexicans, the most vulnerable, will have been vaccinated,” Lopez Obrador told a regular government news conference.Moderna Inc has confirmed it will supply 40 million doses of its COVID-19 vaccine to the South Korean government with deliveries starting in May.The vaccine, which is authorised for emergency use in the US and Canada, is not currently approved in South Korea. The company said it would work with regulators to pursue an approval prior to the distribution of the vaccine.The European Union medicines watchdog said German company BioNTech has applied for clearance in the 27-nation bloc to administer up to six doses of its COVID-19 vaccine from each vial, instead of the five doses currently approved.In an email to The Associated Press, the European Medicines Agency said that BioNTech, which developed its vaccine together with Pfizer, has “submitted a request for change” which will be reviewed by the agency’s human medicines committee “in the shortest possible timeframe.”It said if the committee establishes that six doses can be consistently extracted from each vial of vaccine, it will recommend changing the authorization that clears the vaccine for use in EU nations.Portugal’s daily number of coronavirus cases reached a record high of 7,627 on Thursday as the country prepared for a subdued New Year’s Eve with an 11 pm curfew and no travel between municipalities.The country, which has so far registered 413,678 cases and 6,906 deaths from the virus, eased restrictions around Christmas but has cracked down again on New Year’s Eve with a ban on travel between municipalities and public gatherings, an 11pm curfew and a 1 pm curfew from Jan. 1-3.Cases had risen abruptly to 6,049 on Wednesday from 3,336 on Tuesday, but prime minister Antonio Costa said it was too early to say if this was as a result of the Christmas easing of rules.“In the second week of January we will be able to evaluate the impact of Christmas,” Costa said. “We happily lightened the restrictions but now we need a period of containment to evaluate the results.” Police and federal authorities in the US are investigating after a Wisconsin health system said an employee admitted to deliberately spoiling 500 doses of coronavirus vaccine.Aurora Medical Center first reported that the doses has been spoiled on Saturday, saying they had been accidentally left out unrefrigerated overnight by an employee at Aurora Medical Center in Grafton. The health system said the doses of vaccine now appear to have been deliberately spoiled.Police in Grafton, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) north of Milwaukee, said in a statement that the department, FBI and Food and Drug Administration are “actively” investigating the case.In a statement Aurora said the employee involved “acknowledged that they intentionally removed the vaccine from refrigeration.”Aurora said it has fired the employee and referred the matter to the authorities. The statement said nothing about a possible motive for the action.We continue to believe that vaccination is our way out of the pandemic. We are more than disappointed that this inidual’s actions will result in a delay of more than 500 people receiving their vaccine.”The Greek prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis has elected to spend the last day of the year on Lesbos, site of the ongoing refugee drama amidst the pandemic.The island - and other eastern Aegean outposts – is among the ten top regions in Greece with the highest coronavirus caseloads. Following the devastating fires that destroyed Moria, Lesbos’ notoriously overcrowded holding centre in September, some 7,500 asylum seekers are being temporarily housed in a controversial tent camp outside the port capital Mytilene. Visiting the installation Mitsotakis said plans were on course to replace the facility with a permanent structure in the New Year. The current camp has been described as a disaster by local NGOs with Covid-19 restrictions - in place for most of 2020 – exacerbating what psycho social support experts have described as a mental health crisisamong refugees on Greece’s frontline isles.  We had said we would close Moria. Of course we didn’t expect it to close in the way it did but it finally did close and it was for the best,” said Mitsotakis describing the facility as a vast improvement on Moria. Refugees have been especially hard hit by government measures aimed at curbing the spread of coronavirus with only a limited number allowed out of camps hosting asylum seekers at any one time. Case rates in England remain highest among 30- to 39-year-olds, Public Health England said.The rate in this age group stood at 557.5 cases per 100,000 people in the seven days to 27 December, up week-on-week from 495.4.Among 20- to 29-year-olds, the rate rose from 498.6 to 539.5, and for 40- to 49-year-olds it rose from 465.9 to 527.3.Rates fell slightly among five- to nine-year-olds, 10- to 19-year-olds, and people aged 80 and over.The lowest rates were recorded among those aged four and under (150.6) and five to nine (167.2).  Scotland has recorded the highest number of new coronavirus cases since the pandemic began for the third day in a row.A total of 2,622 new cases were reported in the last 24 hours, following 2,045 cases reported on Wednesday and 1,895 on Tuesday.Another 68 fatalities were also reported on Thursday, bringing the death toll under this measure – of people who first tested positive for the virus within the previous 28 days – to 4,578.Seven Covid-19 deaths were recorded between 25 and 29 December 25 and December 29 – though the government noted that register offices had been closed over the public holidays – with a further 43 deaths on Wednesday.There are 1,174 people in hospital confirmed to have the virus, with 70 in intensive care.All of mainland Scotland and Skye remain under level 4 restrictions, while the other islands are in level 3.Police Scotland and the Scottish government have warned people against Hogmanay gatherings to mark the new year as they could break restrictions and potentially spread the virus further. Covid-19 case rates are continuing to rise in all regions of England, according to the latest weekly surveillance report from Public Health England.London’s rate of new cases stood at 735.5 per 100,000 people in the seven days to 27 December, up from 711.9 in the previous week.Eastern England saw the second highest rate (551.3, up from 510.8) followed by south-east England (450.6, up from 427.4).Yorkshire \u0026amp the Humber had the lowest rate: 188.3, up from 172.4.Responding to the latest surveillance report figures, Public Health England medical director Dr Yvonne Doyle said:The Christmas week saw a worrying rise in cases across every region of the country, particularly among adults in their 20s and 30s.We must not now add further fuel to the fire, as meeting in close and large groups this New Year’s Eve risks further transmission.The way we can beat this virus remains the same, whatever the variant. Reduce close contact with others and follow the guidance. Wash your hands, wear a mask and keep your distance.A quarter of new cases of Covid-19 in Greater Manchester, England are of the new variant the region’s mayor has said, but preparations for mass vaccinations are well under way.Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, spoke to reporters at a weekly briefing following meetings with public health bosses.Burnham said the latest figures were taken from the week before Christmas so probably underplay the spread of the new strain across the region.He said there is an “obvious marked change” compared to the week before Christmas with nine of the 10 boroughs in Greater Manchester seeing rises in Covid-19 cases but overall infection rates were below the England average.Only about 2.8 million Americans had received a Covid-19 vaccine going into the last day of December, putting the United States far short of the government’s target to vaccinate 20 million people this month.Shots are reaching nursing home residents at an even slower pace than others first in line even though they are most at risk of dying of the virus.Only 170,000 people in long-term care facilities received a shot as of Wednesday even though 2.2 million doses were distributed for residents, according to data released from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.About 14 million doses of Pfizer’s and Moderna’s vaccines have been distributed to states so far, federal officials told reporters on Wednesday, shy of its goal to ship 20 million doses this month.As late as early December, officials maintained they would have 40 million doses available this month, enough to vaccinate 20 million Americans with a two-dose regimen.The Archbishop of Canterbury has said he saw “reasons to be hopeful for the year ahead” despite the grief of the pandemic in his New Year’s message.The Most Rev Justin Welby reflected on his experience volunteering as an assistant chaplain at St Thomas’ hospital.Speaking from Guys and St Thomas’ in central London, Welby said while 2020 had seen “tremendous pain and sadness”, he said there was hope in how people had cared for each other, from giving comfort in hospitals to wearing masks.In his message, which will be broadcast on BBC One on January 1, he said:This crisis has shown us how fragile we are. It has also shown us how to face this fragility.Here at the hospital, hope is there in every hand that’s held, and every comforting word that’s spoken.Up and down the country, it’s there in every phone call. Every food parcel or thoughtful card. Every time we wear our masks.China has reported the first imported case of the new variant of the coronavirus that was detected in the UK earlier this month, according to the China CDC publication.Hungary will buy vaccines either through the European Union’s procurement mechanism or directly from China because Russia has inadequate capacity to manufacture vaccines, Viktor Orbán’s chief of staff said.Hungary has participated in Russia’s testing efforts and was an early recipient of small batches of Russia’s Sputnik-V vaccine, raising alarm among European peers that it would bypass the EU’s approval mechanism.All travellers entering Norway will have to take a Covid-19 test upon arrival, or up to 24 hours after, from 2 January, the country’s justice ministry said.To stop the spread of the coronavirus variant first detected in Britain, travellers from any point of origin will need to enter Norway at designated entry points where testing is available, with smaller border crossings to be closed, it added. Nightingale hospitals across England are being “readied” for use if needed as Covid patient numbers rise. The NHS in London has been asked to make sure the Excel centre site is “reactivated and ready to admit patients” as hospitals in the capital struggle.Other Nightingale hospital sites across England include Manchester, Bristol, Sunderland, Harrogate, Exeter and Birmingham.A spokesman for the NHS said: Hospitals in London are coming under significant pressure from high Covid-19 infection rates and while staff are going the extra mile and the NHS in London is opening more beds in NHS hospitals across the capital to care for the most unwell patients, it is crucial that people do everything they can to reduce transmission of the virus.In anticipation of pressures rising from the spread of the new variant infection, NHS London were asked to ensure the London Nightingale was reactivated and ready to admit patients as needed, and that process is under way.A four-day lockdown is set to begin in Turkey at 9pm on New Year’s Eve in a bid to stem the spread of Covid-19 and measures against New Year’s gatherings are to be enforced.Turkey’s president has warned parties will not be allowed and law enforcement officers will monitor for any violations. The interior ministry said gathering would be banned “not as a preference but as a necessity” for public health.Istanbul’s governor said some 34,000 law enforcement personnel would be on duty to enforce the rules in Turkey’s most populous city. The interior ministry announced more than 208,000 officers would be working across the country and have set up thousands of control points.Tourists, who have so far been exempt from lockdowns, will also not be allowed to go to symbolic squares and avenues.Turkey has among the worst infection rates in the world but official statistics show the seven-day average of daily infections has dropped to around 16,000 from above 30,000 since evening curfews and weekend lockdowns were instituted in early December.The total death toll to date is 20,642, according to health ministry statistics.The new UK variant of the coronavirus, B117, is more transmissible than older variants, and appears to have a greater impact on those under 20 a new study has confirmed.The research, led by scientists at Imperial College London and largely based on data relating to the second England lockdown, reveals the new variant has an R number 1.4-1.8 times larger than older variants. Put another way, the team says the R number for the new variant is between 0.4 and 0.7 higher than that of older variants.The R number reflects the average number of people one infected person will go on to infect. If R is above 1, an epidemic can grow exponentially, whereas if R is below 1, the epidemic shrinks.During the UK lockdown in the spring the R number fell to between 0.6 and 0.9 by the end of April. However, the new data suggests that such measures may not be enough to produce a similar effect for the new variant.It would certainly be a close run thing,” Prof Neil Ferguson of Imperial College London, told the , adding that if R for the new variant is 1.5 times higher than for older variants, “lockdown 1 might have still achieved control (1.5 x 0.60.9), making perhaps optimistic assumptions.”A key factor, he added, is that it is not clear what effect closing schools and universities has on transmission – a strategy applied in the first lockdown, but not the second.“The next two weeks will be critical, especially in the highest risk areas. If we see case numbers start to plateau and decline while schools and colleges remain closed, we will at least know that control is possible, even if at a high cost,” he said. “We’re in a very difficult place right now.”Research published this month from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine found that even if tier 4 restrictions were applied across England from 26 December until 31 January, the R value of the new variant in England would not fall below 1.Prof Axel Gandy of Imperial College London, said: “Until a very high proportion of the population has been vaccinated, strong social distancing measures are needed to control this more transmissible variant of Covid-19. Everybody that can be vaccinated should be vaccinated.” "},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"The first test is for governments to stop subsidising fossil fuel industry which knowingly contributed to global over-heatingEvery 0.1 degree matters as the world attempts to keep within 1.5-degree rise\u0026lsquo2020 is on course to be the 10th consecutive year of above-normal temperatures\u0026rsquo"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4447543.1609344746!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ireland s climate a year of extremes from wettest february to driest spring","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPhotographs taken from drones showing the extent of widespread flooding in the Shannon river catchment during February 2020, due to 252 per cent of normal rainfall. Photomontage: Paul Scott Graphics StudioAny notion Ireland in 2020 escaped the effects of global heating that is triggering more extreme weather events does not tally with Met Éireann’s data for the year.Looking at those figures, and trends over many years, the fate of Ireland in terms of facing into more variable weather patterns with potential for extremes could not be clearer, according to Met Éireann’s senior climatologist Keith Lambkin.His verdict on the year is emphatic: “In Ireland, 2020 is on course to be the 10th consecutive year of above-normal temperatures. A record-breaking wet February and dry spring in places led to flooding followed by a national hosepipe ban. These are extremes that we expect to see more of as our climate continues to change.”There are enough standout figures to indicate there are no grounds for complacency in relation to extreme weather, though “there might not have been as much damage as other years – and thankfully no deaths”, he says.For starters, Lambkin points to 2.5 times more rainfall in February – 16 of 25 monitoring stations recorded their wettest February ever – and records being broken during “a very unseasonal Storm Ellen” in August. What’s more, 19 of the 20 years of this century have had an above-normal temperature.The picture globally is more obvious in terms of extremes. 2020 has been marked by a record hurricane season in the Atlantic wildfires across the planet, from Siberia to the Americas to Australia accelerating melting ice sheets in polar regions and record temperatures in a great many pockets of the planet.In contrast, Ireland is in a “longer burner” scenario, as he describes it. We have variable weather normally, which will continue, Lambkin adds, but with potential for more extreme events, where roofs may come off stadiums and flood defence walls are broken.So while there may be a perception that 2020 was a relatively benign year, the picture from the perspective of a climatologist looking at trends over a longer period is “very consistent”.DroughtsThat means wetter winters and drier springs including droughts than we have been used to. So rainfall will increase by some 10 per cent, but how that manifests itself will be the critical factor. A complex interaction of rain, winds and tides will often combine, resulting in extreme weather events that will be increasingly evident.In the case of February, it was the amount of rain that fell which was the standout feature. That was quickly followed an extended drying period. “So 2020 is a great example of that trend,” Lambkin explains.Huge variation this year was typified in the switch from record rainfall to parts of the east having their driest spring on record. Countrywide, only 58 per cent of normal rainfall fell in March, April and May. During August, sustained wind and gust records were broken during Storm Ellen.As 2020 draws to a close, the world has experienced the warmest decade on record and one of the three hottest years ever measured, according to the World Meteorological Organization.This is in spite of a La Niña event, Lambkin says – when natural weather patterns cool global temperatures. This is expected to peak in intensity in coming weeks and continue through the early part of next year.Record warm years usually coincide with a strong El Niño event – when surface water in the equatorial Pacific becomes warmer than average and east winds blow weaker than normal, as was the case in 2016.We are now experiencing a La Niña, which has a cooling effect on global temperatures, but has not been sufficient to put a brake on this year’s heat, Lambkin confirms.And despite Covid-19 lockdown, global concentrations of greenhouse gases continue to rise. “The science is complex, but the message is clear: to reduce the extremes, we must reduce the warming,” he adds. “The warming we see globally is also observed here in Ireland and it is this warming that increases the risk of more extreme weather events.”Of most concern, this warming is “on an accelerating path, and there is no real slowing the trend downwards”.The global pictureA report by Christian Aid shows extreme weather events occurred in all continents during 2020, many of which caused death and widespread economic damage.The report – Counting the cost 2020: a year of climate breakdown – details the most destructive climate disasters of the year.Ten of those events cost $1.5 billion or more, with nine of them causing damage worth at least $5 billion. Most of these estimates are based only on insured losses, meaning the true financial costs are likely to be higher.Among them is Storm Ciara, which struck Ireland, the UK and other European countries in February, costing $2.7 billion and killing 14 people.While the report focuses on financial costs, which are usually higher in richer countries because they have more valuable property, some extreme weather events were devastating in poorer countries, though the price tag was lower. South Sudan experienced one of its worst floods on record, which killed 138 people and destroyed the year’s crops.Some of the disasters hit fast, such as Cyclone Amphan, which struck the Bay of Bengal in May, fuelled by record warm temperatures in nearby seas, and caused losses valued at $13 billion in just a few days. Other events unfolded over months, such as floods in China and India, costing an estimated $32 billion and $10 billion respectively.Six of the 10 most costly events took place in Asia, five of them associated with an unusually rainy monsoon. And in Africa, huge locust swarms ravaged crops and vegetation across several countries, causing damage estimated at $8.5 billion. The outbreak has been linked to wet conditions brought about by unusual rains fuelled by climate change.Hurricane seasonIn Europe, two extra-tropical cyclones, Ciara and Alex, had a combined cost of almost $6 billion (€4.88 billion), while the US suffered from both a record-breaking hurricane season and a record-breaking fire season adding up to more than $60 billion (€48.82 billion) in damage.Some less-populated places also suffered the consequences of a warming world. In Siberia, a heatwave during the first half of the year set a record in the city of Verkhoyansk, with temperatures reaching 38 degrees.Heat and drought drove the fires in Bolivia, Argentina, Paraguay and Brazil. While there were no human casualties reported from these events, it had a terrible impact on bioersity and the planet’s capacity to respond to a warmer world.While climate disruption may have influenced these events, many of the countries that bear little responsibility for global warming were affected, the report underlines.“Whether it be floods in Asia, locusts in Africa or storms in Europe and the Americas, climate change has continued to rage in 2020,” said report author Dr Kat Kramer, Christian Aid’s climate policy lead. “It is vital that 2021 ushers in a new era of activity to turn this tide. With president-elect Biden in the White House, social movements across the world calling for urgent action, post-Covid green recovery investment and a crucial UN climate summit hosted by the UK, there is a major opportunity for countries to put us on a path to a safe future.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4447675.1609360463!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ireland in level 5 third nationwide lockdown to last until at least the end of january","story":"Taoiseach Micheál Martin has announced the return of Level 5 Covid-19 restrictions for at least one month, warning that measures to combat the spread of coronavirus are likely to continue after January 31st.

Photograph: Julien Behal PhotographyPA Wire The country will on Thursday enter a third nationwide lockdown to last until at least the end of January following the rapid spread of coronavirus.Schools will remain closed until January 11th in order to give families 10 days to minimise their social contacts.All non-essential retail will close from Thursday night while social gatherings or visitors in the home are no longer permitted.The public is being told to stay at home and not travel beyond a five-kilometre limit. Indoor and outdoor sports such as in gyms, as well as tennis and golf, will also not be permitted.Speaking at Government Buildings following a special Cabinet meeting, Taoiseach Micheál Martin said the virus is “spreading at a rate that has surpassed the most pessimistic models available to us”.It is understood that Tánaiste Leo Varadkar warned the Cabinet it is unlikely many of the restrictions will be lifted after the mooted end date of January 31st, while Ministers were also warned of the significant impact the move will have on the economy.Mr Varadkar said on Wednesday night the decision to enter a stricter lockdown represented a “very hard blow for workers and employers alike”.The pandemic unemployment payment will remain in place at current rates until the end of March at least, under a memo to be brought to Cabinet next week by the Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys. Some 40,000 additional workers will be laid off in the coming weeks in light of the tightened restrictions. Businesses forced to close from Thursday will be given a double payment for two weeks under the Covid Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS).‘Scarring effect’The Taoiseach warned, however, that there will be a long-term “scarring effect” on the economy.“The economic cost is significant. The concern we would have is around the impact on certain sectors and companies in terms of a long-term scarring effect, so we will continue to evaluate that.”While Mr Martin said schools will reopen on January 11th, a Government statement said there would be a “further review on the precise situation in advance of that date”.The Taoiseach said it is “fair to say quite a number of these restrictions will continue beyond the end of this month”.Green Party leader Eamon Ryan said the ban on travel from Britain will be extended until January 6th while a separate ban on travel from South Africa has also been announced until the same date after a similar new strain of Covid-19 was found there.For the second day in a row, a new record for additional cases of the virus was set, with 1,718 positive tests reported. Another 13 Covid-related deaths were also confirmed.Public health officials responded to the worsening figures by telling people to “stay home” so transmission of the virus can be limited.Partial reductionThey also warned of up to 3,000 new cases a day and 1,200 patients in hospital by the end of January, even with partial reduction in transmission of the virus.Chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan said Ireland was once again in a mitigation phase, meaning resources should be focused on those who are sickest.The Health Service Executive (HSE) warned the testing and contract tracing system is approaching maximum capacity.Continued exponential growth in cases will challenge the system and reduce the marginal benefit it provides, officials said.The benefit of iniduals taking action to prevent infection “far outweighs” what testing and tracing can currently achieve, HSE chief executive Paul Reid told a briefing.Most indicators of the disease have sharply deteriorated in the past week, with a 41 per cent increase in testing and a 129 per cent rise in contact-tracing calls.The number of Covid-19 patients in hospital increased to 455 on Wednesday, up from 411 the previous day. ICU numbers rose slightly to 37, up three.The reproduction number, a measure of the extent to which the virus is transmitting, is currently estimated at 1.6-1.8, and case numbers are doubling every seven to 10 days.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4447677.1609366229!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"level 5 restrictions to remain in place until january 31st says taoiseach","story":"Taoiseach Micheál Martin has announced the return of Level 5 Covid-19 restrictions for at least one month, warning that measures to combat the spread of coronavirus are likely to continue after January 31st.

From January 3rd, up to six guests are permitted.Universities are being asked to continue operating primarily online, while creches will remain open “with protective measures”.Preschools or early learning services will resume from January 4th.The Department of Housing has confirmed that a moratorium on evictions will be reintroduced from midnight until February 10th due to the curbs on travel.Sports matches and events are banned, except for elite levels. Gyms, leisure centres and swimming pools will close and golf and tennis should not take place. Exercise or dance classes will not be allowed.The ban on flights and ferries coming from Britain into the Republic will be extended until January 6th, while travel from South Africa will also be prohibited.The travel ban had been put in place over fears of a new Covid-19 variant identified in southeast England, and was previously extended until December 31st.The new variant, which is believed to be significantly more transmissible, has since been detected in the Republic.New arrangements would be put in place after that date, and “limited repatriation” of Irish residents left stranded in Britain would continue in the meantime, the source said.A different mutant variant of Covid-19 is prevalent in South Africa.‘Deteriorate’In his address to nation, Mr Martin said the new UK strain of Covid-19 was here and the virus was spreading at a rate faster than even the most pessimistic modelling, putting the health service under strain. On Tuesday, 18 per cent of positive cases were this strain.We are already seeing a sharp rise in hospitalisations, he said, almost doubling in one week. The R number is now between 1.6 and 1.8.“The numbers will deteriorate further over the coming days,” he said, and that we will “do what we need to do” to suppress it.This now includes “full scale Level 5 restrictions for at least one month”.He said we now have safe and effective vaccines and factories working around the clock to produce them.“For the first time since this awful disease\u0026nbsplanded on our shores we truly have an end in sight.“The virus can still do immense damage until we have progressed much much further with the vaccination programme.”Until then, we have to continue protecting the vulnerable, he added.“Right now this is what we must do. We must stay at home and eliminate contacts with others now.”In a press conference after his announcement, Mr Martin said: “I think it’s fair to say that quite a lot of these restrictions will continue on beyond the end of this month.”Tánaiste Leo Varadkar said: “The next three months in Ireland are going to be difficult, they will be as difficult as the last nine months were”, adding that while he was optimistic about vaccines it was important not to give people false hope.Mr Varadkar said 50,000 people were laid off on Christmas Eve when hospitality closed but that supports remain.On economic cost, Mr Martin said this was “significant”. Last week’s measures made 50,000 people unemployed and Wednesday’s measures could add 40,000 more.The National Public Health Emergency Team reported 13 coronavirus-related deaths and 1,718 new cases of Covid-19 on Wednesday, more than the previous record reported on Tuesday.A Cabinet meeting was hastily arranged on Tuesday following what was described as an “exponential” increase in the number of cases, the highest number of hospitalisations since May and a massive rise in referrals of suspected cases in the past week.Minsters said they expected numbers to continue to grow sharply over the coming days reflecting increased social contacts at Christmas. “This is perhaps the most dangerous moment for the country since Covid-19 began,” said one Minister, speaking on the basis of anonymity.Vaccine rolloutIreland started its vaccine rollout on Tuesday and Annie Lynch, a 79-year-old Dublin grandmother, on Tuesday became the first person in the Republic to be vaccinated against Covid-19.She was among 2,000 people, mostly frontline health workers, who received the first supply of the vaccine in four hospitals in Dublin, Galway and Cork.Ireland is set to receive an additional one million doses of the PfizerBioNTech vaccine after the EU responded to surging case numbers by ramping up orders for the one treatment it has so far authorised.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4447649.1609362750!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"we are shutting schools leaving off licences open as old questions remain","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe UK has now approved two vaccines while Ireland waits for decisions from the European Medicines Agency, which has taken a more “relaxed” approach to authorisations without any visible benefit so far. Photograph: Getty Images Politicians don’t do panic, not officially, but there was more than a touch of desperation to the latest responses of the Irish and British governments to surging Covid-19 case numbers.Both Micheál Martin and Boris Johnson were forced on Wednesday to pull down the shutters on society given the paucity of alternative ways they have of tackling the virus.Almost a year since we started fighting the disease, lockdown remains the fallback response of politicians when they can no longer ignore the warnings delivered by public health officials.With the decision to delay the reopening of schools in the Republic, the final plank in the Government’s strategy for tackling Covid-19 has been swept away.Ministers may contend that the delay is just for a few days, but we have heard a similar refrain before in relation to the closure of schools and the length of lockdowns generally.As a nation we are now shutting our schools and depriving our students of a proper education, while at the same time leaving off-licences open. This even though alcohol has repeatedly been identified as a driver of unsafe socialisation and although the biggest rises in case numbers are occurring in 18- to 34-year-olds, traditionally the biggest consumers of alcohol.The same criticisms can be made of Martin’s speech as were made about previous announcements by taoisigh. No mention of effective quarantine arrangements, for example, or measures to tackle the Border issue.Border countiesWhile case numbers are rising across the country, they are highest now in three Border counties – Donegal, Monaghan and Louth. This has been the trend for months yet no meaningful action has been taken until this month thanks to lockdown decisions in both jurisdictions.And while Johnson’s government may have made a hames of responding to the crisis for much of this year, the UK appears to be leading the way in terms of vaccine approval and genetic research into the virus.Most care-home residents in the North have already been vaccinated, while the Republic’s vaccination programme in nursing homes only starts next week.The UK has now approved two vaccines while Ireland waits for decisions from the European Medicines Agency, which has taken a more “relaxed” approach to authorisations without any visible benefit so far.At this stage it is unclear whether the new UK and South African variants of the virus are as much a threat as they have been made out to be, but if this does prove the case we will be indebted to the work of scientists in London and Porton Down, not Brussels.This new lockdown will work to a point. The Christmas effect will wear off most people will hole themselves up for January. Things will get worse for a while, then improve.But then what?The old questions remain what do you do then? Do you lift restrictions at the end of January, just as we did at the start of this month? Or do you continue the lockdown into the spring, with all that entails?Single digitsThere is no prospect, given the suite of measures being applied, the failings in quarantine and other areas, and the declining compliance in sections of the population, of eliminating the virus or reducing numbers to, say, single digits.Ireland, it has to be said, is not alone in Europe is facing this conundrum. Many countries with previously good track-records have fallen by the wayside including ourselves, with currently the fastest growth in cases on the continent.It follows that the only game in town from now on is the vaccine. Should we go down the emergency authorisation route used by the UK? Should we focus on giving the maximum number of people a first dose of the PfizerBioNTech vaccine, rather than holding two doses for a smaller group?We have to show alacrity and agility in rolling out what options there are if we are to hope to lift the shutters again early(ish) in 2021.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4448039.1609425148!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit what you need to know about what changes from january 1st","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe UK is set to leave the transition period it entered after its departure from the EU last January. File photograph: Justin TallisAFP via Getty ImagesWhat happens on January 1st?Well to be exact, at 11pm on December 31st – midnight Central European Time – the UK leaves the transition period it entered after its departure from the EU last January. This cuts its ties with the EU and means it leaves the single market and customs union, the arrangements which allow goods, money, people and services to flow freely across the bloc’s borders. It is a fundamental change, ending 28 years of membership of the EU single market and coming 48 years after the UK joined the EU.Brexit – the UK’s exit from the EU – already happened at the end of January this year. But in terms of the practicalities which affect businesses and consumers not much changed then, as the transition period came in to allow a deal on the future relationship between the two sides to be negotiated. This deal was agreed – just in time – ahead of the deadline of the end of the transition period.What does the deal mean?The EU and UK did a “trade and co-operation agreement” on their future relationship – so there is a deal on how a lot of things will work and a framework to go forward. As part of this, no damaging tariffs, or import duties, will generally apply on trade. But a lot is still going to change. Irish companies trading with Britain will have to meet customs rules, fill out documentation and notifications, ensure VAT is paid properly and meet rules for product standards. Particular complexities apply to trade in food and animals to safeguard consumers – and in some industries to rules on where products originate and how they are regulated.What does all this mean for Irish businesses?It means additional costs for importers and exporters, though it won’t have the kind of big and immediate impact a no-deal exit would have meant. The UK market could become tougher in the years ahead for Irish companies – for example, beef producers could face new competition from lower-cost producers from outside the EU in the UK market.Will there be delays getting goods around?There could be. Early January is often quiet for trade and some companies will have stockpiled goods. But there could be delays in goods moving between Ireland and Britain as new customs rules bed in – and in the longer term it may all just take a bit longer. And goods travelling between Ireland and continental EU markets could face delays on the landbridge through Britain as new controls come in at French ports. We already saw delays before Christmas as the French closed off entry from the UK due to the new Covid strain. The EU is to introduce new border controls on goods entering from Britain immediately, while the UK has said it will phase in controls on goods entering from the EU over six months.And there are special plans for Northern Ireland?Yes. Goods will be able to flow freely to and from the Republic and on to the EU as Northern Ireland remains aligned with certain EU rules. However, there will be new checks on goods crossing from Britain to the North. There are some phase-in arrangements here too. What about prices in the shops?The good news is that there won’t be tariffs, which would have added to prices, notably to those of groceries and supermarket goods. The bad news is that customs and other bureaucracy are a cost to businesses and some of this will likely be passed on to consumers. An ESRI report calculated that this could add up to €890 a year to average Irish shopping costs due to higher prices on UK imports. This was on the assumption that the full cost was passed on and that consumers did not substitute the imports with cheaper goods – both likely to happen to an extent. Even without tariffs there are big extra costs for businesses and somewhere consumers are likely to pay.But duty free is back?Yes it is – at least in airports when coming from Britain and when making similar journeys on ferries, subject to limits. However, it will not apply to people travelling between Northern Ireland and the Republic, as under the special arrangements for it the North will continue to follow enough EU rules to avoid a trade border on the island.And online shopping?Consumers have been warned that they will lose EU consumer rights on goods bought online from the UK and charges will be levied by many UK online companies for returns, which are currently generally free. VAT will also be payable as goods are imported into the Republic, which will generally be part of the price of purchase. In some cases retailers may add charges to account for the cost of meeting customs requirements. However, import duties will not be payable, as would have been the case had the UK exited the EU trading regime without a deal. Are there other consumer issues?A lot of smaller ones may emerge – but the State’s membership of the Common Travel Area with the UK and deals attached to this will avoid many which will apply between the UK and the rest of the EU. Irish drivers in the UK will be able to travel with their Irish insurance discs, for example. And the often complex rules which will now apply between the UK and other EU countries on everything from business trips to recognising professional qualifications will not be a problem between the UK and the State. However, there are wrinkles – people driving in the Republic on a UK licence need to change it for an Irish one, for example.So the Common Travel Area is protecting us from wider changes?Yes. From July 1st EU citizens – except for Irish ones – will not have the right to live and work in the UK. Citizens of Northern Ireland can continue to enjoy the right to live and work across the EU if they have an Irish passport. What about the level playing field we were hearing so much about during the talks?A deal here was sorted, to meet the EU demand that UK companies could not get a competitive advantage by having regulations significantly lower than those applying in the EU, or getting aid from the UK government. Britain does not have to follow changes in EU standards, but there is a complex mechanism where either side can object if it feels the other is gaining an unfair advantage. To what extent this will be used remains to be seen.And fish? The Irish fleet will lose some access to UK waters and faces uncertainty as the deal on fisheries comes up for review after a 5½-year phase-in period. The Government has promised compensation.What does it mean for services like banking, aviation and so on? The deal had a lot less on these that it did on goods trade. UK banks will find it harder to operate in EU markets. There is a special deal on aviation, including new ownership rules, and the likelihood of a data exchange deal in the short term. Rules for hauliers will change. It all shows how complex the EU single market is and the complexity of leaving it.So it’s over?Well, kind of. But the new future relationship deal involves a host of new committees and procedures, a range of dispute resolution processes, and, wait for it, the option to review the whole deal in 2024. The deal is done, but Brexit will always be with us.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches. See more here.

Photograph: Brendan SmialowskiAFP via Getty ImagesBack to full-blown Level 5 then? And earlier than we thought. Why is it happening now? An emergency Cabinet meeting was held on Wednesday evening, with Covid-19 infections surging and the numbers in hospitals with the virus climbing alarmingly. After the meeting Taoiseach Micheál Martin confirmed the country was moving back to Level 5 in the Living with Covid-19 framework.Why was ramping-up of restrictions agreed to?It is all about the numbers. As the Cabinet was meeting, a further 1,718 cases of coronavirus were announced, bringing the total number of cases since the start of the pandemic to 90,157 in the Republic. Wednesday’s figure was the highest daily tally since the start of the crisis in February. A further 13 deaths relating to Covid-19 were also announced, taking the total number of deaths relating to the virus to 2,226.Are those numbers as terrible as they sound?Yes, and it has been widely anticipated that things are only likely to get worse in the days ahead. “This is perhaps the most dangerous moment for the country since Covid-19 began,” one Minister said ahead of the meeting.It is approaching capacity. With widespread transmission of the virus now occurring in the community, the benefit of iniduals taking action to prevent infection “far outweighs” what testing and tracing can achieve, according to HSE chief executive Paul Reid.So, what was decided at the Cabinet meeting?All Level 5 restrictions were agreed,\u0026nbspincluding the closure on Thursday evening of non-essential retail and the re-imposition of restricted movement to within 5km which came into effect at midnight on Wednesday.Gyms and swimming pools must stay closed from close of business Thursday. Golf and tennis clubs are closed.No visitors are permitted in private homes or gardens (except for essential family reasons such as providing care to children, elderly or vulnerably people).Organised outdoor gatherings are not allowed, people may meet only one person from another household when taking exercise.Funerals are limited to 10 mourners. Wedding parties cut to just six people from January 3rd. People are being asked to work from home.School holidays are to be extended by almost a week and will not reopen until January 11th. The situation is expected to be reviewed before that date.Yes. Even the smallest of New Year’s Eve house parties have been knocked on the head. The Government is ending a concession which would have allowed two families to socialise in one home until December 31st.And rules already in place will remain?Gastro-pubs and restaurants will have to stay closed, although takeaway and delivery services will be allowed. Hairdressers, salons, cinemas, galleries and museums also closed on Christmas Eve and will remain shut. Mass and religious services have moved online only.What about schools?Schools are to remain closed until January 11th. Students were due to return on January 6th. Higher, further and adult education should remain primarily online. Early Learning and Chidcare Services are open with protective measures.The Department of Housing has confirmed that a moratorium on evictions will be reintroduced from midnight on Wednesday until February 10th due to the curbs on travel. The Government have further agreed the ban on air travel and passenger travel on ferries from the UK will be extended to January 6th. As a similar new strain has been identified in South Africa, this ban will also apply to South Africa.And when will all the new restrictions end?It is hard to say for sure. The Taoiseach said the restrictions will be in place until the end of January. However, he admitted many of the measures could remain beyond that point. Tánaiste Leo Varadkar has previously indicated that there is a case for Level 5 restrictions staying in place until those most at risk are vaccinated.What about the vaccines?There has been mixed news on this front. By the end of the week about 40,000 doses of the PfizerBioNTech vaccine should be in the country. This will be followed by 40,000 per week throughout January and early February, which will largely be for nursing homes. Ireland is set to receive an additional one million doses after the EU responded to surging case numbers by ramping up orders for the one treatment it has so far authorised. European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said the EU will now take an additional 100 million doses of the vaccine, on top of the 200 million already ordered.And the bad news?There have been delays in the approval of other vaccines Ireland is due to get. The rollout of the Oxford University-AstraZeneca vaccine is unlikely to go ahead as hoped in January after a senior official in the European Medicines Agency said regulators did not have enough information about it. Ireland has ordered 3.3 million doses of this vaccine. It has also ordered 3.3 million doses of the SanofiGSK vaccine, but this is delayed until late 2021.And what about the new variant of Covid-19?At the time of writing seven cases of the new, more transmissible variant of Covid-19, first identified in the UK, have been sequenced in the Republic, along with one in Northern Ireland, according to a new risk assessment from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. It added that while there is no information to suggest that infections with the new strain are more severe, because of increased transmissibility, the impact of the virus is assessed as high in terms of hospitalisations and deaths.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"Northern Ireland secretary could detract from Blair statement of regret, officials feared-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4448058.1609427568!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"additional 700 customs officers hired to keep freight moving in calais","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe terminal building at Calais Port, France. Photograph: Sharon GaffneyFrench customs officials say there is unlikely to be a repeat of the chaos experienced by truck drivers in parts of northern France and the UK in recent weeks, after the Brexit transition period ends at 11pm Irish time on Thursday.Thibaut Rougelot, head of regional communications with the French customs service, said traffic between Calais and Dover had decreased significantly, but might begin to return to normal levels early next week.Speaking on Thursday during a tour of the new facilities set up at the Calais terminal ferry, Mr Rougelot said the infrastructure now in place should help to keep freight moving smoothly. He said that an additional 700 customs officers had been taken on in anticipation of Brexit.From Friday, new systems will be in operation at Calais that require truck drivers to have a barcode confirming that their online customs forms have been completed. The infrastructure cost the port authority €13 million to install.Mr Rougelot conceded that there may be some teething problems as companies and drivers get used to the new post-Brexit trade rules.“If the drivers are delayed here at Calais because they don’t have their online customs declarations filled in correctly, they will know what to do the next time they travel through the port. There may be some difficulties initially.”The port has set up two lanes for incoming traffic. Drivers directed to the green route can travel onwards out of Calais, but those who have not completed their customs declarations are sent to the orange lane and into an on-site car park for further checks.Customs officials expect that there will not be much disruption to traffic over the coming weeks. “Many companies started stockpiling goods at the start of December in order to avoid being caught up in potential delays at the ports of Dover and Calais”, added Mr Rougelot.He said that overall this year traffic on the route had decreased, from two million trucks crossing the Channel by ferry last year, to 1.7 million in 2020. The customs official said this was due to a combination of factors, including the current health crisis and Brexit.Mr Rougelot said that it would be interesting to see how the new ferry routes being launched between Rosslare and Dunkirk would operate.He said that the voyage would take almost 24 hours, making it longer than travelling through the UK and into Europe through Calais (17 hours). He said it would also be more expensive.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches. See more here.

It’s time for the bubble to be popped.Irish people coast on the status of English as an international lingua franca. To a certain extent this is an advantage – Irish speechwriters are in demand in Brussels – but it is also marginalising.The Anglophone bubble means that Irish people are more familiar with the dynamics of the US Congress or Westminster than they are with matters with quite direct import for the country and the internal EU balance of power, such as who may replace German chancellor Angela Merkel or the upcoming presidential race in France.It may be contributing to the shortage of Irish people joining EU institutions. Just five Irish citizens entered the concours recruitment programme for the EU institutions in the last five years – far below the level needed to replace those retiring, and potentially making for a shortage in influential positions in years to come.For Ireland to function effectively in the EU, this will have to change.With Britain’s exit from the EU, Ireland has lost a major ally in defending its interests. To advocate for itself now, the country will need multilingual advocates who are fluent not just in different languages but also in the history and culture of our EU allies.Painfully often, the Irish figures in any given room in Brussels are linguistically limited, and it shapes their opportunities and how people behave towards them. It’s assumed that English should be used for the Irish person’s benefit, that translation will be required if other languages are used, and it excludes the Irish person from conversations, opportunities, and involvement.The same goes for most British, American, or Australians as fellow Anglophones, but in Brussels now it’s just the Irish in the room.Discussion of the issue often rapidly descends into psychodrama and self-flagellation, with an outpouring of old grievances about school experiences and complex feelings towards Irish.Please resist reacting to this article along these old familiar lines. There’s nothing surprising or unusual in the low level of foreign language skills we have in Ireland. It’s not due to a unique failing in our schooling system.This is a phenomenon that is common to all the Anglophone countries, and it’s because we can get away with it. The sheer amount of media produced by Britain and the US and their cultural clout means that Irish people can easily live in a comfortable bubble of English and never need venture out of it. Exposure to other languages is simply drowned out by the volume.The situation is different for people in countries in which the dominant language is something other than English. They will come up against English all the time, whether in the films on in the cinema or the songs of their favourite popstars, alongside the imperative that to learn broadens horizons.We err in Ireland in sometimes thinking that we can only afford one other non-English language. A typical European might in different scenarios grow up using a local language, one or more “official” national tongues, English, and whatever is spoken in the countries next door. Multilingualism is a global norm, not the exception, as is several languages being used within families.In a typical day in my job, I might be responding to emails in French, organising a delivery in Dutch, making calls in Italian, following a press conference in any of the other 27 EU languages, and with a cúpla focal here and there as Gaeilge through a press conference with Micheál Martin or texts with a friend.As is the norm, my comfort level in different languages varies according to the scenario and how frequently I’m using them. Mostly, my speech is clumsy and error-strewn, but every bit of knowledge I have of languages is concretely and practically useful in my everyday life.How to pop the Anglophone bubble in Ireland is a challenging question, but I do have one idea based on my own experience.Classroom learning of languages never worked for me. But I found exposure to real-life use of languages transformational. Whether visiting the Gaeltacht as a teenager or on an exchange to Italy, I found that when the language was used around me and I needed to adopt it to communicate, I became conversant within weeks.My suggestion is therefore that Ireland should become the EU’s strongest advocate for expanding take-up of the Erasmus programme and extending it to exchanges at secondary school level. It’s something that has the potential to transform the lives of young people, but may also be seriously important for Ireland’s strategic interests in the years ahead.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4448054.1609426440!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ghostly atmosphere on one of last ferries to britain before brexit takes hold","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            Waiting game: Holyhead Port freight check in on Thursday. Photograph: Peter MurtaghThursday’s early morning ferry from Dublin to Holyhead, one of the last before the January 1st imposition of a European Union trade border between the island of Ireland and the United Kingdom, had a ghostly quality to it.The Irish Ferries Ulysses has capacity for almost 2,000 passengers, together with 1,342 cars and 241 trucks. In the event, there were perhaps 50 cars, ided roughly even between Irish and UK registration plates.Freight trailers were visible mainly by their absence. I saw just four.The ship’s cafe was empty for almost the entirety of the crossing. In Boylan’s Restaurant, half the chairs were stacked on tables, such was the absence of demand. The freight driver’s separate eating area was closed, apparently due to lack of clientele.In the ship’s shop, festooned with sweatshirts, tourist tat, perfumes and alcohol, the absence of customers allowed the crew member in charge to concentrate instead on stacking shelves for the expected onslaught of shoppers once January 1st has come - and duty free has returned.A similar “calm before the storm” feeling attends the motorway standard A55 dual carriageway that leads from Holyhead, across Holy Island and slicing on through Anglesey to the Britannia Bridge over the Menai Strait.For five miles outside the north Wales ferry terminal, the second busiest in the UK, one side of the A55 has been designated a lorry park, similar to the approach road to Dover in Kent.EU Exit Contraflow, announces an LED sign amid the hundreds of traffic cones and dayglo finger posts that shepherd cars off the west-bound carriageway into Holyhead and onto the other side, leaving the approach road free for the thousands of trucks that may have to stop there if their papers are rejected at the Port and they are turned away from the ferries. But for now, the vast linear lorry park is completely empty — not a rejected truck in sight.From 11pm Irish time on Thursday, December 31st, the UK formally leaves the EU Single Market and Customs Union, to be replaced by the trade agreement agreed on Christmas Eve between EU and UK negotiators, and since ratified by the British parliament.What happens on the ground is anyone’s guess. Where once, and for as long as almost anyone can remember, there were no border checks on goods moving around the Single Market between EU Member States, now everything going in or out of the UK from the remaining Member States must comply with the terms of the new agreement.That means importers and exporters, and those moving their products in or out of the UK, must have their paperwork in order. If it is not, the port operators have no option but to refuse a truck entry to the Port - hence the A55 holding area.The whole thing is called Operation Cbyi, named after the 6th century saint who founded a monastery on Holy Island and is the brainchild of the Welsh government and the Port authorities, not least Ian Davies of Stena Line who heads a team that in effect run the harbour.Waiting for January 1st and all that comes thereafter, he describes himself as calm and mentions Y2K, the millennium bug it was feared would crash computers on January 1st, 2000, leading to global mayhem, but which in the event made virtually no impact at all.If that happens this weekend, it will be due very substantially to planning and preparation.“Above the water, I’m fairly calm,” says Davies, but “like a duck, I’m paddling furiously . . .”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

lowering barriers for EU businesses, bolstering competition and strengthening environmental protection.The bloc says it has also managed to get Beijing to agree to “continued and sustained efforts” to ratify International Labour Organization (ILO) conventions on forced labour.“We have to remain realistic: this deal will not solve all the China-related challenges we face, of which there are many,” EU executive vice president Valdis Dombrovskis said“However, it ties China into significant commitments in the right direction - more than it has ever agreed before”.But European lawmakers warned that there is no way to compel China to make good on worker rights.And some in Brussels accuse Beijing of running a “government-led system of forced labour” targeting the Uighur and other Muslim minorities in Xinjiang province.China pushed past the United States in the third quarter of this year to become the EU\u0027s top trade partner as the Covid-19 pandemic disrupted the US economy while Chinese activity rebounded.The political accord comes just weeks before Biden will be sworn in as US president and with his team expressing concern over the EU\u0027s outreach to Beijing and urging Brussels to consult with Washington.While the deal should pave the way for EU firms to make inroads in areas including China\u0027s electric car, health, telecoms and financial services sectors, it also looks set to open up Europe\u0027s renewable energy market to Beijing.But an EU official said that the agreement would still allow inidual member states to block access for Chinese firms on national security grounds.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"republican senator contest electoral college win joe biden","story":"A Republican senator on Wednesday announced that he would object next week when Congress convenes to certify the electoral college vote, in a doomed attempt to upend Joe Biden’s victory.Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri broke with Mitch McConnell, Senate Majority Leader, and other prominent Republicans in declaring he would contest the certification of electoral college vote, following calls to do so from President Donald Trump.The challenge, which would prompt a floor debate and force senators to go on the record as to whether they believe there were voting irregularities in the November 3 election, means there will be at least a short delay in Mr Biden’s confirmation.Mr Trump will inevitably lose that vote, as Democrats control the House and a number of Senate Republicans have publicly recognised Mr Biden’s victory, including Senator Mitt Romney, who has called the president’s refusal to accept the election dangerous.Even in the unlikely event that Mr Trump were to prevail in the Senate, where Mike Pence, Vice President, would be in position to cast a tie-breaking vote if needed, the challenge still would fail given the House vote.Mr McConnell and other senior Republicans had sought to avoid a vote that will see Republicans forced to take sides either with or against the president. Mr Hawley, a constitutional lawyer, said he felt compelled to highlight purported election irregularities despite there being no evidence of any.“Millions of voters concerned about election integrity deserve to be heard,” he wrote on Twitter. “I will object on January 6 on their behalf.”“At the very least, Congress should investigate allegations of voter fraud and adopt measures to secure the integrity of our elections. But Congress has so far failed to act,” Mr Hawley said. The 40-year-old senator is rumoured to be positioning himself as a potential 2024 presidential candidate, and his move could be designed to appeal to the tens of millions of loyal Trump supporters.The Department of Justice, the Department for Homeland Security, election boards, judges, and other authorities have found no evidence of election malfeasance that impacted the President-elect Biden’s decisive win. The US Supreme Court has also declined to intervene. Any member of the House or Senate can contest the electoral votes on January 6. On Wednesday, Mr Pence refused to sign on to a plan that would upend Congress certifying the election for Mr Biden. Representative Louie Gohmert and Arizona\u0027s slate of Republican Electoral College “electors” filed a federal lawsuit to get a judge to say Mr Pence has the power to pick pro-Trump electors when he presides over the January Congressional session.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"britain strikes last minute deal keep gibraltar border open","story":"Britain has reached a deal with Spain for Gibraltar to join the Schengen open border zone, maintaining free-flowing movement to and from the Spanish mainland.The deal was announced by Spanish foreign minister Arancha González just hours before the Brexit deadline of midnight on December 31, at which point border checks would have been introduced, restricting the flow of goods and people.“The border fence is to be demolished,” said Ms González on Thursday. “We are knocking down the border to build an area of shared prosperity – that is the message from this agreement,” she addedUnder the deal struck on Thursday, Frontex, the EU’s border force, will “assist Spain” in controlling security at Gibraltar’s airport and port for a transition period of four years. Sources close to the negotiations said that the presence of Spanish security forces on Gibraltarian soil was a major sticking point.However, Ms González emphasised the fact that Spain would be responsible for the application of Schengen rules in the territory as it is a signatory of the European open-border treaty, while Britain is not. She would not be drawn on the exact details of whether Spanish agents would be involved in border security in Gibraltar or what might happen at the end of the four-year transition period.The minister said that Spain was satisfied with this in-principle agreement and was now handing over to the EU to finalise the details with the UK over the next six months.The current rules regarding movement in and out of Gibraltar and Gibraltarians’ existing rights to circulate in Spain and use healthcare services is to be maintained in the meantime.As talks over the post-Brexit relationship between Gibraltar and Spain approached the New Year’s Eve midnight deadline, residents of the territory had feared their livelihoods would be disrupted by friction at the border.On Wednesday Spain issued a decree with a package of temporary mitigation measures to ease the transition process for UK citizens and Gibraltarians, including the continued validity of UK driving licences for six months and the possibility of using Spanish hospitals, providing the British government offers reciprocal rights to Spanish nationals visiting the UK.The approximately 15,000 people, mostly Spaniards, who cross the border to work in Gibraltar each day will be able to continue to enter quickly without joining potentially long queues for passport checks as long as they have registered their status.Gibraltar was not part of the post-Brexit trade deal that was reached between Britain and the European Union last week. Spain has an effective veto on the Brexit trade deal applying to the Rock.Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said: Today, working side by side with the Chief Minister of Gibraltar, and following intensive discussions with the Spanish government, we reached agreement on a political framework to form the basis of a separate treaty between the UK and the EU regarding Gibraltar.We will now send this to the European Commission, in order to initiate negotiations on the formal treaty.“In the meantime, all sides are committed to mitigating the effects of the end of the Transition Period on Gibraltar, and in particular ensure border fluidity, which is clearly in the best interests of the people living on both sides.“We remain steadfast in our support for Gibraltar and its sovereignty. I am grateful to Foreign Minister Laya and her team for their positive and constructive approach. We have a warm and strong relationship with Spain, and we look forward to building on it in 2021.Gibraltar Chief Minister Fabian Picardo gave assurances that nothing in the agreement compromised Gibraltar’s position on sovereignty. Asked whether Spanish security forces would eventually be deployed in the territory under the agreement, Mr Picardo said: “People should not be concerned about that.”Asked how Gibraltar could now guarantee its security given that the border checkpoint between the Rock and Spain would disappear, Mr Picardo said that there would still be a “policing presence” in the narrow strip of land between Gibraltar and the Spanish town of La Línea.Mr Picardo said that while there would not be a formal checkpoint between Gibraltar and Spain, enhanced electronic surveillance technology would be deployed to control people entering the territory.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 forcing local primary school shut use postcode tool","story":"Primary schools in \u0027high infection areas\u0027 will close for the first time since the spring for at least two weeks to combat the spread of coronavirus, the Government has announced.  One million primary pupils in England will not return to classrooms on Jan 4, the scheduled start date for next term, with only key workers\u0027 and vulnerable children allowed to go back. Enter your school\u0027s postcode below to see if it is impacted by the new rules.Speaking in Parliament on Wednesday, the Education Secretary, Gavin Williamson, also announced that the return of most students to secondary schools had been delayed until Jan 18.He said: We must always act swiftly when circumstances change.

Knights are addressed as sir or dame, followed by their name.Recipients of the other honours have no title, but they can put the letters after their names.Here are a some who were recognised as part of Queen Elizabeth II\u0027s New Year\u0027s honours list. Geoffrey Cox QC, the former attorney general who last year controversially advised the Government that it was legal to prorogue Parliament for five weeks, has been awarded a knighthood. The advice from the Consevative MP for Torridge and West Devon was later overturned when the Supreme Court unanimously ruled the prorogation of Parliament as unlawful. Angela Eagle, the long serving Labour MP for Wallasey in Merseyside who is best known for her work promoting women’s and minority rights, is made a dame for parliamentary and political service.A 106-year-old volunteer who dedicated more than 50 years to a children’s charity has become the oldest ever recipient of an honour.  Anne Baker, from Salisbury, Wiltshire, was given an MBE for charitable services to the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC).Mrs Baker said it was a “great surprise” to receive the award, adding: “I’ve just been helping the NSPCC for about 50 years – I always have the party in my garden which normally makes about £1,000 a year, which is lovely.”“We couldn’t hold it this year but we still managed to raise £4,000.”For 11 years she has held a birthday coffee morning for the charity, usually raising more than £1,500. However, when it was cancelled this year due to the pandemic, she set up a JustGiving page in the hope technology could help raise funds.Her online appeal attracted donations from as far away as Austria and the United States, raising more than £4,000.The sister of murdered MP Jo Cox has described being made an MBE for her work fighting social isolation as “bittersweet”.Kim Leadbeater, an ambassador for the Jo Cox Foundation, was recognised by the Palace for stepping up the campaign during the pandemic as millions were suddenly cut off from their support networks.Ms Cox, a 41-year-old mother of two and Labour MP was shot and stabbed by a far-right extremist in 2016.Following her sister’s death, Ms Leadbeater began promoting causes Mrs Cox had campaigned about.She founded the Great Get Together – a series of events within communities to help people create ties and help those who are lonely to build support networks. Those meetings took  place online during the pandemic.Following the announcement she is to become an MBE, Ms Leadbeater said: “I am very honoured and humbled to receive this recognition.“I would have much preferred for my sister to be here carrying on the work she started on loneliness and so much else, but while this is sadly a bittersweet moment for our family, I know that Jo would be extremely proud.“For me this is not a personal achievement – it is an acknowledgment of the many people who have worked alongside me since Jo’s murder to make a difference on the issues she cared deeply about.”The parents of a 15-year-old girl who died from a severe allergic reaction after eating a baguette on a plane are to accept an OBE.Tanya and Nadim Ednan-Laperouse, who set up the Natasha Allergy Research Foundation in the name of their daughter, said the award is a tribute to their child.Natasha Ednan-Laperouse, from Fulham, west London, died of anaphylaxis after unknowingly eating sesame contained in an artichoke, olive and tapenade baguette she had bought from Pret a Manger at Heathrow Airport.She fell ill and collapsed on a flight to Nice in July, 2016.In a statement, her parents said: “We are humbled and honoured to accept these awards in the name of our beloved daughter Natasha.“Natasha was a passionate believer in social justice and the bright torch that she carried for others inspires us every day.”The honour is for their services to charity and for people with allergic disease. The foundation they set up intends to establish a research centre at the University of Southampton to find a cure for allergies.Mr and Mrs Ednan-Laperouse also managed to win new protections for food allergy sufferers under the introduction of “Natasha’s Law”, which will require all businesses in England and Northern Ireland to include full ingredients labelling on pre-packaged food from October 2021.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"new years eve pictures 2021 celebrations london world covid","story":"Fireworks explode over the Sydney Opera House and Harbour Bridge as New Year celebrations begin in Sydney, Australia. One million people would usually crowd the Sydney Harbor to watch the annual fireworks that center on the Sydney Harbour Bridge, but revellers have been asked to stay away this yearTravel latest: Holidays off for all Britons as more than 13,000 hotels forced to closeUS admits vaccination rollout is slower than hoped - and \u0026#39normality\u0026#39 may not return until autumnCoronavirus latest news: Government accused of living in \u0026#39parallel universe\u0026#39 over school testing plansDonald Trump to skip lavish NYE party to focus on overturning Biden victory in CongressWhat Tier 5 restrictions could include, and who it might affectNew Year\u0026#39s Eve: Muted celebrations as world welcomes 2021 - watch liveIs Covid-19 forcing your local primary school to shut?

What brought me up short was seeing a graphic illustrating the demands of “Tier 4”, in which I had already been residing for several days. Surrounded by a tape of black and yellow chevrons such as one would find at a crime scene, there was an enormous headline reading simply: “Stay Home”.On closer inspection it turned out that in Tier 4 one must not go out at all without a “reasonable excuse” such as for work that cannot be done at home or to an education setting or a trip to get essential household supplies. This discovery made no practical difference to me as I had already attained a near perfect anti-social mindset under the previous “very high” restrictions of Tier 3. “No man is an island,” wrote John Donne. Want a bet?Meanwhile in my experience younger generations have also simply stopped taking notice of the endless stream of edicts. Only in their case the zoning-out process seems to be leading to a full resumption of compulsive socialising. Like millions of us, I am punch drunk on these rules. I’ve been subjected to lobotomy by decree. I am not even angry about the restrictions anymore and haven’t been since the first vaccine came on stream as that was the moment that entirely changed the cost-benefit analysis on distancing and lockdowns.Given we now have two effective vaccines in the field, the second of which is a trusty workhorse that can be stored in a normal fridge, it is obvious that a policy of trying to minimise the spread of the virus until the vulnerable have had their shots is going to be followed and can save many lives. I am a bit sullen about the whole business, but I won’t rage against the policy for a couple of months ahead on one condition: that Boris Johnson provides us with a proper route map out of it.At his press conference yesterday he didn’t really do that. Yes, he painted a picture of mass vaccination allowing normal life to return in due course. But where are the staging posts and what is the timetable?On present policies, when will everyone over 70 or with an underlying health condition have been offered their first jab and had it in their systems for long enough to be protected? At what percentage level of vaccine coverage for the most vulnerable will restrictions on normal life start to fall away? When is that likely to be attained?Warm words about light at the end of the tunnel and the tunnel having become shorter and us moving through it faster are all very well, but as one of Mr Johnson’s much less gifted predecessors would have put it (all right, I mean John Major), they won’t butter many parsnips.In the days when Chris Tarrant presented the quiz show “Who Wants To Be A Millionaire” he used to dangle an intermediate cheque in front of contestants before adding “I don’t want to give you that” as a way of inviting them to continue advancing towards the magic, seven-figure jackpot. Mr Johnson was yesterday using a similar phrase to rebuff the requests of interviewers to be given more information about how many vaccine doses per week he expects to be administered in January, so as to give their viewers and readers more idea about just when things are going to get better.The PM has had his fingers burnt in the past by making rash predictions of victory over the virus – remember his “12 weeks to turn the tide” back in the spring or indeed his forecast of “significant normality” returning by Christmas – but back then he really was relying on guesswork.The pace of events has since accelerated, both in terms of the onset of mass vaccination and the mutation of the virus into a more infectious form. Astra-Zeneca boss Pascal Soriot was yesterday confidently speaking of being able to deliver two million doses a week by mid-January.Health Secretary Matt Hancock spoke about the NHS being able to administer the jabs “at the pace AstraZeneca can manufacture”, but again he refused to be pinned down on a figure.There is no reason why the PM should not give us another televised fireside chat in which he could set some qualified target dates – for instance for the end of Tier 4 restrictions or the reopening of hospitality – on the basis of vaccine roll-out going according to plan.A communicator as talented as Mr Johnson really should be doing more to take the public with him through the last phase of this epic struggle. After all, he will wish us to start behaving as responsible adults capable of making our own decisions again when it is all over. And if he doesn’t then Chancellor Rishi Sunak certainly will because he desperately needs us to start getting out there and creating wealth again.Trusting the people is an idea which has served Boris Johnson well in other regards – most notably over Brexit. Relying on “Project Fear” with its bombardment of doom-laden warnings is, by way of contrast, what did for the Remainers. People stopped listening.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"whales drawing yorkshire tourists dales coast says wildlife","story":"Whales are drawing Yorkshire tourists from the dales to the coast, the Wildlife Trusts have said, as they named the appearance of the marine mammals as one of their highlights of the year.Over the past two years, eco-tourists have flocked to the coast in the North of England to take advantage of brand-new whale-watching tours. The Wildlife Trusts have said that if Britain continues to conserve its ocean life, the country could become a global marine ecotourism hotspot. The minke whales were a particular highlight, and have over the year made the Yorkshire coastline their home, feeding just 100m from the shore. New businesses have been set up just to take tourists out to have a look at the astonishing ocean life.These whales are typically solitary, but some were seen feeding relatively close together, probably chasing the same shoals of fish. A humpback whale was also captured on film 7km off Flamborough Head by Jono Leadley from Yorkshire Wildlife Trust. Public sightings of minke whales have been rapidly increasing since 2015. They are now such regular visitors that a minke whale-watching industry has established in Yorkshire. Bex Lynam, North Sea Wildlife Trusts’ marine advocacy officer, told the : Bex Lynam, North Sea Marine Advocacy Officer for Yorkshire Wildlife Trust says: “Whale watching excursions from Yorkshire are a relatively new and exciting development for wildlife fans. Around five years ago, we weren’t aware of any whale watching boats setting off from local harbours. Today, we know of at least 10 boats that regularly run wildlife watching trips and in the last few years, half of these have been dedicating themselves to whale watching specifically for several months of the year. Many people will be amazed to learn that minke whale in particular are now established as a regular sight off Yorkshire.Other wildlife highlights of the year included the first orcas spotted in Northern Ireland’s Strangford Lough since 1962, a grey seal baby boom, with populations doubling in some areas, and a new northern sand lizard population, which is thriving for the first time in 50 years.An exciting discovery this year was rare evidence of a baby Risso\u0027s dolphin captured on camera by a wildlife enthusiast, clearly showing foetal folds that indicated it had just been born off the coast of Anglesey, Wales.The evidence indicates the Welsh coast could be an even more important place for the species than previously thought, North Wales Wildlife Trust said.Naturalist Sir David Attenborough warned that these sights may become even rarer if trawl fishing, cable-laying and plastic pollution continue.We\u0027re fortunate that our seas are protected by a blue belt of marine protected areas but sadly this does not prevent damaging activities still occurring in these special places, he said.For too long we have taken from the sea with little regard of the consequences,We are all aware of the problems presenting by plastic litter, but some pollutants and impacts are hidden from view, beneath the surface of the waves.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2020/12/16/16/Marcus-Rashford1.jpg","title":"marcus rashford universal credit permanent food poverty","story":"Article bookmarkedFind your bookmarks in your Independent Premium section, under my profileDon\u0026#x27t show me this message again✕Footballer Marcus Rashford is expected to hold a phone call with a senior member of Boris Johnson’s cabinet in a bid to boost welfare payments for hard-pressed families.The Manchester United star will reportedly call for the £20-a-week top-up to universal credit to be extended during a call with work and pensions secretary Thérèse Coffey sometime over the next fortnight. The £20-a-week top-up was introduced by the government as a temporary, 12-month measure in April to help Britons through the coronavirus pandemic – but ministers have refused to confirm whether the £6bn-a-year move will be retained in 2021.The Department for Work and Pensions is reviewing the temporary uplift in January as part of a regular look at the “economic and health conditions” faced by those living on low incomes across the UK.A spokesperson for the government said: “We are committed to supporting the lowest-paid families through the pandemic and beyond.“That’s why we have raised the living wage, boosted welfare support by billions of pounds and introduced a £170m Covid winter grant scheme to help children and families stay warm and well-fed during the coldest months.”"},{"url":null,"title":"beer pub lockdown driveway idea","story":"AdvertorialBeer-lover opens pub on drive for neighbours - now its won him a top awardWe partnered with the Halax to find Britain’s Best Neighbours - now Matthew has won £, worth of Love to Shop VouchersmirrorShareByDave Masters:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC AdvertorialMatthew Grays Driveway ArmsMissing Friday night pints at his local in lockdown, Matthew Gray decided to have a couple of cans with a neighbour at the front of his home in Heath and Reach.

The calls come as the start of term for most English secondary school pupils was delayed and primary school children will have to learn from home next week in Covid hotspots. Ms Longfield said: “Iaposve written to both the Secretary of State for Health [Matt Hancock] and Education [Gavin Williamson], asking them to make teachers a priority.” Tory Education Committee Chairman Robert Halfon said ensuring staff had received the jab would make it less likely schools need to close. He told BBC Breakfast: “What I also want to see is teachers, especially now that we’ve got the Oxford vaccine, that teachers and support staff are made an absolute priority for vaccinations becausewe can make sure that they’re vaccinated and they’re safe, it’s less likely that schools will have to close. “This two weeks has to mean two weeks - schools can’t just be a revolving door that never stands still, open one day, shut the next, because it’s very damaging to the le chances of these pupils.” The over-s, care home residents and frontline NHS and care staff are top of the list for the mammoth rollout of the Covid vaccine, which was given a boost by the approval of the Oxford AstraZeneca jab on Wednesday. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation identied nine priority groups for the first wave of jabs, in the hope of stamping out % of preventable deaths. Teachers and school staff have not been included in the first round, but the JCVI has suggested the next phase could include those at increased risk due to their jobs, such as first responders, troops, teachers and public servants.

Primary schools will remain shut to all but the neediest kids in  council areas - covering up to % of all pupils in England. Meanwhile secondary schools nationwide will only fully open from January , with Years  and  in from January . Education Secretary Gavin Williamson activated the “contingency framework” in a mark of how badly the new iant of Covid has spread.It comes despite he and Boris Johnson repeatedly saying the last thing they wanted to do was shut the schools. The PM insisted: “I stress that schools are safe and your kids are not at risk.” But he said the iant may be % more contagious. The th-hour change has prompted anger and bafflement among many of those hit in London and the Home Counties.  Liz Keeble, headteacher of a primary school in Basildon, Essex, said she learned from the television that her school would not reopen next week, before hearing from her bosses. She said: Itaposs a very dficult situation for everybody, these decisions are made right up to the wire.” And some city boroughs have had their schools closed while others right next door have them open. Here’s everything we know so far.Which areas are having schools closed  Primary schools are being shut to all but key workers’ and vulnerable children next week in  council areas. The areas affected are  out of the  boroughs of London,  boroughs in Essex,  boroughs in Kent, two in East Sussex, four in Hertfordshire, and Milton Keynes in Buckinghamshire. Importantly, these areas are not the same as all areas in Tier . Many other areas are in Tier , but primary schools there are remaining open. For a full list of the  areas with school closures, please scroll to the bottom of this article.How many pupils are affected It’s thought around a million primary school pupils, or % of all those in England, are affected by the closures. That is despite Gavin Williamson claiming only “a small number of areas where infection rates are highest would be affected.What’s happening with primary schools  In the  hotspot areas, primary schools will be closed to all but vulnerable children and key workers’ children.Key workers include health, education, justice, food, police, defence, fire, transport and utilities workers - a full list is here.Vulnerable children include those with an EHC plan, those in care or adopted children - a full list is here. If your child comes under this category you need to specically let the school know they will be attending. Other pupils should be given “high-quality remote education” by their school - in other words, learn from home. These closures will last for two weeks initially before the first review. That suggests they could change on January . If your primary school isn’t in one of the  council areas, it will open to all pupils from January .What’s happening with secondary schools  The plan is the same for secondary schools across England, whether or not they’re in the  hotspot areas. Across the whole of England, vulnerable and key workersapos children will go back from January , but all others will only get remote learning that week. Years  and  - who have exams coming up - will go back in person from January  and the rest of secondary school pupils willfrom January . Confusingly, after January , there could also end up being a local plan for secondary schools to partially close. If secondary schools are hit by the “contingency framework”, they’ll stay open to Years  and  and vulnerable and key workers’ kids only. Years , , ,  and  would need to learn from home. However, we don’t knowthis will happen yet because the plan from January  isn’t confirmed.What’s happening with nurseries, childcare and clubs Nurseries and childminders should remain open even in the worst-hit areas, the government said. However, school-based nurseries in primary schools have discretion to follow the same arrangements as that primary school. Community activities, before or after-school clubs, tuition and wraparound childcare should only run for vulnerable or key workers’ kids.What’s happening with other schools Alternative provision and special schools should continue to let pupils attend full-time. At boarding schools, pupils are only allowed to attend face-to-face learningthat would have been allowed in a non-boarding school in the same area.What’s happening with universities Courses where students are eligible toin early January have been further restricted compared to before. Medical and other courses where face-to-face teaching is necessary have been prioritised. For other courses, students are currently planned toover a two-week period from January  but this is still under review.Will exams go ahead Yes. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson insisted that exams will go ahead in the summer. He also said BTEC exams that are planned near the start of term will be “running absolutely as normal”.Will pupils get testing  Yes. The plan is for all secondary and college students and staff in England to be able to get two rapid tests, three days apart, at the start of term. The government claims the first starter packs of up to , test kits will arrive at all secondary schools and colleges on January . Ideally, test results will come back for most students before they actuallyto the classroom. But headteachers are facing a mammoth task of organising the testing regime in just one week. Gavin Williamson piled pressure on stressed school leaders, claiming he was absolutely confident secondaries will be able to run the regime. But NAHT general secretary Paul Whiteman said: “It is the right thing to do, but so far the government has not actually given schools the details as to how it will happen, or announced any extra resource or professional medical help. “We cannot see how mass testing in secondary schools is actually going to be feasible under the plans that have so far been released. “Certainly it will not be ready for the start of term.” There are , military personnel committed to supporting this testing but it’s more advice and guidance from afar than actually going into schools.Will pupils still get free school mealsthey’re at home  Yes - at least, they’re meant to. During term time, schools should “continue to provide free school meals or food parcels for eligible pupils who are not attending”. They “should work with suppliers to prepare meals or food parcels to be collected by, or delivered to, these eligible children during their time at home.”When will schools in the  areas reopen Unfortunately, there’s no single clear answer to this and we’ve had mixed messages from government. We know the “contingency framework” will be reviewed after two weeks, suggesting schools could reopen on January . However, the framework can also be reviewed earlier than this date, or it could be renewed keeping schools shut for longer.Could schools in more areas be shut Yes, it’s possible. The “contingency framework” that shuts primary schools is now activated so the list of areas hit can be made bigger, or smaller, by the government. Any changes would happen at the first review point, and be announced some time before January .Will teachers be prioritised for a vaccine It’s possible - but as of now they aren’t. Healthy teachers under  are just like all other healthy under-s, in that they’re not part of the first phase of the vaccine rollout. When we get to the second phase, it’s possible people will be prioritised by which occupation they have - but this isn’t confirmed. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said he wanted to see teachers prioritised but “this is a decision that will be made across government”.Why aren’t all Tier  areas having schools closed "},{"url":null,"title":"barclays close 65 more branches","story":"NewsBarclays announces plan to shut  more local branches - see full listEXCLUSIVE: Barclays has closed, or had plans to shut,  branches since  and the latest closures come despite the bank giant admitting some of those being axed have seen rising customer numbersmirrorShareCommentsByGraham HiscottHead of Business:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsBarclays is to axe  more branches \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Our free email newsletter sends you the biggest headlines from news, sport and showbizWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

On the eve of our departure, we asked for opinions from people in the most pro and anti-EU parts of the country. They were Cambridge, where one ward had the highest proportion of pro-EU voters, and Boston, Lincolnshire, which had the most Leave voters. CAMBRIDGE The university city is pro-EU and its Market Ward had the highest proportion of Remainers in the UK at .% Restaurateur Saoor Rahman feels uneasy for the future of his -month-old son Yusha in a post-Brexit world. His Raja Restaurant thrived after opening in  but is now, during a pandemic, struggling. But the  year-old reveals it was straight after the Brexit vote in June  that income first dwindled. He says he noticed fewer languages spoken at his tables and says: “Cambridge is a very international, student city... Brexit put a lot of people off coming.” Sai’s parents immigrated from Bangladesh and he worries racism, or at least fear of immigration, fuelled Brexit. Teacher Yolanda Warwick agrees. Originally from Greece, she is emotional as she admits having encountered hostility herself since the vote. The -year-old is married to a British man, has two British children, and has lived in the UK for  years after studying at Manchester Univserity. Yet after the vote some pupils taunted her: “Where’s your accent from  You’re not from around here, you’re not British”. She says quietly: “That was a shock.” Dr Alasdair Parker, , a consultant paediatric neurologist at Addenbrooke’s Hospital, fears an exodus of European colleagues. He says: “In Britain we still massively under-train, we produce a quarter of the number we need in the NHS. “And there are some areas where we are totally reliant on EU immigration. “In Addenbrooke’s I see that in highly specialist roles, things like radiotherapy, radiology, we have very high-quality people coming from Spain, Portugal and Italy.” BOSTON, LINCS  Alan Clarke and we Jean were among the .% of locals who voted Leave, making the town the UK’s most pro-Brexit place. The -year-old plans to hoist a Union Jack in his garden tonight to mark Brexit. He says: “I’m % not racist, I don’t have a problem with people coming here.” But Alan, who runs a shop in Ingoldmells, hankers after a time when “people were proud to be British” and adds: “Make Britain Great Again, that’s not a bad idea.” Cerri Fletcher is still fervently anti-EU. The fancy dress shop owner, who came to England from Ireland as a baby, says: “Everyone’s fed up of the Iranians, the Turkish and the Romanians. They’re causing... grief and stabbings, killings and dodgy business around Boston.” Many point to Boston’s Tory mayor being of Moroccan-French heritage as proof that Boston is not anti-immigration. Mayor Anton Dani, , in the country for  years and married to a Polish immigrant who is now a British citizen, says people don’t dislike foreigners, just their lack of integration.  He says: “There are people who have been living in Boston for the last ,  years and they can’t speak English.” But he thinks Brexit won’t alter immigration, saying: “People can still enter the country on a tourist visa... then overstay.” Polish financial advisor Iga Paczkowski, , says the referendum sparked hostility. She says: “It was quite painful. But over time people started being nice to us again.” People across the EU have been telling us what they think about our leaving. Amsterdam    Mick van Bemmel, , masters student I don’t understand. The pros do not weigh up against the cons. I am not worried about the future of the EU. All the years of negotiating have made it very clear it is not as easy as it may sound to leave. But it is not perfect yet...we have to look at long-term goals not short term gains. Berlin Stefan Jeka, , senior product manager I am concerned about possible changes within British society. If the negative impact of Brexit is getting severe, people with low income will be disproportionately affected. History told us more than once that this can lead to the rise of extremist views. Britain has made a mistake. Brexit is an experiment with a very uncertain outcome.

Jack Robson, , purchased a three-bedroom property in Gateshead back in February  for £, but only started living in it and doing it up this year. The SEO Consultant has since given the place a total makeover, beginning in March by ripping out all of the original features of the home, including decorative stained glass doors and s style block-work around the fireplace. His hard work on each room in the house cost £, in total and the place is now totally unrecognisable. Formerly a council house, the home was originally on the market for £,, but Jack managed to convince the sellers to lower the price due to the amount of work the property needed.The most expensive part of the renovation was in the kitchen, where the dated interiors were spruced up with a new floor, fresh paint and new cabinets and appliances, coming in at £,. Jack has also rewired the property, added new radiators and moved the fuse box. While doing all of this after work in the evenings and on the weekends, he slept in one of the spare bedrooms.  Speaking to Jam Press, he said: I was quite optimistic about the amount of work that needed doing to it. I’m a handy person and like the idea of a challenge and having something I can put my own stamp on. “I don’t have the biggest budget in the world andI had to pay others to do the work for me, that would have depleted very quickly. I didn’t realise the extent until I’d got the keys – there were things that I didn’t check on my first and second viewing that I will look for next time I buy.  Another part of the renovation included an impressive overhaul of the bathroom, transforming a brown three-piece traditional suite of sink, toilet and bathtub into a modern shower bath with stylish grey tiles and a sleek new sink and toilet. Jack also remodelled one of the bedrooms into a home office, stripping off the worn floral wallpaper and repainting it in green. He estimates that  percent of the work has been completed by himself or with the help of family members, with the remaining  percent finished by a qualied tradesman. Despite the toll it’s taken, Jack has no regrets about taking on the project himself.

He was embarrassed to see his friends, and sitting indoors made him so unhappy that he gorged on unhealthy food and snacks, making it a vicious circle. Treating himself to a takeaway and up to  cans of fizzy drink every day saw his weight jump to st lbs last year - until he decided enough was enough. In the past  months heaposs cut his diet from , calories a day to  - and is now st lighter. Joseph, from Bradford, West Yorks., said: “I got to a point where I was so self conscious I was terried of going out. “I was unhappy because I was big, but I was big because I was unhappy. It was a vicious cycle.” Joseph said he used to be a “normal size” as a teenager and played both football and rugby in school - weighing around  stone when he was . However, his bad food habits began around this time when he would gobble up either a kebab and chips or a large meat feast pizza every day. His weight gain was slow at first because he was still “young and active” but it began to spiral out of control when he got an office job at  and ballooned to over  stone.  Despite skipping breakfast most days, the account manager said he ate a takeaway and drowned himself in up to ten cans of fizz each day. The -year-old would also gorge on packets of crisps, cake and ice cream on a regular basis. Joseph says he tried ious workouts and even joined Slimming World in a bid to lose the weight - but said he felt isolated and stood out as he was the “only bloke” there. He said: “I was at a point of nowith my weight. I tried everything to lose it. I tried Slimming World but most of the people who attend are women and it made me feel so self conscious.  “It was hard, I stood out more because I was the only bloke. So I quit.” Eventually Joseph decided to seek the advice of a medical consultant at Spire Hospital in Leeds, West Yorks., who recommended him for a gastric bypass. Joseph said: “I spoke to my parents in January last year and told them I needed some help because I was deeply unhappy. “The private consultant I was referred to suggested I do a gastric bypass because of how big I was and I trusted them fully.  “It was scary but exciting - the first step to the rest of my le.” In late October  he had the £, surgery which he says has allowed him to “stop hating” himself. He added: “I’ve never felt happier. “It’s changed my le. I couldn’t put a price on how I feel now compared to  months ago.” A gastric bypass is where surgical staples are used to create a small pouch at the top of the stomach. The pouch is then connected to your small intestine, missing out, or bypassing, the rest of the stomach.  This means it takes less food to make you feel full and youaposll absorb fewer calories from the food you eat. Joseph says he lost a stone each week following the surgery, and has completely changed his lestyle and diet. He used to gorge himself with food and eat in secret so his parents wouldn’t know - but now eats healthily, goes to the gym and runs k every week. He said: “No one eats themselves to  stone because they’re happy. Male mental health is so taboo we find it hard to speak about things that affect us. “I used to eat , calories a day even though I skipped breakfast. “I used to live with my parents and I would find ways to eat food in secret - but that’s all in the past now. “Thankfully I was able to make this change before I developed any serious health issues that are associated with obesity.” Joseph said the conversation around male body positivity is still incredibly taboo, but hopes others like himself seek the help they need. He said: “I hope we can start talking about this more - because it’s so important that we take care of ourselves.

Sarah Jane McIntyre is past her period of self-isolation, but is still feeling the effects - a trip to the shops was so exhausting it left her shaking and drenched in sweat. The -year-old, from Belfast, has urged people to follow restrictions and said the symptoms she suffered were not like those commonly associated with Covid-.Health care worker Sarah Jane said she began with headaches so severe it was agony just keeping her eyes open and back pain like she was in labour, reports BelfastLive.Her warning comes after a sharp rise in positive cases in people aged - in Northern Ireland. No one understands, it is out there that the symptoms are a high temperature, cough and loss of smell and taste, but it has been so much more than that for me, she said. No one tells you how tired you will get, walking down the stairs is tough. I donapost think people realise how serious and contagious it is, I am still getting over it and I am on day . She said she is lucky she didnapost have to go to hospital and could remain at home with her children, despite the virus making her feel . Sarah Jane, who has asthma, ed from London on December  and said she felt tired but had put that down to lots of walking around the city. She then started to develop a headache, but again because it was not one of the stated symptoms she did not think she had contracted the virus.  But as the day went on she couldnapost keep her eyes open and even her skin began to hurt. I just thought, this isnapost normal, and I was freezing, I could not get heat into me. I didnapost want to risk seeing anyone so I went and got a test that afternoon. I did not expect to be positive, I thought it was a bit of a cold but the Saturday I found out I was positive. I balled my eyes out.Sarah Jane said her fingers and toes hurt like she had arthritis. She also said she could barely keep her eyes open and felt like an old woman getting out of bed.You feel like you are turning a corner with it then bang, you are back to square one but worse, the relapse is bad, she said. She forced herself to carry on as normal as she could on Christmas Eve for the sake of her children despite feeling nauseous the whole day. I did not lose my sense of taste or smell, my husband has Covid too and his symptoms are dferent to mine as well. On Christmas Day she suffered from diarrhea, vomiting and dizziness and said she nearly fainted in the bathroom. You feel like a pensioner, said Sarah Jane.

The daredevil feat would have been impossible for the mum of one when she was at her heaviest – st lbs and wearing a dress size .But after shedding more than st with Slimming World, dropping to st lbs and a trim size , she’s embracing her adventurous streak.She says: “I feel like I could take on the world since losing weight. Being heavy and unfit had held me back and got me down for so many years. I’m not just lighter and slimmer, it’s like there’s been a weight taken off my shoulders too. “I’m more confident, I smile more and I feel like I can do anything – bring on the skye!” Alison, , head of Norfolk County Council’s Music Service, walked through the doors of her local Slimming World group in June . With an appointment booked to have drastic gastric bypass surgery at a Harley Street clinic two weeks later, she was following her mum Fiona’s pleas to try one last alternative to the op.Although nervous, Alison, says she ­immediately felt a kindred spirit in her Slimming World Consultant Steve Little, who had himself lost st following the organisation’s Food Optimising plan.With his encouragement and her determination, in just one week, she lost lbs and that was enough to make her cancel her surgery slot.  Alison, from Holt in Norfolk, said: “For the first time, it really felt like I might have found something that worked for me. I’d dieted for years and always piled the weight back on, plus extra on top, but this was dferent. It felt like a new way of le, and the food was ­delicious. Nothing was off limits and I could eat to suit my appetite. The ­dference was, I was eating meals cooked from scratch, not junk. “I hated diets that involved counting absolutely everything you put into your mouth. “With Slimming World’s ‘Free Food’ – a long list of foods you can eat without weighing or measuring, like pasta, rice, potatoes and lots of veg – it was so much easier.” Alison saw her weight soar in her s after she moved out of her parents’ house in ­Kilmarnock, Ayrshire, in Scotland. An emotional eater, she’d turn to food for comfort at times of stress at work. But it was when her marriage ended in  that her habit really spiralled out of control. She said: “I was extremely unhappy and found food to be the only thing that gave me comfort. I’d think nothing of having a bag of chocolate bites for breakfast, a tube of Pringles plus two sandwiches and a pasta salad for lunch and dinner was usually a Chinese takeaway or a curry. I also guzzled litres and litres of full-sugar fizzy drinks and snacked all day. “By the time I joined Slimming World, I had a BMI of  and was classed as morbidly obese.  “I dressed in clothes I felt were really ugly and I hated the way I looked. One of the worst moments of my le was when my little boy Angus and I were told to get off a ride at Alton Towers because I couldn’t fit the safety harness over my stomach. It was a ride where the child had to be accompanied and he was crying his little heart out – he was only five at the time and didn’t understand. I knew something had to change.” These days it’s a dferent story. For ­breakfast Alison enjoys a homemade ­breakfast wrap, for lunch she’ll have a low-fat pasta salad and her favourite dish to cook in the evening is bunless tower burgers with salad and jumbo king prawns. She enjoys fresh fruit, home-made hummus or roasted chickpeas as snacks. The weight continued to come off steadily as she went for her weekly weigh-ins and she also discovered a new passion for exercise.  Alison and Angus got a cute sausage dog they named Mr Darcy and began going on long walks together. She also joined the gym and before long was doing five exercise classes a week. By the beginning of March last year, she was delighted to be down to st, nearly at her goal.And then the world went into meltdown as the coronavirus pandemic took hold.She recalls: “Like many people who have a problem with their weight, I panicked when we went into lockdown. “I knew that it could be dangerous for me to spend so much time at home with the constant temptation to overeat. “All Slimming World groups were forced to temporarily close and I was so worried I was going to lose my support network. The encouragement from other members is a huge part of the process, and one of the big reasons why I’d stuck with the plan. “Thankfully my Consultant was amazing. Our group went online and we’d all meet on a Thursday night on Zoom. It was my lesaver. I was so worried I’d undo all the good work I’d done, but my friends from my group were there on a screen in front of me in the same boat and we kept each other going.” Alison decided to shop locally more often rather than buying in a big weekly shop so there wasn’t much food at home to tempt her. She continued to get her daily exercise with Mr Darcy and, despite her worst fears, the pounds continued to drop off. She’s now at her target weight of st lbs, but considering losing a little more. As well as feeling fantastic, there was another ­unexpected benefit to Alison’s weight loss.

The Monarch took to social to wish followers a Happy New Year, sharing four photos from the unprecedented last  months. The message read: “We should take comfort that while we may have more still to endure, better days will : we will be with our friends again we will be with our families again we will meet again.” - HM The Queen. Wishing you all a Happy and Healthy New Year. The words are the final line of her address to the nation in April, when the UK was in the first peak of the pandemic.

She praised the NHS and other key workers for all they are doing at this dficult time, and thanked people who are staying home and not seeing their loved ones in a bid to stop the spread. She said that she hopes people will all look back at the crisis and take pride in how they responded to this challenge.

Tesco has thrown its weight behind the biggest immunisation programme in British history and has told ministers it has the infrastructure in place to make it work. The supermarketaposs subsidiary Best Food Logistics is understood to have offered up its network of refrigerated lorries and warehouses as part of a race to give the newly authorised AstraZeneca vaccine to millions of people by April. Other private companies including hotels and conference centres have also offered their venues as sites for mass vaccinations to be carried out, thereports. And the pharmacy sector is said to be urging the Government to make use of its high street network to deliver jabs. Trade distributor Best Food Logistics, which is owned by Tesco ision Booker Group, says it has spare capacity because thousands of pubs and restaurants are shut. Unlike the Pfizer vaccine that must be kept at - degrees, the Oxford jab must be stored in a fridge, which means the private sectorsapos refrigerated lorries could be utilised. The Government is yet to respond to the support being offered by businesses. Richard Wilding, professor of supply chain logistics at Cranfield School of Management, told the : The chilled food supply chain had conversations a month ago about helping out with vaccine distribution in anticipation of approval of this vaccinel  Iaposm not surethe NHS has the existing capacity to handle moving m doses very quickly. I would expect to see logistics experts from the military who can cut through the politics brought in to help, and also commercial operators which would allow distribution to be ramped up very quickly. I believe, working together, they can get the vaccine out to everyone who needs it within a few months.Health secretary Matt Hancock said Britain can get out of the coronavirus pandemic by Spring after the Oxford vaccine was approved.The government has ordered million doses of the jab, enough for million people, on top of enough of the separate Pfizer jab for million people.

The green light for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine in such a short time is a tribute to the brilliance and ingenuity of our scientists. It is now imperative that the Government ensures the rollout is efficient and fast. Vaccination can save lives, reunite families and start to get le back to normal. So the approval of a second vaccine could not have come at a more needed time. The second wave of the virus is sweeping through the country at an unprecedented rate. Millions more people in England were today placed under tougher Covid restrictions – a national lockdown in all but name. Many hospitals, despite the valiant work of NHS staff, are struggling to cope. The daily death toll is now the highest since April and it is sadly inevitable that the number of Covid’s victims will rise still further. While we wait for the rollout of the vaccine, there can be no let-up in the provision of protective kit, oxygen supplies and testing. Vaccines are a promise of a brighter tomorrow but there is no disguising the darkness of the time before that dawn.  Deal is dodgy AFTER nearly five years of wrangling, the Brexit deal was rushed through the Commons in less than five hours. While most people will be relieved we are leaving with a deal, the agreement is far from the triumph claimed by Boris Johnson. If the Government were confident it had delivered the best possible deal, it would have allowed MPs more time to debate it. The fact that they did not suggests that they have something to hide.

Yesterday official guidance for both the Pfizer and Oxford vaccines changed, with getting the first dose to as many people as possible now a priority.The order of priority remains the same - but millions can now expect to get the vaccine more quickly, with the second dose now administered up to  weeks after the first, rather than three or four weeks. The move has been taken to enable more people to get partial immunity from the first vaccine dose sooner, although medical experts said the second dose is still important for people to reach full protection from the virus. Residents in a care home for older adults and their carers are top priority to get a Covid- jab, according to a list by the The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation . After that, older people, those in frontline healthcare and people with underlying health problems form nine groups of people prioritised for the jab. The JCVI advises that the first priorities for the current Covid- vaccination programme should be the prevention of Covid- mortality and the protection of health and social care staff and systems. Secondary priorities could include vaccination of those at increased risk of hospitalisation and at increased risk of exposure, and to maintain resilience in essential public services, a government document said.

Britain yesterday became the first country in the world to approve the Covid- vaccine developed by Oxford and AstraZeneca. Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced that , doses will be available for rollout from Monday. The UK has ordered  million doses of the Oxford University vaccine, enough to vaccinate  million people. From Monday the Oxford jab will be given along with the Pfizer version at  hospitals and  clinics.  They will also be sent into care homes and within days be administered to the elderly, unwell and care workers. There are around  million people deemed vulnerable including all over-s. GPs are being offered £ for every care home resident they vaccinate in a drive by NHS England to reach the majority of those deemed top priority by the end of January. Latest figures show , people have received a Pfizer BioNTech Covid- jab between December  and Sunday December , NHS England said.  Around two-thirds, some ,, were delivered to people aged  and above, equalling around one in five people in that age group. NHS staff will now also be prioritised following the approval of the Oxford vaccine, the health service said. Dr Nikki Kanani, GP and NHS medical director for primary care, said: Three-quarters of a million people have now received the Pfizer vaccine thanks to the tireless efforts of NHS staff who have given up time with their families over Christmas to deliver vaccines at the same times as treating record numbers of seriously-ill patients with Covid-.

The high school student, from Tinley Park, near Chicago, US, was otherwise healthy but the virus ate her through, leading to a brain bleed and kidney deterioration, according to her parents Deborah and Donald. A few days before Christmas, Sarah began to suffer with mild cold-like symptoms but things quickly escalated and her mum took her for a test on December , which came back positive.  Over the next three days the Lincoln-Way East High School student continued to worsen, with vomiting, chills and body aches, before she was taken to Silver Cross Hospital on December .She was subsequently airlted to University of Chicago Medical Center where she died on Boxing Day, reports the Chicago Tribune. Deborah told WLS-TV : She went into cardiac arrest, she had a brain bleed, it was deteriorating her kidneys, it just ate her through. No parent should ever have to watch their child go through that. Nobody. I know she fought because one of the last times I was able to talk to her on the phone, they were taking her from the regular room to ICU and she said aposI am going to be OK, mom,apos and that was the last thing, Deborah added. The Cook County Medical Examineraposs Office has since ruled she died of acute hypoxic respiratory failure due to the coronavirus infection, with non-traumatic cerebral hemorrhages as a contributing factor. Sarahaposs brother, Matthew, , had come down with the virus in August but quickly recovered.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson hailed it an #extraordinary turning point#.

With Brexit on its way and Boris having become as powerful as he could in human form, the first minister marched on with proposals that involved asking very nicely for a second referendum.Is Boris Johnson the new Henry VIII \" title\"#Is Boris Johnson the new Henry VIII # # Press and Journal\" src\"https:www.pressandjournal fp news politics uk-politics  is-boris-johnson-the-new-henry-viii embed # secretTCgAckzJG\" data-secret\"TCgAckzJG\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"The Scottish Conservatives had spent the month previous campaigning against that idea, with middling results. They continued to say no, adding #once in a generation# to almost everything. The SNP regained a lot of seats lost in  and made no secret about being nationalists with one thing in mind.The polls showed support for the union and independence at - for most of the month.Having promised to resign as leader after taking Labour to its worst general election result since before the Second World War, Jeremy Corbyn launched what felt like the longest leadership contest ever.Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf was asked to make a statement on the #crumbling# police estate. Mr Yousaf said claims the country#s stations were ripping apart at the seams was #hyperbole#, hours before the roof of Broughty Ferry station caved in.mdash Boris JohnsonJanuary , Hero of the Month: Boris Johnson # Mr Johnson had succeeded, taken the UK out of the EU and was hurtling, full-speed ahead, towards the sun-lit uplands.

Instead, the High Court trial of former first minister Alex Salmond was relegated from the front pages as the coronavirus pandemic descended on Europe and then the UK, overnight, changing how we worked, lived, loved and behaved.The trial, in Edinburgh, went ahead. Journalists from all four corners of the country flocked into the confines of the High Court, on the Mile, to see Mr Salmond dramatically acquitted of all the charges against him.Speaking outside court immediately after the verdict, Mr Salmond said: #There is certain evidence that I would have liked to have seen led in this trial but for a iety of reasons we were not able to do so.#Those facts will see the light but it won’t be this day.#I’d like to thank my friends and family for standing by me over the last two years.#Whatever nightmare I’ve been in over these last two years it is nothing compared to the nightmare that everyone of us is currently living through.#People are dying, many more are going to die.#My strong advice to you is to go home and, those who are able, take care of your families and God help us all.#The evidence he claims to have is likely to come up in the investigation into the handling of complaints inquiry under way in Holyrood, so look out for next year#s look-back to see what was said or, better yet, take out a subscription and follow the story as it happens.Meanwhile, talks between the EU and UK on fishing rights started, which the French described as a #nasty battle#.Coronavirus reached Scotland, and everything stopped.Hero of the Month: Common goal governance # The SNP put a pause on the campaign for a second referendum and Westminster opted to workconstructively with the four nations to battle the spread of Covid- across the UK.Villain of the Month: Covid-, novel coronavirus # It comes with many names, but March proved to be ground zero for an illness that would quickly consume the health service, politics, social lives and business, as well as bringing about , deaths .With shops shut, pubs closed, government paused, courts suspended, football finished, rugby ruined and socialising outlawed, millions of people were left out of work and #trapped# in the confines of their home.Doctors and nurses warned of the #impending tsunami# of cases they were expecting, the crushing workloads and their initial concerns over the number of ventilators and PPE equipment they had at their disposal.Chinks of light did try to pierce the blanket of gloom overwhelming the country.

The knock-on effects are still being felt, more than seven months on .Douglas Ross denies any suggestion of a coup against Scottish Tory leader Jackson Carlaw.

Mullen took a place on the bench.After multiple pitch inspections, the officials deemed the surface playable shortly before kick-off.A minute#s silence was held in remembrance of three former Dees who passed away this week in Davie Sneddon, Chic McLelland and Jim McLean.Dundee went close early on through a Charlie Adam header but they fell behind after just  minutes.In the season of giving, Dark Blues right-back Christie Elliott was in a generous mood as his defensive error fell perfectly for Wasps midfielder Steven Hetherington.He made no mistake in finding the bottom corner.From that point it was largely attack against defence with the home side doing all the pressing.And they had a golden chance to level things up on  minutes when Osman Sow went through on goal.McDaid was the creator with a fine reverse pass sending the Swede through but he hit goalie Reece Willison with his finish.Paul McGowan fired a -yarder over the bar as Dundee struggled to open up the resolute Alloa defence and went in at the break a goal behind.They struck, though, straight after half-time with that man Sow on target once more.McGowan set Elliott free down the right and his cross was missed by everyone before falling to Sow at the back post.

It is governed by regulations that decide what countries can participate.#Erasmus includes Norway, Iceland etc, and also states in the enlargement process like Serbia and Turkey, and it is open to neighbourhood countries as well.#But then, of course, we have the domestic issue of having the competence to enter into an international legal agreement which the UK has, but Scotland doesn#t.#So that#s domestic problem that would need to be overcome somehow.#I can#t really see the UK Government doing that because the new scheme that they#ve launched, the Turing scheme, they#ve made a point that it is UK wide. Even though, of course, education is devolved.#Prof Cardwell notes the Erasmus scheme is more than just pounds generated for the economy.On top of the evidence showing students tend to achieve better degrees, there are several #unquantiable# elements that are brought by exchange programmes, including establishing institutions overseas.He added: #Traditionally the UK as a whole has received more incoming Erasmus students than we sent out. Partly that was for linguistic reasons, but also the way in which our degrees are structured.#Having students from other European countries has led to a greater level of ersity, at minimal or no cost to the universities and with much wider benefits for society in terms of student spending#And most Erasmus students across will have a great experience and go back as ambassadors for Scotland or the UK. So in terms of teaching and research, it helps to solidy many of these links, which cannot easily be quantied.#We can quanty the numbers going in and out and we can quanty our costs a little bit, but we can#t take into account just how important it#s been for students to get to know Scotland, to get to know wherever they are, wherever they have been and either stay and contribute to the economy through working or, once they go back, to either convince others to come — perhaps to do a masters degree — or to be informal ambassadors in other ways, and that#s much more dficult to quanty.#More than £ million will be spent on the post-Brexit replacement of the Erasmus exchange programme for UK students next year, the UK Government announced.The Turing scheme — named after Bletchley Park cryptoanalyst Alan Turing — will provide funding for around , students to go on placements around the world from September.Universities UK and Universities Scotland, which represent higher and further education bodies, did welcome the announcement of a replacement scheme.But Prof Cardwell points out bonds between universities take time to set up and leaves more questions left unanswered than before.#One of the reasons I#m sceptical of how quickly it can be set up is that Erasmus has evolved over  years,# he added.#Institutional relationships which form the basis of an exchange take a long time to set up.#Usuallywe#re talking about the next academic year, we would normally be selecting students and preparing them just after Christmas to go in the summer # especiallyit was somewhere like Australia, which will start in July.#To set up a new scheme, get institutions to bid for the money and find out who#s going to operate it— is it going to be the British Council or is it going to be central government #How#s that going to work  Where is the money going to go — is it going to go to universities  How do they distribute it  And what#s crucial about it is: who#s at the centre of this  The students.#We know how Erasmus works, students get inidual grants, which comes from a national agency, which is distributed from the EU budget.One hundred million pounds sounds a lot but it probably wouldn#t go that far.#Professor Paul CardwellProf Cardwell says the money being allocated to the new Turing scheme by the UK Government will be stretched thin to cover the anticipated , students each year.#With a budget of £ million, a lot of people have done the calculation of that being £, each, which isn#t a lotdoesn#t take into account any of the institutional costs#What#s important about this is that in Erasmus, and other exchanges outside Europe, they usually work on the basis of a fee waiver.#A lot of noises are being made, particularly by Conservative MPs, saying #students will be able to go to elite US universities#.#Those universities are not necessarily just going to let in lots of UK students and let them off paying the fees just because they#re getting a scholarship from the UK Government.#But there#s no way I can see how the Turing scheme would allow for tuition fees, especially not somewhere as expensive as the US. And that means the budget would very much disappear.#One hundred million pounds sounds a lot but it probably wouldn#t go that far.#He continued: #If you#re trying to, as the stated aim of the Turing scheme is, help the most disadvantaged in society, how do you reach those #How do you get those students to be able to participate, especially when you#re not really able to guarantee whether they are going to be able to benefit from a programme that is going to not leave them financially worse off.#Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_sub_data  ,\"evening-telegraph-web-and-epaper-annual-january-sale\":This offer will auto-renew annually at the price of  ua.. n\",\"free_trial\":,\"evening-telegraph-web-pack--month\":This offer will auto-renew monthly at the price of  ua., you can cancel at any time. n\",\"free_trial\":,\"plan_ids\":[\"cancelation-offer-evening-telegraph-web-epaper\",\"evening-telegraph-web-and-epaper-annual-january-sale\",\"evening-telegraph-web-pack--month\"],\"subscribe\": ua. per month  u recurring subscription n\",\"label\":\"\",\"highlight\":,\"recurring\":\"\",\"has_multi\":,\"editions\":true,\"durations\":true,\"free_trial\":,\"benefits\":[\"Enjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.\",\"Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

He was telling us stories of his time, how Jim was a forward thinker.#He said the things they did back then, a lot of people almost laughed at them – but now they’re regular practices.#He’s someone we don’t know but we’re all familiar with. His presence and legacy will be felt as long as Dundee United are here.#Reynolds insists the feeling of McLean#s presence at Tannadice still remains at the club as they absorbed some of the tributes laid out for the great man in front of the stadium.He continued: #We’ve been out at Tannadice and had a look at the tributes.#Jim McLean is synonymous with Dundee United, bringing the club to the forefront of Scottish and European football. He gave the club the rich history it’s got.#With the state of the country in lockdown, not as many people have made it to the stadium as would have liked but there are certainly a few who have come to pay their respects.#Everyone at the club feels a loss. It’s a name that is still adorned on the walls, there are pictures everywhere – and that will be like that forevermore.#He’s one of the main men responsible for making Dundee United such a big club in Scotland.#Reynolds added: #It’s still part of the club. I’ve been lucky enough to be at clubs where the history is all over the walls.#This club has a proud history, a successful history. You walk down any of the corridors at Tannadice and you see that. That will never change.#His legacy will always be there, rightly so. It was such a successful period for the club, a period when he launched the club into the public perception and to a wider European audience.#He will always be about this club and this stadium.#Turning his focus to on-pitch matters, Reynolds looked ahead to today’s trip to champions Celtic and insisted the Tangerines go to Glasgow with a belief they can come away with something.#I think we go into every game with a real belief that we can get a result,# he said.#I don’t want to sit here as though we’re going to Celtic Park with real belief when we don’t usually.#Every game we go into, we don’t expect to win – but we expect to take part, show up, compete and fight as hard as anyone.#We’re going into this game knowing that we can focus on ourselves and,we bring the quality we have in this changing room, we give ourselves a chance.#With an Old Firm clash against Premiership leaders Rangers to come for the Hoops on Saturday, Reynolds insists United will be trying to use that distraction to their advantage at Parkhead this afternoon.#Celtic have dominated Scottish football for however long so you look for any tiny advantage,# he admitted.#They are a team who are playing under more pressure now than at any time I can remember.#They are up against a Rangers team who have found their feet and have been as relentless as Celtic have been in the past few seasons.#I think Celtic are aware they have no room for a slip up and they realise every game is huge for them.#For us, we can only try to do what we have been doing every week and make the right decisions on the day.#We know we have the quality in the final third to make it a really interesting game.”LEE WILKIE: Everyone in Dundee has a Jim McLean story.

has been a year like no other, throughout the year we have had to think on our feet and adapt and respond instantly – from changing our entire service model almost overnight from physical to virtual, to switching our Santa’s workshop from a face to face experience to a virtual one with very short notice when the Scottish Government Guidance changed.#Thanks to our partnerships with the Bon Accord Centre and the Rotary Clubs Of Aberdeen and District we have had an incredibly busy period in the run up to Christmas and it has been wonderful to have the opportunity to get out and speak to people about what we do.#It has only been possible for us to do that with the support of our incredible volunteers and I want to thank everyone who has supported us over this period and throughout .”Santa#s Workshop saw a huge level of support given to the charity.Santa himself covered  shts, around  volunteer hours.He was also joined by a team of  volunteer elves, who covered around  hours between them.An additional team of elves working behind the scenes made up a further  volunteer hours making all Santa#s gts look beautul.It also saw another  volunteer hours at the indoor Christmas market organised by Aberdeen Inspired, which took place in the Bon Accord Centre over December.Joan Cowie, volunteer and information co-ordinator for Charlie House, added: “To say that the north-east have pulled out all of the stops for Charlie House this year is an understatement.#It would just not have been possible for us to provide such an incredible Christmas experience without their support.  We have had a wonderful surge in student support from schools and colleges such as event management students from NESCol who have stepped forward to aid the charity.”It#s anticipated that next year will continue to be dficult, however Charlie House will continue to support those across the north-east who need it.Louise added: #With further recent announcements we know the start of  will be hard and challenging for everyone, but Charlie House is committed to making le better for babies, children and young people with complex disabilities and le limiting conditions, their parents, brothers, sisters, and all those who love them.#With the continued generosity of the people of the north-east we can make that a reality.

The current bus stop and car park at the head of Glen Croe would also be bypassed. This is an important public transport link for local residents.The consultation launched by the Scottish Government’s Transport Secretary, Michael Matheson is a muddled exercise. It confuses the urgent need to decide on an alternative route for a new road through Glen Croe with the much longer-term strategic transport options for improving connectivity between Argyll and west-central Scotland.Most of the strategic options involve a number of new civil engineering challenges including the construction of bridges over Loch Long and Loch Fyne and extensive road building, both new and upgraded. For reasons of cost and complexity, none of these options are likely to be implemented within this decade.Whatever long-term strategy options may be investigated for their feasibility, there remains the urgent need to build a new road in Glen Croe. It will always be necessary to link the communities of Arrochar Tarbetwith Loch Goil, Cairndow, north Loch Fyne, Inveraray and beyond with the A.I note that both my local community council in Loch Goil and Argyll and Bute Council support the route that follows the existing forest track on the opposite side of the glen from the Rest and Be Thankful without a similar risk of landslides. Compared with the strategic options, this is a modestof road to construct.The sooner that steps are taken to realise this solution the better it will be for all who currently suffer the increasingly frequent road closures due to climate change and the unstable hill.Alastair R Moodie, LochgoilheadSir,Every year thousands of children contact Childline about being bullied online and tell us that they feel it is hard to escape from.Lockdown has intensied these feelings for many and since April we’ve counselled more than , children and young people across the UK about online bullying.Children have told us about people sending threatening or abusive messages and being pressured into engaging in sexual conversations. Others have shared that they’ve been excluded from online games by other children, while some spoke of online identities being stolen to embarrass or cause trouble while using their name.Before lockdown measures were first introduced this year, the average monthly number of counselling session with children about online bullying was . Between April and October that value increased by  per cent to a monthly average of .This is worrying, particularly as we continue to adhere to strict social-distancing restrictions across Scotland and children continue to spend more time online. Bullying can have a long-term impact on the mental wellbeing of a child and, as we mark Anti Bullying Week this month and beyond, it’s important to ensure that every child knows who they can turn to for support.If a parent thinks their child is being bullied online, it can be hard to remain calm, but it’s crucial not to overwhelm a child with questions. Taking their device away is likely to make them feel like whatever has happened is their fault instead, it’s helpful to listen to their worries, suggest they take some time away from certain apps, and provide them with reassurance.Adeniyi Alade, service head of Childline at NSPCC ScotlandSir,Boris Johnson’s comment that devolution has been #a disaster north of the border# and #Tony Blair’s worst mistake# should hardly come as a surprise to anyone.The Tories have never been great supporters of devolution, vehemently opposing both the referendums in  on establishing a Scottish Assembly and in  on the Scottish Parliament.Most recently the devolution power grab that is highlighted in the Internal Market Bill simply reinforces this stance.The Scottish Social Attitudes surveyon constitutional preference found that only seven per cent favour abolition of the Scottish Parliament and it found that trust in the Scottish Government sits at four times that of the UK Government. This points to it hardly being a disaster.For those accused of scaremongering that there is a threat to Holyrood, Mr Johnson’s comments are clear vindication. The irony of all this being that devolution has given new le to the Scottish Conservatives after its wipe out in  and it is now the opposition in the Scottish Parliament.Be under no doubt that the Scottish Parliament, which was hard fought for, is under threat and we must do all in our power to defend it.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast episode 18 follow me","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Why  Because this modication very effectively protects moths from becoming bat-fodder.Butterflies are active during the day but moths are mostly nocturnal. And under the night sky moths make a tasty meal for insectivorous bats. These tiny mammals detect their prey by echo-location, a method of hunting that involves emitting repeated ultrasonic squeaks, generally with a dominant frequency range of - kilohertz . Their prey is then located from the direction of the ing echoes.Moths have evolved ious mechanisms to evade these predators: some have developed ears that detect bat echolocation calls, allowing them to take evasive action, but others, the earless moths, have to rely on passive defences – so-called acoustic camouflage # that is, their hairy thoraces.Comparing tomographic echo images from two species of earless moths with two species of diurnal butterflies, the Bristol scientists found very little effect on the ultrasound echoes from the thin layer of thoracic scales of butterflies. In contrast, the hair-like scales covering moth thoraces absorbed around  per cent of the ultrasonic sound energy in the broadband - kHz. This provides clear protection from hunting bats and consequently is a very signicant survival advantage.Addressing the mechanisms behind the ultrasound reduction achieved by moth thoraces, the scientists found that the hair-like scales form a connected network of air pockets, which act as porous ultrasound absorbers. Sound waves entering the network cause air molecules in the pockets to vibrate, thereby dissipating energy and reducing echo reflection.The overall arrangement and microstructure of hair-like moth scales closely resembles man-made fibrous materials designed to absorb sound but, interestingly, the Bristol team showed that the moth scales have a considerably higher absorption capacity. So perhaps we could learn lessons from these small hairy creatures.* J. R. Soc.

There are plainly the financial resources to deal with this.It is an inexcusable dereliction of duty on their part and will not be forgiven or forgotten by people whose jobs and livelihoods are being threatened by this ongoing crisis.Donald Cameron MSP, Highlands and Islands RegionSir,I am delighted that the Scottish Government is taking forward my campaign for greater fire safety precautions in social housing.Guidance is now going out to the building industry, ahead of installing fire sprinklers in all new social housing with new regulations coming into effect next year.The sprinklers will be a requirement in new flats, maisonettes and larger multi-occupancy dwellings, including where care is provided.Fire sprinklers have  proved time and time again to be effective in the fight against fire and I know that this move will save lives.There has always been strong backing for these plans from the public, the industry and other MSPs, especially in the light of the Grenfell Tower disaster.I would still like retro-fitting sprinklers in older properties to be considered and, although that is my longer term hope, I understand the problems this would pose.I am delighted this is coming in before I retire as an MSP at next year#s election – what better than a le-saving #present# at Christmas David Stewart MSP, Highlands and Islands RegionSir,Can I please, through the columns of the Argyllshire Advertiser, say a very big thank you to all the wonderful staff and their manager Nan Anderson at the council#s Ardfenaig care home in Ardrishaig.These people have, since the lockdown and well before that, given those in their care love and affection that is second to none.On a daily basis they put themselves in harm#s way, to the benefit of not only the residents but also the relatives of the residents, and may I personally say they do it in a professional and loving way.On behalf of those in your care, especially those who cannot say it for themselves, #Thank you and a very merry Christmas to you all#.Leonard McNeill, MinardSir,I congratulate the Scottish Government on its recent commitment to a bill that will give the role of local government legal status in Scotland.The European Charter of Local Self-Government Bill has been proposed and fought for by Andy Wightman of the Green Party. It aims to incorporate the European Charter of Local Self-Government into Scots law, setting out certain rights for councils and protecting them from centralisation.It’s been strongly supported by local government body COSLA, whose president, Councillor Alison Evison said: #This is a good day for democracy in Scotland. It is a good day for our communities.# It’s also a good day for our hard-pressed local government.Here in Argyll and Bute, I think we recognise the absolute necessity of so many of the services provided by local government for our day-to-day wellbeing.We also recognise the increasingly challenging responsibility involved in the delivery of those services, not least in the face of Covid- and the climate emergency, which both have tested us all this year.Our comings and goings have been adversely affected by both these #events#, as our social relations are constrained by the first, and our movements, our access and connectivity by the unprecedented scale of the A Rest and be Thankful landslides.Andy Wightman’s Bill,enacted, will give people a stronger voice in the conduct of their  affairs, and we will increasingly need that stronger voice to advocate for our present and our future in Argyll and Bute.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, ArdrishaigSir,The much-loved Erskine Tree of Honour was dedicated and lit in fine style last week.Every year the Tree of Honour dedications lead us into the festive season.This year, in spite of the pandemic, we embrace the opportunity to remember those who will be missing from our lives this Christmas. Though  has been a challenging year, we at Erskine have been overwhelmed by the generosity, thoughtfulness and kindness from our supporters and the community.We would like thank each and every one, with special thanks to Central Car Auctions for its continued support of our veterans and also to Atalian Servest which once again generously donated a magnicent Christmas tree, now standing proudly at the entrance to The Erskine Home.Ian Cumming MBE, Erskine chief executivePIC:no_aErskineTree"},{"url":null,"title":"kilmory thanks folk of furnace and beyond","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

As part of that inquiry,  Minister for Sport Joe Fitzpatrick gave evidence at the committee on Tuesday.#While the meeting was very helpful, the detail of how and when the funding and grants will be made available is not yet known and I know clubs at every level of the game are keen to know when and how they can apply for the help being offered.#As an avid football fan I know just how perilously close some clubs are to going under and we need to make sure this money gets to those who need it without delay.He continued: #Football is in the very fabric of communities up and down Scotland and loss of gate sales and hospitality revenue has hit clubs hard.#We must get that help out to the clubs immediately to secure the future of the game, at every level, in Scotland.#"},{"url":null,"title":"distanced but together for christmas celebration","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The rules and regulations put in place to control coronavirus have put paid to that tradition for this year.#But that does not mean that communities cannot sing Christmas carols, even while everyone keeps their distance.#A creative way around this has been the suggestion that on Sunday December  at pm, people should gather on their doorsteps, or by a window, and sing out together. Just as communities rallied to thank NHS and other key-workers by standing in their doorways to make a joyful noise on Thursday evenings, the idea is that we can all join together to sing in Christmas – to be heralds,not angels!#Five carols are going to be sung nationwide that night: O Come all ye Faithful, Still the Night, Once in Royal David’s City, Away in a Manger and Hark the Herald Angels Sing – and the Ardrishaig community is being encouraged to join in.#Carol sheets have been made available at the church, in Peter Law  Sons, Morna#s Flower Shop and McColl#s.#It has also been suggested thatpeople wanted they could leave a donation for Ardrishaig Social Club’s Pensioners# Christmas Dinner .#Typically  or so folk gather for their Christmas dinner and some light entertainment on the Friday before Christmas but, of course, that isn’t possible this year.

Give until January  and public donations will be doubled by the UK Government, up to £ million – meaning we can reach even more hungry children in Liberia with le-changing school meals.Please visit marysmeals.org.uk Christmas to set your place.Wishing you a peaceful and happy Christmas.Daniel Adams , executive director, Mary’s Meals UKSir,What happened to Lochgilphead postmaster Findlay Campbell was tragic.But we need to get the post office service back.I realise that a Post Office van comes up from Tarbert three days a week at the moment, but with a queue of  people having to stand in the cold and damp # as there was on a Wednesday recently # this is hardly conducive to the customers# health, let alone convenience.I trust something is being done tothis much-needed service to the town of Lochgilphead.Celia MacFarlane, LochgilpheadSir,During questions to Transport Secretary Michael Matheson on Thursday December , I told the minister that people were exasperated with the condition of both the A and A after years of promises of investment in them.Mr Matheson’s response, which mainly referenced plans to upgrade the A and the A, will be of little comfort to residents and businesses in the West Highlands who are utterly dependent on the A and A.We have had more than enough woolly pledges over the years, usually made in the run-up to an election, which are then quietly forgotten afterwards, and I’m afraid that Michael Matheson’s response indicates that it will be business as usual as far as his government is concerned.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,I found your article on #Tougher health cuts worry# in the December  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser very dficult to read.I was concerned about the statement attributed to Councillor Mulvaney saying: #It is the same things that are there # learning disability, older people and physical disability # all chunky sums of money at circa £k to ££k#.Yes, they are chunky sums of money and have been on the agenda for some time.  However, we are talking about people human beings who have ious disabilities, learning, physical, and people who are older, something that will eventually happen to us all. People are not just a category for cost cutting, particularly those most vulnerable.This statement could be interpreted in many ways. For me it reads that people with such disabilities and getting older are a drain on our resources, and we need to cut out the services we provide for them. It all sounds like they are a burden on the finances, and that has got to stop. All because the budget must be balanced#at any cost it seems.My question to Councillor Mulvaney is quite simple # What you would do to address these particular costs  Decant everyone into another council area, or simply just hope thatservices are cut so they cannot live in their own homes, or indeed anywhere within Argyll and Bute, they leave Perhaps CouncillorMulvaney has never experienced anyone with disabilities. I have, and unless one has that experience then putting a price on providing a quality service is impossible. Vulnerable people need support which gives them, as much as possible, some sort of a meaningful le. Maybe that is why costs cannot actually be cut, and there needs to be a complete re-think. People are not just a statistic, nor should they be apparently dismissed as a commodity that is costing too much.If the HSCP does not have enough funding to deliver the services stated in the strategic plan, and to the standards it states, it needs to fight to get the correct level of funding from the Scottish Government, or perhaps look at itself and cut down on what I see are excessive layers of management, to make savings in order to deliver to the right level of all services within Argyll and Bute.Heather A Grier, CowalSir,A tunnel in the Faroe Islands is almost complete.

These species grow in the arid conditions of the Middle East and the Horn of Africa, where they have been tapped for their precious sap for millennia.Mentioned in ancient Hebrew texts, frankincense and myrrh were prized for the sweet aromatic fumes they produce when burned, and were used to freshen the airduring embalming of the dead and offering sacrices to the gods. Frankincense and myrrh are components of incense, and as such were carried along ancient trade routes.Incense reached Western Europe with crusaders ing from the Eastern Roman Empire where it was wafted in churches, a use that continues today.Also, frankincense and myrrh are used in traditional Chinese medicines # recommended for conditions as erse as inflammation, pain, fever, indigestion and ulcers. They are also components of mosquito deterrents, deodorants and toothpaste. All fairly obscure you may think, but sales of frankincense have recently rocketed it is now an important part of the international, multi-million pound essential oil industry. Great for the trade, but the booming market is putting severe strain on the supply chain*.Back in the Horn of Africa the trees are suffering. Powerful middle men are encouraging local owners to over-tap their trees for this desirable commodity, resulting in stressed trees, less seed production and virtually no young trees growing up to maintain the plantations.Yet, there is hope, but speed is of the essence. Tappers are being encouraged to form co-operatives, and are getting expert help with tree management. Nevertheless, spare a thought for the growers and the trees as you enjoy your frankincense-scented bath over the Christmas break.* New Scientist   December "},{"url":null,"title":"news from the districts december 25 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

All of our young people are our future andthey require a little help to get there, then so be it.I have heard that Councillor Mulvaney says he has an accounting background, but he seems to lack compassion. Is this a trait of accountants He is depute leader of the council and policy lead for financial services and major projects. To my mind he is not showing a particularly good example to his fellow councillors by making statements that are ill-informed and condemn the vulnerable to miserable lives.Argyll and Bute Council led the way with #care in the community# when this was brought in by the Scottish Government now it seems it doesn’t give a damn for care in the community.Do his fellow councillors want to be tarred with the same brush Is everyone in Councillor Mulvaney#s Helensburgh Central ward hale and hearty with no disabilities  I do not think so.Maybe now is the time that Councillor Mulvaney looks at his current positions before Argyll and Bute Council gains a reputation it does not deserve.An incredibly angry resident of Argyll and Bute, name and address suppliedSir,End of le charity Marie Curie is calling on people across Scotland to brave the chill and do a festive dip to show support for those impacted by death, dying and bereavement.This year has been challenging for many and the charity sector has taken a huge hit, with fundraising events cancelled since Covid- hit in the spring. Marie Curie nurses have been working on the frontline throughout the pandemic caring for people at end of le at the Glasgow and Edinburgh hospices and in people’s homes across Scotland.Marie Curie needs to raise £, every month to provide care and services in Scotland.During the festive season, I hope our supporters will back the new Christmas campaign # running from December  to January  # encouraging people and their four-legged friends to get outdoors and do a festive dip either bare footed or in wellies, in the sea, a puddle or a bucket of ice.We are asking people to take a photo of themselves taking the dip, post it on their social media channels, tag seven friends and donate £ to Marie Curie.We know there has been much sadness this year and we want people to smile throughout the festive season.Living in Scotland we are never short of a puddle or two, and are lucky to be surrounded by coastlines, so there’s always going to be the perfect opportunity for the whole family to get outdoors and unleash their inner child.To donate visit www.justgiving campaign festivedip.Debbie Mooney, head of community fundraising, Marie CurieSir,The fact that UNICEF, the UN’s child protection wing, will for the first time intervene to support those at risk of hunger in the UK, is a damning indictment on the depths to which the UK has sunk.UNICEF has put its funding behind a scheme designed to provide breakfast boxes to , families over the course of the Christmas holidays – marking the first emergency response in the UK by the organisation since it was founded in .Rising levels of food poverty in the UK are an absolute disgrace and the Tory government should be ashamed of this.We are supposedly one of the richest countries in the world.

Food and drink is a staple in households across Scotland for Hogmanay, and it is certainly something that can remain the same, even with these uncertain times.A pot of soup to bring in the bells never goes amiss, and youd be forgiven for thinking that a slow-cooked stew is something of legend at this time of year.But while many families would plan to head out for a New Years Day meal, this will not be going ahead this year.Alternatives could include trying out some new recipes at home, and having a New Years meal at home. Bake some goodies to bring in the bells with, such as traditional Scots tablet or shortbread.Zoom have lted their -minute time limit across the New Year period, so set the camera at the bottom of your table and invite however many guests youd like!First footingA tradition throughout Scotland on Hogmanay, the normal act of first footing will certainly be missed this year, but there may be a way to salvage it.Traditionally, first footing involves the first person who enters the house after midnight bringing gts. It has been adapted through the years, and some now visit neighbours with a tipple and a song before moving on to the next house.While were not allowed in other peoples houses this year, we can certainly adapt the tradition.Ask one of your household to draw the short straw and brave the cold just after midnight and emulate a first footing with your immediate bubble. Or, have a virtual first footing, and make sure to call your loved ones and wish them a Happy New Year.TelevisionAs always, there will be a raft of content available to watch on TV on Hogmanay. Therersquoll likely be old favourites including the likes of Still Game.As ever, there will be several Hogmanay specials to help us bring in the bells from the comfort of our own home. Over on BBC One, Susan Calman will be getting ready for Hogmanay  with ldquoa studio of stars.Live eventsThe events that Scotlandrsquos festive season is famed for wonrsquot be going ahead in person this year. However, many are embracing a digital approach for the first time, making it easier for us to enjoy the festivities from our homes.Edinburghrsquos Hogmanay, which usually takes the form of an incredible street party with live performances and festivities, will instead be heading online.

As she explains: #For the last  years I’ve been caring for Shaun but I definitely wouldn’t call myself a carer, it’s just something I do as his mum.#I’m never, ever, going to give up on my son. Le is too short you know you need to keep fighting.#On top of the dficulties this year has presented, disabled people and the elderly have also been left with far less support than usual, as the Emergency Coronavirus Act allowed local authorities to axe their duty of care responsibilities. Feeling vulnerable and abandoned, many carers are close to breaking point.#This is why we have launched our campaign, Care For Carers and the fundraiser Raise a Million, aiming to raise £ million to support carers and their loved ones to access respite care breaks following lockdown.We have provided respite care breaks # a vital leline to so many unpaid home carers and their disabled loved ones # for over  years.So, in celebration of Giving Tuesday this month, why not pledge to give something special to our charity this festive season I am so proud to work for Revitalise as we amply the voice of carers, and will continue to do so until carers stories are heard.

The moon lit up the landscape and the whole earth breathed peace.The only sound was the quiet lapping as the ocean rolled its waves once again to the shore. The darkness was penetrated by billions of pinpricks of light, reminding me that light has the last word.We are waiting for the lighter nights. We are waiting for the ening days. We are waiting for the light. We are waiting for the light, and for the le light.We wait quietly in a cosmic silence. Waiting can bring peace as we find God’s presence in the present. Waiting can bring hope as we know the light will come.But it’s hard to stop and wait it’s not easy to pause and ponder it’s dficult to take time at this time. We’re busy with the bargains and not so bothered about the baby.We’re busy with the tinsel but haven’t time for the truth. We’re busy with the mince pies and we will get round to the manger.We’re busy trying to fix the tree lights but have forgotten about theWe’re busy with the cards but have pushed away the crib. We’re busy – it is Christmas after all.We just don’t have time right now. We will make time for God when we’re less busy. And God crept in beside us when we were busy."},{"url":null,"title":"rosie reflects on the wonders of nature","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

And then, over the next couple of years, we slowly got them recorded.#Since forming The Strunts, the duo have performed live for a handful of gigs including the Kintyre Songwriters Festival and a couple of Homesong sets.David added: #Obviously it’s been impossible to perform recently and, as a result, we focussed on getting the album out. We#re delighted to say it is now for sale at The Kintyre Larder and The Fish Shop with donations from it going to Kintyre Food Bank and Children First.#Since the album#s release, the pair have had some great reviews in the music press, including this one from Ian D Hall in the Liverpool Sound And Vision: #Together as The Strunts, Les and David have found a common cause, one that sees the release of the album Too Much Of Everything, consistently catching the ear throughout.#The listener starts to understand that the only things you can have too much of are hate, apathy, ignorance and grief, that even in anger there must be subtle humour paving the way to the hope of healing.#A tremendous introduction to a new partnership.#Too Much of Everything is available for £ at The Kintyre Larder and at The Fish Shop, with  per cent of those sales being donated to the food bank and Children First until the end of January."},{"url":null,"title":"down memory lane december 18 2020","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The landlord claimed that through inadvertent evidence upon which he proposed to rely had not been led before the court below and the appeal was allowed. Having heard the additional evidence, the higher court have now refused the appeal, and find the landlord appellant liable in expenses.In the course of a note, the court state that it was not disputed that the applicant was a yearly tenant of his house and land, and that his tenancy did not cease on his employment being brought to an end.Section  of the Crofters Act, , does not therefore apply, as these subjects were not let during the continuance of the employment, and he was not a tradesman placed in the district by the landlord for the benefit of the neighbourhood.Indeed, the respondent#s agent refused to found upon that section, and he placed his case upon the general argument that as this house was required for an estate servant, it would be a great hardship for the proprietor to be deprived of its use for that purpose, after the applicant#s intimation that he did not propose any longer to accept employment from the estate.The tenant has fulfilled all the statutory conditions and titling him to be declared a statutory small tenant, and we have no option but to grant an order to that effect. We therefore agree with the court below that this play falls to be repelled.The only other points raised by the respondent was that these subjects did not constitute a holding in respect that the ground attached to the house was of comparatively small extent. For the reasons stated by Mr Barber, we do not see that we can give effect to this plea, and as the appellants agent stated that he did not raise any question on the amount of rent fixed, we have refused the appeal.Agent for the landlord # Mr Archd.

All important, yes, but why did he fail to mention the two sectors that face the challenge to their survival caused by Brexit: farming and fishing  Both sectors face severe financial ruin.On fishing, west coast fishermen rely on rapid transit to get their catches of prawns, langoustines, crabs and lobsters to Europe within  hours of landing.These vital exports will, due to Brexit, be subject to senseless bureaucracy of red tape before they reach their destination.Warnings from the fishing businesses all along the west coast of Scotland have been ignored by the UK Government. Coupled with this delay are tarfs set as Britain will no longer be an EU member.Next, to farming. Everything points to constant financial hardship. Lamb exports, vital for every sheep farmer in Scotland, face EU levies of  per cent of the value of these animals.For example, prime lambs currently worth £ to export will near be worth £. These levels ofwill make sheep production unviable. All exports of world famous Scotch beef will be levied, as well as Scotch food and drink exports currently worth many millions to the Scottish economy.In the  EU referendum, Scotland voted  per cent to  per cent to remain in the EU. As everyone in the UK surveys the last minute shambles of #No deal or bad deal#, they must be amazed at the absolute mess we are in.Our chance of salvation or rescue comes next May when Scotland has a chance to let Mr Cameron realise the folly of his party#s ways.Robert MacIntyre, Rothesay.First our children painted rainbows, then we stood on our doorsteps applauding the NHS.Now Scotland#s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and devolved administration will grant a one-off #thank you# payment to all NHS Scotland staff. The gross sum of £ will be paid to all full-time staff, including primary care and home care staff and care home and hospice workers.This bonus sum, costing upwards of £ million, will be taxable, resulting in those NHS staff members on the lowest income likely to be hit the hardest.Part-time staff are to receive a #proportionate share# and employees in receipt of top-up benefits may experience a #knock-on# effect on entitlements.The Scottish Labour leader, Richard Leonard, said #many care home workers are part-time, so the fear is that they will end up with a derisory payment#.Let#s also remember that in England and Wales, tax is payable at  per cent on taxable income up to £,. In Scotland, our tax is payable at  per cent on taxable income up to £,.Le Presidente Nicola and her Sepratista Nationale Politicohave put on something akin to a magic show. The question you may wish to ask yourself, is this worthy of your applause Tommy Macpherson, Saddell.I was disappointed that my amendment, brought to the Mid Argyll, Kintyre and the Islands Area Committee to retain the underspend of £, designated for Tarbert regeneration improvements, was not supported by Councillor Alastair Redman.I appreciate that the councillors who represent Lochgilphead were keen that the additional monies should top-up the costs of the project at the Front Green as that tender has come in much in excess of the original budget, but it is deplorable that a councillor elected to represent Tarbert chose to vote against the amendment that would have allowed Tarbert to benefit from the funding allocated for improvements in the village.I would assure all residents in Tarbert that I will work for the people of Tarbert, who elected me to represent them in the best way I can.Councillor Anne Horn, Kintyre and the Islands.Being a previous resident in the Wee Toon, and now residing in Helensburgh, I totally agree that Campbeltown and all other rural places in Argyll, should have been moved to tier one a couple of weeks ago.Helensburgh has had its tier two status challenged recently by sailors from Faslane in several groups going to the boozers and buying #substantial# meals with several beers, but are classed as being from the same household due to being on the same ship.Also #Weegies# getting the short train journey from Glasgow and breaching the travel rules to infest the area unlawfully.We are the closest town to the Covid hot spots, which certainly doesn#t help matters.I hope Nicola Sturgeon sees sense and allows all rural places in Argyll to be exempt from the harsh restrictions that are unfairly spread over the whole of the region.Name and address supplied.I see Bruno Tonioli is pocketing £, a minute during his current appearances on Strictly Come Dancing which equates to a further  free TV licences for the over s.Is it any wonder the BBC has a problem with those of us refusing to pay the licence fee of £. when it can pay mouth-watering sums to endless so-called celebrities.I realise the BBC has a duty to honour contracts but perhaps honouring previous pledges to OAPs over  would be a way forward.I also see water bills are likely to increase every year for the next six years, adding an average increase in council tax bills of £ per annum.Seeing as it seems to have rained every day since October in this part of the world, I begin to wonder how water companies can equate this increase to all citizens who have no alternative other than to pay.Perhaps internal budgeting within these companies could well be a sensible solution.Keith Abendroth, Campbeltown.We are launching the Young People’s Board for Change, and want to recruit  members aged between  and  years, from across the country.The board members will use the  to raise awareness of what matters most to them, take action and make change happen.

Well, as the Native Americans might say, #the story might not necessarily be true, but it is full of truth#.However you view this, something wonderful happened on a starry night over , years ago # something too wonderful to explain in simple words. The ordinary merged with the extraordinary and hope was born.The ordinary and the extraordinary became the midwe of our faith.One explanation could be that Jupiter and Saturn were in alignment on that starry night so long ago.What do astronomers make of this idea Tim O#Brien, associate director of Jodrell Bank Observatory, suggests this would have looked striking.#It#s remarkable how much your attention is drawn when two very bright objects come together in the sky,# he explains.And once the planets lined up in their orbits, Earth would #overtake# the others, meaning that Jupiter and Saturn would appear to change direction in the night sky. A wandering star I invite you to look to the south west about an hour after sunset on the winter solstice, December .You may see something that has not happened for  years. Jupiter and Saturn will come so close together that it will look just like one giant, amazing star.Could this astronomical display of beauty have happened around the time of Jesus#s birth I believe God uses nature to speak to us, and the more time we spend learning about the wonders of nature, the closer we come to God."},{"url":null,"title":"msp presses for detail on football funding","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

But a spokesman for Argyll and Bute NHS Trust said: ‘To date we have been fortunate that it would not appear to be an epidemic.’Typical symptoms of influenza include fever, headaches, aches and pains, running nose, a sore throat and coughs. Sufferers can also feel very weak and sweat during exertion.According to Argyll and Clyde Health Board’s consultant in public health medicine, Dr David Sloan, most people with the flu do not need to see the doctor.He said: #For most people, a dose of the flu is best treated by retiring to bed, taking something for aches and pains and waiting until it passes in four to seven days, usually.#But he added that people who are severely affected or who may get complications should see a doctor sooner rather than later.Single le over in KintyreThe last shop in Kintyre selling top  singles plans to pull them from its shelves shortly.

But singles# fans may still get a reprieve. The spokesman said: ‘If we get responses from our customers against the decision, then we will re-consider.’FIFTY YEARS AGOLairds ban campers and caravannersCampers and caravanners have been banned from three of the Hebridean islands # Gigha, owned by Lieutenant Colonel Sir James Horlicks, former chairman of the hot drink firm Jura, whose landlord is Mr Frank Riley-Smith, a Yorkshire brewer and Colonsay, which belongs to Lord Strathcona.Each island has a small hotel with a maximum of  beds between them. Lord Strathcona has a notice posted on the McBrayne’s ferryboat stating that the island is out of bounds to campers and caravanners.Mr L McKinnon, the tourist officer for Mid Argyll, Kintyre and Islay, has been asked by Lord Strathcona’s factor to make it clear in the association’s brochure that campers and caravanners are not wanted on Colonsay.The tourist officer has also received a letter from Mr Riley-Smith asking him to delete from his brochure the statement that caravan holidays can be arranged through the Jura Hotel, which is owned by Mr Riley-Smith.Mr McKinnon, when approached by the Courier, said that the type of people who frequent the Inner Hebrides were bird-watchers and nature-lovers who normally abide by the code of the countryside and it is quite wrong that the landlord should ban them after all, in a few years’ time, these are the type of people who willwith their families to the islandsthey are made welcome in their earlier visits.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGONoticeMen are required for the newly constituted regiment of Lovat Scouts.The raining of the new regiment will be the same as that carried on the Observation Battalion in France during the last part of the war.All ex-Lovat Scouts wishing to re-join should do so before the end of the year to count their former service towards obtaining their Territorial Efficiency Medal."},{"url":null,"title":"leader december 25 2020","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Many may be living on their own for the first time and often will not have a network of friends and family around to offer them support.Christmas can be a particularly dficult and isolating time for care leavers as they find themselves having to spend the festive season on their own, especially this year when Covid- restrictions mean it will be dficult to go out to socialise and the usual large-scale Christmas dinners for care leavers will not be taking place.However, the charity Family Action runs Listening Works, a free virtual helpline specically for young care leavers aged  to  years old across the UK. We are here all evening, every evening pm to midnight and even over the festive period, December  to January , we are still available from pm to pm.So,you are a care leaver, whether you’ve got something on your mind or you just fancy a friendly chat, we’re here for you when many other services are shut or not available.You can call us on   , text us on    or you can have a web chat with us via our website at www.family-action.org.uk listening-works – whatever kind of listening works for you, we are here.Our trained volunteers can offer you someone to talk to – a listening ear, a friendly voice and a chance to talk openly about whatever’s on your mind.We also offer signposting to useful resourcesany specic issues come up and information about other support out there and how to get it.So,you are a care leaver, or know a care leaver who might benefit, please remember Listening Works is here for you and not just for Christmas.

After years of the charity campaigning, on December , the UK Government announced the framework for a future Online Harms Bill that has the potential to provide much greater protection for children when they use the internet.This is a landmark moment – a major step towards legislation that can make an enforceable legal duty of care on tech companies a reality. For too long children have been exposed to disgraceful abuse and harm online.Social media companies will have a duty to protect young users from child abuse and harmful content online and face fines of up to £ million or  per cent of their global turnoverthey fail.But that doesn’t mean that the work we do stops now. For instance, the proposals fall short of ensuring criminal sanctions against named directors whose companies fail to uphold their duty of care.Child protection and children’s voices must remain front and centre of regulatory requirements. We have set out six tests for robust regulation – including action to tackle both online sexual abuse and harmful content and a regulator with the power to investigate and hold tech firms to account with criminal and financial sanctions.Failing to pass any of the six tests will mean that future generations of children will pay with serious avoidable harm and sexual abuse.We will now be closely scrutinising the proposals against those tests. Above all, legislation must ensure Ofcom has the power and resources to enforce the duty of care and be able to identy and then take appropriate action against tech firms that fail.For more information, search ‘NSPCC six tests’.Joanna Barrett, policy and public affairs manager, NSPCC Scotland."},{"url":null,"title":"mcconnachie claims dunavertys december medal","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Food and drink is a staple in households across Scotland for Hogmanay, and it is certainly something that can remain the same, even with these uncertain times.A pot of soup to bring in the bells never goes a miss, and youd be forgiven for thinking that a slow-cooked stew is something of legend at this time of year.But while many families would plan to head out for a New Years Day meal, this will not be going ahead this year.Alternatives could include trying out some new recipes at home, and having a New Years meal at home. Bake some goodies to bring in the bells with, such as traditional Scots tablet or shortbread.Zoom have lted their -minute time limit across the New Year period, so set the camera at the bottom of your table and invite however many guests youd like!A tradition throughout Scotland on Hogmanay, the normal act of first footing will certainly be missed this year, but there may be a way to salvage it.Traditionally, first footing involves the first person who enters the house after midnight bringing gts. It has been adapted through the years, and some now visit neighbours with a tipple and a song before moving on to the next house.While were not allowed in other peoples houses this year, we can certainly adapt the tradition.Ask one of your household to draw the short straw and brave the cold just after midnight and emulate a first footing with your immediate bubble. Or, have a virtual first footing, and make sure to call your loved ones and wish them a Happy New Year.As always, there will be a raft of content available to watch on TV on Hogmanay. The official TV guide has not yet been released, but therersquoll likely be old favourites including the likes of Still Game.As ever, there will be several Hogmanay specials to help us bring in the bells from the comfort of our own home. Over on BBC One, Susan Calman will be getting ready for Hogmanay  with ldquoa studio of stars.The events that Scotlandrsquos festive season are famed for wonrsquot be going ahead in person this year.

I was always mesmerised by how quickly the rough landscape changed into a white wonderland like from the most beautul fairy tale. This was also the time that I associated with countless presents . Who does not like them !Now I still adore winter but for dferent reasons, namely for its wildle visitors to the country. Last month, I introduced you to one of them ndash the short-eared owl ndash and now it is time I presented my favourite winter migrant: the Bohemian waxwing.The sight of a waxwing can brighten up any winter day, regardless of how keen on birding you are. Two years ago, I was privileged to spend a fantastic afternoon with these birds.It was a chilling but sunny day. As my dad, who is a nature lover, was visiting me for Christmas, I took the opportunity to take him on a trip to Aberlady. This place is always rich in all sorts of wildle. I also knew that some waxwing sightings had been recorded earlier that week.As soon as we arrived, I spotted a rather big flock of birds that briefly circulated above our heads before disappearing towards the reserve. Everything happened so fast that I did not have enough time to pick up my binoculars for a closer look at the birds.We rushed towards a copse of rowan trees, where I knew the waxwings would most likely congregate. As we were coming closer, I could recognise the merry trill that these stunning birds make as they were happily feeding on berries. You may remember from my previous articles how careful I am when it comes to approaching wildle. This time was no dferent we took our time watching the waxwings from a distance, letting them get used to our presence. This is a great technique to signal to wildle that we are no threat to them.Suddenly, the flock was spooked by a dog and raised high in the sky for a split second before landing above our heads. My dad and I gave each other a knowing grin and started admiring the beautul creatures sitting merely a couple of metres away from us. This was an unusual moment to me as a wildle photographer: the birds were so close that my lens was too big to capture the scene! But that picture of waxwings having a feast right above me will stay in my memory for a long time.Waxwings are often mistaken for common starlings. These two species are similar in size and, to an extent, profile.However,you look closely, you should spot the peach-brown colouring of waxwingsrsquo plumage. An even closer look will reveal the real charm and beauty that these birds possess: the enlivening neutral base colours are accompanied by splashes of white and red in the wings and a strong yellow band at the base of the tail. The head is crowned by a distinctive crest, which can be raised or lowered depending on the birdrsquos mood. Adding to their appeal is the prominent black mask on their eyes.Waxwings are gregarious birds, who can form large flocks consisting of hundreds of iniduals. They breed in boreal forest that extends from Scandinavia through Russia and across to the Pacic coast.Waxwings are a forgiving subject to photograph they do not encounter humans within their breeding habitats, therefore are approachable on their winter grounds, providing a great opportunity to capture them feeding on colourful berry trees.Waxwings make a loud but cheerful trill as they scour the landscape looking for fruit.Berries are incredibly important for waxwings in the winter. These birds can eat up to twice their body weight, which makes around -, berries a day!Their diet changes during their breeding season as the birds switch to feeding on mosquitoes and midges.Our native rowan is their favoured tree, but they will happily feed on hawthorn, cotoneaster and rosehips as well as dried fruit.If waxwings are in the area and you do not have berries, they can be attracted into gardens using apple halves hung from a tree. It is common to spot waxwings in such ordinary places as supermarket car parks, as they often have ornamental shrubs with berries.This was my first year writing Zanrsquos Wildle Diary and I have greatly enjoyed sharing my stories and experiences with you.

Get compostingChristmas - with its inevitable surfeit of food - can often mean bulging bins full of food waste, which is terrible news for the environment. However, you can easily make your own organic compost and plant food, whatever size of garden you have.There are many ways to do this, including bokashi bins which use friendly bacteria to break down any kind of food . Whether its a balcony wormery to a traditional garden compost heap, however you do it your plantswill thank you.. Make a new pondAny water in the garden is brilliant for helping wildle, as well as an attractive feature and a chance to grow dferent plants. Small ponds can easily be made without using a plastic or fibreglass liner - any watertight container will do, such as an old bucket or bath - and can be sunk in the ground or kept proud of it.Just be sure that there is a ramp from inside the pond so that amphibians, hedgehogs and the like can get out easily. Larger ponds can be made from puddled clay, or use the thickest, longest-lasting butyl liner possible.. Re-use plastic potsPlant suppliers are increasingly using biodegradable or recyclable pots, but what to do with the stock of black plastic ones in the shed  Throwing away perfectly usable pots, whatever they are made of, makes no environmental sense.A better option is to use everything, plastic pots included, until it is at the end of its le, and then replace itnecessary with a more environmentally-friendly alternative.Broken plastic pots can now be recycled at most large garden centres. If you dont need them, perhaps a community or school garden has a use for them . Use water sustainablyA simple change or two can make big steps towards water sustainability. First, install a water butt. Rainwater is better for plants than tap water anyway and it will save on water bills. Most water butts tend to be made of plastic, so why not get a water-butt erterand repurpose an old barrel . Grow your ownEating a plant-based diet is one of the best ways to reduce your carbon footprint, so grow your own veg. Even in the depths of winter you can grow microgreens indoors on your windowsill for quick crops of tasty, nutritious leaves - try radish, beetroot or coriander.. Enlist nature to help with pest controlBug sprays that kill garden pests such as aphids are environmentally damaging and kill other insects such as bees. By planting flowers that attract aphid-eating wildle, such as hoverflies and ladybirds, nature will do the job for you.Daisy-type flowers such as marigoldsand flat-topped flowers such as yarrow and fennel are all popular with beneficial insects.

Most political commentators,myself included, dismissed him as a charlatan, a buffoon, an intellectually lazy chancer who just got lucky when he was elected London Mayor in . But no one has a lucky streak as long as his without having a touch of genuine political genius.:Ian McConnell on Brexit: We are now all bedevilled by bitter fruits of Tory ision: OpinionConsider his record. Mr Johnson led the Leave campaign to victory in  when the opinion polls said he would lose. He went on to become leader of the Conservative Party, by a landslide, and then renegotiated the EU Withdrawal Deal that everyone said could not be reopened. That helped him win an astonishing near-landslide victory in the  General Election, plunging Labour to its worst defeat since . Now finally, tonight, he will have the satisfaction of seeing the House of Commons vote forhis Brexmas trade deal. The one all the smart people said was never going to happen.Many in the commentariat suspected that Mr Johnson had decided to go for a no deal Brexit ndash or what he called an ldquoAustralian-style deal on ruinous WTO terms. It was thought he was in the pocket of hardline Tory backbenchers. That hersquod been outplayed by the clever lawyers of Brussels.The ex-Brexit Party leader, Nigel Farage, mocked Mr Johnsonrsquos talk of an ldquooven-ready deal and said the EU would never allow Britain to leave the jurisdiction of the European Court. Now even Mr Farage agrees that ldquothe war is over.You can call it a ldquothin deal, or second best to EU membership and I would agree, never having wanted to leave Europe in the first place. Britain will undoubtedly lose by no longer being part of the ldquofrictionless European single market. But this is undoubtedly a comprehensive trade deal, guaranteeing tarf and quota-free access to the market. The fishing industry isnrsquot pleased. But there was always going to be a trade-off between EU access to British waters and UK access to European markets for fish.The fact that it is really only the fishing industry crying ldquobetrayal tells you all you need to know. The vast majority of businesses, and the general public, heaved a massive sigh of relief on Christmas Eve, even in Scotland. I donrsquot think the opposition parties fully appreciated how their forecasting of no deal had affected the psychology of voters. People were genuinely afraid that shelves would empty, food prices would rocket, travel to Europe would end and the economy would tank. With their catastrophism, the opposition parties did Mr Johnsonrsquos work for him.Of course, there are many reasons for criticising this deal, not least its vagueness about the level playing field trade rules, but what it cannot be described as is a reckless no deal Brexit. Yet only a fortnight ago, Nicola Sturgeon accused the Prime Minister, not for the first time, of ldquoactively planning a no deal Brexit and said the prospects for a trade deal were ldquovanishingly thin. Now, in an astonishing volte face, the SNP leader has ordered her MPs to vote against the deal in the Commons tonight.This may make sense to diehard Remainers, but it will bamboozle many voters. They believed the opposition parties when they said they would move heaven and earthto prevent Britain leaving the EU without a trade deal. How can they possibly justy rejecting the only one on offer, and not a bad one either Only a year ago, the SNP, along with a majority of MPs in the Commons, voted for the Benn Act. This ordered the Prime Minister to do everything in his power to avoid a no deal Brexit, including delaying Article  and Brexit itself.

Most political commentators,myself included, dismissed him as a charlatan, a buffoon, an intellectually lazy chancer who just got lucky when he was elected London Mayor in . But no one has a lucky streak as long as his without having a touch of genuine political genius.:Ian McConnell on Brexit: We are now all bedevilled by bitter fruits of Tory ision: OpinionConsider his record. Mr Johnson led the Leave campaign to victory in  when the opinion polls said he would lose. He went on to become leader of the Conservative Party, by a landslide, and then renegotiated the EU Withdrawal Deal that everyone said could not be reopened. That helped him win an astonishing near-landslide victory in the  General Election, plunging Labour to its worst defeat since . Now finally, tonight, he will have the satisfaction of seeing the House of Commons vote forhis Brexmas trade deal. The one all the smart people said was never going to happen.Many in the commentariat suspected that Mr Johnson had decided to go for a no deal Brexit ndash or what he called an ldquoAustralian-style deal on ruinous WTO terms. It was thought he was in the pocket of hardline Tory backbenchers. That hersquod been outplayed by the clever lawyers of Brussels.The ex-Brexit Party leader, Nigel Farage, mocked Mr Johnsonrsquos talk of an ldquooven-ready deal and said the EU would never allow Britain to leave the jurisdiction of the European Court. Now even Mr Farage agrees that ldquothe war is over.You can call it a ldquothin deal, or second best to EU membership and I would agree, never having wanted to leave Europe in the first place. Britain will undoubtedly lose by no longer being part of the ldquofrictionless European single market. But this is undoubtedly a comprehensive trade deal, guaranteeing tarf and quota-free access to the market. The fishing industry isnrsquot pleased. But there was always going to be a trade-off between EU access to British waters and UK access to European markets for fish.The fact that it is really only the fishing industry crying ldquobetrayal tells you all you need to know. The vast majority of businesses, and the general public, heaved a massive sigh of relief on Christmas Eve, even in Scotland. I donrsquot think the opposition parties fully appreciated how their forecasting of no deal had affected the psychology of voters. People were genuinely afraid that shelves would empty, food prices would rocket, travel to Europe would end and the economy would tank. With their catastrophism, the opposition parties did Mr Johnsonrsquos work for him.Of course, there are many reasons for criticising this deal, not least its vagueness about the level playing field trade rules, but what it cannot be described as is a reckless no deal Brexit. Yet only a fortnight ago, Nicola Sturgeon accused the Prime Minister, not for the first time, of ldquoactively planning a no deal Brexit and said the prospects for a trade deal were ldquovanishingly thin. Now, in an astonishing volte face, the SNP leader has ordered her MPs to vote against the deal in the Commons tonight.This may make sense to diehard Remainers, but it will bamboozle many voters. They believed the opposition parties when they said they would move heaven and earthto prevent Britain leaving the EU without a trade deal. How can they possibly justy rejecting the only one on offer, and not a bad one either Only a year ago, the SNP, along with a majority of MPs in the Commons, voted for the Benn Act. This ordered the Prime Minister to do everything in his power to avoid a no deal Brexit, including delaying Article  and Brexit itself.

Any teacher found not to be following this directive would have been severely reprimanded.An example of this, which I saw for myself as a teacher, was the instruction to teach primary seven how to create complex sentences, using adjectival clauses starting with who, which or that, but without using any form of or reference to the word \"adjective. Such use, we were told, would stunt the pupilsrsquo imaginations and enthusiasm for learning.

Now the biggest danger is complacency as the public waits for the vaccine to be rolled out.

Visitors to the UK from the EEA or Switzerland will still be able to come and go without a visa for short trips and holidays. And Irish citizens will be exempt as part of the Common Travel Area. But the big change is that EEA and Swiss nationals will no longer be able to come to the UK freely to work or study.The key route is the Skilled Worker one. This allows those with a job offer that meets Home Office skill and salary thresholdsto come to work in the UK, as long as the prospective migrant speaks English at a required level and the prospective employer holds a sponsorship licence.One dficulty with the new system lies with the additional requirements entailed in acquiring and maintaining a sponsorship licence.The UK Government initially recognised the challenge in extending the employer sponsorship system to include all labour migration to the UK.Back in , proposals included review and reform of sponsorship to make it less daunting for employers to navigate, not least because failure to navigate the system correctly raises the prospect of fines and other penalties.This disadvantages Scotland more than other UK nations as Scotland has the highest proportion of Small to Medium Enterprises .The dferential impact of the proposed post-Brexit immigration system has been a subject of complaint from the Scottish Government.Having a single salary threshold apply across the whole of the UK means it will be areas with higher salaries that will find it easiest to continue to recruit migrant labour.In broad terms that means London and the South East of England will find the wage criteria easiest to meet, it is often more rural, remote locations that will struggle most. Requests for the new system to accommodate regional dferences have not been welcomed by the Home Office for now.However, the new system does carry potential for more regional iation through the use of shortage occupation lists. Jobs recognised as being in shortage by the Migration Advisory Committeecan be included on shortage occupation lists to allow for migrant workers to be recruited at lower salaries .Within this system, devolved nation-specic shortage occupation lists allow for recognition of regional dferences, but much depends on whether active use is made of this facility.Tke UK Government has held off recognising the MACrsquos shortage occupation list recommendations in the face of labour market uncertainty.Labour demand is currently dficult to predict, but indications are that neither government nor businesses are well-prepared to use the new system. Critics of the UK Government approach have suggested the impetus behind the new system is political, rather than economic.Repeated inquiries into the impacts of migration on the UK economy and labour market have found generally positive,often marginal, effects.Migrant labour complements rather than supplements the domestic workforce, and adds to innovation and productivity. The irony is that this restrictive turn gets under way as net EEA migration has been steadily declining for years, Attitudes to immigration have also been softening.In Scotland, where demographic challenges are more pronounced and rural sustainability is an issue, this should be the moment to be working on proactive approaches to migration.Indeed, the UKrsquos new immigration system that focuses on ldquothe brightest and the best as determined by higher salaries seems rather outdated after a year in which we have all discovered the crucial role of ldquokey workers, many of whom are on lower pay. Migration Policy Scotland recommends that sponsorship be reviewed with a view to becoming both lighter touch and lower cost, as the system beds in and employers new to the system will need to familiarise themselves with it.Dr Sarah Kyambi is Director of Migration Policy Scotland"},{"url":null,"title":"three-month-customs-grace-period-announced-parcels-ni-britain","story":"The long anticipated guidance comes after several major retailers, including John Lewis, suspended deliveries into the region amid uncertainty over new Irish Sea trading arrangements.Under the terms of the Brexit withdrawal deal, Northern Ireland will apply EU customs rules at its ports from pm on New Yearrsquos Eve.\"@context\": \"https:schema.org\",\"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\"name\": \"Brexit countdown: The end of the transition period\",\"description\": \"Brexit countdown: The end of the transition period\",\"thumbnailUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer v media EJzOrIY poster.jpg width\",\"uploadDate\": \"--T::+:\",\"duration\": \"PDTHMS\",\"contentUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer manests EJzOrIY.mu\",\"embedUrl\": \"https:www.heraldscotland video  \",\"publisher\": \"@type\": \"Organization\",\"name\": \"HeraldScotland\",\"logo\": \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\"url\": \"https:www.heraldscotland sitelogo \",\"width\": ,\"height\": While the wider free trade deal has ruled out the prospect of tarfs on GB goods entering Northern Ireland, customs declarations will still be required.Traders have been seeking clarity on whether declarations would be needed on all parcels being sent from GB to NI, including those being shipped directly to consumers.The Government has announced that declarations will not be required on the majority of parcels sent to Northern Ireland until April .The only parcels requiring declarations will be those containing goods valued at more than pound sent by GB businesses to NI businesses.

Anything that can help reduce the risk of transmission while allowing for the easing of restrictions deserves proper consideration.”Orkney and Shetland MP Alistair Carmichael added: “Island communities across Scotland could benefit from greater certainty and protection from outbreakswe put in place testing at ferry terminals and airports.#I hope that the Government will take these proposals seriously as it cannot be long before we see the new iant of COVID spreading quickly across the country.#The isles often have geographic challenges relative to the rest of the UK – this is an opportunity to make use of our geographic advantages.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Almost a decade, and many awards, later Meena says, “In the beginning, we used to recommend people use the salt in salads but then we started adding it to all our food. It’s great as it doesn’t dominate the taste but just melts into and improves the flavour of all types of dishes, and you only need to use a small amount.” Indeed, feedback from a repeat customer confirms this: “I love cooking with your salt and think about its purity and provenance every time.” Meena added, “These kind of comments bring joy to our hearts!”Fellow director, Chris Watts adds, “We have always looked at the business in a holistic way, with eco-credentials at the heart of the business, from production to the packaging design to the end product. We are very proud to be part of the Scottish Food and Drink Industry, which we know will continue to thrive.”Asked how Isle of Skye Sea Salt had been affected by the Covid- pandemic, Meena replied, “Like most businesses, we’ve had a challenging year. Initially, we had to adjust and focus on our producer partners and increasing online custom until our catering and retail customers were also able to re-open in the latter half of the season. The eco-credentials, provenance, texture and taste have all made a dference to repeat orders. Every order matters to us. We are keen to promote the Isle of Skye brand. We would like to say a really big thank you to all our supporters chefs, collaborators, online and local buyers. Our hearts go out to businesses that have put in as much effort as us but perhaps haven’t survived. Hearing about the vaccine, we feel there is light at the end of the tunnel. We really feel positive about the future and hope that with the support available many of them will be able to start again.”Recent collaborations with Graham’s Family Dairy on an Isle of Skye Sea Salt butter, Chocolates of Glenshiel and COCO Chocolatier Isle of Skye Sea Salt have every reason to feel positive about the future.

Some of the parents had themselves been pupils at Broadford Primary and were determined to see a new school built for their children. With resolute determination, we met regularly, collectively raised awareness and ensured that Highland Council bid for funding.“Community Councillor Hamish Fraser and local Councillor John Finlayson have been resolute in their support, through the highs and the lows of the past few years. Ultimately, this is all about the children, and the parents who are determined to see their children learning in the best possible facilities. They are an inspiration, and I am over the moon on their behalf.”Councillor John Finlayson added: “The fantastic news about Broadford’s inclusion in the next phase of the Learning Estate Improvement Programme, is a fantastic early Christmas present for pupils, staff, parents and the wider community.“Getting to this stage has involved lots of hard work and the promotion of strong team ethos amongst all the key stakeholders and I would like to thank everyone for their efforts.“The support and advice of our MSP, Kate Forbes, has also been hugely influential and her availability to speak with me when required and discuss options has been key to receiving this great news.“This is a great result forboth Skyeand the Highlands and, it represents just one project of many that we are working on to improve the learning environments in our many schools.”The Highland Council has welcomed the successful funding bids for two new schools to replace Broadford Primary and Nairn Academy.These are the latest schools to be awarded funding as part of Phase Two of the Scottish Government’s £ billion Learning Estate Investment Programme, developed in conjunction with COSLA, which announced the successful bid for Tain Campus in Phase  in September ."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/01007.jpg","title":"tobar an dualchais the sea wanted to be","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine.

We first met in Thailand and then lived together in Australia for three years, before ing to Janice’s hometown in Ireland for a year. The year we spent in Ireland gave us time to decide where we were going to put down some permanent roots. We knew, after a number of visits to see family, that Skye was where we ultimately wanted to be.“However, with Janice being an operating room nurse, she struggled to find a full time job on Skye. We quickly realised that we would need to create jobs that would keep us here and ideally would have us working together.”Ewen’s family have fished the local waters for almost five decades. Every week the couple watched the majority of this beautul, local produce being exported, with very little staying in Scotland.Seaflower Skye visits Skye’s neighbouring islands of Raasay and Rona – there are trips of dferent durations and the vessel is also available to hire on a private basis.Seabirds, sea eagles, seals, porpoise, dolphin, basking sharks, orca and minke whale have all been spotted from the deck. Upon reaching the destination, a seafood feast is served.“Often, during our trips, we pass our family fishing boats,” says Ewen. “We love to allow our guests to see how the creels are hauled and where their lunch has been caught.”“This was a stressful, confusing time but we had good policies and guidelines to keep us on the right track,” Ewen added.“Our first adaptation was purchasing an antiviral fogging machine to ensure that the inside areas of the boat were as clean and safe as possible for each of our guests. It was also essential to increase the level of daily cleaning around the boat.“Maximum capacity was reduced from  guests to , and more seating and tables were provided to allow guests to spread out. Passenger access to the indoor areas was limited, which made trips more susceptible to disruption in poor weather conditions.“However, the main dference was that each group onboard had to have a private dining experience. Previously everyone would sit and get to know each other during lunch, sharing one big table.Ewen said: “I think it’s safe to say that the workload for every business has increased this year, but we do fully understand it is something that must be done in order to remain operational. We are just extremely grateful that people were able to get out on our trips and were allowed to enjoy each other’s company outdoors.”.”“We could not and would not be operational without local support.

Online retail giant Amazon has told customers here to expect longer delivery times or that some items may not be deliverable at all to NI addresses.Some NI customers who pay for Amazon Prime with the aim of getting goods delivered faster have already been charged £ for a year#s subscription. However, it#s understood the benefits of Prime will continue. Amazon said it is making changes to processes in order to be compliant with the new requirements for shipments to Northern Ireland.Discount designer store TK Maxx, homewares chain Dunelm and department store chains John Lewis and Debenhams have said they will not be delivering here as the system for ensuring parcel deliveries between Great Britain and NI from tomorrow onwards remains unclear.However, a Dunelm spokesman said: Our teams are aiming to have home delivery in Northern Ireland available by January  and are doing everything they can to potentially bring this forward.John Lewis# website said: Deliveries and collections are temporarily unavailable in NI as we make adjustments in line with new legislation. We hope to be back soon.However, other big names such as ASOS, Next and Marks  Spencer have said they are still delivering to NI - though MS indicated that deliveries may take longer than usual.The NI Consumer Council said it#s working closely with the UK Government to ensure guidance can be published on how parcels will be processed from New Year#s Day.Head of postal services Kellin McCloskey said the council remains concerned that official guidance has not yet been published on how parcels between GB and NI are to be processed. This delay is causing market uncertainty, as some retailers are choosing to suspend services to NI until more information is available. If consumers have noticed a retailer suspending deliveries to NI, please contact The Consumer Council who is gathering evidence on this issue.We are working closely with the UK Government, to ensure this guidance is published as soon as possible and that parcel operators can still keep parcels moving between GB and NI come January .Published guidance on processing parcels between GB and NI is needed so Northern Ireland consumers know how this will impact the delivery of their recent orders as well as any annual delivery subscriptions they have signed up to from retailers and marketplaces.HMRC, which is writing the guidance, said: The UK Government will take forward a pragmatic approach that draws upon available flexibilities to implement the protocol without causing undue disruption to lives and livelihoods. We are engaging with operators to finalise these arrangements.These arrangements will mean that goods continue to reach consumers, while ensuring that goods at risk of moving into the EU market pay the duties that are owed.Meanwhile, Secretary of State Brandon Lewis has said the UK-EU free trade deal - which was voted through in the House of Commons yesterday - will give Northern Ireland a unique opportunity.This is a deal that works for NI in a sense it gives NI a unique global opportunity, because NI businesses will have a position from which to trade that no-one in the world has got.That could be very good for business investment and job growth.Mr Lewis also moved to reassure NI businesses that the flow of trade across the Irish Sea will continue in January as it has in December.Once we get into the next month or so and things settle down into the new year, I#m an optimist but I think people will see that the ability for business to continue to flow across the UK will be pretty static in a positive way but NI will be at the advantage of also being able to trade with the EU as well. Thiscreates an opportunity for NI and I#m very much focused on seeing people in NI being able to benefit from improved jobs, opportunities and economic growth, something that NI needed before Covid struck as obviously the economy in NI was behind the rest of the UK pre-Covid.Belfast Related Content\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk aaa .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_d-b-e-faf-eae_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk aaa .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_d-b-e-faf-eae_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk aaa .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_d-b-e-faf-eae_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk aaa .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_d-b-e-faf-eae_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk aaa .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_d-b-e-faf-eae_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"UKWhat post-Brexit issues do UK businesses face The last-minute UK-EU trade agreement saw British businesses breathe a sigh of relief that a no-deal Brexit scenario had been averted.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk dcbd .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_baaa--f-ee-eedd_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk dcbd .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_baaa--f-ee-eedd_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk dcbd .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_baaa--f-ee-eedd_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk dcbd .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_baaa--f-ee-eedd_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk dcbd .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_baaa--f-ee-eedd_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"UKBrexit: What will change for the average Briton from January  As  draws to a close the Brexit transition period will end, ushering in a new era in the UK’s relationship with the European Union.Most ReadThe full list of Northern Ireland recipients for  New Year HonoursNorthern Ireland school reopening dates released...

Read MoreCovid- vaccine plans in Northern Ireland overhauled to give first dose to more peopleSix more deaths related to Covid- were confirmed by the Department of Health on Wednesday.A further , positive cases of the virus were also announced. The death toll now sits at , and there has been , infections since the pandemic began.There are  Covid patients in hospital,  of whom are in intensive care while  are being ventilated. Hospital occupancy is at % with  care home outbreaks. Earlier this week Health Minister Robin Swann warned that New Year#s Eve house parties would not only be against the law, but could be super-spreader events and potentially cost lives.That message was echoed on Wednesday night by Dr McBride. What I would say to everyone who is at home and has plans for New Year#s Eve, rethink those plans, he told the BBC. Celebrate this New Year#s Eve within and with your household and with no other contacts outside your household. That#s what the regulations say and what we should all be doing because we can all play a part in ensuring that we protect each other, our family and our health service. Dr McBride said the case numbers were extremely troubling. Sadly we will see a signicant number of those work through to iniduals who will be hospitalised, many of whom will get sick and sadly some will die in the coming weeks. Our health service is going to come under very severe pressures on top of an already pressurised system. I am very concerned about the next couple of weeks will look like, particularly for frontline staff, he added. Dr Tom Black, chair of British Medical Associationsaid the virus is now bleeding across the generations. On Tuesday it emerged that those aged - make up more than % of virus cases here.The hospitals wards will cope as long as the numbers are in the younger age group but as it bleeds across into the elderly that#s when they will come under pressure, Dr Black said. He added that younger people are being complacent about the danger of infection.If old people aren#t getting infected because they#re being careful but then they#re being infected by their younger relatives who are transmitting large numbers of the infection, I think the fault here lies with younger people not being careful enough. Elsewhere the NI Ambulance Service has said its emergency control room is experiencing absences due to Covid- and contingency planning to mitigate the potential risk to service disruption is ongoing. It#s also urging people to only call for an ambulance in an emergency. We would strongly advise anyone who calls  to stay on the line - to disconnect and re-dial will result in a response to your call being further delayed, it said.Belfast Related ContentCoronavirus PremiumCovid- vaccine plans in Northern Ireland overhauled to give first dose to more peopleThe Covid- vaccination programme is to be overhauled with a focus on ensuring as many people as possible receive a first dose in the coming weeks.

The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisationhas recommended that vaccinating more people with the first dose should be prioritised above offering others their second dose. “This will provide the greatest public health benefits in the short-term and save more lives,” the JCVI said on Wednesday. Health Minister Robin Swann subsequently submitted an urgent written statement to the Assembly in which he said: “I fully agree and endorse this advice and from early January the main focus of the programme in Northern Ireland will be on ensuring as many people as possible receive their first dose of a Covid- vaccine.”The advice relates to both the Pfizer-BioNTech jab, which has already been administered to , people here, and the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine, which received approval from regulators in the UK on Wednesday. Read MoreIrish professor Adrian Hill hails approval of new weapon in Covid- fightIreland to re-enter Level  restrictions for at least a month – TaoiseachCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Six further deaths and record , cases reportedWithin hours of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency giving the green light to the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine, local GP surgeries began ringing patients over the age of  to ensure vaccination clinics can begin on Monday. The vaccine will be offered to the oldest patients and front line healthcare workers first.It will then be rolled out to the over-s, over-s and those who are clinically extremely vulnerable. Dr Laurence Dorman, chair of the Royal College of GPs in Northern Ireland, said he hopes there will be a signicant drop in cases by April. “We are delighted and I am hoping that I will be getting the vaccine myself on Monday,” he said. “Given the timescale in which we are working, GP surgeries are going to be ringing patients rather than sending out letters. “For that reason we would ask that patients don’t contact us, we will be in touch to let them know when to come along for their vaccination. “We will be encouraging people, even after they have had their second dose, to continue to adhere to public health guidance relating to hands, face, space. “Restrictions can be lted according to infection rates as opposed to the number of people who have been vaccinated, although there should be a correlation between the two. “I would hope there will be a signicant dference by Eastertime.“All of this does mean that there will be some disruption to normal services, so the likes of blood pressure checks might be affected, but we would ask everyone for understanding and patience.”The Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine has been earmarked for use by GP surgeries due to the fact that it can be stored in a normal fridge. For this reason it is much easier to distribute and store than the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, which must be kept at a temperature of minus  degrees. GP practices have put in place plans to vaccinate patients in the coming months, with clinics being held in surgeries, recreation facilities and town halls. Officials have warned that the speed at which the vaccination programme — the largest ever undertaken by the NHS — can be completed depends on availability of the vaccines. However, with , new cases recorded here over the past seven days, pressure is mounting to ensure as many people as possible get the vaccine in the coming weeks. Alliance Party MLA Paula Bradshaw said: “The approval of the Oxford vaccine and further ongoing indications of the signicant benefit provided by a single dose mean that it is right for Northern Ireland to sht strategy to ensuring as many people get an initial dose as quickly as possible.“By maximising the number of people, particularly with clinical vulnerability due to age group or underlying condition, who receive this initial protection, we will be able to move forward faster towards the end goal.”Belfast Related ContentCoronavirusIrish professor Adrian Hill hails approval of new weapon in Covid- fightThe Dublin-born professor who has been leading the development team behind the AstraZeneca Covid- vaccine at Oxford University has hailed a “landmark moment” after it was officially approved for use in the UK.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland eb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dacf-cf-a-acbd-fcb_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland eb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dacf-cf-a-acbd-fcb_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland eb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dacf-cf-a-acbd-fcb_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland eb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dacf-cf-a-acbd-fcb_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland eb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dacf-cf-a-acbd-fcb_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Republic of IrelandIreland to re-enter Level  restrictions for at least a month – TaoiseachIreland will face Level  coronavirus restrictions for at least a month, the Taoiseach has announced.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk adb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_fbd-c-ac-ab-eab_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk adb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_fbd-c-ac-ab-eab_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk adb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_fbd-c-ac-ab-eab_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk adb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_fbd-c-ac-ab-eab_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk adb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_fbd-c-ac-ab-eab_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"CoronavirusCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Six further deaths and record , cases reportedThere have been six more deaths related to Covid- in Northern Ireland, according to the Department of Health.

If these children are not engaging in education, unlike the first lockdown, there needs to be a more proactive approach from schools, Educational Welfare Service and Social Services to check on and encourage those children and families to participate in education.”Belfast Related ContentCoronavirus PremiumCovid- vaccine plans in Northern Ireland overhauled to give first dose to more peopleThe Covid- vaccination programme is to be overhauled with a focus on ensuring as many people as possible receive a first dose in the coming weeks. \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland ebe .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_da-f--ae-dcaef_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland ebe .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_da-f--ae-dcaef_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland ebe .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_da-f--ae-dcaef_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland ebe .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_da-f--ae-dcaef_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland ebe .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_da-f--ae-dcaef_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"GalleryNorthern Ireland PremiumStay home, Swann begs as Northern Ireland Covid cases hit record high with nearly half infections in - age groupHealth Minister Robin Swann has warned the public to redouble efforts to push down Covid- infection rates after shocking statistics showed a huge rise in positive cases in young people.

Portrush photographer Lauren Chamber#s top tips might just helpPhotographer who married last year gathers couples# experiences for blogExpand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseLauren Chambers says Covid shouldn’t be a barrier to enjoying your big day FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueLauren Chambers says Covid shouldn’t be a barrier to enjoying your big dayMark BainTwitterEmailDecember   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailA wedding photographer who tied the knot herself in November has encouraged anyone planning to get married in  to say yes to the date.Lauren Chambers , who runs LIT Photography in Portrush, said there#s never been a better time to have a perfect, intimate wedding in front of the people who mean most in your le.It#s been quite a year for anyone who planned to get married, but for anyone who postponed until , it looks like Covid will be with us for a while longer, she said. However, that shouldn#t be a barrier to enjoying the perfect wedding day.This is the perfect chance to focus on what#s important, and that#s themselves. There#s never been a better time to strip away all the trappings and get right down to the fact that the most important people on the day are the couple getting married.Lauren has developed her business website to provide tips for those planning to wed in  by speaking to the couples she has encountered during the Covid restrictions.I went through it myself with my new husband Jason on November , she said. Right up until the morning of the wedding I wasn#t sureit was all going to happen, but it did and I#m so glad we went through with it. It couldn#t have been any better, and I#d encourage anyone thinking of postponing to think again.Of the  weddings I#ve been involved with through the pandemic, not one couple said they regretted going ahead with their plans.We were still able to have the people who mattered most to us in attendance. That made it much more emotional and personal and I wouldn#t change a thing.My date was just two days after the second lockdown started, so right up to the last minute things were changing.In her website blog, Lauren speaks to all those who went ahead with their plans. She has come up with her top tips for those who plan to wed in the first half of next year.Unfortunately, Covid isn#t going to go away overnight. But the first piece of advice is to be realistic in expectations. Let go of plans you had and focus on the things that really matter. You can#t postpone forever, she said.Speak to people who have been through it. You#ll find they enjoyed their day even more than they expected. The weddings I#ve been to were so emotional.It#s important not to compare with others. If someone  decides to postpone, don#t just follow their lead.And don#t look too far ahead. Don#t think you have to start inviting people eight weeks before. Speak to venues, caterers. Find out when they really need to know final details. And always remember that the most important people are the couple getting married. All the previous wedding rules have been thrown out of the window, but now there#s a real chance to make the day a special one.Marriage is the beginning of a le together, and couples need to do that on their own terms. It might be dferent to what would have happened a year ago, but that doesn#t make it any less special.Lauren#s blog is available at litphotographyniBelfast Most ReadThe full list of Northern Ireland recipients for  New Year HonoursNorthern Ireland school reopening dates released...

PADecember   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailSinn Fein’s invitation to an Anglo-Irish Christmas party during the peace process created a headache at Maryfield.Civil servants worried it could dissuade some from attending and pose a security risk.An October  note on the affair was published by the Public Record Office for Northern Ireland as part of the annual release of Government archives.The Christmas spirit will not come entirely free this yearPN BellSenior NIO official PN Bell wrote: “Now that Sinn Fein are, following the restoration of their ceasefire and full membership of the talks, a constitutional party, I can see no justication for not extending an invitation which, almost certainly, they will accept.”The Maryfield Secretariat near Belfast was established as part of the Anglo-Irish Agreement which instituted closer north south cooperation.The civil servant added: “Nevertheless, such an invitation would not be without its downside: once news of a Sinn Fein presence became common place, it would intensy unionist dislike of the Secretariat it could generate some security risk it might even deter other guests – although I greatly hope not, from wishing to attend, as well as creating some management problems within the Secretariat itself.“The Christmas spirit will not come entirely free this year.”Up to that point, unionists had never attended the Maryfield Christmas party.The official added: “To sum up, the case for extending a joint invitation to Sinn Fein is irresistible.“But, given the likely reaction in some quarters, I wish to be certain that ministers know all the implications, and are content that I should proceed with inviting a few leading Sinn Fein players along with other leading Northern Irish politicians.”The Northern Ireland Forum for Political Dialogue had also reflected on those who worked at Maryfield, the historic files said.The Government archives quoted from a debate: “Even the prosperous burghers of Holywood were so outraged at the Anglo-Irish Agreement in  that the Maryfield bunker had to be virtually the most fortied place in Northern Ireland, and that remains the case today.”It said civil servants working there and from Northern Ireland did not dare tell friends and neighbours for fear of “shame and opprobrium”.“If he is from the Irish Republic he is furtively ferried

make small talk over the canapes, the file said.“But these people never – and never will- have any direct contact with the ordinary, decent people of Northern Ireland.”NIO official JR Fisher noted in

Those businesses will also have three months to submit those declarations.Declarations will also be required for excise goods, such as alcohol, being sent from GB to NI using an express carrier or Royal Mail Group.Senders will need to provide their selected carrier additional information to enable declarations to be made.The guidance does not provide any detail on what the customs arrangements will be following April .The uncertainty over the issues had seen several retailers and dispatch companies warn of potential disruption, with some having suspended services to Northern Ireland until clarity was provided.John Lewis is among those that have paused deliveries to the region.The company’s website states: “Deliveries and collections are temporarily unavailable in Northern Ireland while we make adjustments in line with new Government legislation. We hope to be back soon.”TK Maxx has taken a similar step. Its website states: “We are temporarily unable to ship orders to Northern Ireland. We apologise for any inconvenience caused and promise we’ll be back very soon.”Hugo Boss has suspended deliveries until February.Amazon has also warned that the new arrangements could lead to delays on the shipment of orders to Northern Ireland.PAMost ReadThe full list of Northern Ireland recipients for  New Year HonoursNorthern Ireland school reopening dates released...

A briefing note from Robin Cook, then Foreign Secretary, to Mr Blair said: Your meeting with the Taoiseach on July  was inevitably dominated by discussion of Northern Ireland. But there was agreement in principle to developing the wider relationship. Mr Cook acknowledged that a nationalist government would likely be less instinctively committed to improving the relationship between Ireland and the UK. But he said having Mr Ahern as the Fianna Fail party#s leader gave genuine cause for optimism. Ahern is a pragmatist, Mr Cook wrote. He has spoken privately to our Ambassador and in public of the possibility of developing a new era in UK Irish relations. Better so-called #East West# relations have intrinsic value and will improve the climate for our exchanges with the Irish over Northern Ireland. The Good Friday Agreement set the way for peaceful powersharing in Northern Ireland.It was backed by % of voters in a referendum in Northern Ireland while % voted in favour of it in the Republic.It became one of the defining achievements of the Blair years. Before the signing of the deal, he referred to the #Hand of History# being on his shoulder.The new Stormont Assembly met for the first time in July  and David Trimble and Seamus Mallon were elected as First and deputy First Ministers.In , on the th anniversary of the deal, Mr Blair and Mr Ahern spoke at a conference in Belfast.Mr Blair said the  deal took real courage by Northern Ireland parties. He added that for all its faults, the Good Friday Agreement was worth doing and worth keeping.Mr Ahern said: The art of politics is compromise, you can#t make progress without compromise.Belfast Most ReadThe full list of Northern Ireland recipients for  New Year HonoursNorthern Ireland school reopening dates released...

However, a civil servant advised that the issue of the Aboriginal head was not of major political signicance.Mr Adams wrote personally to Mr Haughey over the issue on February , .I believe that the refusal to do so , over a five-year period, demonstrates a total insensitivity to the spiritual values of the aboriginal people of Australia, Mr Adams wrote.This is being interpreted as racist by those people.The Irish Government was briefed that the RCSI decided tothe remains to Australia.In a letter dated March  to the Taoiseach, the Aboriginal Centre invited him to attend a handing over ceremony for the remains at the Australian Embassy on March , a memo outlined.The embassy had no knowledge of any such ceremony which, in the light of the removal of the remains from Ireland, does not now arise.Following the decision of the RCSI to give back the remains, the embassy are not anxious to add to the extensive publicity which has already been given to this whole issue and thereby embarrass the college even further.

Any meat product must contain only meat from animals born and raised in the UK or the EU.”– No mutual recognition of professional qualicationsIn a blow to the UK’s services sector, the trade deal lacks a mutual recognition of professional qualications.Ms Thimont Jack said: “It will be much more dficult for many professionals to deliver services in the EU, with rules dfering member state by member state.”An IfG analysis said there were “enormous numbers” of exceptions covering market access provisions in the trade deal.For example, it said UK nationals will not be able to sell actuarial services in Italy or construction services in Cyprus, or to be surveyors in Bulgaria or tobacconists in France.– New rules on business travelThe trade deal permits short-term British business visitors to the EU to stay for  days in any six-month period.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming b .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_d-b-e-faf-eae_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming b .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_d-b-e-faf-eae_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming b .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_d-b-e-faf-eae_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming b .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_d-b-e-faf-eae_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming b .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_d-b-e-faf-eae_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming b .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_d-b-e-faf-eae_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming b .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_d-b-e-faf-eae_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming b .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_d-b-e-faf-eae_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming b .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_d-b-e-faf-eae_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming b .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_d-b-e-faf-eae_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"The trade deal includes limitations on activities allowed under permit-free short-term business travel PA FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueThe trade deal includes limitations on activities allowed under permit-free short-term business travel But the rules mean that activities allowed without the need for a work permit are limited to such things as meetings, consultations, research, training and trade fairs – with iations between member states also applying.Selling goods or supplying services to the public are not covered by the short-term business visit provisions.UK Government guidance says visas or permits may be needed for business travel and advises travellers to check each country’s rules.– Potential for disagreement over the rulesLondon and Brussels agreed a floor for standards for areas like the environment and labour rights, with this level playing field being reviewed in four years.But Irish deputy premier Leo Varadkar warned thatthe UK deviates too far from EU standards its access to the European market could be threatened, saying it was “not unconditional”.A European Commission summary of the deal said either side has “the right to take unilateral measures to safeguard their economies against unfair competition from the other party”.The document said a “dispute settlement mechanism” covers most areas of the trade deal, including the level playing field.Accompanying “enforcement and safeguard mechanisms” include the possibility of tarfs or quotas being reintroduced for an affected sector.– The deal contains gapsTwo key issues left unresolved by the trade deal are “data adequacy” and “equivalence for financial services”.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_d-b-e-faf-eae_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_d-b-e-faf-eae_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_d-b-e-faf-eae_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_d-b-e-faf-eae_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_d-b-e-faf-eae_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_d-b-e-faf-eae_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_d-b-e-faf-eae_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_d-b-e-faf-eae_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_d-b-e-faf-eae_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_d-b-e-faf-eae_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"The future of financial services’ access to EU markets was left unresolved by the trade deal PA FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueThe future of financial services’ access to EU markets was left unresolved by the trade deal The EU is yet to decidethe UK’s personal data protection regime is adequate to allow the flow of information between the two sides.

All donations are welcome andanyone wishes to help our efforts that help would be much appreciated.Ms Monk has enlisted the help of two delivery drivers to take the food to the Bogside, Brandywell and Creggan areas of the city.Like all cafes, Peggys Kitchen is closed at the moment due to current restrictions.Its sad that we cant open because we really miss our customers like the Over s Club that used to meet here every Wednesday and for a lot of them it was their only source of interaction but the safety of everyone needs to come first, said Ms Monk. googletag.cmd.push We cant wait to reopen again but until then please keep safe.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Barman Andy Nutt is preparing to pour the last measure at the well-known local pub.Reporter: Liam Tunney::  Dec   addthis, Knobbsrsquo Tavern closed in March, just before the pandemic arrived. In the week leading up to its final hurrah, we caught up with barman Andy Nutt and a few regulars.A well-known County Derry pub that has been in operation since  will close its door for the final time on Thursday.Knobbs’ Tavern in Kildoag, between Claudy and Donemana, was originally a grocery store that serviced the local area, but the community it sustained has been shrinking.On Saturday, they held a packed farewell concert, and when the County Derry Post caught up with a few of the regulars on the Friday afternoon, they were in reflective mood.“We’ll miss the yarns and the company,” said previous owner, Jack Knobbs, who was perched at the corner of the bar with his dog, Honey.“It was originally what they call a licensed shop and the first time it was opened as a bar was in . Until , the shop was still here and the bar could only hold maybe seven or eight people.“It would have been mostly locals in the bar and then in  they built on the upstairs and it would have hosted a lot of music – mostly country and western music.” googletag.cmd.push Jack is quietly spoken but points me in the direction of black and white photographs on the wall, where he featured in the Kildoag Wanderers FC side and the local cricket team in a previous era.Both teams used the bar as their base, and the social aspect the rural pub brought to the area is something Jack feels will be greatly missed.“The place would have been packed out on a Saturday night – people would have come from Donemana, Waterside and Claudy for the music.“We just enjoyed the craic. You had the odd tall story told. It’s hard to beat a good story, evenit’s not true!”Mervyn McComb lays claim to being the bar’s oldest customer. “I’ve been coming here about  years,” boasts the -year-old. googletag.cmd.push  “I was in it when the old bar was in the other room. Then, when they opened up the lounge, the place was packed to the rafters. “A lot of old bars seem to be closing up, there’s not the customers there used to be. It’s going to be badly missed. “It’s local people that come here.”Right on cue, a loud cheer erupts from the men as another regular walks into the bar, while Ian informs me the bar has its own taxi driver in residence.Barman Andy Nutt prepares to explain further. He mutes the small television mounted above the bar. This is serious stuff now.“There were six women arrived from Cumbria in England on a Tuesday night. They were on a biking tour and on their way to Park.“They came in and asked to use the toilet and I said that was no bother at all. One of them askedthis was a bar and I said it’s been called many things, but you could definitely call it a bar.“She askedthere was any chance they could have a drink and to cut a long story short, they ended up leaving the bikes here!“They stayed all night so I said I would get them a taxi man to get them back to Park. I rung up Eddie Curry and askedhe could do a run.“Eddie said ‘I’m definitely not going to Park’. Then I told him it was six women and he asked what time I wanted him down!     “I got a text from them that evening then – I think they were in Portrush.“It said: Andy, no Guinness at pound., no gin and tonic at pound. – we shouldn’t have left you!”The tale is typical of the kind of comical, slightly embellished yarns that used to be commonplace in bars across the country, but rural decline is threatening to silence them.Mervyn McComb’s son, Ian, believes that people make the bar what it is.“It’s a good wee bar, with great people in it,” he says. “There were memorable nights here every weekend. It was always good craic.“There used to be bands in upstairs and the place would have been jammed. It always did a good trade, was well run and there was never any trouble. “I’m  now so I’ve been coming here maybe  years. It will be sorely missed and it’ll hurt the community.”The range of presentation cheques that adorn the bar’s walls give an indication of how the community will suffer without its hub. Each year, the bar ran a charity drive and the evidence of their impact is clear in the many comments left on social media following news of Knobbs’ closure. Nicola Doherty fondly recalled a vintage tractor rally held at Knobbs’ after her father had beaten cancer.She commented: “We held our first tractor run in there when my dad beat cancer and bought a vintage tractor. “We hoped for a few tractors to show up and to raise a couple of hundred, but the place was packed, and we raised pound, for the Sperrin Room. “Great memories, I’m sad to see it close the doors.”The doors will indeed close, but Saturday night’s punters were treated to the nostalgic sight of the rafters reverberating to the sound of the Father and Son Remo band in the lounge above. There is a black cat that Jack Knobbs says follows him to and from his house to the bar on every visit.It sits almost sentry-like on the windowsill outside Knobbs.On a bright summer’s afternoon, Jack’s feline companion would be treated to a breathtaking view of the Faughan valley, but on Knobbs’ farewell night, Storm Jorge’s wind and rain battered its weary walls.The storm will have calmed by Thursday, as Andy Nutt prepares to close the doors. There is no doubt that Jack Knobbs will be there to oversee what will be an emotional moment.Knobbs concedes to the march of time.“I’m just a customer now,” says the former owner.“Sometimes I sit too long.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Until now. Liam Tunney talks to an ex-member of the infamous Gorilla Gang, who were responsible for many a headache at Slaughtneil discoThe Slaughtneil GAC committee used to meet every Monday evening. The meeting was supposed to be a general meeting about club business, but usually got bogged down with the disco. Discussions often revolved around two groups of boisterous young men in particular – the Gorilla Gang from Draperstown and the Banana Gang of Bellaghy. The latter were set up in reaction to the former, whose name was notorious around south Derry throughout the s. “The name was actually originally meant to be ‘Guerrilla Gang’,” an ex-member told the County Derry Post. “About  or , things were getting hot and heavy and the likes of Ballinascreen was getting saturated by the British Army. googletag.cmd.push “There would have been fighting with the UDR or the Brits, andthey came into Draperstown, the Gorilla Gang would have gathered up a posse and put them out. “There were two or three gangs in Draperstown at that time. One of them was the Wombles and the other one was the Sixtown Clowns. “They all used to fight amongst each other at small discos that used to be on round Draperstown before Slaughtneil started. “The police knew about the Gorilla Gang. I had a few older brothers that went to Spain, and on their way home they were pulled in at London airport and quizzed about the gang!” googletag.cmd.push As the disco’s popularity began to grow, the three gangs soon set their grievances aside as the possibility of taking their local scuffles to a wider field presented itself. “The disco took in the whole of south Derry, so there was more boys to fight with outside your own town,” he recalled. “It was just like that at those times around dance halls. In the early s, before Slaughtneil, the older Gorilla Gang would all have been over in Dungiven fighting at the Castle. “There were a wile lot of boys in the Gorilla Gang that were mad for fighting, and then everyone started making up their own gangs to fight us.     “I think that’s where the Banana Gang came out of, that they were going to get the Gorilla Gang at Slaughtneil. “I think the Banana Gang gave the Wombles and the Sixtown Clowns a bad beating one night and then they didn’t want to go anymore. “Well, they were mad to go, but they couldn’t because they were scared of the Banana Gang. They came to the Gorilla Gang and askedthey could join up.” The merger prompted a rivalry that lasted throughout the late s and caused the Slaughtneil bouncers no end of trouble. Our ex-member feels that the gangs’ propensity for bravado and fisticuffs helped boost the crowds that flocked to the hall on a Friday night. “Four carloads of us would leave the town to go down to Slaughtneil. We didn’t chance taking the bus, becauseyou were fighting, the bus driver wouldn’t let you on,” he said. “I remember going down to Slaughtneil and being told these Banana Gang boys were gonna be there, and two nights in a row, we went down, and they weren’t there. “The third night we went down, we thought they weren’t turning up, so maybe only five or ten of us went and we got some beating from the Banana Gang that night – they all turned up! “God help them bouncers. I don’t think Slaughtneil would have been Slaughtneil without it. Everybody was going, girls and all, to see what was going to happen next week. “If there was a small scuffle in the car park, threats were made about who was going to be there next week that wasn’t there tonight.  The characters’ nicknames roll off the ex-member’s tongue. Bungle. Flan. Rocky. Numan. Turk. Goggles. Nelly. Bruce. Shiny, who ‘couldn’t beat eggs’ but drove the getaway car. The King, who would run out onto the pitch and shout, ‘I’m the King of the Gorillas and I eat bananas for breakfast’ before a dust-up. Johnny the Donkey, who played the role of negotiator when the gangs were thrown out of the car park and arranged to meet halfway between Draperstown and Bellaghy to finish it off. An eclectic mix, but one name resonated more than others. “Flathead was the feared name. He was a real tight boy, he would have fought anybody man to man,” he said. “We would have said, ‘you boys will be in trouble next week, we’re taking big Flathead with us’, and everybody would have been at Slaughtneil the next week for the big punch up outside! “Even the bouncers were a wee bit scared of big Flathead because he was big for his age. There were some characters about.” While the rivalry between the two gangs was intense, it never created any lasting grudges and the member recalled how, by chance, he encountered one of his nemeses years later. “I hadn’t seen this boy for years, until I was going along one day in the car through Rocktown and heading for Bellaghy,” he said. “I saw a man walking along the road in the pouring rain and I stopped to seehe wanted a lt. “He hopped in anyway and was talking away to me and when he was getting out of the car, whatever way he turned sideways I recognised him. He caught on then to who I was too. “We were good friends at school, but then he was in the Banana Gang and I didn’t really want to let him know that I wanted to kill him, and he didn’t want to let me know either!” Time and people move on. The exploits of the Gorilla Gang may seem shocking when viewed through a st century lens, but our ex-member says it was a dferent era. “When I look back, I never knew of a man being hurt badly. When I hear the gang mentioned, it makes me laugh,” he said. “There were no mobile phones, no fancy cars. Anybody that had a car, it had cost them maybe pound. That whole thing is just lost. “I know it wasn’t good going to all them dance halls and fighting, but at the same time, no one was doing drugs or anything, it was just a punch-up. “Just a locka lads with a few beers in them, that fell out with another group of lads and there were a load of myths and legends that never even happened. “There were a few nights when I was younger that I maybe woke up in the morning with a black eye and a cut forehead and I said to myself, ‘oh my God, what am I at ’, but apart from that, I’ve no regrets. “We were all young cubs. Apart from the odd bleeding mouth and a bust lip, there wasn’t much harm done.” “God help them bouncers, those men got some torturing! Them boys did some organising to keep that all going. “For a club on top of a mountain, they did well to actually get people to get up there. There’s not even a pub.” It’s unlikely south Derry will ever see the likes of the Gorilla Gang again, but their mention invokes howls of recognition and intrigue. With a chuckle no doubt brought on by the memory of discos past, the ex-member had one idea that might have some under lockdown pining for its end. “I couldn’t say that I’ve any enemies out of it, put it like that. If we could get a Banana Gang-Gorilla Gang reunion night gathered up, I’d say we could have a good laugh!” See also: If you build it, they will come: Slaughtneils field of dreamers Spinning the soundtrack to a timeless era South Derrys ballroom of romance The goose that laid the golden egg Bringing Muhammad to the south Derry mountains The night a TV star came to Slaughtneil  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Under the mentorship of Richard McBride and Victoria Townsend, six Year  pupils from Foyle College recently participated in the Livery Academy Awards. Richard is a former pupil and current governor of the Derry school, whose back- ground is in law, whilst Victoria is the founder of the London Academy of Bespoke. Their joint expertise and business acumen provided the pupils with the perfect marriage of guidance and knowledge. Traditionally hosted in Merchant Taylors’ Hall, London, this year the pupils joined the competition virtually, proposing the launch of their Covid- inspired product, Care Cog. googletag.cmd.push During months of preparatory work alongside Richard and Victoria, the team developed a business plan and created a product prototype, before presenting their Care Cog to Merchant Taylors‘ judging , Lady Harding, Nick Hewer and Jana Mackintosh. The team’s presentation was excellent and they coped well with the judges’ questions. However, London- based all-girls St Saviour’s and St Olave’s School were selected as winners. The Foyle pupils were awarded pound, to gt to their chosen river rescue charity, Foyle Search and Rescue. The pupils selected the local charity because, they said, it is a grassroots charity whose work makes valuable contributions within their local community. googletag.cmd.push Barry Duffy, from Foyle College, praised all those involved. “The pupils really benefited from their participation in the Livery Academy Awards and are proud that their journey will also help to support others through the Merchant Taylors’ donation.”      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Robert explained how his le-changing win came about. “I was out doing an essential grocery shop and had a scratchcard in my pocket with a pound win on it. So while I was paying for the groceries, I exchanged it for another similar National Lottery Scratchcard, and bought an extra one for good measure. “I brought the two scratchcards home and played them that night.

They asked for some details and then, I’ll never forget, the lady on the phone said… ‘Congratulations, you have won pound,’!     “My reply was ‘you what ’ My heart felt like it was going to burst out of my chest. In fact, I still can’t believe it. It’s like a dream come true, especially in these uncertain times when we’re stuck at home and don’t really know how our jobs will be affected by this coronavirus pandemic.” Despite his big win, Robert hopes to get back to work as soon as possible, saying that he loves his job and the ‘banter’ with his workmates.

Bernadette Radclfe, from the Brandywell, bought a ticket for a competition to win a black Lamborghini Gallardo on a whim when she saw it advertised on social media. Mrs Radclfe had just a one in , chance of winning the prize from Derry company Vogue Competitions She couldnt believe her luck when she got a call from Derry singer and entertainer Micky Doherty who had picked her name out using a computerised random number generator. Micky then paid a surprise visit to Bernadette who was celebrating with a cup of tea at her sister Siobhans house in Galliagh Park. googletag.cmd.push Shes doesnt drink, she doesnt smoke and she doesnt drive so she was celebrating with a cup of tea and a Club biscuit, laughed Micky. Anybody  would be drinking a bucket of vodka. Micky said he was delighted Mrs Radclfe had won the prize because shes a lovely person. Shes from the Lecky Road which is where my mother was from so it was very special to me. At first I didnt recognise her name because I would know her as Bernie, but then I realised that I know her and all her sisters for a long time. Shes a lovely person and a real lady. googletag.cmd.push I always say nice things happen to nice people. Earlier that day Bernie was out handing out candles of Sister Clareand I said a wee prayer to Sr Clare before I picked the winner that I would pick the person that deserved it. She works in mysterious ways. The Lamborghini was part of a three part prize draw that also included a Rolex watch which was won by Niall McDaid from Bishops Street from a pound ticket and a lawn mower which went to Patrick McDaid from Rosemount who purchased a ticket for pound. Blaine Tierney of Vogue Competitions and Vogue Car sales in Springtown has given away a large number of cars in competitions since lockdown began in March.     The Lamborghini is our biggest giveaway yet, its an amazing car and it would cost pound, new, he said. Its brilliant to be able to give people le changing prizes and the majority of the prize winners have been from Derry.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Bernadette Radclfe, from the Brandywell, bought a ticket for a competition to win a black Lamborghini Gallardo on a whim when she saw it advertised on social media. Mrs Radclfe had just a one in , chance of winning the prize from Derry company Vogue Competitions She couldnt believe her luck when she got a call from Derry singer and entertainer Micky Doherty who had picked her name out using a computerised random number generator. Micky then paid a surprise visit to Bernadette who was celebrating with a cup of tea at her sister Siobhans house in Galliagh Park. googletag.cmd.push Shes doesnt drink, she doesnt smoke and she doesnt drive so she was celebrating with a cup of tea and a Club biscuit, laughed Micky. Anybody  would be drinking a bucket of vodka. Micky said he was delighted Mrs Radclfe had won the prize because shes a lovely person. Shes from the Lecky Road which is where my mother was from so it was very special to me. At first I didnt recognise her name because I would know her as Bernie, but then I realised that I know her and all her sisters for a long time. Shes a lovely person and a real lady. googletag.cmd.push I always say nice things happen to nice people. Earlier that day Bernie was out handing out candles of Sister Clareand I said a wee prayer to Sr Clare before I picked the winner that I would pick the person that deserved it. She works in mysterious ways. The Lamborghini was part of a three part prize draw that also included a Rolex watch which was won by Niall McDaid from Bishops Street from a pound ticket and a lawn mower which went to Patrick McDaid from Rosemount who purchased a ticket for pound. Blaine Tierney of Vogue Competitions and Vogue Car sales in Springtown has given away a large number of cars in competitions since lockdown began in March.     The Lamborghini is our biggest giveaway yet, its an amazing car and it would cost pound, new, he said. Its brilliant to be able to give people le changing prizes and the majority of the prize winners have been from Derry.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Earlier this month, Gemma set a new record of kg, in the open weight category, in the Shankill Barbell Deadlt Championship, despite only being involved in the sport for seven months. The  year-old, who played Gaelic football for Craigbane, started off the sport in a bid to lose weight and has since really excelled. Since then, her aunt Ciara got her on board with City of Derry Rug by Club. “My journey started at the gym where my original goal was to lose weight which I did,” Gemma points out. “Then, over time, I realised strength is key and that I had plenty of it so I then invested in a coach.” googletag.cmd.push She linked up with Matthew McKeegan and trains out of MK Strength and Fitness in Derry. Matthew McKeegan came second in Irelands strongest man at the weekend. In September this year, Gemma dead-lted kg at the championships in Derry before setting her kg record, one that less than  females in the world have achieved. “My next competition is Irelands strongest woman in Derry in March next year and I will attempt the world record in April,” she adds. “Achieving these targets gives me the itch and desire to get stronger and better”. Magheras Dolores McGuckin continues to prove that age is only a number. Despite being , she continues to aim for the top. She was crowned Ireland’s strongest woman last April and competed in Britain’s strongest women. googletag.cmd.push “I should be in the masters category as an over , but compete in a weight category by choice as it was more challenging,” said Dolores, who is originally from Dungiven. In September, she broke her own record for the fourth time, also at MK Fitness in Derry, setting a new Irish Record of kg, at the Ukg category, in the process. “My goal is to hit kg and I’m making it my mission,” Dolores stresses. “It’s quite unusual that both the middle weight and open weightrecords are now held by strongwomenin the north as they were previously held by strongwoman in the south of Ireland...coincidentally we are both from CountyDerry.”     Last month, Dolores also competed at the championships in Shankill and took first place in her weight category. “This was a strange experience and as an elite event during Covidit was heldbehind closed doors with no spectators allowed,” Dolores added. “This was the first time I travelled alone to any competition and I was concerned about competing in these unusual circumstances however the other competitors were very supportive of each other in the absence of spectators.” Like Gemma, Dolores is eyeing Irelands Strongest Woman  and defending her Ukg title. “Following this competition I plan to compete at Record Breakers in  in Belfast during the month of April where I will attempt to break my own Irish record again.” As  comes to a close, Gemma and Dolores both aim to bring their performances to the another level next year.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Writing in his new book, The Invisible Game, the two-time All-Ireland winning midfielder dedicated the battleground chapter to players he came up against in the midfield sectors on pitches across Ireland. Walsh highlighted nearly  players, which included Enda Muldoon and Anthony Tohill, before summing up to give his top three. Brian McGilligan, supported by Ger Lynch, in action against Andrew Jarmon of Australia during the  International Rules series in Croke Park  McGilligan, McGrane and McCreery were among those I admired most, and McGilligan was the best in my opinion.

Once Derry won, he didnt care who was getting the love from the terraces or the media, but he was the heartbeat of the team.

Students save a considerable amount of time by using the laneway to get to and from school.The former Down Council attempted to secure funds to upgrade the laneway and carry out a much-needed resurfacing and lighting scheme but liaising with representatives from a number of statutory agencies including the Housing Executive and Roads Service, the ownership issue could not be firmly established.Describing the laneway as a ldquovital link for residents who live at the Langley Road area in particular, Cllr Walker hopes that, with the publicrsquos help, he can find out who owns the land.ldquoThere are several street lights along part of the laneway but the Department for Infrastructure insists that it is not responsible for the land, he said.Cllr Walker says it is necessary to find out who owns the laneway as work is starting to upgrade Ballynahinchrsquos masterplan which includes a number of new walking trails in and around the town.ldquoWhy not include Beedhamrsquos Lane in the planned trails andwe could find out who this piece of ground it could pave the way for its upgrade, he continued.ldquoPeople could be forgiven for thinking that it leads to a farm. Given that we are in the midst of winter, the laneway is an awful state and children who are walking to school are literally getting covered in mud.Cllr Walker has suggested that it would not cost a signicant sum of money to upgrade the laneway which he suggests has the potential to become a key component of the townrsquos planned new walking trails.ldquoIf anyone can help me identy who is responsible for this piece of land could they contact either myself, the Langley Road Residentsrsquo Association or Newry, Mourne and Down Council, he said.Cllr Walker added: ldquoThe upgrade of this particular laneway has been raised on numerous occasions in the past, but nothing has ever been done.ldquoGiven the high volume of pedestrian traffic which uses it, itrsquos important work gets underway to upgrade it.ldquoIn seeking to find out who owns the laneway I hope that it can be determined of this particular piece of ground is a registered right of way..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd December 2020 Caldwell.jpg","title":"Caldwell’s goal seals cup win  ","story":"DOWNrsquoS U- hurlers will have cause to celebrate Christmas with a little more cheer after they clinched the Peadar Oacute Laithaacutein Cup with a two-point win over Meath in Navan on Sunday.Two minutes into injury time, and with the sides deadlocked at - apiece, it looked aswe were heading to extra time when Ryan Byas struck over a wonderful m sideline.Meath looked to have sealed victory from a doggedly tough Down side with virtually the last play of the contest.However, straight from the resulting puck-out Michael Dorrian raced clear of midfield and floated the sliotar towards the edge of the box.Francis Caldwell reached highest and as he slipped past both Cottrell and Ennis in defence.A deftly-placed one handed flick out-foxed Jack Fagan as he lunged out to intercept the sliotar. He could only watch on but as it bypassed his attempts and nestled in the back of the Meath net.Finn Turpin opened the day with the first score of the game inside a minute. Downrsquos captain, Tom McGrattan, knocked over a free a minute later, but by the end of the first quarter Meath were in front as midfielder Joey Cole got the next three scores.McGrattan levelled matters from play shortly afterwards, as both defences were kept busy.On several occasions in the first half, Down threatened the Meath rearguard as goal chances went begging with James Clarke, Michael Dorrian and Caldwell all having attempts saved, blocked or bundled away from danger.Down struggled in the middle of the park and found it hard to win any puck-outs against a physically strong Meath team.They did though throw themselves into every tackle. Jarlath McCollum, Deaglan Mallon and James Higgins played out of their skins, harrying, hustling and shutting down any potential danger as Meath tried in vain to breach the Down defence.A McGrattan free and a Caldwell point saw Down edge into a two-point lead in a very scrappy final ten minutes of the half.With less than three minutes to the whistle, Meath hit a purple patch with four unanswered scores, two courtesy of the dangerous Ryan Byas and the others from corner men Rory Fagan and Josh Harris.Playing with a slight breeze in the first half, Meath knew thatthey were to ensure a victory on home soil, they would surely need some daylight between themselves and their northern opponents before the change of ends.Thankfully for Down, Turpin, Dorrian and Clarke kept Meath on their toes as they eventually managed to engineer the last score of the half.Oisiacuten Coulter popped the sliotar over from out near the side-line to leave just two points between the sides at the end of the half.Within the opening two minutes of the restart, Oisiacuten Coulter continued a good vain of form and had the sides level for the fth time, as both sides refused to yield.Joey Cole pointed four minutes later as the Royals introduced Matthew Cully to full forward, his introduction would breathe new le into their attack.Down initially struggled to handle the burly full forward, who ended the day with three superbly-taken points whilst under severe pressure from their Ulster counterparts.The lead changed hands again as two McGrattan frees and a Michael Dorrian point gave them a slight edge with the game fast approaching the second water break.A Jack Meagher score, followed swtly by Matthew Cullyrsquos first of the day, when he picked Downrsquos pocket after a quick puck-out had failed to reach its intended target, shook Down. Instead of leading going down the home straight, it was level at - each.With  minutes played Denis Darby won a sideline for the home side and when Byas hit the sweetest of strikes straight over Pearse Smythrsquos crossbar there were scenes of jubilation and euphoria from the Meath bench as surely it looked asJustin Coyne would be presented with the cup.Sean Young had this young Down side well drilled and it was a credit to the teamrsquos spirit that within the next  seconds Downrsquos goal machine, Francis Caldwell ensured that it would be a victory for Down in the strangest of seasons five days before Christmas.After seeing Tom McGrattan lt the cup, a delighted Young was magnanimous in victory and praised Meath for the high standard of Hurling that made this contest such a thriller.ldquoWe knew coming into the game today this would be a very dferent challenge than last week, he said.ldquoMeath are always a big strong physical side with a spread of talented Hurlers in their ranks. We knew it wasnrsquot going to be easy to play them in their back yard, it was going to be a monumental task to get over the line.ldquoI thought the game was nip and tuck in the first quarter as our main objective was not to concede any early goals playing against a stf breeze in the first half. I canrsquot praise the boys enough, our bench helped us over the line and it was a superbly taken goal from Francis.Meath: J Fagan, R Ennis, H Cottrell, E Cole, P Connelly, J Coyne, K OrsquoGorman, J Cole , E Grehan, R Byas , J Meagher , S Donnelly, R Fagan , J Harris, S Cunningham .Subs: M Cullyfor Harris, E McCormack for Donnelly, D Darby for Cunningham.Down: P Smyth, J Higgins, D Mallon, J McCollum, N Kelly, C Savage, F McFall, R OrsquoNeill, J Duggan, F Turpin , T McGrattan , M Dorrian , O Coulter , J Clarke, F Caldwell .Subs: S Milliganfor OrsquoNeill, F MacManus for McGrattan..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd December 2020 Castlewellan.jpg","title":"Castlewellan woman’s releases debut children’s book  ","story":"A CASTLEWELLAN woman has joined the ranks of childrenrsquos book authors.Kathleen McPolin, who is a Speech and Language Therapy Assistant in Downpatrick SureStart, has just published the first in an exciting new series featuring the farm-based adventures of Boomer and Blanky.Produced by Shanway Press in Belfast, the books are aimed at encouraging early yearsrsquo interest in reading and promote new vocabulary.Part of Kathleenrsquos work with SureStart over the past  years has been helping to facilitate rhythm, rhyme, and story sessions each week for children - with their parents or s.ldquoBecause this age group have short attention spans, I find the books that really capture their attention are the colourful ones with few words but yet have a story to tell, explained Kathleen.After finding it dficult to get the right books to cover everyday topics such as transport, weather, clothes, and food in a short-story style, Kathleen decided to create her own.ldquoChildren love to see the same characters appear regularly in their books.

He had lived in London most of his le, leaving Saul at the age of .Engaged to be married, but struggling to find the right ring, he found himself back in Northern Ireland on business he decided to call on his uncle Will, his only surviving Irish relative.It was the eve of the longest night of the year, a few days before Christmas, and a bitterly cold late afternoon. On the side of a rural road, devoid of street lights, all but hidden by trees, was an old fashioned car, with smoke escaping from its engine.Standing beside the car, kicking it was a young woman in a bridal dress. She appeared to be beating up the motor. Jim applied the brakes of his vehicle and rolled down the window.lsquoCan I help rsquo The young woman looked at him with burning blue eyes, turned away and thumped the boot. lsquoUseless piece of junk,rsquo she shrieked. The young woman attempted to give the car one last kick, missed and ped with a thud on to her rear. Jim got out of his car. Trying not to laugh he rushed over to the young woman and attempted to help her to her feet.She pulled her arm away and with an effort dragged herself up using the carrsquos half open door. She ripped of her shoe and attacked the window screen. She turned to Jim. lsquoWhat do you know about fixing cars rsquo Jim shrugged.The bride pierced him with fiery blue eyes.lsquoAre you going to a fancy dress party rsquo he asked. lsquoI am going to be married,rsquo she replied. She banged the roof of the car with her shoe a number of times, hopping about attempting to put the shoe back on to her foot. lsquoLet me give you a lt,rsquo suggested Jim.In order to steady herself the bride hung on to Jimrsquos shoulder and finally won the battle of the shoe. lsquoThought yoursquod never ask.rsquo She lashed out at the motor with her fist, missed, spun around and fell into Jimrsquos arms.Saul Church was only a mile away. The lady could not walk to her own wedding, besides it was growing dark. She grabbed his coat in near panic. lsquoMy ring,rsquo she cried. lsquoIrsquove lost my engagement ring!rsquo She dropped on to her knees. lsquoThis is a nightmare and you are not helping.rsquoJim walked at speed to his car and grabbed a torch as the bride crawled around the ground, feeling the earth in a vain attempt to retrieve the ring. Jim ed and shone the torch about the trees and grass. She grabbed his leg and pointed towards her car.lsquoItrsquos cursed, the car is cursed, and so are you.rsquo She bit him on the knee. lsquoGet off me,rsquo he shouted. She sat back on a muddy mound. lsquoI may have overreacted,rsquo she said. lsquoIs my lipstick smudged rsquo She wiped her hand across her lips. rsquoI think it might be smudged.rsquoJim did not answer, choosing to rub his knee, shine the torch, find the ring and hightail it to his unclersquos house as fast as possible. lsquoItrsquos all go,rsquo she said, trying to make conversation. lsquoIf my father could see me now, he would be so proud.rsquo The young woman adjusted her veil. It slowly drooped on to the side of her head and from there drted towards her lap. She picked it up and tossed it away.Jim located the ring beside the front wheel. lsquoIrsquove got it, Irsquove got the ring.rsquo He retrieved it and gave it a amateur polish. It was silver with an small amber stone as its centre piece. He read the inion lsquoTo M.K, Saul rsquo. It must have been handed down through her intendedrsquos family.lsquoYou great big sexy man. The bride jumped to her feet. Well done.rsquo She kissed him on the nose. lsquoItrsquos a lovely ring,rsquo said an embarrassed Jim. lsquoI am engaged, havenrsquot got the ring yet.rsquoThe bride grabbed the ring and placed it on to her finger lsquoThen you had best get a move on, you donrsquot want to lose her.rsquo She took out a hanky and blew her nose with considerable force.Jim noticed in the torch light that she was muddy and dishevelled, her face and red hair littered with spots of mud.lsquoYou donrsquot have a driver rsquo he asked. lsquoSmelly little man, didnrsquot trust him, kicked him out a mile or so back,rsquo she replied. Jim had spotted a somewhat sad looking gentleman on the road a few minutes before. lsquoShall we go rsquo asked the bride, as she gathered up her dress and walked towards his car, tripping over her loose shoe, all the while muttering under her breath.They didnrsquot speak much during the short trip to the church lsquoYes, I am looking for a ring. Where did you get yours rsquo Jim inquired.                                                                    lsquoYou like it rsquo asked his odd passenger as she struggled in vain to apply lipstick. Jim smiled and nodded his head. The bride inspected her ring lsquoItrsquos very nice, expensive,rsquo she boasted. lsquoWas it handed down through your fianceacutersquos family rsquo The bride didnrsquot reply. lsquoI live in London, I am visiting my uncle Will, do you know him, Will OrsquoBrien rsquoJim noticed that the young lady was gazing out of the window, looking slightly lost, she was not in the mood for conversation. The car came to a halt outside the little church. Warm lights beamed from inside. Jim thought it was an odd time of day to get married and a strange time of year. A few indistinct people stood around the grounds of the church.The bride opened the door, lsquoIrsquom here,rsquo she said and fell out of the car, lsquoIrsquom alright,rsquo she said painfully, stood up and slipped. Steadying herself, she kicked his car and her shoe dropped off. She picked it up and without so much as a thank you, disappeared, muddy and wet, into the church, resembling a worn-out scarecrow more than a bride. Jim waited a moment before driving off.Uncle Will and Jim talked and joked as they caught up with all the news over tea and cake. lsquoDid you ever meet Maureen Walsh rsquo asked Uncle Will. Jim shook his head as he helped himself to an extra slice of cake.Your grandfather was meant to give her lt to her wedding. She and he didnrsquot hit it off.rsquoUncle Will poked the dying embers of the fire. lsquoHe wasnrsquot one for bathing,rsquo he mumbled under his breath.lsquoShe died a few hours ago. Her husband called around almost at once to see me, gave me this for you. How he knew yoursquod be here is beyond a mystery.rsquoUncle Will handed Jim a small box. He opened it. To his surprise it was a engagement ring, silver with a small amber jewel at its centre. Jim focused his eyes and read the inscription lsquoTo M.K, Saul .rsquo Uncle Will popped a bun into his mouth. lsquoYour young ladyrsquos called Mary Kane rsquo lsquoMaureenrsquos maiden name was Keenan, She married her husband back in, let me think...rsquo Jim closed the little box. lsquoAt Saul Church, Christmas ,rsquo he replied.

It was slightly bizarre, as one was a track and field meet, and the other a cross country race.As most of us donrsquot know what day it is, let alone which month, this blending of two dferent seasons seemed acceptable to many.The ANI Winter Track Series, spread over two nights, included a range of distances with East Down ACrsquos Neil Curran opting to give the km a blast. He has mostly been training solo since March and was glad of the opportunity to mix with some speedy competitors.He raced well and was pleased with third place in his heat. He recorded a time of .. which is only five seconds off his PB for the distance and proves that he remains in good form, despite the lack of racing to keep him sharp.In  his attempts at this distance exceeded the  minute barrier so this represents commendable progress overall. Keep at it Neil.The first cross country event of the  autumn season was also the last of the year. The Bobby Rea Memorial had been scheduled and rescheduled as restrictions rose and fell, but finally got away on Sunday at the Billy Neill playing fields in Comber.There was a limit on the entries and waves were allocated to permit social distancing. Sadly there were no spectators allowed. East Down AC had only three runners taking part as the change of date had affected overall attendance.The first to test the underfoot conditions were the senior men with Aaron McGrady representing East Down.The race got underway after a short period of silence in honour of John McKeag, the Ballydrain Harriers stalwart who sadly passed away the previous Monday in his th year.Aaron had hoped to fit in this particular race as a marker for his form ahead of the Intermediate Championships scheduled for mid-January but now likely to face abandonment due to the lockdown proposed to be implemented for six weeks after Christmas.The race consisted of two laps of .km each, the shorter distance designed, like the ision of the runners, into waves of up to a maximum of  runners each, to prevent mass overtaking to comply with social distancing requirements.As only half of the over  entries turned up, it was necessary to use only two waves.Aaron was drawn in the first wave alongside the faster runners and though he prefers to start relatively slowly and then set out to catch those in front, he doubtedit would be possible on this occasion so he was well to the fore from the off and came through at the end of the first lap in fourth place.However he stuck with his pre-race plan and when the runners re-appeared at the end of lap two, he was in third place behind Mark McKinstryand Craig McMeechan , and comfortably maintained his position until the finish line.He said afterwards that he was happy with how the race had gone and had no regrets about his tactics. The first three recorded times were ., . and . respectively, which is pretty hot running on a cross country course that was holding a fair amount of overnight rain. Well done Aaron.The second race was for senior and masters women and East Down AC again had only one representative mdash the ever-enthusiastic Sharon Madine.Sharon started conservatively in the second of the two waves, but proceeded to make steady progress and at the end of her two laps she had a time of . against her name. When the results of both waves were combined she placed overall th but first in the over- category. Well worth the efforts Sharon.The third and final event of the day was for Male Masters and again a sole East Down AC runner mdash the evergreen Dee Murray. Another who seems to have lost none of his competitive edge during the pandemic, Dee simply turns up and runs as hard as he can.On Sunday this meant that his time of . gave him th place overall and second in the over- category. Well done Dee.In spite of the absence of spectators, all who turned up said that it was well organised and they were glad to have taken part. As one of the few interested official observers, I have to agree with that.Sandwiched between these two events was the East Down AC annual Xmas predicted K at the Downshire Estate on Thursday evening.This is a fun event where runners try to guess how long they will take to cover the distance and then without a watch or other timing device do their best to match it. With the emphasis on accuracy and pacing rather than speed the way is wide open for all to snatch the prize.The top five were impressively close to their predicted times with fth place going to Johnny Holmes, who was seven seconds out. Deirdre Weatherall and Colin Shields tied for third equal - each with a five-second deficit.Seamus Savage was four seconds off his guess, which was good going, but it would have been hard to beat the winner Maureen Kelly who was a mere one second to the better of her guess. She was delighted to top the table and over the moon to find that her prize was a hamper of goodies as well as a pound voucher for Bells Supervalu Crossgar. Congratulations Maureen.Even though the runners had to be split into waves and social distancing was enforced, it was the best that was on offer due to current circumstances and it was a good boost to club morale. Instead of charging the normal entry fee, members were asked to donate food items which have been duly delivered to the Fountain Foodbank in the town.All in all it was a successful night for all concerned and an uplting end to a less than inspiring .

The enthralling cup tie ended - after  minutes with the sides locked at - after extra-time at Hampden Park.Hazard, who was recently handed the number one jersey by Hoops boss Neil Lennon, made both his European and Scottish Premiership debuts and retained the starting jersey for Sundayrsquos final.The stopper mdash who has also forced his way into the Northern Ireland international squad mdash was delighted to play a major part in his sidersquos cup final victory.And while his current contract expires in the summer which allows him to negotiate with other clubs in January, should he favour a move away from Celtic Park, leaving the club he has supported since he was a boy is the last thing on his mind.Conor described Sundayrsquos cup final as ldquocrazy day for him and his family who watched the match at home.ldquoThree weeks ago, I would never have been able to picture what happened there on that pitch, he said moments after his penalty shoot-out heroics.ldquoI am just absolutely over the moon. Irsquove been a Celtic fan my whole le and to get this opportunity, well I am just delighted, he said.ldquoTo play for such a worldwide club, we know what the fans expect and how much they drive us towards winning. It is an honour to play for them. I want to fully focus on each match, playing week in, week out here at Celtic, and hopefully it will come together.Conor said the final was a ldquomomentous day for him and his family, explaining that his lsquophone hasnrsquot stopped ringing.Conor grew up in Downpatrick and developed his skills in the Celtic academy, travelling across to Scotland for games from a young age.ldquoThe club means everything to me, he said. ldquoWe used to get up at am to get on the boat to go to matches and we wouldnrsquot be home until three the next morning. Itrsquos something I always dreamed of growing up.Conor has spent several spells out on loan in recent years in order to build-up his first team experience, readying him for a career between the sticks for Celtic.He got his chance to impress against Lille and Kilmarnock r as Celticrsquos form hit a rocky patch, but being selected by Lennon for the win over Hearts at Hampden Park was a huge confidence boost.ldquoI have to thank all of the staff and the manager for putting trust in me, said Conor.ldquoIt was a huge honour in such a big game. Thankfully, I was able to repay that trust with the two penalty saves. I have put a lot of work in and gone on loan spells waiting for my chance. The coaches have helped me a lot throughout the club.Sundayrsquos cup win clinched the domestic treble for Celtic for the fourth successive campaign, something that has never before been achieved. It is also the th time Celtic have been crowned Scottish Cup winners, with the Downpatrick man admitting the team has a lot of work to do to try and achieve its aims and targets this year.ldquoThe final was only my third game for the club, so Irsquom taking each day as it comes. As a team and as a group, this win could be a major factor in turning things round, he added.Conorrsquos family watched his cup final heroics at home in Downpatrick as fans were not allowed to attend the match due to coronavirus restrictions. However, they were over the moon with his achievements.ldquoI donrsquot think I have any fingernails left after that, laughed his beaming dad Gary. ldquoWe didnrsquot know up until the last minutehe would get the nod to play or not. We knew he did well in the European game and certainly made a case for himself. He only found out on Thursday from Lennon that he would be playing.Whilst there was undoubted pride from his dad, Gary said Conor has deserved his break due to how hard he has worked.ldquoHe has put so much time into Celtic over the years and done all the right things. All the close family are so proud of him, his mum Pauline, his younger brother Jack. He was superb.ldquoConor very much wants to be able to go on and make himself number one for Celtic. He is only  and this was just his third appearance, so hersquos been doing well. He had a loan spell at Dundee and did very well there and that has put him in good stead.Gary said Conor has also been drawing high praise from his Northern Ireland manager Ian Barraclough after breaking through for the senior team too.ldquoBarraclough has spoken really highly of Conor. He did very well for him when he was the manager at under-age level and the boss knows what he can do in training, he said.Conorrsquos family are no strangers to sporting success either.

They will be hoping that he [the abuser] will be OK, she explained.ldquoI have seen over the years that women and children develop this radar with antennas scanning all the time to judge his mood, howrsquos he walking, howrsquos he eating, scanning constantly all the time, thinking is it safe, is he OK, are we annoying him  It will not matter as he is only one who can control his behaviour.While Eileen is keen to highlight that Womenrsquos Aid will provide   help to women, she also wants to dispel some myths about domestic abuse and violence and to talk about coercive control mdash any act or a pattern of acts of assault, threats, humiliation and intimidation or other abuse that is used to harm, punish, or frighten victims.ldquoOne of the main things we do for women when they come into the service is to help her understand that there was not anything she did as therersquos nothing she could have done which would have stopped him, she said.ldquoWe have women who have had to beg to have a shower and we have women who phone us who are literally hiding in a hedge as hersquos walking up and down the street trying to find her.ldquoA lot of us think its black eyes and broken bones but the real damage is the psychological torture that is going on where women and children are terrorised in their own home. They are led to believe that everything is all their fault, they are at the root cause of whatever incident. When you are living with that  , you are only surviving.Womenrsquos Aid recently launched an awareness campaign called lsquoUnlock Your Lockdownrsquo to highlight their services to women who are living in fear or under threat.Eileen said: ldquoI would say that any woman who is worried at how she is going to get through Christmas andit is to do with her partner, then I would say to ring us and have a chat. We donrsquot force anybody into the service and we donrsquot make women leave home, thatrsquos always their choice.ldquoWhat we do is to work with her and help her to determine where she is and whatrsquos the best option for her. It can be either just one phone call to her engaging in full services for anything up to two years.She stressed that the first thing Womenrsquos Aid do when a women calls them is to assess the risk she and her children are in.ldquoThe first we do is assess the risk, to find out how safe she is, where she is, where her children are, what is the immediate priority  she stressed.ldquoDepending on the level of risk, we may had to do several dferent things. It could be that a woman is hiding out at a family member or friendrsquos house, so it might involve the police or social services.Then we try to manage the risk and reduce it as much as possible and then we try and work with out how best to help her move forward and to keep her safe. For the top % of women who come to us, we would hold a Multi-Agency Risk Assessmentconference and then we would work with them on a continuous basis.ldquoHowever, I would like to stress there is no such thing as low level risk of domestic abuse for women because the only person who is in control of whether that risk is high, low or medium is the perpetrator.She is dismissive of abusers where an incident of abuse involves either drink or drugs.ldquoIf you keep terrorising the people that you love and continually use the excuse of alcohol or drugs I donrsquot buy that, said Eileen.ldquoWhat drink and drugs to is give him an excuse for violence. When itrsquos over he will say it was the drink or whatever. But I always say to that isI woke up tomorrow morning to see my partner battered or bruised and he told me I had done it last night with drink in me, would I take a drink again  Yet these guys continue to do it.ldquoThere is no doubt about that we work with traumatised women and children and people try and deal with it in many dferent ways. Trauma basically makes the whole world unsafe for you and you donrsquot know where the next incident will come from.Support and information are available at www.womensaidni.org including information on the local centres covering all of Northern IrelandTo contact police, call the non-emergency lsquorsquo number or call lsquorsquo in an emergency.

But the media has been dominated by the opponents of academic selection, circling in this Covid-hit year to undermine the transfer testThis has had an impact on a range of issues, including education.One of the most contentious issues educational issues in Northern Ireland is the so-called ‘transfer test’, which is administered by two private organisations, AQE and PPTC. In almost all of the public discussions on this issue, contentious as it is, I have been the single outspoken proponent of the test proceeding, and more specically, the single public figure willing to offer a defence of academic selection in general.    \" fill\"#ea\"  to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...The media has been dominated by the opponents of academic selection, circling in this Covid-hit year, seeking to undermine the use of the transfer test using the highly charged language of the educational progressives, and claiming private ownership of the ‘child-centred’ stance on this issue. In all of my public engagements to date — both on television and on the radio — I have sought to make the argument that those who are portraying themselves as the moral compass of the Province in relation to this issue are, in fact, offering no workable alternatives for those schools who wish to remain committed to using academic selection, even in this year. Indeed, despite there being  schools which removed the use of the transfer test this year, in favour of using alternative admissions criteria,  of Northern Ireland’s grammar schools have remained steadfast in their commitment to continuing to use the test as the primary admissions criterion. The  schools who ditched the test, we are told, have shown phenomenal leadership and have put their children’s needs first. • Ben Lowry: Covid will be used to undermine grammar schoolsThe other  grammars are, in contrast, by implication described using words like ‘cruel’, ‘barbaric’, and are accused of failing to put their children’s needs first, by people in public office. Indeed, the NI Children’s Commissioner, Koulla Yiasouma, has regularly used her office in her public engagements on this issue to describe the administration of the test this year as ‘cruel’, whilst the Interim Mental Health Champion, Professor Siobhan O’Neill, has similarly in a radio debate with me on BBC Talkback, described the transfer test as ‘barbaric’.Furthermore, Professor O’Neill on that same radio debate, together with articles on Belfast Live and The Derry Journal, contends that the administration of the test this year has the potentialto cause “lasting and lelong” damage to children’s mental health, citing anecdotal stories of children crying and considering suicide because they had to sit the test.In a similar manner, Archbishop Eamon Martin in Theon May , went beyond the scope of his office to cite the unsubstantiated claim that “educational disadvantage will be exacerbated” should testing continue. He urged schools to admit pupils on the basis of “non-academic” criteria, but gave no further indication of how this would work in practice for the schools which remain committed to the concept and philosophy of admitting pupils to their schools on the basis of academic merit. These discussions should trouble us greatly as a society, because they represent a worrying culture which exists within debates of this nature namely, to occupy the moral high ground, seeking to win the argument in the hearts of others. Depressingly, opponents to these views are criticised for failing to put the needs of children first. The  grammar schools committed to using academic selection this year are, therefore, seen as perpetrators of cruelty, barbarism, and an anti-children ethos. Their commitment to selection in this year is, de facto, taken to be the action of an elite collection of schools seeking only to protect their own interests over and above the interests of children. My call to the readership of this newspaper is, to the contrary, let us celebrate the steadfast commitment of those grammar school heads who have said that they are determined to continue the educational provision for approximately % of NI’s children in selective education. Let us avoid the temptation to be swept along by the ill-considered rhetorical drivel which those seeking to be the moral barometers of this debate would have us believe. Being ‘child-centred’ is not a normative, definitive position, which is the possession of one side of this discussion. Is it so terribly inconceivable that being child-centred might be to allow those children who wish to sit the test — even in this chaotic year — a chance to do so, and to pursue the grammar school education they want, based on merit  Is it so unfathomable that we would seek to protect the excellent work which takes place in NI’s grammar schools, and their right to admit children on the basis of educational merit, which can only be established through the administration of a test We must distance ourselves people in publicly appointed offices and privileged societal positions who try to tell us what is best for every child. The hysterical language of these contributors should not surprise us. What perhaps should, however, is the even more troubling failure of our education minister, Peter Weir, to offer the protection of his office to a process which he claims to support.I tried to engage with the department via the minister’s SpAd , and was reminded that it was the department’s role to facilitate the transfer test, but not to support it. Minister Weir failed around % of NI’s children with his unwillingness to offer a robust defence of academic selection. His three Sinn Fein predecessors never missed an opportunity to undermine academic selection. Now is a time for those who occupy public office to show courage and integrity and to follow the evidence to avoid empty rhetoric and the pursuit of public approval.Northern Ireland’s children deserve much better from the adult community. • Dr William H Kitchen is an author and academic• Ben Lowry: Covid will be used to undermine grammar schools——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

But there are also powerful arguments that cracking down hard on the virus is better in the long run because a period of sacrice and deprivation gets us more quickly to a normal society and a ing economy.Few people think the choices facing politicians are easy, particularly when most establishment scientistsare telling them that the disaster will follow a failure to go into lockdown.But the evidence in favour of school closures is highly uncertain and the scientists are far from unanimous. They recognise the damage done to children from missing class.Pupils were out of school from March until September. They had an extended break at Halloween. Some schools then closed for Christmas early.Peter Weir has been right to try to get schools back as much as possible next week. In particular exam years need to . If not, children suffer, most of all the poorest ones.Young people are almost never badly hit by Covid, and the youngest among them rarely infect adults.Meanwhile, as Dr William Kitchen writes opposite, there is a disturbing push to use Covid to undermine academic selection.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityMinister for education, Kirsty Williams confirmed the move as part of a ldquonational effort to reduce transmission of the coronavirus.The minister said: Minister Kirsty Williams said: ldquoEvery day, we are seeing more and more people admitted to hospital with coronavirus symptoms.ldquoThe virus is putting our health service under signicant and sustained pressure and it is important we all make a contribution to reduce its transmission.ldquoIn his advice to me today, the CMO recommends that a move to online learning should be implemented for secondary school pupils as soon as is practicable.ldquoI can therefore confirm that a move to online learning should be implemented for secondary school pupils and college students from Monday next week.ldquoWe recognise, as we did during the firebreak, that it is more dficult for primary and special school age children to undertake self-directed learning.ldquoThat is why we are encouraging primary and special schools to continue to stay open.ldquoHaving spoken to local education leaders, I am confident that schools and colleges have online learning provision in place.ldquoThis will also be important in ensuring that students are at home during this time, learning and staying safe.ldquoCritically, and this is very important, children should be at home.ldquoThis is not an early Christmas holiday, please do everything you can to minimise your contact with others.The Minister said her decision followed expert advice from Walesrsquos Chief Medical Officer showing that the public health situation in Wales was deteriorating.The latest data shows that rates of COVID- have further increased across Wales and have now exceeded  k with a test positivity of %.The R rate in Wales has increased to . with a doubling time of just . days.There had been calls for schools in Wales to close early in order to allow children time to quarantine ahead of the Christmas period, with some parents saying they would not send their children to school in the final week of term.However, the Welsh Government had previously stated schools would remain open.On Monday, health minister Vaughan Gething said: \"A signicant number of schools have not had an outbreak. Primary schools in particular, there is no rationale to close them.\"We have to take in account the fact that evidence doesnrsquot show signicant harm we can reduce or avoid by closing them.\"What we do know is that it causes real harm to children and their prospects.\"It is also the direct impact on the mental health and wellbeing of children by closing schools.\"While first minister Mark Drakeford said: ldquoIf I thought that those young people would genuinely be at home, genuinely self-isolating, genuinely creating that period before Christmas to keep them safe, Id be attracted to the idea.\"Im afraid the risks are that that simply wouldnt happen, that those children would be doing riskier things than they would in school. Better for them to be in school.\"But there was pressure from teaching unions for a sht in position.The National Association of Headteachers Cymruwrote to the minister for education, Kirsty Williams, to call for the closure of schools ahead of the Christmas holiday.They said: ldquoParents will undoubtedly vote with their feet and children will be kept at home.\"That choice will not be afforded to school staffschool leaders are not supported in closing school sites.\"No direction from the government on this issue risks large numbers of families making their own decision to take children out of school and once again will result in a mixed economy across Wales, with local authorities making their own decisions based on local circumstances. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityMike Kingston, who this week collected his long service medal to recognise the achievement, has shared his pride and some of his memories over the years.Mr Kingston, who is married and has two children and two grandchildren, joined Penarth RNLI on November  , as a volunteer crew member ndash and quickly progressed to become leboat helm.Along with his fellow volunteer crew members, he attended hundreds of incidents, launching day and night in all kinds of weather conditions, to go to the aid of people in trouble at sea.Since his retirement from being a sea-going member of the team, he has spent the last  years as shore crew and one of Penarthrsquos Deputy Launching Authorities, liaising with the coastguards when they request assistance, and managing the leboatrsquos launch.Mr Kingstonrsquos leboat career has extended beyond the UK. In , he was a member of a crew of just eight leboat volunteers from across the UK who flew out to aid the relief effort in flood-stricken Mozambique.Together, the team faced the dangers of crocodiles, hippos, poisonous snakes and anti-personnel mines, navigating rivers that had burst their banks, in a rescue mission to bring desperately needed medical relief to , people in villages marooned by flood waters.ldquoWe had five small D class inflatable leboats, and had to ferry doctors and medical supplies to areas that had been written off as impossible, as helicopters couldnrsquot land there and they were inaccessible by road, he said.ldquoIt was so hot that the soles of my boots melted. We had to spend the night on sandbars where we took turns to keep watch, as the crocodiles were very keen to join us.Since he joined the crew, Mike has combined his volunteering with his paid job in the South Wales Fire and Rescue service. He joined the service back in , at just , and progressed from his position as a firefighter, to the lead instructor for recruit training, finally finishing his career in  as Chair of the Water Rescue group, and a member of the servicersquos all Wales flood response team.Over the past four decades, -year-old Mr Kingston has seen huge changes in the way the RNLI operates.He has seen Penarth leboat station move from its original home in the deck chair store underneath the current Coffi Co building on the Esplanade, to its current location just up the road in a purpose built, modern leboat station.ldquoIrsquom sure the people of Penarth will remember the hand held maroons that were fired off by a leboat crew member to call the rest of us to the station for a launch, he said.ldquoBut even before that, I remember when the Pier Master would get us down to the station by firing the maroons out of a small cannon.ldquoNowadays, technology has moved on and we use pagers, mobiles phones and computer systems to respond to a shout.ldquoThese systems are a lot more sophisticated, but itrsquos still the same feeling when yoursquore called out of bed in the early hours of a freezing cold January morning.ldquoNo matter how times have moved on, one thing that remains constant is the unbelievable commitment of the whole RNLI team.ldquoThere have been so many highs and lows over the past  years. As all the team will know, itrsquos good to feel that yoursquore part of a team, giving something to your community.ldquoBut there have also been some sad times when people have lost their lives. Irsquom proud to have been a part of Penarth RNLI family.Thanking him for his  years of service, Jason Dunlop, Penarth Leboat Operations Manager said: ldquoOn behalf of all at Penarth leboat station, I would like to congratulate Mike on this fantastic achievement and thank him for his commitment and support to saving lives at sea over the last  years. We are all volunteers at Penarth RNLI, we give our time freely to support our local community.ldquoMikersquos contribution to the charity over the years has not only been volunteering his time, hersquos also been happy to share his wealth of experience with the crew as we train and work together when someone needs our help. Hersquos been a fantastic mentor to many and for that we thank him. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local community\"The increasing numbers of Covid- case numbers across Cardf and the Vale of Glamorgan Health Board area could not be any more serious or alarming.Therefore, this message needs to be acted upon urgently and be seen as a warning to each and every one of us about the seriousness of the health situation we are all now facing.If current projections continue, then by Christmas week we will be seeing more than four times the number of new infections each day, than we were seeing at the start of December. These projected figures are the highest we have ever seen in this County and are likely to reach almost , cases per , in the seven-day period up until Christmas Day.If you compare that with the figure of  cases per , when we entered the local lockdown, you can see how serious the current situation is. We can no longer be complacent.We know from the first and second waves that as case numbers increase, more people get seriously unwell, and we will inevitably see more deaths from Coronavirus - many of which can be avoided,we act now.We are deeply concerned that hospitals and primary care services across Cardf and the Vale of Glamorgan are now under unsustainable pressure due to COVID-, and sadly, but inevitably, the number of people who are becoming very sick is increasing daily.Each and every one of us has a responsibility to act now. We must all follow Welsh Government coronavirus regulations, butyou can also take further actions to protect those you love, then we urge you to do so.We should not meet with anyone outside our household bubble and keep contact with people outside our household to an absolute minimum until the current threat has passed, but especially in the run-up to Christmas.We know that staying away from loved ones will be painful for many, especially at this time of year, butwe do this now, we will be doing everything we can to protect our family and friends for the months to come.We know many people think that the vaccine is going to become more widely available, so everything is going to be okay. Regrettably, that is simply not the case. If we donrsquot change our behaviour now,many people will die before the vaccine is rolled out, people who donrsquot need to die, possibly people who you know.The full roll out of the vaccine will take many months, so now is not the time to be complacent. Very few of us are immune and the virus is still prevalent in our communities and our hospitals. By practising social distancing, washing our hands regularly and wearing face coverings we will all be doing our bit to help.So, our message is simple.Wash your hands regularly oryou canrsquot do that use sanitiser hand gel.Please try and stay at home and only go out for essential reasons andit is essential to go out, please do so in quieter periods.If you do go out, wear a mask when required and keep socially distanced by at least  metres, wherever possible.Please do not mix with other households or your friends.Work from home,you can do so.If you develop symptoms such as a new and continuous cough, a temperature, or a loss of taste or smell please self-isolate with your household and arrange a test.These small steps can really help us all to keep our communities safe.As a Health Board and Council, we are fully mobilised in the fight against COVID-. Doing so continues to be a huge challenge and is one that we will best achieve,we do it together, just as we did in the Spring.We are asking every one of you to achieve this challenge together.Letrsquos stop the spread, and letrsquos keep the Vale of Glamorgan, the NHS and our loved ones safe.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Hospitality businesses would have joined them on pm Christmas Day, with a level four lockdown coming into place on Monday, December . The five day lsquorelaxationrsquo period would have still been in place according to these rules, but a change from three households mixing to two.But on Saturday, December , all this changed as prime minister Boris Johnson held a press conference to update the UK on the rapid spread of the new strain of coronavirus and announcing that the South East of England, including London would be moved into tier four.Tier four means residents must stay at home with some limited exemptions ndash which includes workunable to do so from home, however, working from home is strongly advisedit is possible. Non-essential services must also close. People also must not enter or leave a tier four area.This also saw a change to Englandrsquos Christmas restrictions, with households banned from mixing, apart from single households, which would be allowed to form a bubble to avoid isolation.Areas in the lower tiers were still allowed to continue to mix with up to three households ndash however, only on Christmas Day.So, what did this announcement mean for Wales The announcement by the prime minister was focused specically on England, but it was followed by Walesrsquo first minister making an announcement of his own the same evening. He announced that the tier four lockdown would come into place from midnight on Saturday, December , meaning businesses had a matter of hours to come to terms with the news and people rushed out to do some last-minute Christmas shopping before all the non-essential retail closed.Some of the supermarkets across Wales have now taken their lsquonon-essentialrsquo items off sale.The festive period bubble rule has also changed, with a maximum of two households allowed to mix on Christmas Day.MORE NEWS:Mr Drakeford said in a statement on Saturday evening that the pattern of transmission in London and the South East of England, which is linked to the new iant of coronavirus, is ldquoremarkably consistent with the rapid acceleration of transmission in Wales in recent weeks.Also in the statement, the first minister said that latest evidence had suggested the new strain is present throughout Wales and that it needed an ldquoimmediate response.After meeting with the Welsh Governmentrsquos Cabinet on Saturday and taking into consideration advice from senior medical and scientic advisors, he said: ldquoThe situation is incredibly serious.

People of all faiths have been unable to gather as they would wish for their festivals, such as Passover, Easter, Eid and Vaisakhi.

Across the Commonwealth, my family and I have been inspired by stories of people volunteering in their communities, helping those in need.ldquoIn the United Kingdom and around the world, people have risen magnicently to the challenges of the year, and I am so proud and moved by this quiet, indomitable spirit.

Not just from the virus but the isolation our response to it creates.So the Penarth Times will publish, online and in print, a list of support services - public organisations, charities, community groups and local volunteers - who are there to help in whatever way through this dficult time.And we are asking you to play your part by doing three things.First,you know an organisation or group that should be on our list, let us know and well add them so more people can benefit.If you know of a group doing good in your community, tell us so we can share their story and provide hope and inspiration.And, most importantly, think about who the people are in your community who you might be able to help, be it a card through the door or dropping off some shopping. In short, look out for each other.More NewsSecond coronavirus vaccine approved for use in the UKPenarth nativity delights audiences despite lockdown challengesFigures on police use of force and tasers on childrenThe campaign has been welcomed by Vale of Glamorgan Senedd member Jane Hutt said: \"The Penarth Times has continued to serve our community throughout the pandemic and I am pleased to support its Were in it Together campaign.\"Teams of volunteers, including family, friends and neighbours, have directly supported vulnerable members of our local community and I am pleased that the Penarth Times is highlighting these efforts and sharing offers of support.\"You can take share your suggestions or stories by emailing us at penarthtimes@penarthtimes or calling  .You can share ideas on social media too using #InItTogether. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Christmas bubbling will now be reduced to one day only on a date between December  and  to ensure flexibility for those working on Christmas Day to choose an alternative day that suits best. At last nights extraordinary Executive meeting, Ministers discussed the progression of the pandemic and were updated by the Chief Medical Officer and Chief Scientic Advisor on the emergence and rapid spread of a iant strain of the virus. A statement after the meeting readL The safest place for everyone to spend Christmas is in their own home and people are strongly advised to stay at home for Christmas. Those who feel they need to meet with their bubble should keep it as small as possible, as close to home as possible and keep the visit short. Follow public health advice rigorously. Keep your contacts to an absolute minimum keep your distance wear a face covering and wash your hands. The Executive is urging everyone to travel onlyit is absolutely necessary. Travel is not permitted in or out of Tier  areas in England. Restrictions apply in other tier areas. Everyone should comply with all travel restrictions in place for each region and check the guidance at both the point of departure and destination. The Executive also discussed the issue of restricting travel and Ministers agreed to consider this further when they next meet. In relation to schools, Health and Education officials continue to liaise closely to consider how schools can operate as safely as possible. As this is a rapidly evolving situation, the Executive will continue to keep all matters under review, the statement added.  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_eaecfdededbc   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_dffaaededeb   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1608569304946.jpg--swann__follow_the_three_wise_moves_this_christmas.jpg?160856930400","title":"swann follow the three wise moves this christmas ","story":",\"image\":,\"description\":\"HEALTH Minister Robin Swann has urged everyone across Northern Ireland to keep taking the simple steps that prevent the spread of COVID-.\",\"author\":,\"dateCreated\":\"--T::Z\",\"dateModied\":\"--T::Z\",\"datePublished\":\"--T::Z\" cmspos   *** Handle jQuery plugin naming conflict between jQuery UI and Bootstrap *** .widget.bridge@-webkit-viewport @-moz-viewport@-ms-viewport @-o-viewport@viewport - Twitter, Inc.

As Christmas Day approaches, public health advice has been summarised into “Three Wise Moves”. The Minister said: We must remain vigilant about the threat from COVID-. The virus does not take time off. By strictly following public health advice, we can help reduce the risk to ourselves and others. “The emergence of a new strain of the virus has underlined the need to keep up our guard at all times. We underestimate this virus at our peril.” The Three Wise Moves are: Remember the basics. Keep contacts to a minimum. Keep your distance from others, wash your hands, wear a face covering. We’ve heard this advice countless times this year. But it’s just as relevant and just as important as it ever was. This is how we protect ourselves every day. Be risk aware. Particular settings are known to help COVID- spread: crowded places, close-contact settings especially where people have close conversations, confined and enclosed spaces with poor ventilation. Remember over Christmas that social distancing can slip in familiar surroundings and familiar company. Watch out for old habits creeping back in. This cannot be a normal festive season. If in doubt, walk away. If any situation makes you feel uncomfortable or unsafe, remove yourself from it. Put safety first and err on the side of caution. That’s particularly important in the next few days ahead of the lockdown, when shops and hospitality will still be open. Just because we can do something, it doesn’t mean we have to. No set of regulations can cover every part of le or every activity. We all have to do our own risk assessments and make our own decisions on how best to keep each other safe.  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_eaecfdededbc   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_dffaaededeb   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1609333145190.jpg--assembly_recalled_to_discuss_schools_reopening.jpg?160933314500","title":"assembly recalled to discuss schools reopening ","story":"THE Stormont Assembly is set to be recalled to discuss next weeks planned reopening ofschoolsamid concerns over increasing coronaviruscase numbers.
