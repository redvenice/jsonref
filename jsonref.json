If you get the injection, your arm may be sore, too, or you might experience a slight fever or aching muscles for a day or two afterwards. Serious side effects with both the jab and nasal spray are extremely rare.HOW WILL MY CHILD BE VACCINATED AGAINST FLU?Most children will be vaccinated at school, but those who have not started yet, or who are in a high-risk group, can also get it from their GP.I\u0027M PREGNANT – IS IT SAFE TO GET THE COVID AND FLU JABS?Yes – both are safe for pregnant women, and it\u0027s important to have both if eligible. There are more risks for you and your pregnancy if you contract Covid-19 without the vaccine, and the flu vaccine will also help protect your unborn baby.If you catch flu when pregnant, you\u0027re at risk from complications such as bronchitis and it could cause your baby to be born prematurely, have a low birth weight and may even lead to stillbirth.If you are pregnant, you can get a free flu vaccine from your GP, pharmacist or through your maternity service.  ◼ To check your eligibility for the flu vaccine and Covid-19 booster vaccine or to find a service, visit nhs.ukwintervaccinations ■ This article is part of a paid-for partnership with the UK Government"},{"url":null,"title":"Azeem Rafiq quizzed racism allegations Yorkshire","story":" Former England captain Michael Vaughan is named in the independent report into Rafiq\u0027s claims, but has strenuously denied allegations he told four Asian team-mates: \u0027(There\u0027s) too many of your lot, we need to do something about it.\u0027Rafiq, Adil Rashid and Rana Naved-ul-Hasan all say they remember those words, while the fourth player Ajmal Shahzad has said he cannot recall any racism at the club.Asked about Vaughan, Rafiq said: \u0027Michael might not remember it... three of us, Adil, myself and Rana remember it.\u0027He clearly had a snippet of my statement. He used his platform at the Daily Telegraph to tell everyone he hadn\u0027t said these things.

I felt like he was listening, but then they took the stance that they would trust Yorkshire to do the right thing and then as regulators would come in to hold Yorkshire to account.\u0027It was difficult for me to take through the winter. I kept begging the ECB, the PCA, I kept telling them, \u0027They (Yorkshire) are not doing the right thing, this is going to end up in a car crash for everyone\u0027.\u0027No one wanted to do that until that Monday (November 2) when the article broke in Cricinfo, at that point the ECB came in.\u0027On a human point I felt like if someone else had told me they were suicidal and they were ringing you saying, \u0027Please help\u0027 I\u0027d forget my constitution and help a human. Over the winter there were some real dark moments.\u0027I didn\u0027t feel like they did that because they were concerned for me or worried for me, I feel that was done to tick a box in case I killed myself.\u0027Rafiq described the PCA as \u0027incredibly inept\u0027 and added: \u0027An organisation that should have supported me left me on my own.\u0027He said Matthew Hoggard had apologised to him after watching him being interviewed about his experience at Yorkshire.He said: \u0027I took a phone call from Matthew and he just said, \u0027Look, I didn\u0027t realise, I\u0027m really sorry. If some of the comments I made made you feel the way you\u0027ve described it, I just want to apologise\u0027.\u0027You know what, when someone does that, I was like, \u0027Thank you, I really appreciate it\u0027.\u0027Asked to name other instances of racism he had personally heard about outside of Yorkshire, Rafiq said: \u0027I\u0027ve had messages from people who have played at Leicestershire, a guy who played at Middlesex, messages from people who played at Nottinghamshire.

The bill, slimmed down to a $1.85tn price tag from its previous size of more than three trillion, is currently awaiting a vote in the House.  As previously mentioned, House leaders are hoping for it to pass this week and certainly before Thanksgiving and the CBO expects to indicate its estimates for the spending bill by Friday. But even if this happens, there is still expected to be conflict in the Senate over the price and content of the bill. Taking the second point first, Bates said: “We are confident that we are going to obtain 50 votes in the Senate for the Build Back Better Act.” The Democrats intend to pass BBB via the reconciliation process, as it is a budgetary item, meaning they need a simple majority in the senate, not the 60-vote majority normally needed to satisfy the filibuster rule. But with the 100-seat Senate split 50-50 Dems and GOP, Biden can’t afford to have even one Democratic senator vote against Build Back Better, which is why moderates Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, are holding such sway in their opposition to a big price tag and some of the bill’s social spending and climate action elements. Meanwhile, Bates said, essentially, that the CBO’s estimates are not the be all and end all and the Biden administration is supremely satisfied that “this is going to be paid for”. “This will reduce the deficit, that’s the bottom line for us,” he said.Bates just began and we are tuning into the audio-only live stream online and Bates is talking infrastructure and now basketball … we’ll bring you anything meaty. The US president’s long, virtual summit last night with Chinese president Xi Jinping is the first topic that’s come up from reporters. Bates says he has nothing to add to a report this morning in the Washington Post that Biden and his administration plan a diplomatic boycott of the winter Olympics, being held next February in Beijing. “That was not part of their conversation … it was not part of their discussion” last night, Bates says. Tuning into an AF1 gaggle is intriguing! We just heard a loud rattle and Bates, who is still gaggling – this is his first such briefing – had a gaggle giggle and said: “This is the first time I’ve ever landed standing up.” We hear the roar of engines going into reverse thrust, as the Boeing 747 slows after landing, and the party has arrived in New Hampshire and is preparing to alight. Just before Bates talked about the expected House and Senate votes on Build Back Better – catch you in the next post on that.Speier, 71, who has served seven terms as congresswoman for the San Francisco Bay Area, announced her retirement in a video message published to Twitter, saying that while it was an “extraordinary privilege” to serve in public office, she is ready to move on.  “It’s time for me to come home,” Speier said. “Time for me to be more than a weekend wife, mother and friend.” Speier noted that she was motivated to serve in public office after accompanying Representative Leo J. Ryan of California to Guyana in 1978 during an attempt to rescue 900 followers of the cult leader Jim Jones.  The trip ended in massacre, with Ryan and four others killed and Speier herself shot five times.  “I vowed that if I survived, I would dedicate my life to public service. I lived and I served,” said Speier during her retirement announcement.  Speier is one of 14 Democratic representatives who have said they will not seek re-election in 2022. While many have cited reasons such as spending more time with family or allowing others to serve in public office, the growing list of retirees, in addition to the more expected, is a sign of Democrats losing representation in Congress and potentially becoming the minority party.Hoyer noted to reporters that debate on the bill should be happening tomorrow, with a House vote expected on either Friday or Saturday, reports Politico.  “We’re going to get it done this week,” said Hoyer, with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi telling House representatives that the Congress will not go on Thanksgiving break, as Thanksgiving is next Thursday, until the House passes the bill. The Congressional Budget Office released a statement saying that it would provide cost estimates for sections of the “Build Back Better” agenda by Friday. The stalled cost estimates are an upset for moderate Democrats who want the estimates before voting, increasing the chances of a weekend vote. The cost estimates that will be published by Friday include:  If the House passes the bill, the plan will advance to the Senate where it currently faces united Republican opposition and difficulty amid moderate Democrats. “My expectation is that we will vote on this Thursday or Friday,” Hoyer told reporters. More details to follow. Citing multiple sources familiar with the planned boycott, the Post wrote that while the decision has not been finalized, the White House is expected to announce that neither Biden nor any US government official will attend the games, with Biden expected to approve the plan before the end of the month.

Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois, who chairs the committee, called on Garland to dismiss BOP’s director Michael Carvajal who has led the organization during a series of ongoing crises including the unmitigated spread of Covid-19 in prisons as well as dozens of escapes – at least 36 within the last 22 months, deaths and chronic understaffing that has limited critical emergency responses.  AP’s investigation published two days ago also found that over 100 BOP employees had been arrested, convicted or sentenced for crimes since the start of 2019 and that the agency failed to address allegations of misconduct or suspend employees that had been arrested for crimes, including one official at a prison in Mississippi who remained in his position despite being arrested on charges of stalking and harassing fellow employees.  “It is clear that there is much going wrong in our federal prisons, and we urgently need to fix it. That effort must start with new leadership,” said the Senate judiciary committee in a statement posted on Twitter, also calling the BOP a “hotbed of abuse, graft and corruption.” Durbin also noted the need for new leadership in an ongoing attempt by some Democrats to reform America’s criminal justice system. “We have a new Administration and a new opportunity to reform our criminal justice system. It’s clear that there is much going wrong in our federal prisons, and we urgently need to fix it. That effort must start with new leadership,” tweeted Durbin.  Carvajal had been appointed to his position by then-Attorney General William Barr, one of the few holdovers from the Trump administration. Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco also said that she had confidence in Carvajal despite continued issues during his leadership. Read the full report here.

The president will be traveling to Woodstock, New Hampshire, located two hours outside of New Hampshire’s capital, and speaking at the Pemigewasset River Bridge, which is in need of major repairs, according to the WMUR, a local news affiliate.  Biden’s speech will primarily focus on how the newly passed infrastructure bill will benefit rural communities such as Woodstock, as town officials have spent nearly $250,000 across the past decade doing temporary repairs on the bridge.  “I think it’s a great compliment to the Granite State that this is the first stop he’s making after signing the infrastructure bill,” said Democratic state representative Steve Shurtleff, who also said that the money New Hampshire will receive from the bill is very needed.

Photograph: Alan BetsonThe Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly has announced the extension of the Covid-19 booster vaccination programme to include the over-50s, those with underlying medical conditions and those in long-term healthcare facilities.The announcement comes following recommendations made by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to chief medical officer Tony Holohan, who has endorsed the advice.The Niac has recommended that a booster dose of an mRNA vaccine now be offered to those\u0026nbspaged 50- to 59-years-old who have completed their primary course with any Covid-19 vaccine.It has also been recommended for those aged 16-59 who have an underlying medical condition and for residents in long-term healthcare facilities, irrespective of age, many of whom will have an underlying condition.As per previous booster dose recommendations, the additional dose will be given at least five months after completion of the first vaccination schedule.If a person in one of the recommended groups for booster dose is has had Covid-19 after a completed primary vaccine course, the booster dose should be delayed for at least six months after the infection was diagnosed.Mr Donnelly said: “In Ireland, we have already seen that booster doses given to those aged 80 years and older have been followed by a sharp decline in case numbers in that age group. This is very welcome news, and I encourage all of those who are eligible for a booster dose of Covid-19 vaccine to come forward and receive that vaccine as soon as it is available to you.“Niac have strongly recommended that those who have yet to receive their primary vaccination do so as a matter of urgency given the current force of infection in the community.”Closing timesA new closing time of midnight for pubs and restaurants from Thursday has been agreed by Cabinet, with advice on working from home to change from Friday.Cabinet also agreed to change the public health advice for households where a case of Covid-19 is confirmed. Members of the household will now be asked to restrict their movements for five days by staying at home.Previously, vaccinated people with no symptoms in such a situation were not obliged to restrict movements.Sources indicated impacted households will be sent antigen tests.The mood at Cabinet was sombre about the situation facing the country, sources said.Downbeat assessment from the HSE about the issues facing the State’s hospitals forced the Government’s hand, sources said, pointing out the change to nightclub opening hours is the first time the Coalition has moved to curb freedoms without specific advice on a measure from the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet).Sources said the hope was the situation could be reassessed in three weeks. Engagement is planned during the week with the Labour Employer Economic Forum (LEEF) about working from home. The Cabinet meeting concluded this afternoon.On his way into the meeting earlier, Micheál Martin said: “We’ve got to make decisions today but also I think collectively as a society we’ve got to look out for each other and just be very aware that the situation is getting worse, and will get worse before it gets better.”Ministers discussed whether the closing time of pubs should change in an effort to suppress rising Covid cases, less than a month after a curfew was dropped.A previous curfew of 11.30pm was removed at the end of October.There will be a different situation for hotel bars.The Cabinet discussed a number of possible actions in response to the growing fourth wave of the virus.Mr Martin had confirmed that advice from Nphet on working from home and other measures would be considered today.He said there was an obligation on everyone to reduce social interactions to help reduce transmission, adding that the situation demanded “fairly quick action”.“The overall objective is to prevent people getting very sick, going into hospitals, ICUs. We simply have to limit the increase we are experiencing at the moment,” he said.Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly said the latest modelling on hospitalisations and intensive care admissions was “very stark”.“If we did nothing and were to continue as is, we could be looking at somewhere between 200 and maybe up to 500 people in ICU. Obviously, that’s not something we could countenance.”Antigen testsThere was no dedicated memo on antigen testing at Cabinet earlier today, with the issue briefly dealt with in the memo brought by Mr Martin, which briefly outlined that a protocol will be worked out between Mr Donnelly and Minister for Education Norma Foley for their use on close contacts in schools. Similarly, proposals for subsidising the tests were briefly addressed.Other proposals expected to be discussed at the meeting include issuing new advice for people to work from home where possible, and expanded guidance on wearing face masks, as well as extending the requirement for Covid certs to gyms and hairdressers.Earlier, an immunology expert called for faster action from Government in rolling out a booster vaccination campaign.Professor Paul Moynagh called on the Government to “act with speed now” to roll out a widespread booster vaccine programme.The academic said it was confusing why the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) had taken so long to make a decision on booster vaccines, given there had been “real world data” from Israel for some time that the additional shots were safe and effective.Boosters would be “enormously effective” at weakening the link between case numbers and hospitalisations, he told Newstalk Breakfast.Prof Moynagh was also critical that Ireland was “very late to the game” when it came to supporting antigen testing, as the Government considers subsidising the rapid tests.Health servicePaul Reid, head of the Health Service Executive (HSE), told a Monday evening meeting of the Cabinet Covid subcommittee that the health service was now at greater risk than at any time during the pandemic, as it copes with the fresh wave of the virus while trying to continue providing other care.New guidance from Niac is expected to clear the way to provide booster vaccine shots to those in their 50s, and others with underlying health conditions. At present those aged 60-79 are approved to receive booster vaccinations.Liam Woods, HSE director of acute hospitals, also stressed the importance of the vaccine booster campaign, particularly for older age cohorts.The number of confirmed Covid-19 cases since the pandemic began surpassed 500,000 on Monday, after a further 4,570 daily cases were reported.Dr Ina Kelly, president of the Irish Medical Organisation, said hospitals were facing “huge capacity issues” heading into the winter, particularly in intensive care.The HSE’s proposed winter plan was “inadequate” to deal with the pressure the health service would face over the coming months, Dr Kelly told RTÉ Radio One’s Morning Ireland.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"heuston masterplan area to be largely car free with more than 1 000 residential units","story":"The 10-hectare site around Heuston Station is set to be transformed into a ‘largely car-free’ mixed-use development. Photograph: iStockThe 10-hectare site around Heuston Station is set to be transformed into a largely car-free, mixed-use development that will include more than 1,000 residential units, under a plan published on Tuesday.The Heuston masterplan, unveiled by CIÉ, the holding company that sits above Dublin Bus, Irish Rail and Bus Éireann, also features new cycling and pedestrian infrastructure.Commercial, residential, retail and leisure units will also form part of the development under the plan, designed by O’Mahony Pike architects.Two bridges will be constructed across the River Liffey for cyclists and pedestrians, along with 5,000 bicycle parking spaces to encourage more active travel.The Conyngham Road green bridge will provide a new link between the Heuston station train hall and the gates of the Phoenix Park, while the existing railway bridge at the Phoenix Park tunnel is to be extended to also provide a second river crossing for pedestrians and cyclists.This will make the 175-year old train station more accessible, the plan states.The plan, which will proceed in phases, will gradually remove all existing car parking places. Drop-off locations and taxi areas will remain.The ongoing transport operations and planned enhancements will be safeguarded, according to CIÉ.There will also be improved public transport provision through a new station at Heuston West, as previously announced as part of the Dart+ South West proposals.The new station is expected to be located northwest of the greater Heuston Station complex, adjacent to the Liffey railway bridge and the Clancy Quay development.Connectivity between public transport measures is expected to be strengthened through the establishment of the pedestrian and cycling infrastructure.About 1km of river frontage will be opened. The area will also be linked to local amenities such as Phoenix Park and the Irish Museum of Modern Art.The final cost of the project has not yet been determined, but the gross development value is estimated to be in the region of €1 billion.The main development will be funded on a commercial basis through a partnership with a developer while the enabling works are expected to be funded through the CIÉ or potentially other sources such as the National Transport Authority.Asked if the residential units would include affordable housing, CIÉ said it is working with the Land Development Agency in that regard, adding that they “envisage a mix” of housing availability.Heart of DublinThe CIÉ said the plan seeks to ensure that public transport and active travel, such as walking and cycling, are at the heart of a “vibrant, new urban area in Dublin”.CIÉ, working with estate agents Lisney, will seek a developer partner in the first half of 2022 to develop the masterplan proposals further. It intends to submit a planning application for the site in 2023, with construction beginning “as soon as possible” after that.It is expected the development will take up to 15 years to complete.Announcing the proposals, CIÉ group executive Lorcan O’Connor said they will deliver a “largely car-free development”.“We will link those who live, work and travel through Heuston directly to the Phoenix Park through pedestriancycling bridges and open up 1km of river front, enhancing quality of life,” he said.“Additionally, the development itself will support the enhancement and expansion of public transport services proposed under the National Development Plan and beyond.”Minister for Transport Eamon Ryan said well-planned transport-led development is “one of the key components to a thriving city”.“The exciting proposals outlined in the Heuston masterplan clearly have the potential to transform the Western edge of Dublin city,” he said.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"serious consequences for eu uk relations if article 16 triggered %C5%A1efcovic","story":"Maroš Šefcovic told the Seanad committee he hoped negotiators could ‘bring in agreement’ on the supply of medicines into the North before he meets Mr Frost on Friday. Photograph: John ThysPoolEPAEuropean Commission vice-president Maroš Šefcovic has warned of “very serious consequences” for EU-UK relations if London triggers article 16 of the Brexit protocol on Ireland, but welcomed the recent “change in tone” from British negotiator David Frost.Adopting a positive stance on some aspects of the talks at a meeting on Monday with the Seanad committee on Brexit, Mr Šefcovic said he hoped negotiators could “bring in agreement” on medicines issues before he meets again on Friday with Mr Frost.On the supply of medicines into the North, he promised to do “whatever it takes to address this issue” in line with industry requirements. Negotiators were focused “like a laser beam” on the question, he added.“We are here, ready to amend our own rules to solve this problem. Of course I would prefer to have a joint solution with the UK on this issue but we need to move quickly here.”Calling on Britain to reciprocate the EU’s offer last month to change how the protocol operates, he said Brussels needed to know “that there is also good faith from the other side” in the talks.There was no question over the commitments the EU made in the talks, he said. “If we say there is 80 per cent or 50 per cent cuts in respective checks you can be pretty sure we know what we are talking about.”ResolutionAsked by Fine Gael senator Barry Ward whether people could have faith in any resolution that might emerge, he said: “I would characterise my approach as very realistic, if our partners from the UK would engage, and I hope we will see more of it this week, then I’m absolutely sure can solve all these issues.”Responding to Sinn Féin senator Niall Ó Donnghaile, the commission vice-president he said any triggering of article 16 would have “very serious consequences” both for the North and the EU’s relationship with the UK.Article 16 is the last resort clause that allows either side to act unilaterally to address “serious economic, societal or environmental difficulties”. Repeated UK threats to trigger the clause have led to EU warnings of a trade war with Britain as the union could in retaliation suspend the trade and co-operation agreement (TCA) that was struck last Christmas.Mr Šefcovic said the basis for EU engagements with Britain was a sequence of deals starting with the UK withdrawal agreement, followed by the protocol and then the TCA.The EU’s objective in the talks was to establish a positive and stable relationship with Britain, Mr Šefcovic told the committee by video link. But he added: “I have to say that I worry about the rhetoric and action of the UK.”After increasingly sharp signals from London that Boris Johnson’s government might trigger article 16 this week after the Cop26 climate summit, Mr Frost relented a little in recent days by saying the talks process was not at an end and that there was still time to reach agreement.Mr Šefcovic, who met Mr Frost last Friday and will meet him again next Friday, promised to do his utmost to avoid the “dramatic development” of a trade war, adding that such an outcome would only aggravate the situation. “It would be up to us again to pick up the pieces,” he said in response to Fianna Fáil Senator Malcolm Byrne.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"we would be in lockdown without vaccination taoiseach says as he announces new restrictions","story":"“Without the vaccination programme there is no doubt we would now be in a full-scale lockdown,” Taoiseach Micheál Martin has said, adressing the nation on Tuesday evening.The public statement followed\u0026nbspa sombre Cabinet meeting on the situation facing the nation amid rising cases of Covid-19.I know the picture emerging across Europe and numbers in our own country are a cause for deep concern.

Photograph: Christopher FurlongGettyCop26 puts the onus on countries to deliver on climate commitments to ensure the world can keep global temperature rise to within 1.5 degrees – and avoid dangerous warming.For Ireland it provides an added impetus to make immediate progress on its pledges, says Prof Brian Ó Gallachóir of University College Cork. Although there has been much talk of 2030 targets, short-term actions are essential, he says. That means asking: “What are we going to do next year?”In an Irish context, that should mean, for instance, increasing sales of EVs from 15,000 this year to 50,000 next year, and increasing deep retrofits of houses from 4,000 in 2021 to 40,000 in 2022.Having the Climate Act in place, backed by carbon budgets, enables focus on action, says Ó Gallachóir, who is director of the UCC research centre MaREI. Acknowledging “people’s sense of disappointment about the outcome, given the challenge ahead”, he says there were some achievements in Glasgow. Factoring in commitments beyond 2030, the International Energy Agency has concluded “we can get to 1.8 degrees” for starters, he says.The US is back in a leadership role, “which puts it up to all of us to do as much as we can to reduce emissions”, while there is a clear signal in the final text on getting out of fossil fuels, despite a watering down on coal.Incremental changeDCU climate policy specialist Sadhbh O’Neill points out that the Cop format is an iterative, “pledge and review” process that invariably leads to incremental change. Critically, she warns, “that does not get us to 1.5 degrees”.There is a danger “we forget to build on what was agreed in Glasgow”, she says. Emphasis on “near-term actions” means countries will have to upgrade their nationally determined contributions – emissions reduction commitments – with more frequent reviews than every five years, which has been the case up to now. This will also apply to cutting methane.While commitments on coal were weakened, O’Neill says it is clear fossil fuels are about to become toxic assets, so the financial system, including banks, insurers and pension funds, will have to shift away from supporting them.On implications for people in Ireland, she points out that because Cops are part of an international and legal framework, it can take time for actions to translate into national policies. In the meantime, focus needs to be maintained on domestic policy, but Ireland already has the Climate Act in place, legally binding targets and robust governance, she adds. “Essentially, we have the architecture at national level we just need to take action.”Carbon budgetsThe new climate action plan has to tally with carbon budgets, which in turn need to be translated into sectoral ceilings, imposing emission limits on key sectors such as transport and agriculture, she says. Measures in the plan must add up to what’s in carbon budgets, and what we have committed to in Glasgow.All this will not work, she says, unless actions are scaled up well before 2030. This requires wealthy countries doing more because they are most to blame for the climate crisis. It means getting out of fossil fuels entirely by the end of the decade, she notes, otherwise more stringent reductions will be necessary.Minister for Climate Eamon Ryan said at the weekend Ireland’s obligations following Cop26 were “in line with science” and set out in both the programme for government and the Climate Act. This was “a challenge beyond compare”, with the key priorities being cutting emissions by 51 per cent by 2030 and achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.Cop26 would see decarbonisation of all sectors in Ireland accelerate, he predicted. “If you’re in business and you’re not taking climate change seriously, then you won’t be in business in 10 years’ time.”"},{"url":null,"title":"cop26 outcome nowhere near enough say irish campaigners","story":"A protest over climate change in Dublin last week. Irish climate NGOs and overseas aid organisations expressed disappointment about the outcome of the UN summit in Glasgow. Photograph: Damien StoranPAThe outcome of Cop26 falls far short of what is necessary to tackle the climate crisis, but countries who are climate leaders must show the way forward, “and let history judge the laggards”, according to Friends of the Earth Ireland (FoE).Irish climate NGOs and overseas aid organisations expressed disappointment about the outcome of the UN climate summit in Glasgow, though some welcomed gains on climate finance for poorer countries and increased funding for “adaptation” to help make climate-vulnerable states more resilient in face of inevitable impacts from global warming.“Glasgow was a staging post not a finishing line,” said FoE director Oisín Coghlan. He said what was clear now was that formal negotiations through this UN process “may never produce an outcome that reflects the urgency of the science and the imperative of justice. Not when the final text is effectively subject to a veto from any polluting country with a brass neck”.Collective agreement is no longer the limit on global action it once was, Mr Coghlan said. “While some countries are still dragging their heels others are beginning to pick up the pace. Equally, while fossil fuel companies are lobbying for the path of delay and destruction others are grasping the business opportunities of the race to zero.”The global climate movement was growing in strength and ersity, and this would continue in an effort to secure a better response by governments, he said.“We may not yet have succeeded in forging the international agreement we want but increasingly we can hold our national governments to the standards required by the 1.5-degree goal in the Paris agreement.“The two-steps forward, one-step back nature of the annual climate talks is deeply frustrating but we must pocket any modest gains from Glasgow – the first mention of phasing out of fossil fuels and the renewed commitment to adaptation finance for example – and ratchet up our demands for the next time,” he added.“Collectively our governments have not met the moment but our international movement emerges from Glasgow stronger than ever. We return home to push our national governments harder than ever to act in line with science and equity.”Mary Robinson, chair of the Elders group of international figures founded by Nelson Mandela, pushed repeatedly for greater ambition during the two-week long negotiations. She said it had made some progress, “but nowhere near enough to avoid climate disaster. While millions around the world are already in crisis, not enough leaders were in crisis mode. People will see this as a historically shameful dereliction of duty”.Climate activist Dr Lorna Gold, chairwoman of the Laudato Si Movement, said the outcome was a huge disappointment. “The only thing worse than this would have been no outcome. That would have spelt disaster. The outcome shows that the majority of leaders still do not yet fully accept the reality of the situation.”Last-minute watering down of critical language on phasing out coal deepened mistrust and did bode well for the road ahead, she added. “That said, this Cop was not just about the official outcome. Many key initiatives have been signed – including the agreement on methane and Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance, to which Ireland signed up.”On the fringes, however, critical discussions were held on financial realignment, including value-based organisations rapidly shifting financial assets into clean energy and adaptation, she noted. “The awakening of global finance is good news. Cop26 has not been a disaster – but not a success either. Some would call it a ‘compromise’ – a ‘balanced outcome’. Sadly, a rapidly changing climate does not react to such human excuses.”The failure of global leaders to include “loss and damage” financing in the final agreement is “deeply disappointing” and a “missed opportunity” by the powerful nations who have contributed most to climate change, according to Trócaire.The overseas development agency said the deal failed to show solidarity in supporting shattered communities recover and rebuild after climate disasters.Trócaire head of policy and advocacy Siobhán Curran, who attended Cop26, said: “There were huge expectations that Cop26 would be the moment when wealthy countries stepped up and acknowledged they have done most to cause the climate crisis. They have turned their backs on indigenous communities, small-scale farmers, women and girls who desperately need support to recover and rebuild after climate disasters. This is a matter of great injustice.”Ms Curran said although the commitment to “urgently deliver” $100 billion (€87 billion) for climate finance was welcome, it is still a fraction of the amount that will be needed in the face of the climate emergency.Trócaire chief executive Caoimhe de Barra said: “This was an exclusionary Cop. Civil society found it difficult to access the Cop sessions, and many were excluded from the negotiation area.“People from the global South and countries most affected by the climate crisis were under-represented . . . yet they are the most affected communities and their voices needed to be heard.”Simon Murtagh of Oxfam Ireland said: “At every level, Cop26 did not deliver the goals we sought urgent action on. The process couldn’t deliver for small island states facing immediate destruction. Nor could it deliver for two million Kenyans currently left destitute by the effects of climate change, nor for millions more in Yemen, Madagascar or central America, who face hunger and destitution caused by climate change.”"},{"url":null,"title":"story of portugal s three marias a reminder of a darker recent past","story":"Women protest in support of the Three Marias. Photograph: Los Angeles TimesGettyJust beyond St Anthony’s Church in Lisbon, with a little help from the man himself, you’ll find the Museu do Aljube.The former jail for political prisoners of Antonio Salazar’s dictatorship has since 2015 been home to a museum about the resistance to the fascist Estado Novo.The first floor of the building, which once detained “women of ill-repute”, is hosting an exhibition highlighting the role of women in the struggle and in particular the case of “The Three Marias”.In 1971, over the course of nine months, Maria Isabel Barreno, Maria Teresa Horta, and Maria Velho da Costa wrote Novas Cartas Portuguesas. The rather impenetrable collection of unsigned essays, poetry, stories and letters draws on the 17th-century Letters of a Portuguese Nun, obsessed with a French soldier who abandoned her.Reviewing the English translation in 1975 for the New York Times, Jane Kramer wrote that as a feminist work The Three Marias’ book “is in trouble” and she was “bored silly by too many hymns to the womb and the languid, helplessly seduct lye body and too much heavy eroticism turned inward on itself”.But the Portuguese censors ensured it became something of a sensation by destroying and banning it three days after its publication in 1972.The authors were charged with “abuse of the freedom of the press” over its “irremediably pornographic content intended to corrupt public morals”, an offence that could carry a custodial sentence. Salazar’s successor Marcelo Caetano described them as three women “who aren’t worthy of being Portuguese”.The controversy drew international attention and the Marias’ cause was taken up by activists in the US and France among other countries while the book was translated into several languages.The book went against the prevailing political ideology and the “comfort of the great certainties” of the regime Salazar had declared in the 1930s: “we don’t discuss God and virtue we don’t discuss fatherland and its history we don’t discuss authority and its prestige we don’t discuss family and its ethics”.Women’s position as second-class citizens in this environment was underlined by the Portuguese penal code which said a man could murder his adulterous wife and only have to “leave his district” for six months.This “symbolic penalty” was cited by a judge in 2017 when upholding a suspended sentence for two men who attacked a woman with a nail-spiked club.Conservative societyThe primacy of the Catholic Church in shaping Portuguese society echoed how the Irish State was developing in the same period. Many in Ireland expressed admiration for Salazar’s regime with Eamon de Valera praising its “progressive and Christian manner” in the Dáil in 1941.Maintaining the conservative society was the job of Portugal’s secret police, PIDE. The museum, whose new director is Rita Rato, a former MP for the Portuguese Communist Party, is full of testimonials from people who were arrested and interrogated from the 1930s up to the fall of the regime.There are memorials to some of those who were killed, including Raul Alves, who was thrown from the third floor of the PIDE headquarters in 1958. The museum’s exhibit claims that after the wife of the Brazilian ambassador reported Alves’s death, the interior ministry told her: “There is no reason to be so shocked. It is only a communist.”The trial only concluded following the April 25th, 1974 Carnation Revolution which ended the regime (so called as crowds gave the flowers to the soldiers that carried out the coup).On May 7th, they were acquitted and “ordered to go in peace with carnations to the chest”. The judge said: “The book isn’t pornographic or immoral. Quite the opposite it’s a work of art of the highest quality.”Two years later, the new Portuguese constitution enshrined the absolute equality of rights between men and women. And while much may have changed in the decades since, culminating in the liberalisation of abortion laws in 2007, the museum offers a reminder “to ensure that our future is not amputated from our past”.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Attack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"every little helps no 10 hopes nothing stops people getting","story":"“This Christmas, nothing’s stopping us,” Tesco has declared in a new festive advert so political that it could have been commissioned by the Downing Street nudge unit.The commercial, which shows Father Christmas clutching his Covid vaccine passport at UK immigration, was broadcast just 48 hours before the Government extended the booster programme to 40-somethings.Announcing the plan on Monday, Boris Johnson argued that high booster uptake is the key to saving the holiday season, placing Christmas freedoms firmly in the hands – or, more accurately, the arms – of the public. Every little helps, after all.The Government has so far resisted calls to implement “Plan B” Covid measures, relying instead on increased immunity from third jabs to keep cases at manageable levels and avoid another winter wave.At a press conference on Monday, the Prime Minister said: “It’s going well,” but warned: “If we want to avoid restrictions on our daily lives, we must all get vaccinated as soon as we are eligible.”Thankfully, there are encouraging signs that the booster programme is working – at least among the over-50s.Real-world figures released by the UK Health Security Agency on Monday showed that boosters give 93.1 per cent protection against symptomatic infection for Britons who had the AstraZeneca vaccine. Before the booster, protection had slipped to 47 per cent six months after a second jab. It is a similar story among Pfizer jab recipients, with protection rising from 69 per cent to 94 per cent.Data from Israel suggest boosted over-60s are 10 times less likely to suffer a Covid infection than those with just two doses. There was also an 18.7-fold reduction against hospitalisations and a 14.7-fold reduction against mortality.Data from the Office for National Statistics, released last week, showed antibody levels are also rising again in the over-50s after slowly declining since the summer.However, there is one flaw in the Government’s under-50s booster extension plan to save Christmas – the majority will not be eligible for a third jab until after the holidays.The first under-50s received their jabs in mid-April, about four months after the programme started for the oldest and most vulnerable.At the time, ministers recommended an interval of 12 weeks between jabs, which was not changed to eight weeks until July. It means that most will not be eligible until mid-January.It is also unknown whether younger people will see a similar drop in immunity to older people. Research suggests waning antibodies are less of a problem in younger groups, who mount a stronger initial response.Recent data from the UK Health Security Agency showed the AstraZeneca vaccine’s effectiveness against symptomatic infection nearly halves, to 36 per cent, five months after the second jab for the over-65s.In contrast, in 40-year-olds to 64-year-olds, effectiveness remains at 57 per cent at five months, having dropped by just nine per cent.Offering a booster to 40-somethings is also unlikely to have a large impact on deaths and admissions.According to latest figures from  the UK Health Security Agency, the number of double-jabbed 40-year-old to 49-year-olds dying after testing positive for Covid in the last three weeks was just 32 – just 1.5 per cent of the total. They also account for just five per cent of emergency admissions.So the decision to extend the programme may be more political than practical, allowing the Government to be seen to still be making an effort to control the virus even as it draws up plans to dial down its response.Documents leaked last weekend revealed that mandarins are working on Operation Rampdown, which will take Covid off an emergency footing and back into the realms of everyday healthcare.Even Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, the Deputy Chief Medical Officer, signalled that the country is nearing the end of the crisis as he urged people to come forward to be boosted so that Britain can “get on and finish the job”.Modelling also suggests the UK has little to fear from another winter wave. New figures from University College London suggested deaths will remain at an average of 150 a day for the next week before steadily declining towards 25 a day by the new year.The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine correctly forecast that cases would start to fall in November, with Christmas seeing low rates of infection. On Monday, Mr Johnson reaffirmed his belief that there is “nothing in the current data” to trigger Plan B.Prof Chris Whitty, the Chief Medical Officer, confirmed that cases, deaths and admissions are no longer rising and have been “broadly flat” for many weeks.“The number of people in hospital is mercifully a lot lower than in the peak,” he said at Monday’s press conference. “Covid numbers are not going up as you are seeing in continental Europe, and if they were you would have to look again.”However, he warned that the NHS is under “very significant pressure” from winter effects and the catch-up from Covid. Officials are clearly concerned that the health service could face a worse than normal flu season, while struggling to clear the backlog of treatment put off during the height of the pandmeic.If that is the case, preventing even small numbers of Covid patients will be crucial to avoid overwhelming the NHS this Christmas.So, ‘tis the season to be boosted. It might just keep you out of hospital – and off Boris’s naughty list.More from News\u0026#39It was now or never\u0026#39: Child from Turpin \u0026#39house of horror\u0026#39 reveals how she escaped and freed 12 siblingsThe people are fleeing Paris, a city ruined by the French LeftThousands complain about Tesco advert featuring Santa with a Covid vaccine passportRolling blackouts threaten Europe this winterInside Austria\u0026#39s \u0026#39apartheid lockdown\u0026#39: huge queues to get jabbed as unvaccinated sneak around ViennaMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"church groups must learn accept christian asylum seekers may","story":"There aren’t that many worthwhile hot takes on the supposed motives of the Liverpool bomber, following the news that he was, reportedly, a Christian convert rather than a radical Islamist, as was originally assumed. Christians, after all, are more renowned for their bake sales and the ferocity of their whist drives than for their eagerness to commit mass murder.It would be fruitless and unhelpful at this stage to speculate about the motivations of this spectacularly inept terrorist. Nevertheless, without seeking to cast uninformed aspersions on the sincerity or otherwise of his alleged religious conversion, it’s worth pointing out that for decades, optimistic asylum seekers have cited their newfound faith as a reason not to remove them to their intolerant home countries.As a newly-elected MP after 2001, I and other newbies were briefed by Home Office officials and ministers about the various tactics that people traffickers recommended to their “clients” during the long, arduous journey from the Middle East to Britain. The first step was destroying any identifying documents: after all, an asylum seeker claiming to be from war-torn Afghanistan rather than from Egypt or Iran would stand a better chance of a filing a successful application for refugee status.Those who had already filed an unsuccessful application and been removed to their home countries would, in extremis, volunteer to have their fingerprints burnt off in order to foil Home Office processes for identifying them. But a crucial piece of advice offered to many claimants by their traffickers was to get involved in a local church as soon as they made their initial asylum claim and were allocated their temporary accommodation. A full-on conversion to Christianity was even better, though not always necessary British people who attend church were, it was assumed, much more likely to take up the cases of asylum seekers and advocate on behalf of those who made the effort to attend services along with their families.Time and again I was invited by church leaders and members to explain and defend government policy on asylum. Such meetings were often fraught: incredulous people would get angry at my refusal to accede to their view that personal testimonies were always 100 per cent accurate. Repeatedly I pointed out that there were iniduals whose testimonies about their backgrounds and origins could not always be taken at face value. The reaction was almost always hostile: who would believe a politician over someone who volunteers to serve the tea after Sunday evening service?MPs and government ministers who insisted on the existence of asylum seekers who misrepresented their circumstances back home (unhelpfully labelled by the tabloid press as “bogus”) were disparaged. Many MPs, in an attempt to curry favour with their constituents, would adopt the same trusting approach and claim that whatever an asylum seeker told them must be true, and that Home Office decisions to deny refugee status must, therefore, be unjust.In truth, it was virtually impossible to deny the fact that if an applicant claimed to have converted from Islam to Christianity following his arrival in Britain, it would be the equivalent of a death sentence to remove them back to their home countries where the Islamic authorities dealt mercilessly with apostates. Such is the dilemma of those who insist that the asylum process must be rigorous and robust and should not be used by economic migrants as a means of bypassing the formal immigration system. Such people are unpopular with those whose perfectly natural and well-intentioned motives make them want to help those less fortunate than themselves but who, as a result of those same good intentions, are resistant to the more practical and legal obstacles to their charity.It’s impossible to judge whether conversion experiences are genuine – a fact upon which the people traffickers and their unfortunate and exploited customers rely. But it would be a courageous inidual who decided that no one would seek to pull the wool over the eyes of the British authorities and try to secure permanent residency here by claiming something they did not genuinely believe.Rather than see churches and their members as pliant dupes willing to believe any sob story told them by new arrivals in the country, we should celebrate the fact that we still have groups of people willing to give up their time to advocate on behalf of others by virtue of their own commitment to biblical principles. Such people bring a necessary degree of compassion and concern that would otherwise be missing. The corollary of those qualities, however, is a necessary cynicism by the authorities: respecting the right of Christians to represent the cases of members of their flock does not mean every demand for a positive asylum decision should be met. The churches have their role and it must be respected. Government has a role too: it would be good if churches returned that respect and accepted the right of the state to decide who should stay and who should remain.More from NewsThe people are fleeing Paris, a city ruined by the French LeftThousands complain about Tesco advert featuring Santa with a Covid vaccine passportRolling blackouts threaten Europe this winterInside Austria\u0026#39s \u0026#39apartheid lockdown\u0026#39: huge queues to get jabbed as unvaccinated sneak around ViennaMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"obsessed net zero arent nearly enough adapt climate change","story":"Cop26 was not a complete failure, but it has repeated a pattern of the past 30 years. Many countries’ politicians make warm noises about climate change at international shindigs, and as countries get richer they naturally tend to take more care of the environment, but when it comes to doing as much as might be required to actually prevent the Earth from warming, only the Western Europeans, amongst the major countries, do even close to enough.Market and taste-driven technological changes are delivering more in the way of carbon abatement than many of the gloomier climate predictions of the past expected, and there are some game-changing further possibilities coming over the horizon, such as driverless cars (hugely increasing the energy efficiency of independent travel) and lab-grown meat (freeing up vast acreages of grazing lands for reforestation). But the reality is that, for all the warm words of politicians, there simply isn’t the will, at the global level, to do enough to prevent the Earth from warming materially more than the target of “1.5 degrees centigrade”, relative to the pre-industrial era, set by Western leaders. Let us be clear what that 1.5 degrees target really means. The Earth is already 1.19 degrees centigrade warmer than the pre-industrial temperature, and warming at around 0.18 degrees per decade. So sticking to a 1.5 degrees rise would mean very little material change from the temperature we are at now.It was said at the Cop summit that to achieve that target there would need to be commitments to phase out coal. “Phase out” is something of a misnomer here, as it might give the impression that coal use is currently at a low level, internationally, and it is just a matter of winding down the residual. Nothing could be further from the truth. Coal use has plateaued for over a decade at a very high level and Chinese use in 2021 will be at an all-time high. Coal use in advanced economies has fallen (though not by nearly as much as it might have done had green activists not impeded a fuller-blooded transition to nuclear power). But that has not come close to offsetting rises in China and the rest of the world. The debacle over the change in the wording of the Cop commitment from “phasing out” coal to merely “phasing down” illustrates the perennial problem with these climate conferences, and with climate action more generally, that international coordination on the scale that would be required to prevent climate change has not proven feasible. Grand speeches are made. The UK exceeds its promises. The EU does a lot. The US administration enters into undertakings it knows Congress will never accept, purely for the purposes of bashing its political opponents at home. And the politicians of other countries either refuse to take part or cynically smile and nod knowing that once they go home nothing of substance will happen.Don’t get me wrong, here. I don’t particularly regret this myself. Virtually every serious economic analysis ever done on global warming policy demonstrates that adapting to climate change is a vastly superior approach to attempting to prevent it. But the point I want to emphasize is that it doesn’t matter whether you agree with me or not. The reality is that climate change mitigation efforts are not going to come close to being sufficient to prevent the climate from changing.Some countries accept that the climate will change and have fairly clear strategies in response. China’s strategy is to grow as rapidly as possible so that when serious climate change comes (which it will) China will be richer, and richer countries and households will be more resilient to climate change and more able to adapt.In the UK we need to ponder how we respond to that reality. Our strategy appears to be to assume that other countries will eventually embrace mitigation, at a “net zero” type level or something close, and when they do so Britain will be seen as a thought leader and also have a head-start as an incubator of the relevant technologies and methods. This would not be an obviously daft strategy (setting aside the general objection to mitigation efforts I mentioned above) if the world were indeed going eventually to go green. But at present that seems very unlikely. And a strategy of “mitigation in one country” risks leaving us poorer without any material benefit in terms of reducing global climate change. If we are poorer than we might otherwise have been, we shall be less able to adapt.Significant climate change is coming, whether you like it or not and whether preventing it is still possible or not. There simply isn’t the global consensus that would be required to act enough to prevent it. When that change comes, it will mean we need to devote considerable resources to adapting to the new world we will find ourselves in. This adaptation should include practical solutions, such as upgraded flood defences, which, unfortunately for the politicians, isn’t as shiny as some of the more far-fledged climate technologies that we are told to look forward to. Now is the time to ask whether the resources we are currently devoting to an increasingly obviously futile attempt to prevent climate change would be better re-purposed to helping us to adapt when it happens.More from News\u0026#39It was now or never\u0026#39: Child from Turpin \u0026#39house of horror\u0026#39 reveals how she escaped and freed 12 siblingsThe people are fleeing Paris, a city ruined by the French LeftThousands complain about Tesco advert featuring Santa with a Covid vaccine passportRolling blackouts threaten Europe this winterInside Austria\u0026#39s \u0026#39apartheid lockdown\u0026#39: huge queues to get jabbed as unvaccinated sneak around ViennaMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"thousands complain tesco advert featuring santa covid vaccine","story":"Tesco\u0027s TV advertising campaign featuring Father Christmas bearing a Covid vaccine passport has prompted more than 3,000 complaints – making it by far the most complained about ad of the year.The ad, entitled This Christmas, Nothing\u0027s Stopping Us, shows the supermarket\u0027s customers determined to enjoy Christmas with family and friends after last year\u0027s Covid restrictions.However, in one scene a reporter appears on TV with breaking news that Santa could be quarantined.Father Christmas is then shown presenting his Covid pass at border control, proving he has been vaccinated to a customs officer so he can enter the country without restriction.The scene from the full 90-second ad sparked fierce debate on social media when it launched on Saturday night.Television presenter and nutritionist Gillian McKeith tweeted: £tesco has a new Christmas advert that celebrates £discrimination \u0026amp £segregation via a fully jabbed Santa who shows his medical status!Who in their right mind in management thought this was a good idea?

Holidaymakers can use the pass to prove they are fully vaccinated, allowing them to avoid quarantine rules in most countries. But the Government has been hinting that people will soon need to prove theyaposve had a booster to be considered fully jabbed. Mr Johnson was asked about the idea at a Downing Street press conference about the expansion of the booster rollout. He said: I think that we will be making plans to add the booster to the NHS Covid travel pass.But again, I think what the general lesson is,anybody wants to travel, you can see that getting fully vaccinated with a booster is going to be something that will - on the whole - make your le easier in all kinds of ways including for foreign travel. So I would just say, you know,youaposre thinking about that, then this is yet another reason to get it done. Mr Johnson was later pressed on whether the concept of being fully vaccinated would need to be changed to include boosters. The PM told journalists: On boosters, itaposs very clear that getting three jabs - getting your booster - will become an important fact and it will make le easier for you in all sorts of ways, and we will have to adjust our concept of what constitutes a full vaccination to take account of that. And I think that is increasingly obvious. The booster massively increases your protection - it takes it right back up to over %. As we can see from whataposs happening, the two jabs sadly do start to wane, so weaposve got to be responsible and weaposve got to reflect that fact in the way we measure what constitutes full vaccination. It comes after the UKaposs vaccine experts announced an expansion to the booster programme to extend the rollout to the over-s. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation issued a new recommendation for  to -year-olds to get a third dose, alongside a decision to offer a second dose of the Pfizer vaccine to  and -year-olds. Mr Johnson warned that a surge in Covid cases in Europe could derail Christmas unless people get their booster jabs. While he said there was nothing in the data to suggest the country needed to move to Plan B of Covid measures, he warned that action could still be taken. Askedhe could rule out a Christmas lockdown, he said: Clearly we cannot rule anything out and the most important thing people can do to prevent further NPIs from being taken is to - non-pharmaceutical interventions that is, further restrictions - get the boosters.

The Prime Minister urged Brits to get their booster vaccine to avoid new restrictions, with all over-s and vulnerable people now able to get a third dose six months after their second one. Today he told his Cabinet that while boosters will be the main defence, “we are still not out of the woods and we cannot be complacent”. Yet despite an R rate of . to ., cases ‘running hot’ and deaths at more than , a week, he has not actually triggered England’s ‘Plan B’ - which stops well short of a lockdown. So what’s going on  Here are the main questions answered. Why is Boris Johnson worried  Boris Johnson says there is a new threat as cases are spiking in European countries including Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany. Describing it as a “blizzard”, he said: “We don’t yet know the extent to which this new wave will sweep up on our shores but history shows that we cannot afford to be complacent.” Perhaps, though, the Prime Minister needs to be more concerned about the situation closer to home. UK cases have been at a high level for months and are rising again after a long fall, up .% week-on-week. There are more than , deaths a week within  days of a positive test. Scientists who spoke to the Mirror suggested domestic policy - which has pretty much no Covid restrictions in England - would be far more to blame for a rise than surges in the virus abroad. It could be that waning immunity and colder weather, forcing people to huddle indoors, are helping the virus spread.  Will there be a lockdown for Christmas   A few weeks ago Boris Johnson was asked this, and replied: “I see no evidence whatever to think that any kind of lockdown is on the cards.” But asked a similar question last night, he told a No press conference: “Clearly we cannot rule anything out. “And the most important thing people can do to prevent further NPIs from being taken is to - non-pharmaceutical interventions that is, further restrictions - get the boosters. So yes, there could be a Christmas lockdown, it’s possible. But at the same time, Mr Johnson hasn’t even triggered his Plan B, let alone full lockdown. It seems likely his warnings are at least partly designed to push people into getting their booster. What is England’s Covid ‘Plan B’  A -page plan spells out a ‘Plan B’ for Englandthe virus surges. It includes bringing back the legal requirement to wear face coverings in some settings. Which settings would only be decided at the time but they’d likely include public transport, shops and supermarkets. Separately, schools have a “contingency framework” forthe virus surges locally. That includes compulsory masks in secondary classrooms. Plan B also involves forcing punters to show they’ve been fully-vaccinated using the NHS Covid pass - before entering all nightclubs, and other venues open after am with alcohol, music, and dancing. It’d also include indoor, crowded settings with  or more people outdoor, crowded settings with , or more people and any settings with , or more attendees, like Premier League football and stadium gigs. Lastly, Plan B would also see the government “consider asking people to work from homethey can, for a limited period”. And ministers will “communicate clearly and urgently to the public that the level of risk has increased, and with it the need to behave more cautiously” - which arguably is already happening.  How is Plan B dferent from a lockdown  Plan B stops far, far short of the lockdown rules that last afflicted England in early .Those included forcing people by law to stay at home apart from for a limited number of reasons, such as going out for exercise or medical appointments. Shielding resumed, pubs and restaurants shut, takeaway pints were banned, schools were shut for months, and meetings between people from dferent households or bubbles were outlawed.Millions of workers were put on furlough, with the government paying up to % of their wages at a cost of billions of pounds per week. All these measures remain so far in reserve that the government dare not even speak their name - they do not feature in the Plan B document. When could Plan B happen  We cannot say “when” Plan B would happen exactly, and many experts have called for it to be triggered already.But we can say what the criteria for triggering it are. Key questions for triggering Plan B include:Is the NHS in danger of being overwhelmed  This crucially isn’t just about cases - hospitalisations and deaths are more important. Key metrics include “hospital occupancy for COVID- and non-COVID- patients, intensive care unitcapacity, admissions in vaccinated iniduals, and the rate of growth of admissions. The link between hospitalisation and infections: The winter plan says the Government is monitoring the ratio of cases to hospitalisations and also the proportion of admissions due to infections among other factors. It also states ministers are keeping an eye on how many people over -years-old are catching Covid- or ending up in hospital. Vaccine efficacy and immunity: A major booster campaign for the over-s is under way but was not as quick as ministers hoped. Crucial will be whether immunity across the population is waning, or whether it’s being kept strong by the booster programme. The impact of new iants: In recent months the threat of a new, more deadly or more infectious iant appears to have faded. But that doesn’t mean it won’t emerge in future months, and the government now has a sequencing infrastructure that will attempt to spot them as they appear.Why hasn’t Boris Johnson triggered Plan B yet  The Prime Minister has effectively made a political choice that, because the rate of new cases isn’t soaring the NHS isn’t yet “overwhelmed”, , deaths a week are a price worth paying for a le without Plan B restrictions. He said this week: “We donapost see anything in the data at the moment to suggest that we need to go to Plan B. Weaposre sticking with Plan A.” Organisations including doctors’ and NHS groups have argued the health service is, in fact, close to breaking point due to the backlog of elective care. Critics argue the Prime Minister should have drawn the line in a dferent place and triggered Plan B at an earlier stage. What’s happening with booster vaccines  Booster jabs will be rolled out to people under . People aged  to -years-old are to be offered another dose of the vaccine to boost their immunity and limit transmission of the virus. Over-s and vulnerable groups could already get a booster, six months or more after their second dose. A booking can be got in the diary after a five month gap. While healthy under-s are not being offered a booster for now, the JCVI watchdog will make a decision on this when more data is available. The vaccine experts also announced new advice for  to -year-olds, who will now be told to get a second dose  weeks after their first. Will I have to get a booster for foreign travel  Quite possibly, yes. Holidaymakers can use the NHS Covid pass to prove they are fully vaccinated, allowing them to avoid quarantine rules in most countries. But the Government has been hinting that people will soon need to prove theyaposve had a booster - a third dose - to be considered fully jabbed. Boris Johnson said: I think that we will be making plans to add the booster to the NHS Covid travel pass. But again, I think what the general lesson is,anybody wants to travel, you can see that getting fully vaccinated with a booster is going to be something that will - on the whole - make your le easier in all kinds of ways including for foreign travel. So I would just say, you know,youaposre thinking about that, then this is yet another reason to get it done. The PM added: On boosters, itaposs very clear that getting three jabs - getting your booster - will become an important fact and it will make le easier for you in all sorts of ways, and we will have to adjust our concept of what constitutes a full vaccination to take account of that.

Image: PAByMikey SmithWhitehall Correspondent:,  Nov Updated:,  Nov | commentsMichael Gove referred a personal friend and donor to the Governmentaposs aposVIP laneapos for lucrative Covid- contracts, it has been revealed. It came as a leaked list showed dozens of firms were given contracts worth a total of £. billion after being referred by Tory figures. The list shows that former health secretary Matt Hancock referred four companies to the scheme. And former Tory chair Lord Feldman was listed as having referred three firms who went on to get contracts worth tens of millions of pounds. Meller Designs was handed a total of £ million worth of PPE contracts at the height of the pandemic.The firm was, until January this year, co-owned by David Miller, who helped to run Mr Goveaposs failed Tory leadership campaign in , has personally donated £, to Mr Gove and a total of £, to the Conservative Party.Mr Gove had previously appointed Mr Meller as a Non-executive Director at the Department for Education, while he was Education Secretary.  In April it was revealed Mr Meller had personally contacted Health Minister Lord Bethell by phone, urging him to speed up the award of a £ million contract for face masks.Mr Gove also proposed a second company, the China National Instruments Import and Export Group Corporation, which won a contract to supply PPE - including , goggles which the NHS could not use before their expiry date. The list published by the Politico website detailed  firms which were given Government contracts to supply personal protective equipment during the height of the coronavirus -gtcoronavirus pandemic, after they were referred by MPs, ministers, peers and Government officials and deemed more credible than other leads.MPs Julian Lewis, Andrew Percy, Steve Brine and Esther McVey also passed on details, as did peers Lord Agnew, Lord Feldman, Baroness Mone and Lord Deighton.The Prime Ministeraposs former chief aide Dominic Cummings was also listed as a referrer, although he said this was an admin error.  There is no suggestion that those who referred companies had any say in whether they were eventually handed contracts, but the National Audit Officepreviously said those who went through the high-priority route were  times more likely to be successful.Deputy Labour leader Angela Rayner said:Michael Gove stood up in Parliament and said that all contracts were awarded through the same process. He must have known that wasn’t true when he said it because he had already helped his mate gets tens of millions of pounds of taxpayers’ money.“It is time this corrupt government published the full details of every PPE and testing contract awarded to companies with links to the Conservative Party, Conservative Ministers and Conservative MPs so we can get to the bottom of the lobbying, dodgy deals and special favours that have been done using taxpayers’ money like a get-rich-quick scheme for Conservative donors and mates. Jo Maugham, Director of Good Law Project said: “The question every journalist should be asking Michael Gove now is: why did he or his office fast-track a firm run by a major Tory donor, who also donated to his Tory leadership bid, for a lucrative £m Covid contract  This on the face of it looks like really ugly stuff” Asked about the firm today, the Prime Ministeraposs official spokesman said: I think on all these cases that were brought forward, they underwent the same level of scrutiny as they did through other procurement routes. That high-priority list meant procurement officials could assess offers more quickly from sources such as large companies with established contacts and those more capable of supplying the protective equipment for NHS workers at speed. It went through the same level of due diligence as other routes did.  A Government spokesperson added: At the height of the pandemic there was a desperate need for PPE to protect health and social care staff and the Government rightly took swt and decisive action to secure it. Ministers were not involved in awarding contracts. The NAO previously criticised a lack of transparency about the way emergency procedures were used to secure supplies and services in early . The NAO said it was understandable that unusual procedures were followed in a time of crisis but its report identied failures to properly document where referrals to the fast-track lane had come from, and criticised the Government for not publishing details of all contracts in a timely manner. The Public Accounts Committee of MPs previously said the Cabinet Office had confirmed that £. billion of contracts were handed out through the VIP lane.

It’s bad enough during normal times. But in a pandemic it’s downright dangerous.Do you agree  Have your say in the comment section  Now the seeds they have sown are bearing fruit. Last year every hospital had , people in a mental health crisis brought to AE by ambulance. That’s a % jump since . The system couldn’t cope anyway. Now it’s breaking. Ambulances are backing up outside hospitals, waiting lists are at all-time highs, paramedics and police are struggling to cope. The solutions are clear: proper funding for health services and proper provision for mental health, a revolution in social care, better pay and conditions for our health service staff. It’s a lot, but this Government has a knack of finding money when it needs to. This isn’t for a trip to the Cayman Islands though. This is big money to save our NHS, end the mental health crisis and enable our health service do what it does best: caring for people and saving lives. Meghan court out The beauty of the justice system is that it is blind. Rich or poor, those before the courts are judged on the facts of their case and nothing more. Even Meghan Markle is finding this out now. She “forgot” certain vital information during a hearing. What’s frightening for her is that others might now remember things that were forgotten. No-one wishes her ill. She has had a tough time of it in the past couple of years. But the courts are based on a system that applies to everyone. Even a Duchess.

Mr Johnson said no, no, no, no and waved his hand when approached by a reporter, and said he has “no recollection of Caroline Nokes at all”. The Mirror has attempted to contact him for comment.  Ms Nokes was a candidate for Romsey and Southampton North which she went on to win at the  election and has held the seat since.Waiving her right to anonymity, Nokes alleged during a  discussion on Sky News: “I can remember a really prominent man, at the time the Conservative candidate for Teignbridge in Devon, smacking me on the backside about as hard as he could and going ‘oh Romsey, you’ve got a lovely seat’.”Ms Nokes continued: “I would have been in my early s so old enough, old enough to call it out.” She told the programme I didn’t do anything, and I feel ashamed by that. The other MPs told her “you shouldn’t feel ashamed” and “you were just shocked in the moment”.  She said now it is an “absolute duty” to call it out as women shouldn’t have to put up with it, adding that it is necessary to be the “noisy, aggravating, aggressive woman in the room” becausea stand is not made then her daughter will be in the same position. Stanley Johnson told Sky News that he didn’t remember Ms Nokes at all. He said: ”I have no recollection of Caroline Nokes at all but there you go. And no reply… Hey ho, good luck and thanks.”  Ms Nokes spoke out about her alleged experience during a cross-party  discussion about confronting violence against women following the murder of Sarah Everard. Also participating in the discussion were Tory MP Fay Jones and Labour MPs Jess Phillips and Rosena Allin-Khan. Ms Nokes said she was also groped by a group of men when she was aged , and Ms Phillips said: I canapost remember the amount of times Iaposve been sexually assaulted in my le in one way or another. They shared their experiences, with Ms Nokes adding: “I’ve had male MPs stick their hands on my backside in Stranger’s Bar”. The four MPs feel that public sexual harassment should be made a specic crimes in future legislation. Tory Security Minister Damian Hinds refused to comment on the allegation, telling Sky News: “I just don’t know the details of the allegation we’re talking about, we’ve just been hearing about.” He added: “I’m not in a position to be able to comment but we do take [these issues] extremely seriously.” Shadow Home Secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds urged the Tories to launch an investigation. He told Times Radio: The Conservative Party clearly needs to investigate a serious allegation like that, that happened at their party conference. Caroline Nokes is a very senior member of parliament. Sheaposs the chair of the Women and Equalities committee. But whether it is a very senior member of parliament, whether it is anybody who attended that party conference, whoever the victim is, it is for us to listen to the victim, to treat their allegation extremely seriously and sensitively. This is an allegation being made about a specic incident at the Conservative Party conference and I would expect the Conservative Party to investigate it.Most ReadFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Conservative PartyStanley JohnsonPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Janice Burnett, , who claims sheaposs a Harry Potter addict, now has so much stuff she needs a specic room for the collection. After realising her Harry Potter trinkets were taking over the house, she had an idea for the mass of items - she would turn the attic into the Gryffindor Common Room, the Warringtonreports.

Janice says this month marks a special milestone in the Harry Potter calendar, as itaposs  years since the film of Harry Potter and the Philosopheraposs Stone was released. She recalls first falling in love with the magical world of Harry Potter when she watched one of the films at her friendaposs house. Janice said: I’d never seen it or bothered with it and I noticed there was a creature and I said who is that and she said it is Dobby. From then on, she admits she was addicted. Soon after her first glimpse of one of the films, her son and daughter-in-law invited her to watch another flick from the series at their house.

The couple have  children and seven grandchildren and have been carrying out an epic transformation of their home since the beginning of this year. In a vlog posted on November , Sue said she had her eye on a Christmas tree at Ambleside Garden Centre for “a little while” so was keen to “see what itaposs like” before purchasing it for the festive season, LancashireLive reports. She said: “I’m hoping it gets me in the Christmas mood because I’m not really feeling it at the minute. “I think itaposs probably because maybe itaposs a bit early.” She then explained to both the viewers and son, Archie, that she wants to buy a new Christmas tree for the living room and the old tree can go into the dining room.  The family live in a -bed former care home in Morecambe which has been newly renovated. Sue took viewers around the garden centre and pointed out a range of Christmas decorations, including owls that can sit on the Christmas tree and some giant toadstools. She bagged a couple of toadstool baubles for £. as well as some red flowers to sit on the tree.  Revealing their Christmas decoration plans for the newly renovated house, she said: “I think this year it’s going to be pink in the dining room, because obviously I’ve got pink chairs, and then red in my living room, so I’m going to do that, it’ll look good.” She also picked up some pink baubles for the dining room tree and took viewers along on the shop with her.  After making their way around the garden centre, Sue said they were going to pick the rest of the children up from school as they had “filming” that evening. Sue and Noel bought their Victorian home - a former care home - for £, back in  - and the size of their family has grown considerably since then. There are currently  of their kids living at home as eldest children Chris, , and Sophie  have now moved out, although they are always round for visits.  Living at home is Chloe, , Jack, , Daniel, , Luke, , Millie, , Katie, , James, , Ellie, , Aimee, , Josh, , Max, , Tillie, , Oscar, nine, Casper, eight, Hallie, five, Phoebe, four, Archie, three, Bonnie, two, and baby Heidie. Their th child Alfie was stillborn in . The couple famously rely on their own bakery business and do not claim any benefits apart from Child Benefit.  When askedthe family were rich during a QA on their YouTube channel, Sue said: Absolutely not, weaposre definitely not secret millionaires. To me rich would be having the big mansion, the flash cars and quite a few hundred thousand in the bank, to me that would be rich but we are not that. They get some money through brand partnerships on social media, but their main source of income comes from The Radford Pie company, located near their family home, which serves fresh, healthy pies to customers across the UK. Their Channel  reality series ‘ Kids And Counting’ first aired in  as ‘ Kids And Counting’ and the family are set tofor a new -part-series soon.

It is selling stones from its very own walls for prices ranging from £ to £ to pay for repairs and “ambitious expansion”. The Cathedral featured in the first two Harry Potter movies, Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone and the Chamber of Secrets. In the second movie, a scene featuring Moaning Myrtle, a ghost, and a flooded girls’ bathroom was filmed at the Cathedral as well as another with a warning written in blood. Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletterScenes filmed for the first movie were largely cut but included the poltergeist Peeves, played by Rick Mayall. In some cases, the stones on sale are up to five hundred years old and their auction will take place on November . Demand is so high that eight out of ten stones have already exceeded their original bidding price. They would not be the first cathedral to do such auctions. Sonia Bielaszewska, philanthropy manager for the cathedral, said: Obviously, COVID- has hit so many charities and Cathedrals particularly hard. Weaposve fortunately been able to raise a signicant amount of money to get us through that period, but we have really ambitious plans for the next ten years for the Cathedral so weaposve decided to be more innovative with our fundraising. Weaposre really fortunate to have a supportive community and congregation who feel a part of the cathedral. So we thought what a better way to connect them more physically to a building which they cherish so much by offering the opportunity to take a piece home.” The cathedral ran a trial auction that went really well, encouraging them to push on with the real thing. The stones on offer range from paperweights to gargoyles weighing  kilograms. Sonia said: Weaposve recently finished renovations, with new gargoyles going up which was a really big project weaposve managed to finish last year. Due to renovations weaposve built up a backlog of several stones, some of them dating back five hundred years. As a cathedral, we typically keep some stones in the crypt for archive reasons and some for historical records. So we found ourselves in a position to essentially have an excess of stones that we needed to find a new home for. Bids have already come in from across the country with shipping already being planned to get stones to South Wales, Cornwall, and Sussex.  Some stones have been more popular than others, with lot , a slender cross marked mortar grip from the s, receiving the most interest by far. Weaposve received some really nice messages accompanying the bids from social media and emails. Weaposve had a lovely mix of the local community, and historical buffs as always. Weaposve also had a lot of people who have found faith quite recently, and want this to be a representation of their new journey through religion. Initial bids that have been coming through have far exceeded our expectations. We have a really well-maintained pinnacle dating back to the aposs which is decoratively beautul which one of the bidders wants to display at the front of their house.

But there are plenty of things you can do at home to cut your own emissions, writes Dr Nina SkorupskaHaving a smart meter to monitor your energy use at home can show you how to make small changes to avoid wastage Image: Getty Images iStockphotoopinionByDr Nina Skorupska:,  Nov | comments The United Nations Climate Change Conferencein Glasgow sought stronger international agreement on actions to cut emissions, reducing fossil fuel usage and increasing the pace of rollout for household renewables.Weaposve heard a lot about what nations must do to help tackle climate change. It can feel like a huge undertaking, where the power for change is in the hands of leaders and not ordinary people.But there are ways we can all help reduce our home and personal carbon footprint, as part of the effort to tackle climate change. Technologies like solar , renewable heating systems and electric vehicles are not only changing how we use and think about energy, they will enable us to reduce energy costs and allow inidual households to play a role in helping to decarbonise the UK electricity network.In order to do this to its greatest potential, we will need to upgrade our energy system. The integration of smart meters will help maximise the benefits of renewable energy systems and help us be more intelligent about how the UK generates low carbon energy to meet growing demand.  Having a smart meter installed in my own home was an easy decision. The in-home display, which comes with the smart meter, shows my energy use in near-real time in pounds and pence, encouraging me to make small changes to avoid wastage – helping to reduce my personal carbon footprint and save money. However, this is not just about saving inidual households energy and money. In the future, an upgraded energy system will help to balance demand on the electricity grid. For example, we might see the option of pausing electricity usage in appliances that aren’t being used or the batteries of electric cars being used to power home electrical appliances in the evening, when electricity is in high demand, before fully recharging on cheap electricity overnight.  While you might think that a single home has a limited impact, once combined with other households the positive impact quickly adds up. A smarter system means real-time usage data, and that means demand can be more easily managed, more renewables can be used in the system and a more cost-effective system for iniduals and the nation. There are many other steps that need to be taken to keep global temperature rises below . degrees, but a smarter energy system must be an integral part of it. The good news is, getting a smart meter installed is a step that pretty much everyone can do from the comfort of their own sofa, at no extra cost, and also something an inidual can do that will actually make a big dference. Put simply: the UK just will not achieve its net zero target without them. Ten tips to help tackle climate change in your home In addition to having a smart meter installed, here are ten other tips from Smart Energy GB, who Dr Nina Skorupska is working with, on how you can be smarter with energy use to help tackle climate change: . Turn your TV off rather than leaving it on standby, and turn your mobile phone charger off instead of leaving it plugged in and turned on with no phone charging in it . Ask your electricity supplier to switch you to a green tarf - this means more renewables will be used in the energy system . Replace any incandescent or halogen bulbs with LEDs – they use around % less energy and last around  times longer . Keep your household appliances clean –dirt and dust build up, they may have to work harder . Turn your thermostat down just one degree – you won’t feel the dference but you will save energy and save yourself around £ a year . Check the energy rating when buying appliances like fridges and freezers, and only buy the most efficient . Don’t overfill your kettle - using just the amount of water you need instead of overflowing it, saves you energy, as well as money . Using a slow cooker is a great alternative to the oven for stews, tagines and curries, which need time for flavours to develop. Batch cooking dishes like this saves energy, as a slow cooker uses little energy . Use draught excluders around windows and doors to keep more heat in your home . Choose smart appliances, like lights that only turn on when someone’s in the room and turn off when you leaveDr Nina Skorupska CBE FEI is chief executive of the Association for Renewable Energy  Clean Technologies, the UKaposs largest renewables and clean technology trade association, and Smart Energy GB supporterComment MORE ON Climate changeSave moneyWashing machinesSolar powerCOPEnergy bills\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates from our environment editor on green issues and actions you can takeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

That morning of October  he was vomiting and had diarrhea, so decided to stay home from work.But then his symptoms became more severe and he was hit with unbearable pain in his chest and left arm, Herts Live reports.Tom thought he was having a panic attack, something heaposd experienced before - and wouldaposve thought it impossible to have been caused by a cardiac arrest. A day later, Tom - whoaposs a type  diabetic - was still feeling rough and his blood sugar levels were worryingly high. Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter He and his partner Jess Clark, , called  and paramedics rushed to the home and performed an ECG. It was then the responders told him the symptoms heaposd been suffering with for  hours were caused by a major heart attack. He told Herts Live: That was the point I discovered Iaposd had a major heart attack. So I was rushed off to hospital where I had an emergency procedure to try and put a stent in one of my arteries to open the artery back up. Unfortunately, because it had been over  hours, the procedure didnapost work. The condition had caused a loss of  per cent of his heart muscle. His heartwas running at around  per cent. Tom said the condition was a massive shock as he doesnapost drink, or smoke and has no health issues apart from his diabetes. Tom was kept in hospital for six days after the attack, but didnapost last a day before he needed to be readmitted on October . As he watched Manchester Utd play Liverpool on TV he felt his right-hand side go completely numb. Doctors said thathe hadnapost gone back to hospital he wouldaposve died.I had no power in my right arm,said Tom, who was born in Ware.I couldnapost lt my arm very well, and I certainly couldnapost grip anything. The fortunate thing was it didnapost spread any more than my arm, it wasnapost my leg, not any higher than my shoulder, so it certainly wasnapost a stroke. He added: I had an ECG and a blood test to which I was rushed into resus because my markers around my ECG had gone through the roof. The actual doctor on site who was treating me suspected I had another heart attack. It turns out I hadnapost had another heart attack, however the markers themselves were pushing the boundaries of going into severe heart failure. I was told that day thatI hadnapost come to hospital when I did then I would have died that day. He was transferred to St Bartholomewaposs in London before being admitted to Harefield Hospital, which specialises in heart and lung transplants. Doctors are not yet certain what caused the heart attack, and essentially put it down to bad luck. Diabetes has been suggested as a factor. His cholesterol levels were stable.One of his pals Ryan Newey has set up a GoFundMe page to help support the young family while Tom rests up.Itaposs smashed its £, target, with £, in donations already raised.Tom said heaposs been humbled by the support, and wanted to thank his friends, family and NHS staff for their help.I was gobsmacked, he said. To the ious people that have donated on that page, people that I havenapost seen in years, people Iaposve only met a handful of times, long-term friends and family, itaposs nothing short of amazing.

Simeon told MyLondon: “It took me two hours to run my we a bath.The pair said they have been told they will not have hot water or heating until December  at the earliest.  But Simeon says he has been told the council could take eight to  weeks to decide whether to install a new pipe. On some days the home is so cold they are forced to put the oven on for warmth. For the pair to run a bath requires  pans of heated water, forcing Alex to shower at work. But since Simeon works from home he is forced to face  second freezing showers. On frozen mornings it is just one degrees in the apartment - making the shower water colder. The couple previously had under floor heating but say they are now forced to boil the kettle and wrap up warm. Simeon is also worried that damp is starting to spread by their front door because without the heating on, moisture has started to build up in spots Simeon has never seen before. The website designer claims the whole block of flats they live in has been affected. Simeon added: “People have been trying to get tenants in but they have just left straight away. It’s just been a disaster.” A nearby hotel has offered the couple the chance to shower there in light of their problems.

Claire Holland, , was last seen at a pub in central Bristol, on June , . The mum-of-one was reported missing by her family a few days later but has never been found. In  a -year-old man was arrested on suspicion of the murder but was released under investigation. Today the Major Crime Investigation Teamof Avon and Somerset police has released new CCTV footage showing Claire on the day she vanished. The last sighting of Claire was at the Seamus O’Donnell’s pub in St Nicholas Street in Bristol city centre. Police will also be using an unprecedented method of messaging anyone who was friends with Claire on Facebook in  seeking further information.Investigators will also carry out several targeted searches in and around the Bristol area over the next few days. Senior Investigating Officer Det Insp Darren Hannant said: “We’d like the public to cast their mind back to The Queen’s Diamond Jubilee weekend, which was on the weekend of - June in .  aposaposClaire went missing the day after this signicant national event. “CCTV shows Claire walking along Baldwin Street heading towards the Seamus O’Donnell’s pub at around .pm on Wednesday  June. We don’t have any footage showing where she went afterwards, but staff have confirmed she did leave the pub later that evening just after closing time, around .pm.  It is possible she headed in the direction of the fountains, near the Harbourside, but we don’t have any footage of her doing so, despite extensive reviews of more than , hours of available CCTV. Claire is described as white, around ft tall of a small build with shoulderbrown hair that is often tied in a ponytail. She was last seen wearing black trousers, a short-sleeved black top with a grey t-shirt underneath.  She was also carrying a cream-coloured Primark re-usable carrier bag. Det Insp Hannant added: “At this time, we’re treating Claire’s disappearance as suspicious. aposaposClaire had no known reason to go missing of her own accord and had made plans for the week following her disappearance.  “Claire’s family are being kept up to date on the progress of this investigation and we’re committed to providing them with the answers they need. Specially trained liaison officers will continue to support them at this very dficult time.” If you have information that could help the investigation, you can call the police on  and give the call handler the reference number .

Butyou’re planning on heading out to buy new decorations this year, an interior design expert has suggested steering clear of tinsel and colourful lights – as the most popular themes for Christmas  are sustainability and simplicity.Rachel Epstein, Interiors Expert and Creative Director of CARME Home, has detailed all the in trends for this year’s festive season, from floral tree decorations to the best winter scents.Choosing the right theme Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. The interior expert says “natural” styles are the way forward this year, and has encouraged people to ditch the “sparkly aesthetic” in favour of a stripped back look. She said: “This year, weaposre going to see lots of natural, eco and sustainable materials. If this is your go to choice, try incorporating acorns and dried fruit into your decorating. “Unfortunately, the black and white, sparkly aesthetic is somewhat overdone. Instead, simply your interior, go for mainly white decor with very small accents of sparkles.” Decorating the Christmas tree Rachel also thinks we should move away from plastic baubles and tinsel to liven up our trees, as this year is all about “floral elements” with baubles made of wood or glass. She explained: “Weaposll see lots more floral elements added to Christmas trees this year as we continue to be inspired by nature. “Plastic baubles will be replaced with wood and glass and tinsel is another decoration of the past as we turn to soft ribbons instead. “If youaposre hoping to revamp your current decorations rather than purchase new ones, a trick we love to do is to use ribbon to tie together a few small baubles creating little bauble clusters. Theyaposre creative, simple and cost effective.” Changing colour palettes According to Rachel, the festive colours for  include dark blue, green, brown, and pink – instead of the timelessly traditional red and green.  She said: “A huge part of any interior design is choosing your colour palette. The traditional Christmas colours of red and green, and more recently gold and silver, will always be favourable. However, Christmas  will see us steer away from the traditional, and colours like dark blue, green, brown and pink will be introduced.” Creating an ambience This year, interior designers are telling people to discard their multi-coloured Christmas lights and to pick up neutral tones instead to great a “cosy touch”. Rachel said: “Simple lights will reign supreme this year, opt for warmer tones to introduce a cosy touch to your interior. “Colourful lights are slowly becoming less and less popular each year. However, some softer tone lights such as a blush pink would be favourable depending on the overall aesthetic of the home.” Make your home smell as good as it looks Scented candles and room dfusers in festive scents can bring a finishing touch to any room in your house, and Rachel says to go for classic Christmas fragrances – including cinnamon, pine, and gingerbread. She said: “Adding candles, room dfusers or even fresh ingredients to your interior is like the cherry on the top of the cake. Scents help to pull the whole room together and complete your interior. “Whether you’re a fan of cinnamon, pine, roasted nuts, gingerbread or even mulled wine, including fragrance into your home is the final touch! Try to avoid anything too fruity or fresh, for Christmas it’s all about the luxurious, earthy smells.”Have you got a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

Late-night emails, client WhatsApps, the news, a Twitter notication, FitBit… it didn’t matter what it was. What mattered is that I was immediately available or I’d miss something transformative, I was sure of it. I’d sit at dinner, discussing a friend’s hilariously bad date, missing cues to laugh as I was too busy urging myself not to glance down at my lit up screen. I’d sit at my desk, unable to focus, being pulled out of concentration by the incessant glow. I had reached such a heightened level of contact with the outside world that I didn’t even notice how badly I needed to disconnect. One day, after a long, hard think about this habit, I did something I never thought would actually stick: I turned every single notication off.You’d think I’d be the last person on earth to actually manage this, or I certainly did anyway. I had founded amarketing agencyin the year prior. I had clients, a small team, umpteen social media accounts to manage, inquiring journalists, potential business popping up and I really believed this demanded me to be non-negotiably on, all the time. Would you ever go cold turkey on your phone notications  Have your say in the comments below Fast forward six months, I now find it incredibly odd to imagine my phone holding that much power over me. I’ve turned off every single notication, I don’t open the email app out-of-hours, and I’ve turned off the banner and badge alerts for most apps too. Nothing, except urgent phone calls, has lit up my phone for over half a year. The first two weeks were uncomfortably dficult. When you get a notication, it triggers a dopamine rush, and my own brain was addicted to this “reward”, craving the habit-based behaviour. I felt anxious for a while, semi-desperately telling everyone about it, making sure they knew to call they needed me.After that  Peace. There’s been a million ways this has benefited me in every aspect of my le but perhaps most importantly, I am able to be present, no matter where I am. Whether it’s getting my head down to plan a brand launch strategy or at the dinner table discussing future travel plans. Either way, I am finally living in the moment. People rarely call, and this always surprises me. Both my colleagues and I have realised that we believe everything is urgent, until we’re forced to decideit’s worth interrupting someone... and it often turns out, it’s just not. Clients follow the same logic. I’m a big fan of that. I can’t think of one single moment or opportunity I have missed because of this. Everyone, both professionally and personally, has better boundaries with me now. Our clients rarely WhatsApp, butand when they do, I still won’t reply out of working hours, unless itaposs an emergency - which is almost never. My friends know I’ll reply when I can , but they also know when I’m with them, I’m now both physically and mentally present. As a society, we have a painful and damaging relationship with technology, and an ever-growing notion that with all this wonderful tech, we should be far more connected than ever before. It’s undeniable that we’re privileged to have this access. But at the same time, being instantly available to everyone and anything is simply not healthy.My current wellbeing is testament to that. I used to feel anxious and overwhelmed, and while this might not be the only change I made to lessen that, it’s certainly one of the biggest. It’s liberating. I’ve learnt that you don’t ever need to apologise for being unavailable. You don’t need to give anyone that instant access to you. You don’t need to be actively busy to not respond - you’re entitled to be actively not-busy and still unavailable. Those boundaries are healthy and should become society’s norm. And I truly believe,you challenge yourself to three weeks, this will become your norm too.

If that werenapost enough thereaposs also a wide selection of sauces to accompany your food, such as Mango Habanero and a collaboration with Megan Thee Stallion on a hot sauce called Hottie. The Mirroraposs Courtney Pochin was invited down ahead of the launch to take a look behind the scenes, meet the team and give some of the food a try. Hereaposs a look at what she thought...  Get the news you want straight to your inbox. for a Mirror newsletter here.Until this week all I knew about Popeyes was that their Chicken Sandwich went viral, with customers across America queuing around the block to get their hands on one. A total of  million Chicken Sandwiches were sold in the productaposs first year and after visiting the new branch in Stratford I understand why people were so keen, as it really is worth the hype. During my behind the scenes sneak peek, I got to have a go at making my own Chicken Sandwich, toasting a brioche bun, slathering on spicy mayo, adding two bread and butter pickles and a ginormous piece of fried chicken.I then tucked in and was impressed by the crispiness of the chicken, something CEO Tom Crowley refers to as the shatter crunch.The ingredients may sound rather simple, but thataposs kind of the point, as they were all carefully chosen to allow the fried chicken to remain the star of the show.  At Popeyes, we focus on the quality of our ingredients and doing the basics brilliantly well, explains Crowley. Thataposs one of the things weaposve done with the sandwich is keep it simple to focus on great ingredients. So really good bun, a really fresh brioche,  per cent fresh British chicken, nothing frozen. Then thereaposs good mayo, picklesand I think those components keep it super simple to focus on quality and we keep the price right at £., which is pretty competitive. Weaposll let everyone judge the quality for themselves rather than it being higher priced. The Chicken Sandwich was definitely an upgrade on your average fast-food fare and Iaposd even go as far as to claim itaposs better than the McChicken Sandwich or a KFC Fillet burger... Iaposm already craving another one. Once Popeyes opens youaposll be able to try it for yourself, with a classic or spicy Chicken Sandwich priced at £. or £. for a meal with a regular side and drink.  As well as giving the Chicken Sandwich a try, Peter Genna, the Director of Global Culinary Innovation and Product Development for Popeyes recommends ordering the Signature Louisiana Chicken, with a pot of the Mardi Gras Mustard and a Lotus Biscoff Shake to wash it down. The Signature Chicken Mealcontains chicken on the bone, marinated for  hours in the companyaposs signature blend of Louisiana herbs and spices, one regular side, one drink and one biscuit.Andyouaposre getting a biscuit then you simply must order a pot of cajun gravy to go with it.Biscuits and gravy are incredibly popular in the US but the concept is bound to baffle some customers here as the biscuits look just like scones - and they are pretty similar, but with a slightly more savoury taste. Once you get over the initial feeling of bemusement and drown your plate in cajun gravy itaposs hearty comfort food at its best. Trust me. So whataposs the verdict Ultimately, Iaposd say I was a Popeyes convert and Iaposm excited for everyone to get to have a taste of Louisiana in London. The prices are pretty generous for the portion sizes and the fried chicken was super crunchy and full of flavour - with the hot wings and spicy sandwich packing a real kick.I love that Popeyes is staying true to its American roots and offering customers something thataposs familiarbut also completely dferent, with more unusual items on the menu like biscuits and gravy.Also, itaposs worth noting that the company, while being an iconic American brand, is going to be sourcing  per cent of ingredients locally in the UK instead of importing from the US. Theyaposve also signed the Better Chicken Commitment, which aims to improve the lives of chickens in their supply chain. If you enjoy fried chicken and want to try something new, then this is definitely the place for you. Owned by Restaurant Brands International, which also owns Burger King, Popeyes already has  branches in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Over in the US, the menu also features items such as cajun fried shrimp and a flounder sandwich. If all goes well with the UK launch we could see similar items added over here in the future. Popeyes have yet to confirm where  in the UK they will be opening, but CEO Tom Crowley said he is looking forward to the expansion, which will feature dine-in restaurants and drive-thrus. Our vision for our UK launch is ambitious and bold. All our locations will be carefully chosen in communities that echo the Louisianan spirit synonymous with Popeyes. We’re looking forward to unveiling our next sites in due course, and revealing more about our expansion into new locations in  and beyond, he told The Mirror.This launch comes after another US chain recently opened, with Wendyaposs bringing more burgers to the UK, after disappearing from the high street  years ago.

The -year-old Syrian refugee’s murderous mission was thwarted by heroic cabbie David Perry, who is said to have locked him in the vehicle as he detonated his home-made device. It is also feared the type of bomb he used could indicate that an al-Qaeda cell was involved, as the country’s terror threat alert was raised from substantial to severe – meaning another attack is now “highly likely”. Al Swealmeen is believed to have had mental health problems and according to pals had been sectioned for brandishing a kne in the city centre before launching his death bid.  And it was tonight reported his intended Remembrance Day target was church-goers who helped him convert from Islam to Christianity. But police said he switched his deadly intentions to Liverpool Women’s Hospital after his route in a taxi was blocked by traffic and road closures and told David to head there. A senior former intelligence source said: “The bomber intended to enter the hospital and trigger his device, but for some reason it went off early and failed properly to initiate.  “Had he successfully set off the bomb inside it would have been extremely bloody and horric. “We believe this was a partial ­explosion, clearly from a device at high-chest level, aimed at causing many casualties.” Al Swealmeen, who died inside the burning cab, converted from Islam in Liverpool’s Anglican ­cathedral in March . He spent eight months living with devoted Christians Malcolm and ­Elizabeth ­Hitchcott at their home in the Aigburth district.  The couple today told of their shock at hearing the “quiet and well mannered” man, who was also quite artistic, allegedly intended to bomb women and children. Former soldier Mr Hitchcott­ said: “It’s terribly sad. We loved him. He was a lovely guy and we are shocked. “We are shocked because a less likely ­candidate you could not imagine.  “He first came to the ­cathedral in August  and wanted to convert to ­Christianity. He was ­destitute at that time and we took him in.” Mr and Mrs Hitchcott told how Al Swealmeen arrived in the UK via Dubai in  seeking asylum. It is believed his case had been decided and rejected at first. Motor racing fan Al Swealmeen, who is said to have called himself Enzo Almeni after Ferrari founder Enzo Ferrari, then renewed his ­application in November .  But the couple said he never spoke about his time in Syria or Iraq. They said he was born in Iraq where his mum was from. His dad was Syrian. Armed police arrested three men in Kensington, a mile from the blast, on Sunday at .pm. They are aged ,  and . A fourth aged  was held today close to Sefton Park. ­Neighbours told of the drama as officers raided the property. One policeman could be seen with a gun on a ladder overlooking a garden behind the raided terraced house. There was a shout of “armed police” and another officer appears to break down the wooden fence or gate before storming the garden. A man in a white T-shirt looked through the back door, before ­disappearing. There were then shouts of “get out of the house, do not move, hands on your head now” as the man re-emerges and follows instructions to lie on the ground.  Resident Keith Ford, , said: “Police were everywhere. There were two officers with big guns, they looked like machine guns, pointed at the house. “One of them must have come to the door as I heard the policeman say to him, ‘Hands in the air’. “But he must have refused and gone back into the house because I then heard the policeman say, ‘He might have a gun in his pocket.’”  Matthew Heitman, , who lives opposite the raided house, added: “Two of the men were marched out at gunpoint and they had them up against the wall. There wasn’t any kind of struggle, they just walked out. “The people living there had not long moved in.” Jimmy Ashworth, , who runs Jimmy’s cafe was evacuated at am today as the further arrest took place.  He said: “They said that my le was in danger, that’s all they could tell me.” Photographs taken within the cordoned area at am showed a man in a black puffer jacket, black ­trousers and white trainers being held. One -year-old ­resident, who gave her name as Amy, said: “It’s unbelievable to think we were living  yards away from a bomb factory. I haven’t slept all night.”  Today Army specialists carried out a controlled explosion near Sefton Park “as part of the ongoing” probe into the blast, according to police. There have been warnings for weeks that terror groups are growing in Afghanistan following the bungled evacuation and could attack the West. The intelligence source added: “This is the attack we have been warning would take place.  “We are likely to see more in the coming months. Terrorists globally have been given confidence since the Afghan ­withdrawal and they have more space and time to devote to extending their violence worldwide.” Boris Johnson slammed the ­“sickening attack.” The PM said: “My thoughts remain with all those affected and I want to pay tribute to the emergency services who responded as always with such speed and professionalism.  “The British people will never be cowed by terrorism.” The Liverpool attack came just two weeks after Tory MP David Amess was stabbed to death at his surgery in an alleged terror incident. Home Secretary Priti Patel said the terror threat has been raised because “what we saw yesterday is the second incident in a month”.  NHS chiefs have ordered an overhaul of security at hospitals across England’s  health trusts. Cab driver David fled the vehicle after the explosion and just moments before it was engulfed in flames. He was treated in hospital.Most ReadFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Terror attacksTerrorismPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Caroline Cerny, lead at the Obesity Health Alliance, said: “There are several aspects of the pandemic that are likely to have contributed to this increase in child obesity levels. “But it is very clear from data showing increases in sales of confectionery, biscuits and fast food that junk food companies used the opportunity to keep their unhealthy products centre stage in children’s minds. “We need to break the junk food cycle to improve children’s health. “We need the Government to take stronger action to improve everyday food and drink with a levy on food companies to incentivise them to improve.” Childhood obesity rates are twice as high in the most deprived communities compared to the least. David Fothergill, chair of the Local Government Association’s wellbeing board, said: “Childhood obesity is one of the greatest public health challenges we face, made all the more dficult by the impact of the pandemic on children’s activities and lestyles. “As these worrying figures show, there is still much to do to encourage healthier eating and habitswe are to avoid today’s obese children becoming tomorrow’s obese adults.“Investment in councils’ public health services now will reap benefits for everyone longer-term, including for theNHS .”The numbers The proportion of children who were a healthy weight dropped between   and  .

What part of this is sustainable Sajid Javid  Faye, who lists herself as Ambulance ECA  Student Paramedic at South Western Ambulance Service, made her comments as the NHS faces unprecedented pressure ahead of the deep winter months. Alarming data shows that there are almost half as many fewer beds free now than during the peak of the pandemic in January. While Covid hospitalisations have dropped signicantly - from around , daily admissions at the beginning of the year to around , eleven months on - other, non-Covid related pressures have soared. The build up in demand has left health chiefs feelings deeply concerned.A survey of  NHS leaders in England finds the health service already at “tipping point”, according to NHS Confederation. Now % of the leaders think the demands on their organisation are unsustainable, and % believe a lack of staffing in the NHS as a whole is putting patient safety and care at risk. Matthew Taylor, the chief executive of the NHS Confederation, told the : “Almost every healthcare leader we’ve spoken to is warning that the NHS is under unsustainable pressure, and they are worried the situation will worsen, as we head into deep midwinter, unless action is taken. They are also sounding alarm bells over risks to patient safetytheir services become overwhelmed, on top of a severe workforce crisis.

Help.aposapos A spokesperson from South Western Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust said it was experiencing the highest-ever level of sustained demand on our service and that response times are affected as a result. We are losing many more hours compared with recent years which causes our ambulances to queue outside hospitals and unable to respond to other patients and has an inevitable impact on the service we can provide, they said. This is a health system problem which therefore demands a system solution. It is an absolute priority for us and our NHS partners to reduce these delays, so we can be there for our patients, while prioritising those who are most seriously injured and ill. Patients who need urgent medical help or advice are encouraged to visit or to call , which is free and available  . This will ensure they get the right care, and the ambulance service can focus on those most in need.

The victimsapos bodies were found in a refrigerated lorry trailer after it was transported by ferry from Zeebrugge to Purfleet in Essex, in October . Earlier this year, other members of the people smuggling gang were jailed at the Old Bailey for their involvement. Damian had been arrested on June  just outside Milan and sent back to Britain in September. On Tuesday, he appeared at the Old Bailey by video link from Chelmsford prison.  With the assistance of an Italian interpreter, he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration between May ,  to October , . Prosecutor Jonathan Polnay said Damianaposs principal involvement in the plot was by personally and allowing others to use his van to pick up migrants from Collingwood Farm in Essex after they were transported into the country. Sentencing was adjourned until January  next year before Mr Justice Sweeney. Earlier, another gang member, Valentin Calota was ordered to pay the victimsapos families more than £,.  Calota was paid £ plus expenses to drive one vanload of migrants from Essex to London days before the fatal run. The -year-old, from Birmingham, was jailed for four and a half years earlier this year. Calota appeared at the Old Bailey for his confiscation hearing by video link from HMP Huntercombe and was assisted by a Romanian interpreter. The court heard that Calota had benefited from his criminal lestyle to the amount of £,..  The money in sterling, euro and Romanian leu had been seized by police upon his arrest. Mr Polnay said: The prosecution had considered submitting to this court the benefit was higher. However, given we understand Mr Calota is to be deported relatively shortly from this country we consider there to be littleany benefit in an academic exercise in asserting that he had a higher benefit. Judge Mark Lucraft QC ordered that the entire sum of £,. be confiscated and paid as compensation to the victimsapos families. Other gang members are due to face confiscation hearings later this week. Previously, the court had heard the criminal operation was long-running and profitable, with the smugglers standing to make more than £ million in October  alone.  A total of seven smuggling trips were identied between May  and October  , with migrants paying up to £, for a VIP service. Migrants would board lorries at a remote location on the continent to be transported to Britain where they would be picked up by a fleet of smaller vehicles for transfer to a safe house until payment was received. Some of the trips were thwarted by border officials and residents in Orsett, Essex, had repeatedly reported migrants being dropped off to the police. Yet the smuggling operation was not stopped until after the tragic journey. The families of the victims in Vietnam and Britain have previously spoken of their loss and hardship.

The interview, broadcast in  and described by many as a “car crash”, saw Andrew speak atabout his association with the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.Andrew vehemently denied any accusations of wrongdoing over his links to Epstein, including allegations he had sex with Virginia Giuffre when she was  years old. He also declined to say he regretted the friendship with Epstein, with his memorable answers including details of his visit to Pizza Express and saying he was medically unable to sweat.  In the days after the interview, his le began to change considerably and he has now stepped away from public duties. Here we look at his two years since the interview... Stepping down from public dutiesIt was just days after the interview was broadcast that Andrew sensationally quit public le for the foreseeable future.In a statement, approved by the Queen, the Duke of York said it had become clear to him that my former association with Jeffrey Epstein has become a major disruption to my family’s work.He expressed sympathy for the victims of the convicted sex offender and disgraced financier, saying he hoped they could rebuild their lives.

He said: It has become clear to me over the last few days that the circumstances relating to my former association with Jeffrey Epstein has become a major disruption to my family’s work and the valuable work going on in the many organisations and charities that I am proud to support. Therefore, I have asked Her MajestyI may step back from public duties for the foreseeable future, and she has given her permission. I continue to unequivocally regret my ill-judged association with Jeffrey Epstein. His suicide has left many unanswered questions, particularly for his victims, and I deeply sympathise with everyone who has been affected and wants some form of closure. I can only hope that, in time, they will be able to rebuild their lives. Of course, I am willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency with their investigations,required. Low-key ChristmasJust weeks after the interview, the Royal Family celebrated Christmas  at Sandringham - and as is tradition greeted well-wishers as they walked to church.But rather than attending this service at around am, Andrew attended the more low-key service, which takes place earlier in the morning - missing the crowds. Misses out on honour  Months after the interview in February , Andrew turned  - and he would have been in line for a Navy promotion.It would have followed advancements to Rear Admiral on his th birthday and Vice Admiral when he was . But he declined the promotion to the rank of Admiral ahead of turning .The move would have been in line with a long-standing policy under which senior royals are treated asthey had stayed in the Armed Forces and are promoted to higher ranks as a result. A Buckingham Palace spokeswoman said at the time: “By convention, the Duke of York would be in line for military promotion on his th birthday. Following the decision by His Royal Highness to step back from public duties for the foreseeable future, the Duke of York has asked the Ministry of Defencethis promotion might be deferred until such time that His Royal Highness s to public duty.” Wedding photo absence There was a happy occasion in the York family in July  when Princess Beatrice wed husband Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi in a low-key ceremony in Windsor under Covid restrictions. Fewer than  guests attended – a far cry from the  wedding of Bea’s sister , Princess Eugenie, to Jack Brooksbank in , which was broadcast on TV. But when it came to the official wedding photos released to the public, Beatriceaposs dad Andrew didnapost figure in any of them.The Queen and Prince Philip were the only royals shown with the beaming bride and her new husband.The decision to release snaps without him was thought to have been taken by the family alongside advice from courtiers. Royals aposblock apos  After the sad death of his father Prince Philip, Andrew talked to television crews outside All Saints Chapel, Windsor Lodge, to express the feelings of the Royal Family. He also very briefly appeared in a documentary about his fatheraposs le in September.However, it was reported last month that royal sources have claimed his siblings have ruled out anyback to public le for Andrew.An insider told the Sunday Times that a meeting was held last January where Prince Charles, Princess Anne and Prince Edward were in agreement that their brother should never be allowed toto public le.They said: “There is no way in the world he’s ever coming back, the family will never let it happen.”The source also claimed that Prince William was annoyed about Andrew’s attitude since the scandal has emerged, saying it’s what “really gets” to him.Legal battle Earlier this year, Virginia Giuffre began the process of suing Andrew in a civil case in New York for allegedly sexually assaulting her when she was a teenager. She alleges she was told by Epstein and British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell to have sex with the Prince at Epsteinaposs mansion in New York and at other locations. The prince has always denied the allegations and said he has “no recollection” of ever meeting herEarlier this month, a judge said Andrew should be prepared for a trial late next year on accusations.Speaking in a teleconference, US District Judge Lewis Kaplan said he anticipated the trial on Virginia Giuffre’s civil claims would begin between September and December .

The monarch continues her doctor-ordered rest at Windsor Castle after being forced to pull out of attending the Remembrance Sunday service at the Cenotaph. On Sunday, the Duchess of Cambridge Kate Middleton took centre stage at the service to commemorate Britainaposs war dead. Kate looked solemn as she stood in the middle with the Duchess of Cornwall and Sophie Wessex at her sides on a balcony of the Foreign Office while Prince Charles, Prince William, Princess Anne and Prince Edward were below as they laid wreaths at the Cenotaph.Buckingham Palace has moved to dampen fears over Her Majestyaposs condition after announcing the -year-old had suffered an “unfortunate” back strain, which left her “deeply disappointed” to miss the event. Courtiers are no understood to be taking a “cautious approach” with the sovereign’s diary moving forward, with no public engagements expected for the rest of the year.

Rosemary Neagle, who lives on a farm in Kilmartin Glen near Lochgilphead, said the noise of the tremor was so loud that she initially thought something had exploded in one of her sheds. She told BBC Radioaposs Good Morning Scotland programme: It kept on intensying and the house vibrated. It rumbled on for about  seconds afterwards, so it was quite frightening. I have experienced them before here but never to that extent. The house has never shook like that in the past. Victoria Winters, , also felt the earthquake rumble through her home - and described it as like a freight train. She said: We were woken with a bit of a start. It sounds like a freight train appearing all of a sudden and then it starts shaking. It sounds like something really big is hurtling towards you. I live in a big echo-y old stone house, so it makes quite a noise when it comes through. Itaposs not the first time Iaposve experienced one here, so I knew what it was.  I can imagineyou hadnapost experienced it before then it could be quite scary. Iaposve felt about four in the last ten years. It lasted five or six seconds, enough to wake me up, carry on and then I could tell when it was coming through the house. It came through where the bedroom is.

Until about , years ago much of the north of the UK was covered by a thick layer of ice - which pushed the rocks down into the underlying mantle. These rocks have been slowly rising back up ever since the ice melted, causing occasional earthquakes in the process.The UK is also subject to tectonic stresses caused by the expansion of the Atlantic Ocean, which is slowly pushing the entire of Eurasia to the east, and from the northward motion of Africa, which is pushing into Europe from the south.The most damaging UK earthquake was in the Colchester area in .

Zara Groves, , was shocked when a friend told her a woman, who was a potential customer, saw a photo of her and decided not to sign up with her. She said that the comment caused her to have a aposlittle cryapos. The fitness instructor, from Llandudno, Wales, was surprised that her skill and expertise was dismissed so easily and that her experience of working in the industry for over  years was overlooked, reports the Daily Post. She has worked all over the world including Asia, Europe and Australia and runs her own fitness company, Zara Groves Fitness.  Zara said: My friend who told me about what the woman said was mortied when she realised how upset I was. Apparently the woman knew all about me and was going to sign up to one of my online courses, but then saw a photo of me on social media and instantly dismissed me as she thought me too fat, and so as a result I couldnapost possibly be a good trainer.The next day Zara dusted herself down and decided to post about what happened to her on Facebook.In my Facebook post I say clearly I know Iaposm not fat, Iaposm a size  which isnapost fat at all, said Zara. I may have put weight on since my s but the thing is Iaposm  now and Iaposm also peri-menopausal.  She continued: Iaposm just really shocked about how judgemental people can be and also how harsh. Iaposm very body confident, I really am but I know some younger fitness trainers who would have felt crucied by someone not going to them because they were deemed fat. Iaposve had some of them contact me saying similar things have happened to them and how horribly upsetting it has made them feel. I think people have a very unrealistic vision of how women and fitness trainers should look, some seem to think we should all be like was. Zara added: Just because Iaposm not a stick doesnapost mean Iaposm not a good trainer, I know I am as Iaposm still in the business  years on. And the thing is with me I keep it very real and natural. I have not had Botox, fillers, fake boobs or a bum lt, other instructors do that eventhey are only in their s itaposs important to me to try and keep things realistic.

James Martin, , drove away with Stella Frew hanging on to the side of his van in Sutton, south London in July last year. As he zigzagged through parked cars, the -year-old victim hit an Audi and fell under the van wheels, the Old Bailey was told. Martin fled the scene as members of the public rushed over to help Ms Frew, who had suffered extensive injuries and died at the scene. The court had been told the incident appeared to have been sparked by the defendantaposs refusal to pay her for sex.  Martin had also driven off with the victimaposs handbag in his van, which he later threw into the road. Ms Frew, who had four children and four grandchildren, had problems with drugs and drink and was said to have been out of her head when she approached Martin. Prosecutor Jonathan Polnay said: She was obviously very desperate to obtain money and she would not have been willing to leave with out it - and still less without her handbag. Martin had initially denied wrongdoing but had pleaded guilty to causing Ms Frewaposs death by dangerous driving on what would have been the first day of his trial. Judge Richard Marks QC rejected Martinaposs case that Ms Frew was not hanging onto the van as he drove off. The judge also noted that Martinaposs expressions of remorse were largely centred on the effect on himself and his family and he had shown little empathy for his victim.  Judge Marks told Martin: She did not deserve to die in the circumstances that she did. It is clear from the evidence that she got dragged along the road, coming into contact with a parked vehicle. Your van drove over her body causing her fatal injuries. She had a tyre mark vertically up her back from her pelvis to her neck. Your behaviour in the course of this incident and in particular at and towards the end of the incident was cheap, cynical and disdainful. He said Martin was only thinking of himself when he drove off, despite the risk to Ms Frew. The judge went on: Having driven away not having paid her a penny piece... you demonstrated the contempt for which you held her by throwing her handbag from the window. Given the lateness of Martinaposs guilty plea, Judge Marks gave him only a % discount on his sentence, handing him four and a half years in prison.  Martin was disqualied from driving for four years upon his release from jail. The judge commended the dignity shown by Ms Frewaposs family who wiped away tears in court as Martin was sentenced by video link from Belmarsh prison. Earlier, Ms Frewaposs two grown-up daughters had described their motheraposs troubled le in which they said she had suffered abuse at the hands of men. Frankie Cottrell said: Stella was a vulnerable young woman exploited by many due to her kindness, especially by men. It pains us that Stellaaposs le has been ended by the actions of a male too. She went on: She was somebody, she had a family who love her dearly. Mr Martin may have thought my mum was worthless but to us she was everything. Georgie Cottrell described her mother as the kindest, most warm-hearted woman. She said: In her le she had always been abused and hurt by men and that is why this pains us all so much - that she had died due to one too.Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON PrisonsPrison sentenceCrimeDangerous driving\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

But while this treat might feel like heaven, believe me, itaposs Hell working there. Whether it’s the medley of teenage lads shouting “Here comes Fatty” to me as they scoff a p cheeseburger, or the experience of witnessing a grown man rip off a Covid- protection window due to a lack of milkshakes, my six years at McDonalds have been nothing short of a flurry. After applying fresh out of high school , McDonald’s flexible hours and healthy rate of pay was extremely attractive to a skint first-year college student. And while most worry the lack of experience would be the issue with younger staff members, it’s the drama you’ve got to watch out for.  Once you’re past the three-month probation - during which most existing staff members refuse to acknowledge your existence - every fresh cohort brings a brand-new tier to Macciesapos ever growing political chain. However, the real initiation isn’t complete without the obligatory mid-sht breakdown. I can’t tell you how many people I’ve caught crying in the freezer, the stock room, even behind the bins. It’s a rite of passage for new staff members. Keeping a brave face is at least  percent of the job. From the Friday stampede of orders , to shovelling the remnants of half-chewed chicken nuggets from abandoned trays into the bin, and even having abuse hurledfor receiving cold food “after waiting for half an hour” always half an hour.It’s all just a part of the job.  That’s not to say every customer is rude, though. But there are the ones who test patience in a busy Drive-Thru. Firstly, nothing is LESS funny than when people try and order a Wicked Zinger Box Meal. Secondly, on behalf of every McDonald’s worker, we don’t serve mayonnaise. I don’t know why we don’t serve mayonnaise I don’t know IF we will ever serve mayonnaise and “speaking to the manager” about the lack of mayonnaise certainly isn’t going to solve anything. Thirdly, we can hear and see everything you do while you’re waiting to give your order by the Drive-Thru speakers. I can’t tell you how many solo renditions of cringe ‘s pop hits I’ve heard over the years. Alas, the serenade of freshly driving teens and those who queue for half an hour for the sake of a bottle of waterblocks out the eight hours of incessant beeping machines. *The writeraposs name has been changed.

However, she was able to finally find answers after tracking down her Iranian dad, Saeed Sotoudeh, from an ancestry DNA testKelly, , had never known who her dad was and decided to do a £ DNA test when she saw them on sale Image: Triangle NewsByEmily HallShiler Mahmoudi:,  Nov | commentsA woman who did an ancestry DNA test has found her long-lost dad after  years.Kelly Pinkney had done the test to find out about her ancestry, but was shocked find a first cousin who led her to her dad.After tracking him down, she met up with her dad, Saeed Sotoudeh, for the first time earlier this year.She had been conceived in a short fling and was taken into the care system as a young child. Kelly,  is now forging a relationship with her dad who she was never able to find as her mum did not remember his name. She said: Itaposs such an amazing feeling knowing who I am for the first time.When I look in the mirror I look at myself in a dferent way than I did before. I feel complete. I feel like I belong now.Kelly was born in September  and was conceived the Christmas before in a one night stand in a London hotel room. She was raised by her single mum but grew up moving between foster homes before settling with a family for four years.She describes herself as a sad and unhappy child who started to run away.As she was reaching her pre-teens, she began questioning her identity, as she was dark-haired and dark-skinned with brown eyes despite her mumaposs family being fair.Kelly said: I got bullied at school because further north there were no black people, no brown people.Iaposm not even that dark, but I was the darkest kid in the school, the only kid that was brown, everyone  was white.My colour became a thing for me. That was really hard as I was in a childrenaposs home so I was dferent anyway, I didnapost have a family and I was also dferent because I had colour and no-one  did.If I was white, no-one would ever have questioned me.She moved back in with her mum aged ten and began asking her about her dad, but her mum could not give her a definite answer and said she thought he as Egyptian or Arabic.Mum didnapost know she was pregnant until eight or ten weeks, Kelly added.She said people said aposAre you going to get rid of it apos as there was no father and back in those days it wasnapost the done thing to be having a baby outside marriage.She was adamant she loved me and was keeping me.Then two years ago, she looked into doing a DNA test after a friend told her she had done one with Calornia-based Me.  At the time, the test was £ and Kelly couldnapost afford it, but a few months later she bought one on sale for £. Five weeks after sending a saliva sample. she received the results that said she was % Persian from Iran and that she had a first cousin on the site. Kelly reached out to the man and explained her story, and the cousin told her that his mum had six brother, meaning that one would be her dad.Two had died, two lived in the US and others hadnapost been in London in the late s, but he agreed to speak to his mum.I didnapost want to cause any trouble but then again I was so excited about this discovery, Kelly said. But he rang me back and instantly his tone had changed.He said there was a mistake and his mother and grandmother said it wasnapost possible as the family hadnapost come to the UK until the late s. He thought the company had made a mistake.He wished me good luck and then cut me off. But I knew the DNA couldnapost be wrong so I started doing my own research - I was literally like an FBI agent.She tracked down two of the brothers on Facebook who did not speak to her, but she was able to speak to their daughters , along with a brother, agreed to a DNA test.The results determined they were uncles and cousins, but as word spread, Kelly received another message from one of the brothers Saeed who lives in London. He said he recognised Kellyaposs mum and after a test, he was revealed to be her father. After  years Kelly had finally found the father she had been missing all her le - and amazingly his one regret in le was that he had never had kids of his own. She felt relieved that she finally understood her heritage and questions around her identity were solved. Kelly said: When I found out I cried uncontrollably for an hour. I couldnapost stop. I thought of all the hurt and pain. There was massive relief - I finally knew who I was. He never met the right person, got married or had a family of his own and he said he always wanted children. And he was the only brother out of all of them who had no children.

Then I would have to get up again because there was housework, A-level coursework, or revision to do Image: Getty ImagesopinionByElizabeth Haigh:,  Nov | commentsWhat would you do for £. an hour  Not a lot, I imagine. Aged  I worked nine-hour shts at McDonald’s for this measly sum, saving towards university while doing a job that is, without a doubt, harder than an Oxbridge degree. And you can trust me: I’ve done both. Shts at McDonald’s are far from a golden time. Spent running around, never sitting down, under constant pressure to deliver meals within the magic -second window, all the time fixing a smile on your face and saying hurried, robotic company mantras: “Enjoy your meal!” Sounds exhausting  It is. Not to mention the frequent abuse, bad-mouthing and often flat-out lies from customers angling for a free Big Mac .  I would get home and quite literally collapse to the floor. Then I would have to get up again because there was housework, A-level coursework, or revision to do. Flash forward a year, and Iaposd just arrived at the University of Cambridge. I come from a low-income, single-parent household from the back of beyond in Shropshire. I was excited, nervous, and finally free. But I was not prepared for the culture shock I was about to experience.  The majority of my new friends were privately educated. Some of them had never had a job at all, let alone a customer service job. As term began, I became increasingly incredulous as I had to advise some of myfriends on everything from how to use a scourer, to how to wash up and cook pasta. And break the news that no, you can’t just add tomato purée to plain pasta and expect it to turn into the delicious vegetable sauce your mother makes. I went from flipping burgers and swearing as the milkshake machine broke again , to attending fancy formals with menus where I barely understood half the words on the page.Cambridge was tough. The workload was overwhelming and, at times, it felt like I was drowning in deadlines. If you turn up to McDonald’s at nine in the morning, or more often, six, there’s no-one interrogating your most recent essay on the philosophical value of th century French literature, asking you questions until you can’t string two words together anymore. But for all its reputation, Cambridge is the very definition of work hard, play hard. I would study for eight hours every day and despair that no matter how much time I spent, it was never enough. But then there were the formals, the balls, the nights out with friends that made it all worth it. My college became my family, and its people my community. McDonald’s is tougher than an Oxbridge degree. It is bone-wearying, relentless, and without any of the fun. But it also taught me to be grateful for every penny I have, and to appreciate the degree that enables me to do what I love. And no Oxbridge degree could have taught me that.

If convicted, Mr Bradshaw would face a maximum of two years and a ,fine for each count. As he is facing  counts, this means he could face up to  years in prison and a fine up to a quarter of a million dollars. The pictures included naked images and often the victim’s name and other identiable information.  Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter They were posted on subreddits that had names like “HumiliatingComments”, “DegradeThisPig”, “DegradedCaptions”, “Slut”, and “needysluts”. According to legal documents, photographs of VICTIM-, as she was named, were posted in the subreddit “raceplay”. The case is being brought by the Office of the State Prosecutor which claims that Bradshaw created “multiple accounts”. The documents claimed that Bradshaw distributed the photos in dozens of posts between April and May this year. The alarm was only raised when the woman herself spotted the images online. She told police Bradshaw was the only person who she had ever shared the photos with and that she hadn’t given him permission to distribute. The document alleges that most of the images were captioned with sexually degrading and humiliating comments that included worrying personal details. It alleges some of those captions included things like “The kind of white girl [redacted] love to nut on”, and “The kind of body black men love”. Others were more explicit.  An investigation was launched and the alleged IP address where the photos were uploaded from a property owned by Bradshaw in the area. State Prosecutor Charlton T. Howard said: “Using someone’s private images without their consent is a serious breach of trust and invasion of privacy, and the power and breadth of the internet makes such a violation even more egregious. “Our office is committed to protecting victims from those who abuse their positions of power and trust.” That means Bradshaw could face up to  years behind barshe is convicted at a later date and fined up to a quarter of a million dollars. Bradshaw took office in January of this year and according to his online bio, he is the youngest mayor ever elected in the history of Cambridge.

Itaposs no secret that most dogs really arenapost a fan of having to wear medical cones to stop them biting and aggravating any injuries. And adorable Mushu, an American bully, may be one of the least fond dogs when it comes to wearing the cone though, as this amusing video shows.The clip, which was uploaded by TikTok user @mushu, shows just how nervous the dog is about wearing the cone, freezing like a statue as soon as it is put on him.  At the start of the video, Mushu shows his apprehension, initially refusing to sit still in order to be fitted with the cone. He flees to the corner of the room, but here he is stopped and the inevitability of the cone begins to set in. When Mushu pauses and allows the cone to be placed around his head, he instantly adopts a hilarious shocked-looking expression, with his eyes stuck wide open and body totally frozen. The dog refuses to move while the cone is adjusted, continuing to stare widely while remaining stf and almost stuck in place, baffled by whataposs going on. Asthe American bully’s initial reaction wasn’t enough to hammer home his dislike for the cone of shame, his refusal to even eat a treat brings home the realisation to his owner. On two occasions they attempt to give Mushu a treat, but the traumatised pup refuses to bite, simply ignoring the offer. The amusing clip was a huge hit on the video sharing , with over  million views and over . million likes. Viewers were clearly amused by Mushu’s reaction to the cone, with one user commenting: “Legend has it he never moved from that spot ever again.” A second commenter wrote: “The cone took away his ability to blink.”The TeamDogs Christmas Gt Guide, sponsored by Keep Wales Tidy, is packed with more than  treats, toys, gadgets and garments to make every dog’s tail wag with holly jolly joy on December .

But one woman on TikTok was left disappointed when she tried to get the employees at her local Starbucks to write her an uplting message to help her get through her revision session – as they appear to have totally ignored her request.The woman, who posts under the username @dahgari, ordered an iced double shot white mocha from the popular coffee chain on a delivery app which let her write a note to the employees with any additional information about her order.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. And while theis usually used for those with allergies, the woman instead asked for a pick-me-up from her barista. In the video, she showed her receipt with her message on it, which read: “I’m studying for a hard exam, can you please write something that makes me happy ” But the woman was left disappointed when her order arrived, as she found the baristas had either ignored her request or had forgotten all about it. The video included a series of broken heart emojis as the woman showed her plain coffee cup without any uplting words written on it.  And although the woman was upset about the employees deciding not to fulfil her request, commenters on the video – which has been viewed over . million times – insisted she was asking too much of the baristas who may have been extremely busy at the time. One person wrote: “Their job isn’t to decorate your cup. You realise that sometimes there’s a rush and they’re making drinks non-stop  Their job is to make your coffee.” While another said: “Can we not make service workers do emotional labour on top of how hard they work and how relatively poorly they’re paid  Not cool.” And a third agreed, posting: “They’re a barista, not a therapist.” Some other commenters defended the woman though, as they said it was unfair to get so angry at her for making a simple request. Another person commented: “If the girl started swearing or insulting the employees then you would be right to be upset. But all she did was make a video which was clearly a joke.” And someone  added: “You all are wild in the comments.

Only two of these temples have been found to date. But experts like Dr Massimiliano Nuzzolo, assistant professor of Egyptology at the Academy of Sciences in Warsaw, have spent their careers trying to discover the others. The temples were built while the pharaohs of the Fth Dynasty were still alive, with the purpose of granting them the status of god. On the other hand, pyramids were built as final resting places to ensure pharaohs were resurrected as gods in the afterle.  Experts digging north of Egyptian archaeology locality Abusir first uncovered hints that a sun temple had existed in the spot, with signs of a building having sat atop the ground. It was believed the latest sun temple uncovered was built by Nyuserre Ini, an Ancient Egyptian pharaoh and the sixth ruler of the Fth Dynasty during the Old Kingdom period. Ini ruled for about  years in the th century BC. Further investigations revealed an older building base made from mud bricks and the two-foot deep base of a white limestone pillar.Experts said this suggested the original structure was “quite impressive”, according to reports fromthe .It was fty years later that researchers uncovered more proof that the old site was a temple, digging up an array of beer jars filled with mud. Experts said the tokens would have been a ritual offering reserved for the most sacred places.  Dr Massimiliano Nuzzolo, assistant professor of Egyptology at the Academy of Sciences in Warsaw, Poland, said: We knew that there was something below the stone temple of Nyuserre, but we [didnapost] knowit is just another building phase of the same temple orit is a new temple. I have now many proofs that what we are excavating here is one of the lost sun temples. Despite the now-extensive evidence that a sun temple existed on the site, it remains a mystery who the sun temple was built for and when. It was thought likely to have been constructed for a ruler from the same time period. The Fth Dynasty pharaohs ruled for about  years - from the early th century BC through to the mid th century BC. However, only a small number of rulers had sun temples created in the name of the sun god Ra, which stood on the west bank of the Nile.

The bumper find of megalodon teeth in the Atacama desert in Chile is now one of the largest scientic collections of megalodon teeth in the world. The gnashers belonged to the megalodon, a huge prehistoric shark that was alive between  and two-million years ago.An archaeologist leading the dig said the scientically-important site has recently been plundered for rare fossils which are then flogged on the black market. [Itaposs] by far the largest shark of all time, a super predator whose wingspan is estimated to be between  and  metreslong, said Atacama Palaeontologyaposs Executive Director, Pablo Quilodran.Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter  He said: Although in Chile, fossils are protected by law, for many years one of the most spectacular localities, the Bahia Inglesa Formation, was the victim of destruction by deregulated mining operations and from looting by illegal fossil hunters. He added, however, that some of them had been ed to Chile, allowing it to build the worldaposs most impressive collection. Hundreds of teeth were found and sold internationally, but some have now been traced and ed to museums in Caldera and Santiago.  With this, we undoubtedly have one of the largest scientic collections of megalodon teeth in the world, he said. Explaining how the teeth from a marine animal were found in the middle of the desert, the expert said that this was because the sea level has changed over millions of years . This is visible not only in the abundant marine fossils found in sediments today, but also in the geomorphology of this part of the desert, where we can see natural esplanades, which are ancient marine terraces that testy to these dferent sea levels.  In short, the sea has receded, but the ground has also risen as a result of earthquakes and subduction of plates, phenomena that we Chileans know and experience so well. Quilodran said Charles Darwin reported having found some megalodon teeth during his trip to Chile in . But he added: However, the ersity and abundance is a novelty. And Quilodran also said that recent discoveries had put the total number of dferent shark species found in the area to . He said: In the case of sharks, it is not only Megalodon, we recently found a new sawshark record for the area, this adds up to more than  dferent species of shark that have been found in the sector. Quilodran explained a lot of these discoveries were down to sheer luck. He said: The interesting thing is that much of these findings are fortuitous and did not respond to systematic scientic activity.  The expert said it is good news that Chilean scientists will be able to continue scientic research due to recently created palaentology centres. The implications of the discoveries of megalodon teeth in the Atacama desert are huge for science, with Quilodran saying: The unusual abundance of megalodon remains in this part of the desert opens up expectations for new knowledge about many aspects of ancient le regarding this remarkable species of shark. For example, what and how did it eat  New estimates of body size, growth speed, whether it was solitary or gregarious, internal temperature and palaeoenvironmental data, among many other topics.  For its part, the Bahia Inglesa site also has an abundance of remains of bony fish, marine mammals, birds and even reptiles, and all the research potential to understand the evolution of a great ersity of dferent lineages of marine vertebrates is gigantic. The teeth will eventually end up in a museum, where the public will be able to view them. Quilodran reassured anyone with concerns of a megaladon making an appearance while paddling in the waves that itaposs categorically impossible for the beast to still be alive. No, the Megalodon became extinct due to possible climatic changes around  million years ago, he said.Although he did add that it is always possible to find new species and animals that have gone unnoticed by science, but at  metres long, it would be very dficult to have not detected it.Despite megalodon being the largest shark of all time, it is also still possible that an even greater predator preyed on it. Mr Quilodran said though the megaladon was a super predator - archaeologists have found a rival with similarly massive teeth. He said: This cetacean, a relative of sperm whales, is called Leviathan and its fossils have also been found on the Atacama coast, along with those of the Megalodon.

Sonya Danita, , is a content creator, body-positive activist, and standing at ft ins, is also a successful model. But her journey to fulfil her modelling dream has not been smooth sailing, to say the least. The model from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, lives with vitiligo - a long-term skin condition that leaves her body covered in pale white patches caused by the lack of melanin. Sonya developed the condition when she was eight years old when she spotted a dot on her face, which gradually spread all over her face, her hands and her legs up to her knees. Due to constant remarks on her skin, Sonya grew very self-conscious of her condition, made more so as vitiligo is a rare condition in Malaysia. She faced relentless judgment by strangers in the street who marvelled at her vitiligo. She said: I was bullied a lot for my vitiligo, a lot of people had presumptions over what I had and stared at me in the streets without shame Strangers came up to me and asked meI was a burn victim or acid victim ormy parents spilled oil on me. It wasnapost discrimination that I faced by strangers but judgement, they would just stare in this particular way. Her parents tried their hardest to find a solution to her skin condition, spending over ,on failed treatments. From ayurvedic medicine to modern medicine, to even becoming a vegetarian for two years, Sonya tried it all. The model had even suffered sunburns and peeling skin from UV light therapy. It was only until Sonya began seeing a doctor - who claimed to be injected her with natural herbs - that her skin began going back to brown. But the doctor had lied and ly claimed to be using natural herbs when in fact he was injecting Sonya with harmful steroids. She said: I started falling sick a lot and we did a blood test to find out the cause only to find out that the doctor was injecting me with steroids. After I stopped taking steroids my skin went right back to normal, it was like the steroids had pressed pause on my vitiligo nothing . But despite her hard childhood, Sonya wanted to become a model, to not only learn to embrace her vitiligo but raise awareness about vitiligo is and impact the standard of beauty in Asian Culture.  She said: I feel like itaposs very important to have these conversations because we need to pave the way for future generations Especiallywe want to create an environment which is more inclusive and more accepting and this one that does not put people into a particular box and expect them to only fit according to that box. Sonya is empowering people to know the beauty within vitiligo, speaking on the uniqueness of the condition where no two spots are the same in pattern.

Nikolett spends around €a week on the freshest raw meat to suit her unique tastes. She said: “The reason I choose to eat raw meat is really because I feel fantastic when I do. “After meals, I am less bloated and have since seen a huge increase in my body both mentally and physically. “It’s a lot easier to digest and I also really enjoy the taste.” Nikolett regularly eats raw beef, lamb and eggs in her daily diet. She said: “ I have quite a erse range of meats which I enjoy eating , as well as things like liver, heart, bone marrow and brain. “I like to have lots of dferent options to eat as I never want to restrict myself to just one or two options.” Her favourite raw meat to enjoy is a brisket, aged for two to four weeks. Nikolett added: “Dry, aged beef brisket is just incredible to eat, the flavours are so bold. “I enjoy fatty steak meat in general, and always make sure it is organic, grass-fed meat, as this ensures the flavours are better and the animal was living a better le. “The fat honestly melts in your mouth like butter.” Despite traditional information suggesting it could be harmful, Nikolett is not worried about the potential risk of food poisoning from ingesting uncooked meat. She explained: “It is not something that has ever worried me since starting this diet. “The stomach acid we produce as humans is incredibly strong, and rivals the acids produced by most predators in the wild. “I have never once gotten sick from eating raw meat and do not believe I will as long as I eat well sourced, fresh cuisine.” Although she is passionate about eating raw meat, she insists describing the flavour to non-meat eaters is a dficult process. She said: “I get asked it all the time and itaposs so hard to answer because even dferent cuts of the same animal have vastly dferent tastes, depending on the animal’s diet, gender, age, and how are they treated. “Raw beef has kind of a sweet or milky tastethe cow was grass fed, but cows raised on grains can turn the flavour of the meat almost metallic.“I describe the taste of my grass fed, locally sourced beef as all the flavours of the freshest forest, because you should be able to taste all of the natural herbs and the green plants in the animals diet.”“The best part is the fat, which seriously tastes like buttery cream.” Nikolett also prefers to eat her meat unseasoned, in order to retain as much of the natural flavours as possible.  She added: “In the beginning, I tried everything to make my meat taste similar to how it would taste after being cooked., with herbs and ious sauces. “Nowadays I rarely use only salt and pepper, as the meats adopt their own unique flavours based on their treatment. “There is a reason the best steaks are made from dry aged beef, and that is because the natural flavours are far bolder and make for a more enjoyable meal.” She sources all of her meat from small businesses in and around her hometown. She said: “As a butcher, I have the benefit of knowing all the best suppliers.  “We always try to get the best meat for our customers at our family shop, with all of our products coming from slaughterhouses in the countryside. “We don’t handle industrial processed meat in any fashion, and it is not something that I wish to have included in my own diet.” Nikolett researched the carnivore diet after suffering with PCOS syndrome, with affects the oies and causes irregular periods and hormone issues. She said: “I have insulin resistance and digestion issues as well as my PCOS, so I went to the doctor in order to find a diet which better suited my conditions. “The diet which was recommended by my doctor consisted of g of carbohydrates a day and had little to no effect on symptoms.  “Before long I was feeling even worse, but since I made the switch to raw meat I have never felt better.” Her daily routine usually consists of just two meals a day, with breakfast normally skipped. Nikolett explained: “On most days I will rarely be hungry at breakfast but try to drink water and a hot beverage without sweetener or sugar. “My main meal is lunch, where I usually eat fatty beef with eggs, with something similar for dinner in the evening, often substituting the beef for raw bacon, pork, ham, or liver. “However no two days are the same and I always just try to listen to my body, occasionally skipping dinner which often means  hours without eating.”  Nikolett occasionally eats some small fruits and vegetablesshe is craving something sweeter or flavourful. She said: “I eat things like raw garlic and onionI want a bold flavour, and blueberries, raspberries and strawberries for sweet. “I normally only resort to this when I am on my period as my body craves it, but all other times I am back to primal eating. Despite the diet only beginning last year, Nikolett has been prone to the taste of raw meat in the past. She explained, “ My family are also butchers, so throughout my childhood I was always surrounded by raw meat. “I used to eat a lot of raw sausage meat growing up, which is still something I really enjoy today. “I have also eaten a lot of carpaccio and steak tartare throughout my le, so there has always been this side of me even before I made the switch full time.” Nikolett’s International truck driver husband, Roland Kiss, , is really supportive of her unique diet. She said, “My husband supports everything I do, and he is totally fine with my diet despite him not eating raw himself. “It does however mean he gets lot of steak which I cook rare for him, and what man wouldn’t love steak every day  “I have some friends which are horried, and I have had a lot of negative feedback online, but my close friends and my family are always on my side and have come to accept I am a bit of a weirdo.”You can follow Nikolett on Instagram @keto.insulinresistance.Comment MORE ON FoodDiet\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Daniela Carreola, the woman claiming to be the man’s current girlfriend, responded in the comments. “This tattoo was done March of  before we even met. I make fun of him for it, yes, but people get tattoos of names all the time,” she wrote.

Soon afterwards, I remember going into his study, which had previously been out of bounds, and sitting in his chair, surrounded by his books, writing materials and music tapes.These were the days when combined radio and tape recorders were popular. His music tapes were in a special box, all titled in his handwriting. Hersquod recorded the music from the radio so the quality wasnrsquot brilliant.There were moments on the tapes when hersquod not switched it off quickly enough, so hersquod caught snippets of the presenter talking, and sometimes the tape had run out before the tune ended.But all this just made the tape collection a more powerful personal connection to my dad who Irsquod recently lost. So, while he had been unable to interest me in classical music while he was alive, I began to listen to his collection after his death. I would recognise tunes and was now able to put a name to them thanks to the titles hersquod written on the tapes.They conjured up memories for me. One was of a rainy Saturday afternoon in which my father invited me to join him in being the conductor for a Mozart tune. So he showed me how to conduct, leading and living the music with our arm movements. We had fun together doing this for what seemed like an hour or so in our small kitchen, as he explained the dferent instruments involved and how they merge together, and the role of the conductor. It was, in truth, a rare moment, but perhaps thatrsquos why I remembered it so vividly.It was the same Mozart tune that played on my car radio last week. It conjured another memory: of me standing in the kitchen being the conductor to the tune, alone, in the weeks after my fatherrsquos death. Irsquod found the tape and recognised the tune. I then learnt every pause, listened to the instruments and conducted to the music as my father had taught me.I didnrsquot understand it at the time, nobody spoke to me about it, but I now realise that I was in deep grief.My conducting the music was an expression of my loss, but I had nobody to talk to about it or process it I couldnrsquot allow the emotions to surface: ldquoBe strong, now you are the man of the family, boys donrsquot cry, they get on with it.My mother was stunned and closed down as well. I somehow learnt that tears, crying and being upset was something to avoid. So I buried my grief.So I did as advised, I got on with it. Irsquove done OK, I think, for I suppose when we walk with a stone in our shoe long enough we get used to it, and after a while stop noticing it. But, of course, it is still there, and only when we take our shoe off and finally find a way to remove the stone do we feel the dference and understand the effect itrsquos had on our walking.Last week was that moment for me: sitting in my car, overwhelmed with emotion from  years ago, remembering myself as a -year-old boy who felt he was unable to talk about what was then the greatest loss in his le.Irsquom a father myself now, of course, and thank goodness times have changed.There is a greater recognition these days of the need to talk, to express emotions and process feelings that our mental health is as important as our physical health, although words are often not matched with resources.But within our families also, we all need safe spaces to feel upset, let emotions surface and receive support from love ones. And that includes recognising our own mental health needs.I know most of us already know the importance of this. I certainly know it, yet despite this, I still tend to ignore the signs Irsquom struggling until my mental health is in tatters, which helps nobody.Just now my kids are having their own challenges, as so many are, and my own emotions have surfaced in my attempts to give support. The temptation was to quickly re-bury my emotions so I could concentrate on giving that support and also not let anyone down that voice is still in my head: ldquoGet on with it, man up.But that Mozart tune stopped me doing this. It made me connect with how I felt. It helped me understand why the adults close to me, when I was that -year-old boy, didnrsquot ask me how I was feeling or give me space and time to talk about my emotions and express my loss they couldnrsquot because they hadnrsquot allowed it for themselves.Mozart that day gave me the gt of self-care, which has helped me be more effective in caring and supporting loved ones, and ing at well at work.Itrsquos never easy to write about a personal vulnerability there is still that fear of ridicule. I had actually planned to write a historical tale this week, but events, and emotions, took over. There is always next time.Remembrance Day is this week, a time when we collectively pause to remember people we have lost in wars. Veterans know all about long-lasting trauma and loss, and the importance of acknowledging unseen emotional wounds.These issues can affect us all in dferent ways at dferent times. We rarely know the struggles that others are experiencing. Being kind to others includes being kind to yourself."},{"url":null,"title":"plans-360-centre-former-cockenzie-power-station-site","story":"Councillors are to be asked to approve funding for a feasibility study into the development of the proposed  Centre, a community-led initiative to create a nationally important climate change centre.The  Centre is intended to be a major attraction for East Lothian, with proposals for a signicant art installation alongside a visitor centre, education and training facilities, as well as the potential to run ferry buses along the coast and marine trips from the adjacent pier.So far, the vacant former power station site, owned by East Lothian Council, has seen planning permission granted for offshore wind farm substations.The  Centre proposal is a community-led initiative which took shape last year and has since garnered pledges of support from residents, academic researchers and renewable energy developers.An online public launch event was conducted in April to gather community views, which have been incorporated into a draft vision document.The group behind the proposed plans will continue to seek community guidance and views through a series of events and an online survey.Anna Scott, a representative from the  Centre community group, said: ldquoWe are thrilled that East Lothian Council is engaging so constructively with our proposals and are hopeful that funding for a feasibility study will be approved.ldquoThe  Centre is an ambitious project, but why should we not be ambitious for the future of our local community ldquoAs a young person growing up in this coastal community, doing something positive to address the climate crisis just feels so important, not just for the future of our area but far beyond that.ldquoThe Cockenzie site is a site of hope ndash built on coal mines which stretch out under the Forth and the site of a former coal-fired power station which can now be reimagined to tell the story of climate change and even host research into solutions.ldquoThe  Centre would include iconic new sculptures and improve access to the site and the coastal pathway, which is of course named after the East Lothian-born environmentalist John Muir.ldquoOver  years ago, John Muir was creating national parks in America and inspiring others to value the earth and the nature around us.

Younger siblings wore hand-me-down clothes that their elders had grown out of. Shopping was done on foot on a pretty much daily basis at a range of small outlets in onersquos own district. Girls were to taught to darn socks and to patch and mend. We knitted to acquire otherwise expensive pullovers, and made rugs from kits at home. At least we had a coal fire to keep us warm, evenintermittent power cuts sometimes kept us in the dark.This is what reducing demand on resources means: going without, settling for something lesser than we want, making do and mending. Reduced to our -minute neighbourhoods, restricted by the limits of public transport, our horizons will shrink, cultural le will stagnate, choices will be strictly circumscribed. This is what austerity is. This is very much the Greensrsquo prospectus, and it appears to be that being embraced also by the SNP.What the young, whose demand for new clothes, accessories and gadgets is limitless, will make of it remains to be seen. But I suspect that, after demonstrating in favour of climate change measures, when faced with austerity in reality a number of them will say, in shocked tones: \"But we didnrsquot mean it to be like this\".Jill Stephenson, Edinburgh.WE HAVE TO FIGHT INEQUALITYTHE COP Glasgow climate negotiationsrsquo tone was set by the UK Government, among those still failing to keep even the inadequate pledges made at Paris six years ago, like  billion a year from developed to developing countries to cope with the effects of climate change and afford green energy technologies. Experts say they need more like  trillion annually.The half-baked legal requirement on UK companies to make plans on how they would progress towards net zero showed a lack of serious intent. There are no dates by which they have to have reduced their net emissions by % or half or to zero. The belief that the market will sort it itself is wishful thinking.China, Russia and Indiarsquos governments certainly disappoint too. But the UK, US and most other developed-country governments have not only failed to provide the foreign aid levels required, but continue to use fossil fuels themselves. More than % of all US energy and % of total UK energy comes from fossil fuels. President Biden also refused to sign up to phasing out coal to avoid losing votes in mining state.If developed countries, who could afford the transition, havenrsquot got close yet, low and middle-income countries, where many people are a dayrsquos earnings away from starving, need more support from richer countries to do it. And no government will survive in power longthe electricity supply is cut off too often.The UK Governments welfare ldquoreforms targeting the disabled, those on low incomes, and other vulnerable groups and unwillingness to fund insulation of existing housing, also undermine public support for green reforms among low and middle income earners. As did David Cameronrsquos scrapping of supposedly ldquogreen levies on fuel bills which were mostly actually subsidising energy bills for the poorest.Itrsquos neither realistic nor fair to expect anyone to vote to make their family or population cold, hungry or homeless today for the good of all in the long run. Reducing inequality within and between countries is the only way to get majority support for the changes that are needed.Duncan McFarlane, Carluke.DO POLITICIANS DO ENOUGH THERE is another way of looking at the situation where our representatives such as Douglas Ross have multiple jobs . Personally, I have always found it dficult to be in two places at the one time. If Mr Ross can fulfil the roles of MP and MSP simultaneously and have time to run up and down the sidelines with a flag it would suggest to me that none of the jobs can be particularly onerous.If we are led to believe that elected representatives with multiple jobs can do so at no detriment to the interests of their constituents, one has to ask how those with just the one job pass the time of day  Do they just sit about twiddling their thumbs  Is being an MSP, even one who couldnrsquot convince a constituency to vote for them and gets parachuted into Holyrood as a list MSP, simply a part-time job  If that is the case, why does each MSP need an annual budget of pound, to employ support staff  Why can MPs claim pound, each year for support staffmany of them are in effect part-time MPs  I wonderMr Ross is entitled to claim support for both jobs Thatrsquos a big bag of worms to delve into but it is a pointless, futile exercise as despite the fact the we pay their wages the general public is powerless to control either Westminster or Holyrood.

For example, on Friday and again tonight , those wishing to watch Scotlandrsquos international matches on television must take out, at their own expense, a subscription to Sky Sports they do have the option, of course, of watching the England games on STV . That may well be their preference anyway. On Saturday, they may have picked up the numerous references to \"England\", rather that the UK or even Britain, during the reminiscences. Second-class citizens, or merely invisible in their own land By contrast, todayrsquos Herald highlighted the dference in performance in the expansion and electrication of the rail network in Scotland under Holyrood, to the stagnation and broken promises in England, particularly with regard to HS and the Northern Powerhouse railway . And Holyrood achieved this with a limited budget and severely circumscribed borrowing ability. I leave Unionists to draw their own conclusions.Larry Cheyne, Bishopbriggs.REVIVE GLASGOW CROSSRAIL PLANREADING Catriona Stewarts piece on plans for transport in Glasgowreminded me of the issue of travelling between Central and Queen Street railway stations.Some years ago the late Roderick McDougall and Ken Sutherland showed how a Crossrail could be constructed with just . miles of track and a station at Glasgow Cross no expensive tunnels under the Clyde required.Passengers whose final destination was Glasgow would still use Queen Street or Central, but those requiring to travel on to the other network, such as from Edinburgh to Ayrshire, or Dumfries to Fe, would change trains at Glasgow Cross instead, without the long trek or bus ride through the traffic presently required.So far, the powers that be have proved deaf to this straightforward measure which would make rail travel more attractive and thus reduce car use. With the pressing need to make travel more sustainable I hope they will change their minds.In the meantime, is it too much to ask for a safe cycle route between the two stations to be identied Jane Ann Liston, St Andrews.Read more: Now the hard work really begins"},{"url":null,"title":"scotland-women-await-clarification-2022-rugby-world-cup-qualifying-fate","story":"Bryan Eassonrsquos side do have a Final Qualication Tournament to play, which we are led to believe will take place in Dubai at some point during January or February.

I feel sheis an -year-old woman.ldquoHer achievements in the last six months have been so incredible, perhaps we could be more considerate and kind when we are talking about somebody losing a few tennis matches.

I sense every step of that journey.In , Borrodale school closed for that last time. And yet,we listen, we can still hear from Borrodale, forever young and in timeless cèilidh.Put in this kind of context we can sense how community relationships are deeply connected to change. The continuity of change, both backwards and forwards, gives us insight, and proximity with dferent and creative ways of being in place.Times change and culture continues. It is important to be hopeful in this and to not perceive the shadows of the past as a fading le force but as an index pointing to future relationships.The second social experience is of course relates to the typical excitement of guising at Oidhche Shamhna. Originally, Oidhche Shamhna was integral toour sense of place and the cultural relationships of le cycles, including time itself.Oidhche Shamhna is ‘the night of summer’s end,’ and in our older understanding of the festival, it reveals that new le begins in darkness and is born into light similarly, just as days used to begin and end at dusk, the move to the darker half of the year is also the continuation of a cycle and is equally about new beginnings.In the deeper memory of Gaelic cosmology, this is the beginning of the new year, and of course, November is still called ‘an t-Samhain’ in Gàidhlig.My earliest memories of guising would be like those of many, our dad taking my sister and I for a few easy visits to long-standing neighbours and family friends. Even though we would only go to a few houses in those early days, the intensity and excitement of the initiation on a cold dark night was largely experienced through the warmth and kindness revealed in the relationships that emerged in the evening.Guising, then, is a form of cèilidh, where the encouraging and nurturing of the gt of exchange is more intangible than we always appreciate. It is that dimension of sustaining or developing relationships that seems most important to me.One of the first homes we would have visited on my first Oidhche Shamhna will have been that of Angus and Effie Ross in Fàsach. In my early years it was a home that we probably had more time in than any house outside of my family.It was a home I visited everyday day walking home from Borrodale school. My errand was to collect our newspapers from the post office, but it wasn’t a job, it was a relationship.Our family had a strong connection with these Rosses. In , Angus Ross’ great-uncle Alexander Ross had been nominated to deliver the prepared statement for the Fàsach croftersto the Napier Commission.In it he testied specically to the clearance of my great-great-grandfather from Ramasaig , who was removed along with all the families from Ramasaig around -, to make way for sheep, congesting further the land in Fàsach. So, it is from at least that time that our family had been friends.Alexander Ross’s brother, Kenneth Ross, also Fàsach, had among his eight children a first son called Neil and a second called Norman, both being young boys during the land wars....I did know Margaret but I never did met James Ross as he had a fatal accident in the early s in Glasgow, outside the BBC.Angus Ross and Seanair worked together on the County lorry . We saw Angus and Effie a lot and my mum credits him with telling her and her siblings about their Cameron origin story in Glendale.A mysterious tale of a man with long grey hair and a beard living in a cave at Scornandaoine on the east side of Loch Poolteil. He had arrived from Lochaber, in the mid to later s, likely a refugee from any number of social problems in the Gàidhealtachd of that time.Even now it still sounds like a good Halloween story. Certainly, my mum has never been a fan of beards in the family, but we were always welcomed by the Rosses in the ceilidh ethic of everyday relationships., Tobraichean a’ Gluasad .Here, ‘Tuam’ talks about his knowledge of local wells the necessity to move between dferent wells for sustenance, and so there will be times when a well in one place becomes dry while water would be plentul in another well.A resource such as Tobar an Dualchais helps us think about our many and ied relationships with culture, place, and time.Part of the intangible gt to be found within the archives, and also with the people and places around us, is how the wells of culture will be found popping up with all their potential, anywhere and everywhere, carried through the voices and relationships we nurture and come to know.Importantly, this can activate new dialogues, experiences, and gestures of cèilidh, and to embrace these for all in our communities, our futures, wherever the wells emerge."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/20211103_133201-scaled.jpg","title":"climate action group to hold skye bridge march and vigil in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine, which formed shortly before the pandemic, is inviting people to show their solidarity with activists across the world in highlighting the need for urgent change to tackle the existential threat of climate change.Speaking to the Free Press during the first week of the COP UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, Skye Climate Action coordinator Anne MacLennan described the summit as “critically important” and was keen to emphasise that Saturday’s event should take place in a peaceful and respectable manner.#Saturday is the Global Day of Action for Climate Justice, and the themes are that we need to act, and act urgently, and there is also the huge justice issue,# she said.“The idea for the march is for us to leave the Kyleakin-end at  noon and to walk over the bridge by the pavements and walk back again.#It is really important that the event is peaceful, family-friendly, and respectful of everyone # I think it is a demonstration of the kind of society we want to head towards being, so we can live in a sustainable and equitable way. Issues of climate, bioersity, equity are all interconnected.She added: “I think it is more powerfulit is a peaceful walk.#Giving her views on the progress being made at the COP, she added: “There are some really hard-hitting things being said, so I hope the issues are getting through to people. It is important that those who are convincedcan demonstrate.#Addressing the potential for far-reaching consequences to impact people across the world, she said: #We are cushioned now to some extent, although people in the UK have had to suffer from flooding, wildfires, and drought.“Much of our food comes from overseas, andpeople will have to migrate and find somewhere  to live # so people will be moving around the world, so places that are nice and comfortable now might then receive other people.#A huge element of this issue is about all the youngsters and children # the more carbon we put into the atmosphere, the more trouble that they will have to face, meaning there will be less chance for them to turn the situation around.#This issue is critically important.”On Friday th November, as the conference is expected to be closing, there will be a candlelight vigil in Somerled Square in Portree from .-pm.Ms MacLennan added: “There is a sense that people want to show solidarity with what#s happening at COP in Glasgow, and they want to be able to express their concerns.#Holding it in Portree makes it more accessible for people in the north of the island, because Saturday#s march over the bridge is a long way for people further north to travel to be involved, especiallyit is a dreadful day.#For those unable to attend Saturday#s march over the bridge, everyone is of course welcome to walk over the bridge with signage at any point at the weekend.“It might be good for people to be wandering over the bridge to and fro at dferent times to help convey the message.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Uist-beach-Floraidh-Forrest.jpg","title":"climate change and the hebrides the rising sea and an eerily prophetic","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineFor those acquainted with Gaelic oral lore, it cannot be denied that there is something intensely perceptive, and eerily prophetic, about the traditions tied to the steady ingress of the sea.Since time immemorial, the mental record-keeping of a coastal people has documented and predicted the near imperceptible, yet near constant, rise of the waters since the Ice Age. century.In Tobar an Dualchais, there are numerous recordings illustrating similar examples where the sea has conquered the land.In one example from , Dòmhnall MacCuinn and Dòmhnall Ailean MacCuinn were recorded describing old domestic ruins seen at extreme low tides over a mile from the shore in An t-Ìochdar .These homesteads must have once been on dry land, they surmise.In Tracks   , the collector Dòmhnall Eairdsidh Dòmhnallach of the School of Scottish Studies asks Dòmhnall Alasdair Johnson about submerged places near An t-Ìochdar, including Sgeir na h-Àtha – The Skerry of the Barn.Similar shore names which incorporate terrestrial features dot the seascape of Uist and evidence the widely held belief that the machair once stretched much further into the west.Anxieties tied to coastal le were not only informed by past experience and day-to-day observation they also manested themselves in people’s visions of the future.There is a prophecy, for example, retold by Dòmhnall Alasdair Johnson in Track . It presages that the Ìochdar shoreline will soon be as far inland as A’ Bhuaile Dhubh and An Càrnan, close to where the old Church of Scotland is.He remarks that such an outcome isn’t all that farfetched, considering the severity of coastal erosion in the area.Alexander Carmichael, the folklorist and compiler of Carmina Gadelica, also published several climactic prophecies. He was fascinated by these histories and repeatedly drew attention to the submerged remains of houses, temples and tree-roots in his writings.A poem collected in Lìonacuithe in  prophesies the flooding of the Atlantic: “The walls of the churches shall be the fishing-rocks of the people, while the resting-place of the dead shall be a forest of tangles, among whose mazes the pale-faced mermaid, the marled seal, and the brown otter shall race and run and leap and gambol, like the children of men at play.”The approaching catastrophe so arrestingly depicted in this verse parallels many of the same fears voiced by coastal communities today.Indeed, such predications are the reality for hundreds of millions of people across the globe. The most recent UN report on climate change published in August  warned that we could see the ocean ascend nearly  metre by the end of the century.Such outcomes will threaten many of these societies existentially. Island nations such as the Males and Tuvalu will disappear.Cities, including New York City, Shanghai and Kolkata, will be exposed to coastal flooding by . Bangladesh could lose up to a fth of its land mass, displacing -million people. century is our frightening reality.In Scotland, low-lying areas with soft coasts of machair are particularly vulnerable, especially those at the edge of the Atlantic like Islay, Tiree and Uist.In addition to the constant erosion on the western edges of Uist, there is a further struggle in low-lying areas.Drainage is critical, as any crofter will tell you.Sufficient and well-maintained drains allow water to flow to the ocean. When there is heavy rainfall – a trend that is due to intensy in the UK in the future, drains alleviate inland flooding.In South Uist, a large drain is called a “lig”, a term associated with letting water.There are several main lige systems in South Uist and some are apparent in placenames. There is An Lige Mòr in Dalabrog, An Lige Mòr in Loch Aoineart, Loch Bun an Ligidh in Dreumasdal and Loch an Ligidh at the western terminus of Loch Bì.While the ligidhean today act as drains, most of these sizeable watercourses were likely built as canals to transport goods.This is reflected in the oral tradition of Uist that most of the machair lochs were once connected by ligidhean.In Track , Dòmhnall MacAonghais of Taobh a Deas Ghleann Dail credits the Norse with the original construction of the canals, which ran from Poll a’ Charra to An t-Ìochdar. He says that the waterways were used in place of roads. Track  runs into Track , where Dòmhnall says that there were three places where the Norse wintered their fleets, at An t-Ìochdar, An Ròdha Glas in Cill Donnain, and at Poll a’ Charra.Interestingly, these places correspond to locations where there are manmade drains running to the Atlantic Ocean.Regardless of their actual origin, which is the subject of ongoing research, the ligidhean of South Uist endure as critical infrastructure against flooding.As sea levels rise, however, the drains are rendered less effective due to the reduction in the height between the inland water table and the sea.This gets so bad during some springtides that saltwater can even flow back into the freshwater system, risking the salinisation of the ecosystem.The threat of climate change and sea-level rise unites coastal communities across the world.It is imperative that the COP debates take notice of these voices and reflect on the cumulative experience and knowledge of these societies.Gaelic is only one voice, and there are numerous other climate threads and themes, from within Tobar an Dualchais and without, which couldn’t be included into such a short article.We can only guess at the breadth and depth of information about climate change that exists in other endangered and indigenous languages across the globe.This information is not only relevant to fully understanding the crises we face they may also point to a way out of them."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4193378.jpg--.jpg?1635492771000\n","title":"frightful fun for all at hallowena 2021","story":"THE People’s Park, Ballymena will host one of the scariest nights of the year on Friday, October , from pm to .pm.The free event, organised by Mid and East Antrim Borough Council, will thrill and chill with a packed programme of spooktacular activities for your little monsters to enjoy, with a huge walking dragon, fire juggling display, a fancy dress competition, a kiddies funfair, live music from The VIPs and a spooky illumination trail.You can sink your fangs into some sweet treats or tasty hot food to beat those Halloween hunger pangs, while the fun and festivities will finish with a fangtastic fireworks finale at .pm.Why not have your own #MEAdventure in the park  Outdoor areas including the brand new play equipment will be accessible during the event and there will be a free kiddies fun fair to entertain your little terrors.Wandering ghouls and spine tingling figures will be ready to spook you at every turn with a few hair-raising special additions.Follow the extended spooky illumination trail throughout the park and bump into some familiar characters along the way!Mayor of Mid and East Antrim, Councillor William McCaughey, encouraged everyone to join in the Hallowena fun: “It is a great delight for us to be able to safely welcome our community to events this year and the Hallowena celebrations are always among the most popular on Council’s entertainment programme.“There is literally something for ghosts and goblins of all ages to enjoy on Friday  October in the stunning People’s Park in Ballymena, and I am really excited about the evening.“I am privileged to welcome everyone in our community to the park for some spooktacular fun, and I encourage those attending to observe the necessary public health guidelines so that we can protect ourselves and those around us.”There are over  off-street car park spaces within a -minute walk of People’s Park so make an evening of it with a visit to any of the fantastic shops or restaurants in the town.Parking for blue badge holders is available from pm at the People’s Park council car park off the Ballymoney Road.To help with a safe set-up of the site People’s Park will be closed to all members of the public on Friday  October until the event starts at pm.For everyone’s safety dogs, alcohol or fireworks are not permitted in the park and under s must have a responsible adult with them.Admission is free and no tickets are required.Visitors to the Hallowena event are asked to use the hand sanitisers provided and observe social distancing.

Currently, people here are not required to prove their vaccination status to enter indoor hospitality or entertainment venues.Stormont recently published a contingency plan which referred to the “potential” deployment of Covid- status certication in “higher risk settings”.Vaccine passports are in force for designated hospitality venues in Scotland and Wales, but England scrapped similar plans.Support here is particularly strong amongst the older age group, with % of over- respondents saying they believe passports should be mandatory. That falls to just over halffor those aged -.The hospitality industry is largely against any such scheme, believing the sector should not be singled out for special treatment, having already been hit hardest by Covid restrictions.Femalesare more in favour of passports than males , according to the survey.There’s a dramatic split in support for Covid passports based on political voting preferences, with only % of the DUP voters questioned believing passports should be brought in as a mandatory requirement.Over half of the DUP voters polled were opposed to any passport scheme , but support was strong from Alliance Partyand Sinn Fein supporters .The polling also suggested strong support for compulsory Covid vaccinations for healthcare workers.Over two thirdsagreed health staff vaccination should be compulsory, with only a quarteragainst.

What sort of conditions are you seeing most often A: The ED is always busy during the winter but it’s even busier this year than usual because of the surges of winter viruses. The commonest is the RSV virus, which cause bronchiolitis in small children and we’re also seeing lots and lots of other winter respiratory viruses, rhinovirus, metapneumovirus, adenovirus, all causing chesty coughs, wheezes, shortness of breath and poor feeding in lots of dferent children.Q: With so many coughs and colds, what can parents do to support their children at home and what are the signs that it’s something more serious and they should seek medical attention A: The vast majority of coughs at the moment are being caused by the viral infections that children are getting and often the cough from a viral infection can last  days, two weeks, sometimes even three weeks.Or very often they get one viral infection and recover from that one and then they get the next virus so it can feel to parents that these coughs are going on for weeks and weeks.Unfortunately with viruses, there is no treatment that makes them go away more quickly.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up The things to look out for, it depends on the age of the child, with children under two or one, we’re worried about bronchiolitis, so parents need to watch out for signs of increased work of breathing.That means breathing much faster than usual, sucking in under the ribs, sucking in at the throat or the head bobbing.The other way this can affect children is by reducing their feeding, you can imagine their airway and their nose are all clogged up, so they don’t like the bottle or the breast being put into their mouth.So,the feeding is less than two-third or half normal, then parents should seek medical advice.Q: Is it best to take your child to the pharmacist, GP or ED in these circumstances A: If your child is very unwell, and that means pauses in the breathing lasting more than  seconds, turning blue around the lips or abnormally lethargic and dficult to rouse, then parents should phone an ambulance, or take them to their nearest ED as quickly as they can.But most children will not be that unwell, they will get unwell more slowly and their options are to try and get an appointment with their own GP and our GPs are seeing young people with respiratory symptoms.If their GP isn’t available or the child is getting worse very quickly, they can come to their local ED.Q: What can parents do when their child is up all night with a cough to try and ease those symptoms A: Unfortunately the evidence is there are no treatments, no over-the-counter cough mixtures, that are effective.You can administer a little bit of paracetamol, particularly in the middle of the night,your child is distressed, keep them drinking plenty of fluids, but other than that it is just watching out for signs of more serious infection.Q: If your child has a respiratory infection, should you take them for a PCR test before contacting the GP A: I think parents should telephone their GP through the normal triage process and their GP will phone them back and discuss the clinical situation andit’s an urgent clinical situation, the GP will be able to direct the child to go immediately to the ED or may be able to bring the child up to the practice in a safe manner.Usually there isn’t time in these sort of conditions to wait for a PCR test to come back.Q: What constitutes a fever in a child or a baby and what steps a parent should taketheir child does have a fever A: A fever is a very common symptom and a common reason parents take their children to see us.There is a big dference between babies and slightly older children,your child is under three months and has a temperature more than c, then they do need to be assessed by a doctor or a nurse.Older children, it’s less concerning,the temperature is over c, it’s okay to administer a little bit of paracetamol, a little bit of Nurofen and see how they get on.If the temperature isn’t settling, or your child is becoming unwell in other ways, purple bruising rash that doesn’t disappear, abnormal sleepiness or there is a general sudden deterioration in their condition, then they need to be examined by a doctor or an experienced nurse.But most children with temperatures have a viral infection andthey respond to the paracetamol and are otherwise well, then parents should just look after them at home.Q: What can parents do to help when their children have a vomiting bug A: Again, it’s a viral infection, there is no treatment that makes it go away more quickly.Parents should offer their children small amounts of fluids more frequently and it’s really important that the fluid they’re offering the child is something containing sugar.I know we promote low sugar juices and drinks in normal circumstances, but the one exception to that is during a vomiting bug.Lots of the fruit drinks are low sugar, so something like a flat fizzy drink, or the best thing to administer is Dioralyte, although it’s quite salty and sometimes the children don’t like that. Fruit juices are also quite high in sugar.Q: Should parents encourage their children aged  to  to get the Covid- vaccine A: Yes, I think they should. We know the Covid vaccine is very, very safe in this group and we know that from the very large doses that have been administered in the US and throughout Europe.We certainly acknowledge that Covid doesn’t usually cause serious infection in children but we all know that it’s very disruptive on young people’s le in terms of sport and education and just their general socialisation.Q: Has the hospital seen any cases of children coming in having suffered adverse reactions to the vaccine A: No, we haven’t and prior to the roll-out to all  to -year-olds, we have been administering it to the clinically extremely vulnerable children for quite a few months now and we’ve had no experience of adverse reactions.It’s a very safe vaccine in this age group.Q: What can parents do to try and boost their children’s immunity to common childhood illnesses A: The lockdown last year didn’t just suppress Covid, it suppressed all of the viruses, so there are many children, particularly those under two years of age, who have not been exposed to the normal childhood viruses and that’s why this winter feels much worse for parents and it feels much worse for children’s health services because we’re seeing twice as many viruses.There are no treatments, there is no evidence base of things that can boost immune systems but we know intuitively that balanced health diet and just good exercise and keeping healthy are the best things for children.Q: What advice would you give to parents who are concerned about their children’s mental health A: It’s a worry for a lot of parents, the effect Covid has had on their young people’s mental health.Talk to your young people, discuss with them and find out what’s making them anxious andyou can work together as a family to address those issues, that’s great.If not,it’s more severe and your child has low mood or their anxiety is impacting on them, the first port of call is their GP and in severe cases, there are services available for children who have severe problems.Q: Many parents are saying they’re struggling to get an appointment with their GP and they don’t know where to turn. What is your advice A: Sometimes our GP colleagues are very, very busy, but I thinkyou are worried about your child, whether that’s a physical problem or a mental health problem, I think you just need to persist.It can be dficult to get through, butyou take the time,you persist, you will eventually get through to your own GP and they will phone you back and give you advice.Q: How do you see the hospital and children’s services coping in the coming weeks and months A: The data suggests we’re currently at the peak of the RSV virus, we anticipated this peak and we spent many weeks and months reorganising our services so we could deal with the surge and that has worked.We’ve been able to deal with the extra numbers coming to the emergency department and the increased admissions to the hospital.But we know this is going to continue through the winter and that our staff and our systems are going to be under pressure for many more months to come.Q: Are things going to improve slightlywe have reached the peak A: No, I suspect the other viruses will increase as the RSV virus decreases and it will fluctuate all winter and we haven’t yet seen a peak in the flu infection which does affect young people and it affects the busyness of our services, we’re anticipating a surge of the flu virus.We’re expecting it to be a relatively busy flu season because of the lack of exposure in recent years, but there is flu vaccine available and it’s really important that young people take up that option when it’s offered to them through the schools.Again, it is a very, very safe vaccine that has been administered many, many hundreds of thousands of times.Most ReadQuestions mount for BBC after Donna Traynor’s surprise departureBBC NI’s Donna Traynor quits: Legal matters prevent presenter from explaining ‘leaving the job she loves’Meet scissor-happy siblings who form one of the biggest hairdressing families in Northern IrelandViewers and colleagues hail ‘professional, reassuring and warm’ Donna TraynorUVF Belfast Shankill march policing ‘appropriate and proportionate’: PSNITop VideosPlayFather appeals for information after murder of Jake Bailey-SloanPlaySpectacular Derry Christmas house lights draws crowdsPlayWhen should I take my child to AE  Latest HealthWatch: Inside the Elk teen disco linked to  Covid cases and  more self-isolatingFamily of well-known NI businesswoman who died from rare blood disorder urge public to donate plateletsMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averageHospital AE capacity emergency in NI ‘a very real possibility’DUP ministers should not be ‘driven by ideology’ on Covid passport proposal, warns Naomi LongLatestUK Government has not resiled from stance over NI Protocol – DonaldsonConcern over ‘alarming’ rise in obesity in primary childrenFirst atlas printed in Islamic world sold for four times its estimate at auctionGraeme Jones to stay on Newcastle’s coaching staff under Eddie HoweBoris Johnson stands firm to Greek PM over the Parthenon Marbles,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Alliance having been calling for weeks for a mandatory certication system as a way to make venues safer and drive up vaccination uptake rates.The two main parties in the Executive – the DUP and Sinn Fein – had resisted those calls for compulsory passports, instead expressing a preference for a “partnership approach” with the hospitality industry.The intervention by Ulster Unionist minister Mr Swann has shted the dynamic within the Executive.Sinn Fein deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill responded to his announcement on Monday by making clear her party would follow the advice of health officials on the matter.The position of the DUP will therefore prove pivotal in determining whether the system will be introduced.If the DUP opposed the move it could potentially block the proposal by deploying a cross-community voting mechanism.If the party opposed it but did not deploy that mechanism, the support of the other four Executive parties would be enough to see mandatory passports

earlier  Making certication a legal entry requirement for hospitality venues has been credited with driving up vaccination rates among young people in the Irish Republic.North of the border, the Executive has recommended that nightclubs and other venues carry out Covid entry checks and an official app has been developed to enable people to show proof of their vaccine status.However, a majority of ministers have so far resisted calls to make it a legal requirement of entry.SDLP minister Nichola Mallon, a vocal advocate of mandatory certication, said the region’s hospitals were at “breaking point”.“For me, this is long overdue and I think it really is a right and responsible thing,” she told BBC Radio Ulster.“And I hope that all of the Executive can examine the evidence and that we can agree this and get moving on it extremely quickly.”Alliance minister Naomi Long questioned why passports were not made mandatory when social distancing rules were lted in the hospitality industry at the end of October.“It does beg the question, I have to say, as to what has gone wrong, given that we were given assurance at that time by the Health Minister that doing this on a voluntary basis would be adequate and that we’ve been told since that venues have been complying with that,” she told the BBC.Mrs Long said she would not support compulsory passports for accessing public services.“But I think when you’re talking about areas of le which are optional it is reasonable, particularly where there is no social distancing possible,” she said.Asked about the prospect of the DUP opposing the move, Mrs Long said decisions should not be taken on the basis of “ideology” rather on how best to relieve pressure on the health service and save lives.Mr Swann has said,approved, he would like to see the mandatory system being rolled out as soon as the legal regulations were in place – a process he said would take between two to three weeks.He acknowledged there would be a need for engagement with the hospitality sector in the interim.The deaths of a further five patients who had previously tested positive for Covid- in Northern Ireland were reported on Tuesday along with another , positive cases of the virus.On Tuesday morning, there were  Covid-positive patients in hospital, with  in intensive care.Most ReadQuestions mount for BBC after Donna

FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueAn all Ireland Women#s forum has heard how the pandemic increased pressure on women on issues like domestic violence, childcare and isolation. Allan PrestonTwitterEmailNovember   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailAn all-island women’s forum has discussed the disproportionate impact of the pandemic on women from both sides of the border.Those taking part in the online event heard how the impact of Covid- made many problems worse for women in areas like employment, childcare, rural isolation or being at greater risk of domestic violence.Among the speakers was Sarah Mason, CEO of Women’s Federation Northern Ireland.She said women’s refuges felt “totally ignored” by government during the worst days of the pandemic and that lockdown remained a way of le for those trapped in abusive relationships.“Last March when we were told by the British Prime Minister ‘Stay home, save lives,’ that statement didn’t resonate with the women that we work with and support,” Ms Mason said.She said % of her organisation’s work is done face-to-face, and by March  last year women’s refuges were full.“We weren’t given key worker status, we were totally ignored, we had to fight for everything we got,” she added.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “We kept those refuges open, they never closed. We had to get permission to get into our cars and go to the refuges.”This was occurring as domestic violence incidents were escalating, with police contacting Women’s Federation to ask how to get women into refuges.“We had to set up a weekly meeting with police and set up crash pads because most of our refuges are communal living.”She added: “It was all fought for because we were forgotten, meanwhile you had the Westminster government identying £m for domestic abuse during Covid.“I don’t know where it went in the Irish sea, there must be a big pile of money in the bottom of it.“These initiatives come through and by the time they are put through the Barnett Formula...we did not get any major income increase for dealing with Covid.”She said there was also no major funding available to help increase online support.“We gave a major paper to our Executive Office, to the then First and Deputy First Ministers - Arlene Foster and Michelle O’Neill - we got to meet with them on Zoom.“There was all of this ‘yes we’ll do this, we’ll do that.’ It didn’t happen. So Women’s Aid had to put in the biggest contingency plans that we’ve ever had in our over  year history.”She said the support of local sports clubs and fundraisers had been a leline.While distributing items like food parcels or books for children during lockdown, she said it also provided an opportunity to check in with women to make sure they were safe.“One statement that I did hear early on was when theannouncement was first made, that her abusive partner turned to her and said ‘now let the fun begin, you’ve nowhere to run now.’“That was a feeling right across the whole of the country, people thought we were shut.”Many services were forced to move online although refuges remained open.An advertising campaign had been launched to say help was still available, with the message being that lockdown was something some women experienced their whole le.“There were restricted in who they saw, who they talked to, their phone was monitored, their relationship with family was destroyed through coercive control,” Ms Mason said.“It’s still too soon to even assess the impact...our outreach and floating support is inundated at the moment because women coming through lockdown highlighted a lot of serious situations.”Most ReadQuestions mount for BBC after Donna Traynor’s surprise departureBBC NI’s Donna Traynor quits: Legal matters prevent presenter from explaining ‘leaving the job she loves’Meet scissor-happy siblings who form one of the biggest hairdressing families in Northern IrelandViewers and colleagues hail ‘professional, reassuring and warm’ Donna TraynorUVF Belfast Shankill march policing ‘appropriate and proportionate’: PSNITop VideosPlayFather appeals for information after murder of Jake Bailey-SloanPlaySpectacular Derry Christmas house lights draws crowdsPlayWhen should I take my child to AE  Latest Northern IrelandDUP leader says he retains ‘open mind’ to vaccine passport proposalCovid passports NI: DUP’s Sammy Wilson blasts plan as ‘unacceptable step towards unwarranted state control of people’s lives’Government asked to review security for NI Health Minister after online threatsFamily of Portadown murder victim Jake Bailey-Sloan make an emotional appeal for witnesses to come forwardDiverting departmental funds to health budget ‘not sustainable in long term’LatestBoris Johnson stands firm to Greek PM over the Parthenon MarblesTaoiseach says Ireland must act against Covid surgeMurder victim’s missing clothes a matter of deep regret, says BBCUK Space Command criticises Russia after anti-satellite missile testCharles and Camilla visit site of Jesus’s baptism,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The poll asked voters of each of the five main parties, “The Police Service of Northern Ireland is  years old this year. In this context would you personally consider a career in the PSNI and or support, or at least ‘be okay ’ with a family member considering a career in the PSNI”.Recent figures show of the  officers recruited in , three quarters  were Protestant and just %were Catholic.Earlier this month, the PSNI launched a new recruitment drive. One of its priorities is to increase Catholic officer numbers.The PSNI is hoping to hire  student officers in its latest recruitment campaign.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Alliance Party voters ed one of the highest rates of support for the PSNI, with % saying they would consider or support a family member considering a career in policing.Just % said they would not, with % undecided.Ulster Unionist Party voters showed the greatest level of support for the force, % saying they would personally think about joining or support a family member considering a career in the PSNI. However, % answered no to the question while % were undecided or didn’t have any opinion.DUP voters had greater numbers of people saying they would not support a career in policing. Of the party’s voters polled by Lucid Talk, % said they would not join or support a family member who wanted to join the PSNI.Just % of the party’s voters polled said they would consider a career in policing or a support a relative who wanted to join the PSNI.While no reason is given, the poll figures may have been impacted by recent allegations of two-tier policing by loyalists. Just % of the party’s supporters said they didn’t know or had no opinion on the matter.In April of this year loyalists rioted across Northern Ireland, with disturbances in Antrim and the Shankill Road area of Belfast. The decision not to prosecute any member of Sinn Fein in relation to the Bobby Storey funeral was cited as sparking the violence. The then DUP leader Arlene Foster called for the Chief Constable to resign as a result of unionist anger at police handling of the funeral.Across the political spectrum, some % of those asked the question indicated support for the PSNI by replying ‘yes’ with % answering ‘no’ and % either not sure or not having any opinion on the subject.Of the two main nationalist parties, SDLP voters indicated most support for the PSNI, with % answering ‘yes’ to the policing question. Those who said they would not support a career in policing amounted to around a thirdof the party’s voters polled, with a further % undecided.Sinn Fein politicians attended a PSNI recruitment event for the first time in . Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill and Policing Board member Gerry Kelly attended the event in what was seen as an open show of support for the force.In a recent interview with the Belfast , North Belfast MLA Mr Kelly said: “People have come to me, and there has been a number, looking for assistance to join the PSNI and I have assisted them.”However, he added that the build-up to republicans endorsing policing reforms was a “dficult” one. That appears to be reflected in the Lucid Talk results, with just % of SF voters polled saying that they would consider a career in policing or support a relative who wanted to join.Republicanism’s dficult relationship with the police, despite the Patten reforms, was demonstrated by nearly halfsaying they would not consider a career in policing or support a relative in joining the PSNI.

So I don’t think that Cambo should get the green light.”If we are serious about averting climate catastrophe and accelerating a just transition to a green economy, Cambo cannot go ahead.Following #COP and intense public campaigning, it’s welcome that @NicolaSturgeon is now opposed to Cambo. My question in @ScotParl today 👇 pic edtmQPHS— Monica Lennon MSPNovember , However she stressed it was the UK Government that has final approval on the development, saying by calling for its reassessment she had “set out a process by which a dferent decision could be arrived at”.The First Minister said: “I have set out a proposal  for a climate assessment and I think the presumption would be that Cambo couldn’t and shouldn’t pass any rigorous climate assessment.”Labour’s Monica Lennon had raised the issue in Holyrood on Tuesday, telling the First Minister: “There is no rigorous climate change test that Cambo can possibly pass, so the First Minister must do more than ask the UK Government to simply reassess the proposed oil field.”She urged Ms Sturgeon to “oppose Cambo in the strongest possible terms and provide the political leadership that has been lacking”.Ms Sturgeon’s comments were welcomed by environmental campaigners, with Mary Church, of Friends of the Earth Scotland, saying: “We welcome the First Minister’s acknowledgement that there is no credible climate test that the Cambo oil field could ever pass.It is very welcome that @NicolaSturgeon has admitted there is no credible climate test that the Cambo oil field could ever pass. Huge well done to all those people  organisations who have been pushing for @scotgov to join the #StopCambo campaign. 👏 pic TPjEBH— Friends of the Earth Scotland 🌎November , “This is an important progression of the Scottish Government’s position, which must now translate into clear opposition to all new fossil fuel projects.”Sam Chetan Welsh, political adviser to Greenpeace UK, said: “We welcome the First Minister showing leadership, listening to the science and saying no to the Cambo oil field, which has no place in the transition to Scotland’s low-carbon future.“Hopefully this, on top of the many similar comments from scientists, energy experts and leaders around the globe, claries the situation for the Prime Minister.”But the Scottish Conservatives accused the First Minister of having “fully abandoned Scotland’s oil and gas industry”.Holyrood energy spokesman Liam Kerr said that the move was a “desperate bid” to please the Greens, who are in a co-operation agreement with the Scottish Government.I don’t think we can go and continue to give the go-ahead to new oil fieldsFirst Minister Nicola SturgeonMr Kerr said: “Egged on by Labour, Nicola Sturgeon confirmed that she is against the Cambo field and the thousands of Scottish jobs it would protect.“By refusing to back the Cambo development, the SNP have deserted the industry they once cited as the cornerstone of their economic case for independence.“Only the Scottish Conservatives are resolute in standing up for the livelihoods of oil and gas workers in Scotland as we transition to net zero.”But Scottish Greens climate spokesman Mark Ruskell welcomed the “clarity from the First Minister”.He added: “She is absolutely right that expanding oil and gas is folly during the pressing climate crisis. That’s why with Greens in government Scotland is investing in the alternatives, expanding renewable energy and decarbonising homes and transport, creating new jobs along the way.”Industry body Oil and Gas UKsaid however that without the Cambo development the UK would need to import oil and gas from other countries – giving it a bigger carbon footprint.OGUK external relations director Jenny Stanning said: “While we are accelerating greener energies to help ensure Scotland achieves net zero by , we’ll still need oil and gas as those technologies are scaled up, to avoid the lights going out.“Stopping our own production means we’d simply have to import it from Russia, Qatar and other countries at a bigger cost to the taxpayer, jobs and the environment.“All identied oil and gas fields like Cambo are already accounted for in the net zero plans laid out by the Climate Change Committee, Oil and Gas Authority and Office for Budget Responsibility.” Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletter Receive todays headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.

Flynn is a Psychology student at Queen’s University, Belfast. We were highly impressed by Flynn’s commitment to his studies, his family and his community.” The bursary scheme was established in  in memory of Patricia Hughes, a well-known teacher at St. Columb’s College. Highlighting the signicance of the bursary scheme, Patricia’s sister, Mary Delargy, said: “After Patricia’s death in , we wanted to do something positive to continue her work as a pastoral leader in St. Columb’s. “Patricia was an extremely dedicated teacher and always went above and beyond for all of her students. In  we established the Patricia Hughes Bursary Scheme. “The bursary provides pound each year for a pupil from a low-income family to support them through their time at university.” “Flynn is a fantastic ambassador for the Bursary Scheme. Flynn has already done a substantial amount of voluntary work to support his community and we were immediately struck by his commitment to the values of the bursary scheme. We are looking forward to working with Flynn over the coming months and years. “We are so appreciative to the Bursary Committee and the wider school community for sustaining the bursary over the past few years. “Family, friends as well as former staff and pupils have contributed signicantly to the bursary and, in doing so, kept Patricia’s memory alive. We know she would be deeply proud of the work being done in her name.” Paacutedraig Delargy, Patricia’s nephew, outlined the success of the bursary to date: “Since  there have been five recipients of the Bursary scheme. “Having finished university myself in , I know first-hand the economic pressures of third level education. The Bursary offers a chance to alleviate some of that burden and recognises the outstanding contributions the boys have made to their school and wider community.” Two of the pupils who have benefitted from the bursary,Odhraacuten McGlinchey andBilly Quigley, recently took part in a video describing Ms Hughes and how the bursary has helped them. Odhraacuten said: “It takes the stress off the bills -it wasn’t for the Bursary, I don’t know what I would do.” Remembering Ms Hughes, Billy said: “My first thought is she always had a happy aura around her. That made her really approachable. There were a few times when I was struggling and I came to Miss Hughes and she was always willing to lend a hand.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Police are appealing for any information regarding the dead man found at his home in the Moss Park area of Derry on Friday, November , Local NewsArrests made after -year-old man found dead in Moss Park overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Kevin Lynchs Stars in Your Eyes Event \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Kevin Lynchs Stars in Your Eyes Event  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Snow possible with Ireland on weather alert for cold snapWeatherSnow possible with Ireland on weather alert for cold snap overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The PSNI have arrested a man on suspicion of arsonLocal NewsRathmore Road fire: -year-old man arrested overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Ms McLaughlin said:“My thoughtstodayare with victims and survivors of these horric institutions who are hopefully finally at the beginning of the end of a very long road. While theJoint First Ministersannouncement is welcome, I still have a number of serious concerns about how the recommendations of the Truth Recovery Design Panel will be delivered. “We have repeatedly seen in the past how the Executive Office and Joint First Ministers have struggled with delivery and there can be no delay on an issue of this importance. Nearly five years on from the Hart report, victims of historic institutional abusein childrens homesare still waiting for payments, an apology and a memorial and this cannot be the case for survivors of mother and baby homes. Both of these matters must be expediated as a matter of the utmost importance. “In both cases the institutions responsible for this abuse must be compelled to fit the bill and compensate victims, they have been guilty of the worst abuses imaginable against vulnerable people and cannot expect others to pick up the pieces.  “I am also concerned that the legislation to establish the public inquiry cannot be introduced in this mandate.

The families are hoping to raise as much money as they can for Foyle Hospice and HURT, an addiction services charity in the city. After the popularity of last year’s lights, which were put up in a bid to cheer everyone up during lockdown, the neighbours decided to go bigger and better this year. People across Derry are heading down to feast their eyes on the amazing winter wonderland display. Laura Meehan, a resident of Racecourse Drive, said she and all the neighbours love the buzz on the street. “There’s always been a couple of houses on the street that have been heavily decorated. Then more and more neighbours asked for theirs to be done. “So, this year, back in January, we all said we would do a big fundraising event this year. There is a donation box in the centre of the street and all the money is counted and split evenly at the end of the night. “You don’t have to pay to see the street, but you can donate in the wee box. We just ask that cars drive slowly because there are kids running around the street. “From five o’clock onwards, the street does not empty but the atmosphere is brilliant. All the neighbours and kids are running around the street. A woman at the top of the street was even making hot chocolates the other night. So many people came down to see the street last year and this year has been really busy already. I think it’s only going to get bigger each year. “This street is the beststreet to live on, everyone is so friendly and looks after each other. It is so lovely and we are so proud.” Residents are askingany companies could please donate selection boxes for when Santa visits throughout December.

Adam said: “Anyone can attend, we wont be charginganentrance fee on the night but there will be donation buckets placed within the stadiumanyone wants to throw in change. “The decision to organise a match has been a burning one for a while as it has been an idea where Iknew that I wanted to get friends and family involved but I guess time ticks on and on, and you keep putting it back. “A fire was lit when I kept seeing the Sands Maiden City team getting games and coming togetherso I thought, before  is out, Ill make the effort and why not have it at a stadium like theBrandywell, under the lights at Christmas. “The teams are made up of dads, uncles, brothers and friends who have sadly lost a little one in their le.Cahir’s Warriors versus Sands United. “Melissa Crockett co runs the Sands team and once Imentioned it, she was all over it. She has been a great help. She has even roped in the ex-Derry manager, Declan Devine, for a penalty shoot-out competition at half time where people can enter for a prize at the end. “We have many items that we will be raffling off and there are some fantastic prizes on offer from signed sports memorabilia to nights away and glamping hotel vouchers and meals. “Many businesses have donated during the process which is still in operation. “There is also hopefully going to be a visit from the main man himself, Santa. I would love to fill theBrandywellthe best I could but I mainly ask as many to attend for a family evening where Iaim to make it fun, even for those not playing. “There are World Cup finals, there are Champions League finals, FA cups, but they don’t get much better or bigger than this one.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Police are appealing for any information regarding the dead man found at his home in the Moss Park area of Derry on Friday, November , Local NewsArrests made after -year-old man found dead in Moss Park overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Kevin Lynchs Stars in Your Eyes Event \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Kevin Lynchs Stars in Your Eyes Event  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Snow possible with Ireland on weather alert for cold snapWeatherSnow possible with Ireland on weather alert for cold snap overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The PSNI have arrested a man on suspicion of arsonLocal NewsRathmore Road fire: -year-old man arrested overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm. When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny. The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Police are appealing for any information regarding the dead man found at his home in the Moss Park area of Derry on Friday, November , Local NewsArrests made after -year-old man found dead in Moss Park overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Kevin Lynchs Stars in Your Eyes Event \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Kevin Lynchs Stars in Your Eyes Event  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Snow possible with Ireland on weather alert for cold snapWeatherSnow possible with Ireland on weather alert for cold snap overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The PSNI have arrested a man on suspicion of arsonLocal NewsRathmore Road fire: -year-old man arrested overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ieADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Police are appealing for any information regarding the dead man found at his home in the Moss Park area of Derry on Friday, November , Local NewsArrests made after -year-old man found dead in Moss Park overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Kevin Lynchs Stars in Your Eyes Event \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Kevin Lynchs Stars in Your Eyes Event  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Snow possible with Ireland on weather alert for cold snapWeatherSnow possible with Ireland on weather alert for cold snap overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The PSNI have arrested a man on suspicion of arsonLocal NewsRathmore Road fire: -year-old man arrested overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

The general reaction to the outcome of COP has been one of frustration – one that Mr Eastwood echoes. India and Chinas fudge on the issue of phasing out coal use angered many and the Foyle MP warned that the move by those two nations has put a constraint on the main of saving the planet. He said: “While a number of welcome measures have been agreed following COP I cannot help but feel the overall sense emerging from the conference is one of failure, frustration and missed opportunity. “The decision to concede to India and China’s demand to phase down, rather than phase out coal is inconceivable. Burning fossil fuels is one of the key contributors to the climate crisis due to the amount of carbon emissions they produce. “While stopping using them completely won’t be easy, it’s the only choice we havewe are going to save our planet. “This COP also failed to adequately address the destruction taking place in our poorer and developing countries as a result of the climate crisis. If we are going to get to grips with tackling these issues then our leading nations must provide support to those with less resources and major corporations must adopt climate friendly practices or face the consequences. “The chance for world leaders to agree a radical worldwide plan to tackle the climate crisis has been blown – but hope is not lost. Its been heartening to see the strength of will that exists to tackle this issue, particularly from our young people. “For too long our politicians have ignored the climate crisis raging all around us and COP has put it at the centre of public discourse. “Real climate action won’t be easy, we will all be required to change the way we live, but there is no alternative and we must take the wins that were secured in Glasgow and push for further movement ahead of COP in Egypt. “The SDLP will continue to fight to ensure that the climate crisis remains the uppermost concern at both Westminster and in the Assembly. “I am currently bringing forward a bill at Westminster which will force the British government to declare a climate emergency, bring forward the date to achieve net zero emissions, introduce a strategy to achieve new green jobs, guarantee a just transition and create a green corporate levy on large companies to help fund climate action. “It’s a matter of deep regret that the North is currently the only part of these islands without dedicated climate change legislation and targets and that must be immediately addressed.”  Arrests made after -year-old man found dead in Moss Park     Mary Robinson hits out at shameful dereliction of duty on climate change     Put your thinking COP on -

If The Starjets sound familiar to those of a certain age, then they should as they were part of the Norths punk-scene in the late s with the band being contemporaries of Stf Little Fingers and Derrys own The Undertones. The Belfast quartet scored a hit in  with “War Stories” – a song covered by multi-million selling US rock band, Green Day last year which propelled The Starjets back amongst the big time. Their song about Lyra, who was killed in  when covering a riot in the Creggan area of Derry, is the fourth song in a tribute to women who were killed while still young – the other three being about journalist Veronica Guerin, Princess Diana and Palestinian rights activist Rachel Corrie. While singer and guitarist, Paul Bowen, hopes to get the song out to a wider audience, there is one person he hopes the song will reach – Sara Canning who was the late Lyras partner. Paul said: “I wrote this song of May , a month after Lyra was killed.  The Starjets perform a live version of Legendary Girl, a song about journalist Lyra McKee who was killed in Derry two years ago “Its part of a four-song cycle about women who were murdered or died in a tragic accident – two of them being about Irish journalists. “Lyra being one and Veronica Guerin being the other. The other two women were Princess Diana and Rachel Corrie. “The song about Lyra has received a huge amount of radio interest all over the world in places like Australia, Germany, Holland, Calornia and the UK itself. Its sitting high in two of the UKs independent charts. “The song about Lyra is up against some strong competition in the Heritage Chart. “Were up against Rod Stewart, Diana Ross and Billy Idol – we are minnows compared to them. “Were a small band from Belfast – a blip on the horizon – from the old punk era. “There was an exceptional turn of events during lockdown last year when Green Day recorded one of our songs, War Stories, which we had a minor hit with back in .  The Starjets on BBC show, Top Of The Pops, in  performing War Stories which was covered by Green Day last year “A tsunami of goodwill came our way after that. We didnt think anybody knew who we were but theres emails coming in and posts being put up on social media. “The former Radio  DJ, Mike Read – who had championed us back in the day – phoned me up and askedI had any songs as he had started the Heritage Chart for older artists who do not get played on commercial daytime radio as much. “I said I had a song about George Best, called Geordie Best and I sent it to Mike and it reached number one in that chart back in January. “Im grateful for that and Im also very grateful for all the interest the song about Lyra McKee has generated. “One of my main goals was to get the song to Lyras partner, Sara Canning because I think she would appreciate it – I hope she would. “I didnt know Lyra personally but I knew of her. I knew she signed a deal with a Faber  Faber and that she was high-profile. “Apart from the film that has just been shown at the Belfast Film Festival, theres very little footage of her. Her le was so short.”  Paul Bowen and Terry Sharpe, right, still rocking with The Starjets having first burst onto the scene in the late sADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Police are appealing for any information regarding the dead man found at his home in the Moss Park area of Derry on Friday, November , Local NewsArrests made after -year-old man found dead in Moss Park overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Kevin Lynchs Stars in Your Eyes Event \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Kevin Lynchs Stars in Your Eyes Event  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Snow possible with Ireland on weather alert for cold snapWeatherSnow possible with Ireland on weather alert for cold snap overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The PSNI have arrested a man on suspicion of arsonLocal NewsRathmore Road fire: -year-old man arrested overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, Alderman Graham Warke, will take part in the parade which will light up the city centre as it passes through. He will be joined by a number of festive characters and Christmas themed mobile installations. “I am really excited to take part in the parade and see our beautul city lit up for the first time,” he said. “The route is extended around the city centre so that everyone will have their opportunity to see Santa and the characters and you can pick your viewing spot along the route rather than gathering in one place.  Santa Claus, along with an unusually long-eared Mayor Graham Warke, promote Derrys Christmas programme “After last year’s virtual programme, it is particularly pleasing to allow people to attend the switch-on in person again and Council’s maintenance and electrical teams have been working hard this week to ensure the city is looking resplendent on Sunday evening.” The full parade route for Sunday is Bishop Street, The Diamond, Ferryquay Street, Newmarket Street, Orchard Street, Foyle Street, Foyle Embankment, City Hotel Roundabout , Strand Road, Waterloo Place and Custom House Street.

Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, Alderman Graham Warke, will take part in the parade which will light up the city centre as it passes through. He will be joined by a number of festive characters and Christmas themed mobile installations. “I am really excited to take part in the parade and see our beautul city lit up for the first time,” he said. “The route is extended around the city centre so that everyone will have their opportunity to see Santa and the characters and you can pick your viewing spot along the route rather than gathering in one place.  Santa Claus, along with an unusually long-eared Mayor Graham Warke, promote Derrys Christmas programme “After last year’s virtual programme, it is particularly pleasing to allow people to attend the switch-on in person again and Council’s maintenance and electrical teams have been working hard this week to ensure the city is looking resplendent on Sunday evening.” The full parade route for Sunday is Bishop Street, The Diamond, Ferryquay Street, Newmarket Street, Orchard Street, Foyle Street, Foyle Embankment, City Hotel Roundabout , Strand Road, Waterloo Place and Custom House Street.

Available exclusively in Attitude Black paintwork, the new Sport Black Edition brings a distinctive sporty look to Toyota’s fth-generation RAV, and is available in front-wheel-driveguise only.     However, for buyers looking for the added security of an all-wheel-drivedrivetrain in their new RAV, there is the option of AWD in Sol, Sport and Platinum iants, while the entry-level Luna model is FWD only.Petrol Electric PowertrainLike every iant in the RAV range, the Sport Black Edition is powered by a .-litre four-cylinder petrol-electric hybrid powertrain, which produces bhp and Nm of torque and enables the five-seat family SUV to sprint from -km h in just over  seconds. Standard across the entire RAV range is a suite of safety features which offer maximum protection for all occupants, while providing the RAV driver with the latest technology in driver assistance systems.     Collectively called Toyota Safety Sense  , features include Pre-Collision Assistance , Speed Assistance , Lane Keepingand Automatic High Beam Assist.Gracious Exterior, Spacious InteriorThe exterior design of the new RAV is more appealing and less anonymous that its predecessor, and this is gained by way of boxy wheel arches, a squared-off nose with a large grille, and angular edges and creases in the bodywork. I feel that Toyota has done a great job of making the new RAV look and feel more ‘premium’ than ever, while also offering more interior space than any of its predecessors.Cabin quality is exceptional, with sturdy and durable materials used throughout, while overall passenger space is generous in every respect. This has been made possible by placing the front and rear axles mm further apart than before, and even tall adults will be able to sit in the rear seats comfortably, with plenty of legroom and headroom on offer.The RAV’s battery is located under the floor, but its boxy dimensions help to hide it well, with a slightly higher boot floor the only clue to what lies beneath.Compared to its predecessor, the RAV’s boot capacity has grown to -litres , with a massive ,-litres available when the rear seats are folded down.The RAV was awarded a full five stars by Euro NCAP in  and that was thanks in part to an upgrade to the second-generation of Toyota Safety Sense for the latest model.Test CarMy test car was a RAV Sport Black Edition which drew lots of admiring glances due to its terric road presence and distinctive design details.An impressive array of standard equipment includes TEX leather black upholstery with heated front seats, powered driver seat, auto-dimming interior mirror, front and rear parking sensors, rear view camera, auto lights and wipers, LED front light guide with daytime running lights, LED projector headlights, electrically operated boot door, ” Toyota Touch multimedia system, dual zone climate control, rear privacy glass, satellite navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, black headliner cloth, paddle sht, light blue ambient lighting, and illuminated entry along with many more comfort, convenience, safety and infotainment features.As is the case across all models in the RAV line-up, fuel consumption as low as .l km is achievable on a WLTP combined driving cycle, while Co emissions of between  and g kmensures low annual road tax in addition to low overall running costs.Toyota’s advanced hybrid technology ensures that the RAV’s petrol engine and electric motor combine seamlessly to deliver extra performance and outstanding fuel efficiency, while remaining ultra-smooth and extremely quiet when driving in electric mode.Toyota claim that up to % of the time you drive a Toyota Hybrid, you are in electric mode, with the added advantage that you never have to plug the car in to charge the battery.Toyota’s self-charging hybrid harvests the energy normally lost from deceleration and braking into a small battery. This unit doesn’t have enough capacity to propel the RAV alone for any considerable distance, but it does offer the convenience of being able to charge itself without any input from the driver.The RAV sits on Toyota’s New Global Architecture, which is also used in the Toyota Prius, C-HR and Corolla models. It brings big benefits in ride and handling, with more sophisticated suspension than the old model, so the RAV is capable of turning into corners with a surprising amount of poise and precision, with plenty of grip while resisting dramatic levels of body lean.The RAV’s CVTtransmission is smooth and slick in its operation, while a well-insulated cabin ensures that on-road refinement is top class. When travelling through towns and cities at low speed, the RAV’s electric motor is barely audible, with the engine shutting off entirely when stationary in traffic. At motorway cruising speeds, the RAV settles into a quiet hum, with only small amounts of tyre and wind noise getting through to the cabin.Verdict, Cost and WarrantyWith its unique and distinctive modern styling, faultless build quality, impressive tally of standard equipment and frugal petrol electric hybrid technology, the new RAV has all the necessary ingredients to comfortably fulfil the needs of a growing family.The new RAV Sport Black Edition represents great value. The new Toyota RAV is backed by a three-year ,km warranty, along with a five-year ,km warranty on hybrid components.Additionally, a hybrid battery warranty of up to an incredible -years is available upon completing an annual hybrid health check through Toyota’s nationwide dealer network.

Hyundai’s newest offering is an appealing small SUV, which slots into position between the new i and new Kona in terms of its exterior dimensions.  googletag.cmd.push   Hyundai claim that the Bayon is a ‘small on the outside, big on the inside’ urban crossover SUV that is designed to make a lasting impression. Boasting best-in-class safety and connectivity features, the Bayon comes with lots of smart technology as standard.     Eye-Catching ProportionsWith its sharp lines and eye-catching proportions, the new Bayon really stands out from the crowd. Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.     The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads. A precise steering response ensures that the Bayon is a delight to drive around town, while the standard rear parking sensors and rear view camera in my test car made parking a doddle too.The family-friendly cabin space in the new Bayon is impressive, with rear legroom deserving particular praise.Interior storage comprises a of a deep glovebox, front and rear door bins that can accommodate a large bottle, and a flat shelf for a smartphone at the bottom of the well-constructed dashboard.Boot capacity of -litres can be transformed into a ,-litre space when the rear seat backs are folded down, while an intelligent trunk cover can be stowed away safely within the boot when not in use.The new Hyundai Bayon is available in a multitude of stylish exterior colours, along with the option of a two-tone roof and matching door mirror housings in Phantom Black to create a car perfectly matched to inidual taste.

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.     More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.     Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.

On Saturday night, Derry once again flocked to enjoy a night of the Undertones – but this time it wasn’t just their music - but their big screen debut that was getting the masses excited. The legendary band and their family, friends, and fans gathered to indulge in a celebration of their musical careers in the premier of a fitting tribute documentary, featuring the man who made it all possible – DJ John Peel. The documentary, produced by local man Vinnie Cunningham and directed by Tom Collins, traces the band right back to their first performances in school halls, when the lads had barely swapped their nappy rash for pimples.  Dr. Sid Dempsey, third from right, Head Consultant, Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children with members of the Undertones, Billy Doherty, John and Damien ONeill. Also included are Manus and Majella Martin.  The youngsters from Derry, who supported the Clash on their tour of America, never really appreciated how good they actually were, revealed Damien O’Neill - just one of the frank admissions that litter the documentary. The film is liberally interspersed with old video footage of the band as they bopped from the legendary Casbah to Top of the Pops - and features all the greats from ‘Teenage Kicks’ to ‘My Perfect Cousin’ to ‘It’s Going To Happen’. The fundamental ision between Feargal Sharkey and the rest of the Undertones is very apparent, although John O’Neill maintains that there is no real animosity against the singer who eventually caused the band to split. “The way we see it, he was one of our school friends and we eventually drted apart, the same thing that happens to everyone at some stage,” he said. “We really have no bad feelings towards him.” The banter throughout the showing had the audience in fits of laughter as the boys admitted some of their more embarrassing moments, and some revelations came courtesy of others. Caroline O’Neill certainly dropped husband John in it when she let slip that he had dumped her in the hope that fame and fortune would drive the chicks wild. “He’s going to kill me for saying this,” she said. “But he arrived two days later banging on my door and begging me to take him back.” Not so good-natured abuse The laughs were balanced by some more disturbing highlights of the lestyle that saw the boys also abused and often attacked because of their good fortune. “There were nights when we came out of the Casbah and had to leg it up the street,” admits Damien O’Neill. And Feargal Sharkey spoke of the animosity towards them when they were at home: “It was terrible having to face friends in Derry. You couldn’t buy people a drink or wear fashionable clothes because people thought you were being flash.” The Strand Multiplex was packed full of Derry people who have supported the lads over the last  years, and enjoyed reliving the highs and the lows with them all over again. Paul McCloone who now has the job of filling Feargal’s shoes described the documentary as “brilliant, really enjoyable”. John O’Neill, meanwhile, was about as enthusiastic as John gets: “I think it’s great. The most important thing is that the humour really comes across, and the sense that we were just five ordinary guys that managed to make it big.” The screening was held in aid of the N. Ireland Cancer Unit, and donations on the night, along with the money offered instead of an after show buffet, came to over pound. Manus Martin who lost his own son Anthony to cancer last year expressed his deepest thanks to all involved, particularly Vinnie Cunningham and Tony Collins. Two versions of the film have been compiled and the BBC will broadcast the -minute ‘short version’ by Perfect Cousin Productions Ltd, in association with the BBC, Arts Council and Irish Film Board.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.” For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions  ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Police are appealing for any information regarding the dead man found at his home in the Moss Park area of Derry on Friday, November , Local NewsArrests made after -year-old man found dead in Moss Park overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Kevin Lynchs Stars in Your Eyes Event \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Kevin Lynchs Stars in Your Eyes Event  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Snow possible with Ireland on weather alert for cold snapWeatherSnow possible with Ireland on weather alert for cold snap overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The PSNI have arrested a man on suspicion of arsonLocal NewsRathmore Road fire: -year-old man arrested overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Pic by George Sweeney, nwpresspicsReporter: Gary Ferry Nov Email: gary@derrynews.net  addthis, Derry City  Sligo Rovers  googletag.cmd.push  Jamie McGonigle downed Sligo Rovers with two fantastic goals as Derry City comfortably won their last home game of the season. The striker struck either side of half time, with quality finishes to add to keep City’s hopesEuropean qualication alive ahead of the final game at Dundalk.  A peach of a finish from the striker gave City the lead on  minutes. The goal was reward for a positive start from the home side as Joe Thomson set up McGonigle, wh sent a superb left-footed volley past Richard Brush and into the net to make it -. Liam Buckley could not have been happy with his team at all in a one-sided first half, but his mood almost improved when Sligo created their first chance on  minutes, Mark Byrne breaking into the Derry penalty area, but his low effort was parried by Nathan Gartside who stopped the shot with a strong right hand. Gartside came to Derry’s rescue with an even better save five minutes later. Sligo were pushing hard for an equaliser before half time and they very nearly got it when Walter Figueira’s corner found the run of Garry Buckley at the back post, but the defender’s downward header was brilliantly stopped by the City goalkeeper. For all that Sligo pressure, it should have been - Derry City at the break, as McGonigle was able to race completely free through on goal. The striker showed tremendous poise as he dinked the ball over the oncoming Brush, but Lewis Bank was there to stop the ball on the line, much to the disbelief of the City fans. Lewis Banks then performed more heroics at the other end when Brush was caught in no man’s land trying to challenge Akintunde in the air before McGonigle rounded him and got away a strike that was denied on the line by the right back. Derry eventually doubled their lead in sensational fashion on  minutes. Will Fitzgerald ran at the Sligo defence and crossed the ball, only for Garry Buckley to head it away. The ball fell out of the sky straight onto the foot of McGonigle who lashed it powerfully beyond Brush and onto the top corner for -.

Pic by Mark Doherty.Reporter: Liam Tunney Nov Email: liam@derrypost  addthis, Leadon Timberframe Derry IHC final Banagher - googletag.cmd.push Lavey - Banagher survived a late scare to clinch the Derry intermediate hurling title with victory over Lavey at Owenbeg this afternoon. In the final minute of stoppage time, Fintan Bradleys lobbed free fell just over the bar, with the rippling of the net setting hearts racing around the stand. Moments later, the final whistle brought the curtain down on a tense, competitive Derry intermediate hurling final, with Banaghers slender two-point lead proving enough to take the title. Erins Own will rue a total of  wides throughout the game, seven of them in a profligate opening quarter which left the Gulladuff men trailing by - to -. It was the attritional encounter that Lavey manager Johnny McGarvey had anticipated, with Banaghers incessant pressing and tackling forcing his side to shoot under pressure. At half time, Banaghers double-score lead was intact, and although Fintan Bradleys frees kept Lavey in touch, by the second water break St Marys still had them at arms . The north Derry side had two opportunities to put the game to bed in the final quarter, and were almost punished when Ryan Mulholland blazed a goal chance wide for Lavey with five minutes left. A frantic final few minutes culminated with Bradleys hanging point that for a moment had hearts in mouths throughout the stand. Banagher advance to an Ulster IHC meeting with either Castleblayneyor Middletownon the weekend of November . *Full report and reaction in Tuesdays County Derry Post.

Pic by Catherine Comer.Reporter: Liam Tunney Nov Email: liam@derrypost  addthis,  Bridie McMenamin Shield semi final  googletag.cmd.push Magherafelt - Attical- Rossa camoacutegs eased their way into a historic Ulster final meeting with neighbours Creggan of Antrim after a dominant performance brushed aside Down champions Attical on Saturday afternoon. In stark contrast to the previous weeks wind and rain, Saturdays conditions allowed for a much more expressive game, and it was Magherafelt who ultimately took advantage. The Derry champions made one change to the side that ground out the win over Crosserlough in the quarter final half forward Shauneen McGuckin replacing Ellie McGuckin in the starting line up. While the scoreline suggests otherwise, Attical were competitive in the early stages, with Megan Sloan and Shari McNally causing Rossa problems. Magherafelt, though, weathered any early pressure and took a - to - lead into the first half water break, and from then on never looked in any real danger. By half time, the lead was six points, and three second half goals from Sineacutead Comerand Briacuted Corrigan saw the hosts canter home with  points to spare over the Mourne side.

Probably not like. Anyway. For those not familiar and familiar with the process Aaron Cunningham, deputy editor at Chordblossom Addison Paterson, Alastair Simpson, Andrew Lemon, The Thin Air Brendan McKeown, Mr Brian Coney, editor at The Thin Air, Chris Corrigan, head of music Queens University Belfast, Carolyn Mathers, Director of Snow Water middot Christopher McBride, Ciara McMullan, photographer Erika Clarke, Chris Flack, Colin Harper, Colum Fitzsimons, David Roy, Dan Hegarty, Davy Sims, Rachael Campbell Palmer, director Black Box, Dolores Vischer, Monk, Edwin McFee, journalist Gerry Sheppard, Hannah Anderson, Hannah Gibson, Mark Hornby, James Ayo, Robert Brown, Editor at Chordblossom middot John DArcy, Jamie Taylor, beautul Everton fan, Janis Leaden, Amy Nolan, Jimmy Devlin, Joe Dougan, Johanna Leech, Jonathan Stewart, Josh Henry, Jo Wright, Kate Barry, Keely, Keith Millar, Me, Les Hume, Lisa Flavelle, Dylan Murphy and Jack Rapanakis, Mari Jackson, Mark Millar, Brendan McGoran, Meghan Gilleece, Thee Micky Ferry, Thee Nance Hall, Nattassa Latcham, Niall Byrne, Olga Kaye, Patricia McConville, Paddy Craig, Music Peter Cinnamond, Phil McCarroll, Ralph McClean, Roisin McNickle, Rory McConnell, Ruth McCarthy, Sara Champ, Sarah Kiely, Sean Kelly, Sean McCann, Simon Oliver, Siobhan McAndrew, Stephen McCaulay of the wonderful taste, handsome Stevie Lennox, Steve Stockman, Stuart Fletcher, Stuart Bailie obviously, Geoff Topley, Thomas Camblin and Saul Duffin have decided that Andrew McGibbon’s Northern Gothic, Arvo Party’s Inheritance, Bicep’s Isles, CATALAN!’s Veritas, Danni Larkin’s Notes For A Maiden Warrior, Hannah Peel’s Fir Wave, Jealous Of The Birds’ Peninsula, Joshua Burnside’s Into The Depths Of Hell, New Pagans’s The Seed The Vessel The Roots And All, Peter J McCauley’s Amnesty, Saint Sister’s Where I Should End, This Ship Argo’s Always The Bees Never The Honey, TRUacute’s No Fixed Abode and Verse Chorus Verse’s What If We Won have all been nominated for the best album at the Northern Ireland Music Prize and Amy Montgomery’sIntangible, Bicep’smiddot Apricots, Cherym’sListening To My Head, Dea Matrona’sStamp On It, Enola Gay’sSofa Surfing, Invaderband’sI Wont Remember You, Jordan Adetunji’s Wokeup! and Waldorf  Cannon’sWe Are Your Governmenthave been nominated for best single at event. There hasn’t been enough gigs this past year to have a best live act, how they arrived at a conclusion last year is strange but then I may be misinformed. There’s obviously no new bands to speak of so it’s just the two awards this year. I suppose it’s as close to democracy as we can get, but as with everything in the parish, the archaic powers that be hold way too much influence and are too stuck in the past. I’m the guiltiest and have no real business having a say and will keep my opinions to myself from now on. Well after I say that to my ears Andrew McGibbon’s Northern Gothic and Verse Chorus Verse’s What If We Won are the best albums on that list to me and Waldorf  Cannon’s We Are Your Government is the best single. I think we should all sit back and appreciate that Hannah Peel’s Fir Wave was recently up for the Mercury Music Prize kiss of death, sadly not winning butit was two out of two losses an outsider would be thinking that there is something really weird going on within the chambers of power up at the Oh Yeah Centre. I named the  nominators to remind myself that my taste really isn’t that important, and I should read my above statement about keeping my opinions to myself. Waiting for things to change in the parish is just something we are great at here. What next, I hear you ask, well there is a group that meets around a table and weighs up the options for the best albums, I’d like to think they do this in a fair manner and once they reach a consensus then the world, who will undoubtedly be waiting with bated breath, will get their answer The same is not true for the single, that is voted for by the public, you, and that’s why those bands were urging you to vote recently. The public vote is now closed so I suppose they know who’s won it by now but they’re not letting on. Rascals.

Miami Vice: Saturday, TCM @ pm Michael Manns stylish and action packed update of the famous s TV show about cops taking on drug dealers. Bristling with testosterone, its a moody grown up thriller full of suspense, action and neo-nazis getting shot in the face. Whats not to like about that  Colin Farrell  Jamie Foxx are solid as the leads but Naomie Harris steals the film with one small scene in a mobile home. The soundtrack is wicked too. Portrait Of A Lady On Fire: Saturday, BBC @ pm In Brittany at the end of the th century a painter called Marianne is commissioned to paint a portrait of a woman calledHeacuteloiumlse who is due to be married off to an Italian nobleman. A marriage she wants no part of. Do you fancy a romance that will both uplt you and leave you in absolute shreds  Well here you go. Magnicent turns from Noeacutemie Merlant and Adegravele Haenel carry a sublime story. Rain Man: Saturday, TG @ .pm Charlies father has died and left his fortune to an autistic brother he never realised he had. To get the money him and his brother tear off on a road trip where he finds out about both his sibling and himself. Aspects of Rain Man have dated these days but its still a lovely story of discovery and reunion buoyed by a couple of memorable performances from Dustin Hoffman and Tom Cruise. Pawn Sacrice: Sunday, BBC One @ .am  Bobby Fischer vs Boris Spassky. . The chess game to end all chess games. Two grandmasters. West vs East. Some said it was only a game but in a time of cold war its also something far more important than that. Tobey Maguire does fine work as the tragic lead of a well crafted film riddled with paranoia and suspense while Liev Schrieber uses his trademark brooding to intense effect. Walk Like A Panther: Sunday, Channel  @ .am  Their local pub is closing and the only way to make money is toto the lycra and capes. But these folks arent superheroes, nope, they are s wrestlers and aching hips and shoulders arent going to stop them. An entertaining slice of fluff and whimsy from  that will make you feel nostalgic for Saturday morning television. Stephen Graham, Sue Johnston, Robbie Gee and Julian Sands are among the familiar faces having fun. Ladyhawke: Sunday, Talking Pictures TV @ .pm Nare and Isabeau are in love but they have a wee problem. There was a curse placed on them making him a wolf during the night and her a hawk during the day ensuring they can never be together. The only person who can help is a thief called Gaston. Richard Donners  fairytale is a likable, well made, glorious looking romantic escapade. Michelle Pfefer and Rutger Hauer play the lost lovers and Matthew Broderick has a good time as their only hope. St Vincent: Sunday, Film @ .pm After an incident with his next door neighbour a grumpy old Vietnam vet begins to babysit her bullied son and soon they begin to see the best in each other. A funny, bittersweet comedy that will make you laugh and upset you in equal measures. Bill Murray in the lead is better than hes been in years and Melissa McCarthy as his neighbour does well in a role thats a lot more dramatic than her usual parts. Bridge to Terabithia: Monday, Great! Films @ .pm Jesse and Leslie become fast friends when she moves in next door to him. Soon their childhood imaginations are running riot and the kingdom of Terabithia is created. Real le is sadly never far away though. A little beaut of a movie, one full of lessons about le, both the lovely and tragic sides of it. Anna Sophia Robb and Josh Hutcherson are both amiable leads. Be warned, this could might will make you cry. Doubt: Monday, TG @ .pm A well liked priest is accused of child abuse. But did he do it  Thats the crux of the tale in an excellent adaption of the famous Broadway play. Philip Seymour Hoffmanis the priest in question and Meryl Streep is the nun investigating him. We get immense performances from both. The subject matter might be hard to take but its compelling and gripping stuff that will stay in your head for days after. Dog Soldiers: Monday, Film @ . A group of soldiers on routine training in the Scottish highlands find themselves under siege from a pack of beasts that should not exist. Neil Marshalls debut film is awesome. Hilarious, horric, quotable, disgusting and damn scary. A rare horror comedy that gets its blend just right. All this and we get a wicked cast too with Sean Pertwee, Kevin McKidd, Liam Cunningham and Darren Morfitt whos just deadly as Spoon. All The Kings Men: Tuesday, Great! Movies Action @ .am Wille Stark. A real salt of the earth fellow. Liked by all. Well...... Hes a politician, a self taught kind of guy. Hes a decent man, at least he was once, back when he hadnt sold his soul. A deserved Best Picture winner back in , this portrait of the rise and fall of a famous face mixes politics and noir to brilliant effect.Broderick Crawfordand Merceded McCambridge both put in first rate performances. Journeys End: Wednesday, BBC Two @ .pm France. . The trenches of Aisne. A young soldier called Raleigh once who once believed in the importance of war sits surrounded by his comrades in a filthy, rat infested trench as the German army only metres away get ready to attack their front lines. A powerful watch that shows us bullets make no distinctions when it comes to class and social status. Asa Butterfield, Paul Bettany and Sam Clafin do strong work. Nebraska: Thursday, Film @ .am A father and son called Woody and David are taking a trip from Montana to Nebraska to claim a prize. Woody is slowly losing his memory to dementia and David is dragged into the mess. Alexander Paynes comedy drama is a beautully written and crafted look at the complexities of family relationships. Plus it has a couple of wicked belly laughs hidden away. Bruce Dern, Will Forte and especially June Squibb are all on fire. Paths Of Glory: Thursday, BBC @ .pm The men of B-company refuse to make a suicidal run at a German hill during World War . Their general is embarrassed by his perceived failure and sets out to make someone pay. Stanley Kubricks masterful anti war film is an enraging watch, one that shows the toll military le can have on humanity even when the fighting is over. Kirk Douglas as Colonel Dax has never been better while George Macready as General Mireau will make you despair. Sam Whiskey: Friday, TG @ .pm Her husband is dead and Laura has a problem. The gold he stole is sitting in a boat at the bottom of the Colorado river and she needs someone to find it andit to its rightful place. Unfortunately she hires the rogue Sam Whiskey for the job. A charming. amiable western is just what you need for a Friday evening and this one led by Burt Reynolds and Angie Dickinson is just the ticket. Youll instantly guess how its going to end but it will keep you smiling throughout. American Mary: Friday, The Horror Channel @ .pm A broke medical student discovers an unusual way to make extra money and finds herself in some very very dark places as a result. This  dark drama horror film starring Katherine Isabelle is a highly effective piece of work. Be warned though, it should probably only be watched by those with a strong constitution butyou can go with it you discover a unique little story that will open your eyes to a whole other world. The Belly Of The Whale: Friday, RTEacute One @ .pm Joe and Ronald. Two loners in a miserable, run down seaside town in Donegal. One has come home after a long time and the other is already there scratching out a miserable existence. They come together with a plan but theres someone venal in their way. A dark dark dark Irish comedy from  that went under the radar at the time but its still worth your time. Michael Smiley, Peter Coonan and Pat Shortt do nice work as three men youd cross four fields to avoid.

The area will also be power washed.Just over pound, is to be spent on other planting and landscaping schemes in the Church Street area, while there are also proposals for a new bus stop and power washing the area outside the former telephone exchange.New safety railings are to be installed outside  Church Street, while a mural will be painted on one of the gable walls at the entrance to the car park at this part of the town.There are also plans to invest pound, on new interpretation material highlighting the Tower Bell at Down Parish Church and the grave of United Irishman Thomas Russell in the church grounds.Plans have also been outlined to provide new festive lighting on the side of the Down Arts Centre and on trees in De Courcey Place.The draft plan confirms a proposal to appoint a quantity surveyor to oversee the substantial investment with hopes that the work can start as soon as the document secures approval from the steering group.Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran has welcomed the opportunity business and property owners are being given to revitalise what he described as a key part of the town.ldquoThe proposed Church Street investment is welcome news in a part of the town where there are a number of family-owned businesses whose links with Downpatrick stretch back over several generations, he said.ldquoThe draft plan provides a vision for the future and business owners welcome the signicant investment which will considerably help Church Street which has missed out on funding for some considerable time.Cllr Curran said the revitalisation scheme provided a firm  on which to build for the future and he hoped that business and property owners will be encouraged to spend some of their own money on their respective properties to make them even better.He is also keen to see progress on the Irish Street scheme which has not made the progress many would have hoped by this stage.Cllr Curran added: ldquoRedeveloping the former police base site and neighbouring properties will be a game-changer and act as a catalyst to secure more investment, increasing footfall which will benefit existing traders.ldquoDownpatrick is a county town and its status warrants not only a vibrant retail hub, but a place where all buildings look smart and welcoming.ldquoSignicant sums of money have been invested in other town centre streets and I am delighted that it is now Church Streetrsquos turn to benefit from some much-needed, but very welcome investment..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/10November2021_aughlisnafin.jpg","title":"Aughlisnafin make history  ","story":"AUGHLISNAFIN were crowned junior champions for the first time in their  year history after a pulsating contest with Dundrum concluded in a three-point victory at Pairc Esler on Friday night.Despite a commendable second half surge from John Clarkersquos Dundrum men, the lsquoFin showed their experience in the competition and managed to cling on to achieve intermediate status for next yearrsquos campaign.Dundrum began on the offence straight from the start, winning the throw-in and immediately attacking the opposition.This set the tone for what would be a highly paced and energetic contest, as Aughlisnafinrsquos Oran Flanagan fouled Dundrumrsquos Michael McGrattan for a free within the opening minute.However, what should have been a straight forward conversion was missed by Cormac Venney.Breannain McComiskey immediately made Venney rue his miss, as the Aughlisnafin man kicked over the bar following good build-up play from Shea Croskery for the opening score of the final.The lsquoFin kept their foot on the pedal and won the following kick-out, with Flanagan making up for his earlier foul to convert a point from play.Referee Conor Curran was kept busy throughout the game and first brandished his yellow card just four minutes in to Aughlisnafinrsquos Noel Travers after a sloppy high tackle.Following patient build up play, Croskery added his sidersquos third point of the game, with Dundrum now desperate to get on the board.It was clear nerves were playing a part in the early stages, as Venney failed to convert another free wide, this time dragging his shot right of the posts.With Aughlisnafin piling the pressure on the Dundrum defence the ball was worked back to lsquokeeper Walsh who played a fist pass out to team-mate Thomas McShane  metres from goal.However, disaster struck as the Dundrum man fumbled the ball in the danger area, allowing Flanagan to pick up the scraps and bury the ball into the back of the net to give The lsquoFin a six point lead less than ten minutes in.Michael McGrattan tried to answer for Dundrum but saw his effort drt wide before custodian Walsh finally got his side off the mark with a converted free.McComiskey replied sharply, notching his second point by kicking over the black spot from open play, although Venney did answer this with a point of his own that he desperately needed just before the water-break.At the conclusion of the opening quarter, Aughlisnafin were by far the dominant side and led - to -.On the restart Dundrum managed to find their groove and make up for earlier mistakes courtesy of successive points from Venney and McGrattan.However, Aughlisnafin would soon hit their opponents with a damaging blow as Tiernan Noadersquos high ball over the top found lsquoFin forward Adam Garland, who converted his sweetly struck shot into the top left corner for the second goal of the game after  minutes.Noade won a turnover from the resultant kick-out, but saw his effort sail wide before McGrattan replied with a point for Dundrum after winning an inidual battle with Aughlisnafin defender Sean Fitzsimmons.The contest was beginning to ebb and flow with both sets of supporters making their voices heard, as Garland dummied his man, but missed the target.Despite Noade pulling his shot wide a minute later, Aughlisnafinrsquos high balls over the top were clearly causing Dundrum all sorts of bother as their defence struggled to maintain the pressing forward line.Garland kicked over a free to give his side a - score line as Dundrum prepared to introduce substitute Odhran McKibbin to the pitch.Perhaps overeager to impress, McKibbin received a yellow card immediately following a late tackle, as referee Curran continued to show efficient officiating beyond his years.Soon after, McComiskey registered his third point of the match, but once again, Dundrum showed why they made it to the final.After overturning the ball in midfield, the ball worked its way to Dundrum captain Aidan Fegan, who played a lovely pass over the top to McGrattan.The forward found himself in acres of space and struck the ball with conviction past lsquoFin lsquokeeper Morgan Croskery and into the net.Garland replied with a free just before half time as the score read Aughlisnafin - Dundrum -.The lsquoFin began the quicker following the restart after a McComiskey lsquorsquo floated into Garland, who pointed over for the first score of the half.A series of wides took up the next five minutes of the game before McComiskey became the latest player to enter Conor Curranrsquos book, receiving a yellow for a high tackle.Travers then pulled his effort wide before his side won the resultant kick-out and forced a fantastic save from Dundrumrsquos Walsh, who stopped a certain goal.Walsh found himself at the opposite end of the pitch a minute later to kick over a fantastic free, which spurred team-mate Venney on to convert one himself in the following passage of play.This was Venneyrsquos third time raising the white flag and the last notable piece of action before the second water-break as Dundrum trailed by four.The last quarter was nothing short of dramatic, as both sets of players were clearly beginning to fatigue and yet still managed to throw everything at eachother.Dundrum really set the scene for a nail-biting last  minutes when they passed the ball neatly from one end of the pitch to the other before skipper Fegan found David McComiskey with only lsquokeeper Croskery to beat.Dundrumrsquos McComiskey duly converted make it a one-point game and now the atmosphere was beginning to reach fever pitch.John Hurley saw his chance sail wide for Dundrum before Garland kicked over a free to double his sidersquos lead.McGrattan continued to battle, winning a free out of nothing, before Walsh stepped up to send the ball over the bar.Shea Croskery received a yellow card in between two wide balls from Dundrum, as they resulted to kicking from range in the final five minutes.Walsh was forced to make another eye-catching save, this time preventing substitute Ruairi Croskery from converting.Garland managed to kick over a point a minute later to add to his impressive personal tally before Flanagan saw his long range effort split the posts to give Aughlisnafin a comfortable three point margin.With just seconds on the clock, Dundrum knew it was now or never and with the last free of the night attempted a short pass to allow an opportunity for a strike on goal.However, Shea Croskery was on hand to block the shot as Curranrsquos whistle sounded for the final time to signal it would be Dolen Croskeryrsquos men who would lt the trophy.Aughlisnafin: M Croskery J Matthews, S Fitzsimmons, S Willoughby O OrsquoToole, B McComiskey , N Travers D Steele , O FlanaganS

Work started last week on the new facility which is being provided at the grounds of the local gaelic club.The scheme is a joint initiative by the Saul club and Down Council and work is expected to be completed within the new few weeks.The arrival of the contractors on site late Thursday morning marked the end of a long campaign by local councillor Mr Peter Craig.He is delighted work is underway and has no doubt the playground will make a major contribution to the lives of young people in the area.He said the gaelic clubrsquos premises are being used to house the playground because no other suitable sites could be identied in the area.And in a bid to further improve safety standards, Roads Service officials are to provide new lighting along a footpath which runs from Raholp to the GAA pitch.BALLYNAHINCH mdashA senior police officer has rejected claims from a Sinn Fein councillor that a police car sped away from a Catholic couple who had been attacked in Ballynahinch at the weekend.Inspector Paul McClean has refuted Francis Brannfrsquos allegations that police allowed the assailants to escape after attacking the couple in fast food premises at High Street in the early hours of Sunday.Inspector McClean has also rejected Cllr Brannfrsquos allegations that the injured couple were questioned by an officer from a mobile support unit while their attackers were ldquoallowed to escape.Alleging that the Catholic couple were ldquoviciously beaten, Mr Brannf said that after being head butted and ldquobeaten to the ground the woman ran to a nearby police car to get help while her husband was being assaulted.He also said police allowed ldquothe Loyalists to escape the scene of yet another sectarian attack on nationalists in Ballynahinch.NEWCASTLE mdash Two Stormont departments are at loggerheads after Newcastle beach failed a series of water quality tests.Department of the Environment experts failed Newcastle beach because the level of sewage contamination found in the bathing waters was a breach of European guidelines.But the Department of Regional Development, responsible for sewage treatment, has rejected the DoErsquos reasons, claiming other factors are to blame.Only three out of  Northern Ireland beaches failed the quality tests which must be passedbeaches are to be considered for the prestigious Blue Flag quality award. Tyrella passed the stringent tests for the seventh successive year.Announcing the disappointing news for Newcastle, Environment Minister, Sam Foster, said the failure of the three beaches was due to sewage dischargers, which he added highlights the problems caused by the lack of investment in sewerage services.However, the Water Service yesterday stressed that it was unlikely the discovery was due to the failure of the multi-million pound sewage treatment plant which was built at the townrsquos harbour in the s.A Water Service spokesman said there has been no failure at the sewage plant since  and it is therefore questionable that it is the source of the problem.KILLYLEAGH mdash Killyleagh Development Association will be unveiling its latest regeneration scheme at the end of the month.The official ceremony will be performed by former Down councillor, Mr Sam Osborne, who will be joined by a number of people from the town and representatives from the International Fund for Ireland.Work on the High Street project started in January and was completed in September and has transformed the area, with the ambitious pound, project including four ground floor shops, two first floor apartments and a cottage.The cottage has recently been sold and the four retail units are currently available for rental with Association officials confident they can secure tenants.Construction work began at the start of the year and the project team behind the scheme are confident the scheme will greatly enhance this area of Killyleagh which is close to the townrsquos historic castle.CASTLWELLAN mdash Elderly people in Castlwellan are being disturbed by children running through their gardens, according to the local SDLP branch.During a recent meeting of the Castlewellan and Kilcoo branch, the chairman, John Duggan, said he was concerned that some older residents were being bothered by a number of young people.Mr Duggan pointed out that Castlewellan was an excellent place to live but said there was an absolute need for children to pay courtesy to their elders within the neighbourhood.ldquoWhat makes a good community spirit is the ability to have respect for others within the community. There have been some episodes recently where children have been running through gardens and hedges at homes of elderly people.ldquoI would ask them to give these members of the community the peace and space they deserve and consider their feelings in pursuit of fun, he said.BALLYKINLAR mdash Ballykinlar cross-community playgroup has been strongly praised by education inspectors for providing a positive ethos which promotes childrenrsquos confidence and self-esteem.The Department of Education report lists a number of strengths of the playgroup which operates out of the old school on the Carricknab Road.Staff are headily praised for their leadership and dedication to the children and the inspectors found there were only a few areas which need attention.ldquoThe staff treat the children with care and respect and provide a secure, supportive environment which helps the children grow in confidence and independence, said the report.SAINTFIELD mdash The achievements and success of the younger pupils at Saintfield High School were cerebrated during a special junior school prize day last week.The principal, Mr Robert Miss, said the school prided itself on being a family school offering support, interest and encouragement in all the pupils strive to achieve.Mr Mills proudly pointed out that the schoolrsquos well established year eight induction programme seeks to ensure that all new pupils entering Saintfield High School settle quickly into their new environment..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/10November2021_stpatrickday.jpg","title":"Green light for St Patrick’s Day  ","story":"A ST Patrickrsquos Day parade in Downpatrick is scheduled to go ahead next year.The Recorder can confirm that Newry, Mourne and Down Council is pressing ahead with plans for the event which regularly attracts thousands of visitors to the town.The cross-community spectacular was last held in , with last yearrsquos event one of the districtrsquos first high profile casualties of the emerging coronavirus pandemic.The parade was cancelled due to lockdown restrictions to help prevent the spread of the deadly virus, but council officials are confident the event can go ahead next March.With Covid restrictions now eased, they are keen to see the  parade take place with details surprisingly unveiled to councillors in private during Mondayrsquos meeting of the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee.As the public health emergency has eased slightly, a number of councillors believe that as the parade is an outdoor event, it will be able to proceed, provided people continue to exercise caution.Downpatrick area councillor, Dermot Curran, said while there are over four months to go before the parade would be held, ious plans have to be put in place.He said decisions have to be taken now to ensure that all the pieces in the eventrsquos jigsaw are in place and believes that the current environment allows for the popular event to proceed.ldquoPublic health advice rightly prompted the decision to cancel the last two St Patrickrsquos Day parades but the situation has changed. The fact that this will be an outdoor event is also an important factor in deciding that it can proceed, Cllr Curran continued.ldquoThe virus is still in circulation, but a signicant number of people have been vaccinated and things are certainly a lot dferent compared to last year. Protecting peoplersquos health remains important and we should all continue to wear a mask when required to do, exercise good hand hygiene and maintain our distance from others.Cllr Curran said the past  months had been some of the most dficult people across the district haf ever faced, suggesting news that the St Patrickrsquos Day is due to proceed will provide them with a glimmer of hope for the future.ldquoThere have been many large outdoor events over recent months and normality is slowly to starting to , but there is no room for complacency and we must all continue adhering to the public safety message, he continued.ldquoThe St Patrickrsquos Day parade in Downpatrick is hugely popular and people who regularly attend it now have something to look forward to.

Catherine OrsquoConnor was in fineform and led the EDAC ladies in style.Her aim was top ten and she managed that with ease coming eighth in . for the three miles. She also got the prize for first over  as a further boost to her confidence.Leanne Spick, who has only recently joined the club, is a competent runner and game for anything so, new spikes purchased, she turned up to see what was what.She was second EDAC lady home, th overall in .. It is fair to say she looked right at home and will likely make further improvement now that she knows the drill.Nuala Taylor, coaxed into racing by her husband John, who wanted her to know how much he had suffered at Comber, couldnrsquot see what the fuss was about as she flew round in . .Wayne Giles gets a bit of teasing for being in the ladiesrsquo race due to being over  but he takes it in good part.He has even volunteered to shave his legs to help him blend in for the team photo.

She placed st in ..Alison Carroll in contrast said that this was possibly her most enjoyable cross country race ever and she was well pleased with her time of ..Sam Anderson, going from marathon distance to this shorter effort, was afraid of being last but she was far from it and has even signed up for the next event in two weeks time. Her time of . earned her th slot.With the ladies done and dusted, the men swarmed to the start area. There were nine EDAC representatives, a mix of the experienced and the first timers ready for the five laprace.Gordy Graham prefers the feel of tarmac when he is racing, but he aways commits to whatever challenge is set before him. He, like Catherine, was aiming for a top ten and by virtue of targeting runners ahead hemanoeuvred himself into a good position but had to sprintright to the line to hold his tenth place.He recorded . which is speedy for an off road run.Mackenzie Murray is  but with no junior category for this age, he decided to join in the menrsquos senior team and he proved a useful addition.He found the distance long and at one stage was doubting his ability to stay with the pace but he hung in and even passed more runners to finish th overall in a time of ..Martin Willcox loves cross country, as does Dee Murray, and as old hands they know that pacing is key.They went lap after lap, never showing the strain and finishing in . and . respectively, th and nd.Right behind Dee was Jonny Holmes.

Eamon was th , John thand Patrick th in ..With banana bread and chocolate on hand to revive them, the mood at the finish line was buoyant and the whole EDAC contingent went home satisfied with having made good use of the day.The Born  Run team are excited to be back in business after the long layoff during the pandemic.They welcomed back the runners with open arms to the first event of six in the lsquoWinter Run Forest Runrsquo series, namely the Minnowburn K and K. Both distances started at the Mary Peters Track and then headed off into the forest and then along the towpath.There were over  in the K and  in the K. East Down had two runners both doing the K, Sharon Madine and Rachel Madine .Despite her birthday celebrations the night before, Sharon looked fresh as she set off with the lead pack and she was more than able to stick with the pace throughout.While she didnrsquot particularly relish the hill at the start or the climb to the finish, she appreciated the scenery en route.Her efforts placed her third female at the finish and it is worth noting that her time of . was only a few seconds off second place.Rachel equally enjoyed both the route and the race and was pleased to come well up the field in nd place .For Rachel though, this was only part one of her weekend commitments.The annual event organised by Atlas Running on behalf of the Ballynahinch British Legion took place on Sunday morning with a K route along the back roads of the town.Even though she had already raced the day before, Rachel Madine felt that she couldnrsquot let this race go by without taking part as it is right on her doorstep.In fact she could be considered a regular as this is her third time enteringThe  odd runners who turned up were delighted to be greeted with pleasant, bright weather as last year they had to endure torrential rain and high winds.Despite the hilly course, the race was won in a speedy . by Lawrence OrsquoHara of North Belfast. Rachel finished th in a time of .. A good weekendrsquos work for her.It was cross country all the way for the EDAC juniors last weekend but one option was closer to home in Ballyclare while the other necessitated a long drive to Donegal.The home birds were running in the U- race prior to the McConnell Shield cross country in the Six Mile Water Park. It may only have been a mile but it was a tough mile.Matthew Taylor actually ran more than a mile as he arrived late thinking he was in the next race on the program and performed the quickest vest change and number putting on ever seen.He just made it to the back of the pack as the whistle blew. Undeterred he dug in and made his way through the small pack and was barely in his stride when he realised that it was time to sprint for the finish line.He couldnrsquot believe his luck when he was then handed a medal for second boy. Talk about a whirlwind experience - maybe the lack of time to consider what lay ahead was a good thing.Even though he had no time to greet them at the start, he was able to congratulate the two other EDAC runners at the end.Amelia Spick was taking on her first cross country ever and seemed to enjoy the race. Her new spikes are now duly christened and hopefully she willfor another shot at this discipline.She ran an even pace as advised and finished sixth girl and ninth overall. Ky Murray was two places behind and closing in the latter stages.Her lightning sprint brought her within five seconds of Amelia and she was placed eighth girl overall.The juniors then took on the role of supporters, cheering on the adults which was much appreciated encouragement. It is this element of whole club camaraderie that makes cross country so special.Further afield then were the Robinson brothers who had travelled to Stranorlar in Donegal for the NI and Ulster XC Championships .Despite some rain early on in Ballyclare, the athletes raced in dry, almost sunny conditions and there was very little mud to slow them down, but Oliver and Alex were not so lucky.The rain the night before made the course very boggy and although the rainbows on the day suggested it might clear, this was just a tease. Even during the dry spells the biting wind made conditions tough for the runners.Alex was first up running a distance of two kilometres in the U- race. He started safely and quickly became part of the leading pack on the course two loops around two fields.On the second lap he led the breakaway pack and looked comfortable as they disappeared into the second field.When he emerged he had ped to fth and was running with just one shoe having lost the other in the deep mud. The last m metres were heroic as he battled to hold his place only being overtaken in the last m.He was so disappointed with the outcome and on reflection said he should have ditched his shoe sooner instead of losing speed trying to keep it on.A hard lesson to learn but Alex showed his grit and has been rewarded with selection as an inidual into the U- Ulster and NI team for the All-Irelands in Gowran, Kilkenny at the start of December.He was placed sixth out of  runners in a time of ., only  seconds behind the winner. The wayward shoe was retrieved from the mud later.His brother Ollie was in two minds whether to run at all. He was nursing an injury acquired at rugby but he showed commitment by putting his vest on to line up for the U- four-and-a-half kilometre race.He knew he wasnrsquot at his best but didnrsquot want to withdraw without giving it a shot. He went out steadily, wisely treating it as a training run, but still finishing rd out of the field of  runners.When the times are analysed he may well end up at the All-Irelands as part of the county team. Either way, he did the club proud and both boys are to be congratulated on their efforts..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/10November2021-GoDigital.jpg","title":"Make the Call helps families with £5m aid  ","story":"NEW figures have revealed that over , people across the Newry Mourne and Down area claimed almost poundm in unclaimed benefits last year.The cash was paid under the lsquomake the callrsquo scheme spearheaded by the Department for Communities.The government department said figures for the last financial year reveal that people who used the service became pound better off per week on average, with almost , accessing almost poundm in unclaimed benefits province-wide.The lsquomake the callrsquo service supports people in accessing benefits, services and supports to which they are entitled, but have not been claiming.A total of  people in Newry Mourne and Down claimed pound,, last year.Stormont communities minister, Deirdre Hargey, said her departmentrsquos scheme has helped people who lsquomade the callrsquo become, on average, pound. better off per week.ldquoDuring  , we received over  referrals from our partner organisations which helped ensure people are receiving their full entitlement to benefits, supports and services that can make a real dference to their lives, she explained.ldquoOften people donrsquot realise there is support out there to assist them during dficult times.

Enough is enough, it is time to see these projects delivered to improve the lives of local workers and families.With the approach of winter and worsening road conditions due to weather and darker evenings, Cllr Mason said visibility will become poorer.ldquoWe need to see urgent action from the Minister to address the concerns of the local community to ensure our roads are safe and up to satisfactory standard before winter hits, she contended.ldquoWinter gritting is a huge cause for concern for many in our local rural communities and the Minister needs to deliver a more effective solution to winter gritting on our rural roads with priority for those in more isolated areas who fear another winter stuck in their homes, the councillor continued.ldquoMany farmers who rely on milk collection lorries arriving daily and accessing feed supplies for their animals, need the certainty that their services and routine will not be disrupted. Those who work as frontline staff such as the emergency services and domiciliary care workers must have a safe passage to and from peoplersquos homes, while childcare services and rural schools must be able to operate smoothly.ldquoWe cannot allow ordinary people to suffer and a management plan must be implemented to ensure gritting is carried out throughout the winter period, she added, confirming that she has written to Mrs Mallon to raise her concerns.A DfI spokesman said Mrs Mallon ldquocompletely rejects these unfounded assertions and will continue to work equitably across all council areas, including South Down, to improve the condition of the road network.ldquoThe Minister is fully aware of the condition of roads in South Down and will continue to work for all communities to deliver the infrastructure they need, he said.ldquoThe fact that the Minister has increased the funding for the rural roads fund by % and allocated poundm mdash a % increase on last yearrsquos budget mdash specically for rural roads across the North, including South Down, is a clear demonstration of this commitment to rural communities. This funding is not impacted by current legal challenges.The spokesman explained that as a result of challenges to awarding resurfacing contracts earlier this year, ious schemes which the Department had intended to progress during the current financial year have been delayed in four council areas, including Newry Mourne and Down.But he confirmed the Department is taking forward a new procurement strategy and hopes to be in position to go to tender shortly and to have new term contracts in place next January to continue resurfacing programmes in these areas, including in South Down.ldquoSignicant programmes of work have been delivered across all areas in  , in particular on rural roads and while capacity to reallocate resurfacing budgets across areas is limited, every effort is being made to maximise spend across all areas, said the spokesman.ldquoIn relation to the Ballynahinch bypass, Minister Mallon provided an opening allocation of pound.m for land costs and scheme development in -.

We will then come to a decision,” he said.“We feel the best way to maximise vaccine take-up is to encourage rather than force.“Proof of vaccination or a negative test has been used for a large number of events such as Balmoral Show .“We don’t want to be in a situation where people’s access to services is based solely on vaccination. That sits uncomfortably with us but we must always act in the interest of protecting our health service.“In many cases, people without a vaccination are more seriously impacted by Covid- and therefore require hospital treatment.”Mr Swann’s proposal comes amid escalating pressures on the region’s beleaguered health system.Covid- transmission rates have also surged in recent weeks, particularly among young people.Mr Swann said he wanted ministers to discuss the timing of the move and what settings it should be initially applied to.Making certication a legal entry requirement for hospitality venues has been credited with driving up vaccination rates among young people in the Irish Republic.North of the border, the Executive has recommended that nightclubs and other venues carry out Covid entry checks and an official app has been developed to enable people to show proof of their vaccine status.However, a majority of ministers have so far resisted calls to make it a legal requirement of entry.SDLP minister Nichola Mallon, a vocal advocate of mandatory certication, said the region’s hospitals were at “breaking point”.“For me, this is long overdue and I think it really is a right and responsible thing,” she told BBC Radio Ulster.“And I hope that all of the Executive can examine the evidence and that we can agree this and get moving on it extremely quickly.”Alliance minister Naomi Long questioned why passports were not made mandatory when social distancing rules were lted in the hospitality industry at the end of October.“It does beg the question, I have to say, as to what has gone wrong, given that we were given assurance at that time by the Health Minister that doing this on a voluntary basis would be adequate and that we’ve been told since that venues have been complying with that,” she told the BBC.Mrs Long said she would not support compulsory passports for accessing public services.“But I think when you’re talking about areas of le which are optional it is reasonable, particularly where there is no social distancing possible,” she said.Asked about the prospect of the DUP opposing the move, Mrs Long said decisions should not be taken on the basis of “ideology” rather on how best to relieve pressure on the health service and save lives.Mr Swann has said,approved, he would like to see the mandatory system being rolled out as soon as the legal regulations were in place – a process he said would take between two to three weeks.He acknowledged there would be a need for engagement with the hospitality sector in the interim.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Picture Matt Mackey   Press Eye.“I think now is the time for the phased introduction of Covid certication in Northern Ireland,” he told a Stormont news conference today.Mr Swann said he would bring a proposal to the Executive on Wednesday when he said ministers could discuss the timing of the move and what settings it should be initially applied to.“Our view as a Department of Health is that we should be using all the tools that are in our options to use,” he added.Mr Swann said he would like to see the mandatory system being rolled out as soon as the legal regulations were in place – a process he said would take between two to three weeks.He acknowledged there would be a need for engagement with the hospitality sector in the interim.Earlier, Mr Poots said he was not in favour of compulsory certication.“I don’t support that at all,” he told BBC Radio Ulster this morning.“I am very clear that vaccination is the best means of creating normality and it has allowed us to create a signicant normality once again in terms of our day-to-day lives. “And I think that, you know, people should get vaccinated and I’ll encourage and cajole and pressurise and have done that with people who I know who have been hesitant.“But forcing people to do something isn’t going to work. “It’s not going to get those last few over the line. Over % of people are vaccinated and we need to continue to encourage the remainder to get vaccinated, but forcing them is not going to work.“And I don’t think that creating a two-tier system for so many things is something that I would be prepared to accept.”DUP’s Paul Frew is extremely opposed to the introduction of Covid passports believing they will only serve to cause discrimination.Following Mr Swann’s announcement, he commented on Twitter: “The Health Minister wants to bring into law a discriminatory practice to exclude people dues to their health status and history without any evidence of positive health outcomes or impact assessments.”Fellow DUP councillor Nathan Anderson said: “This heavy handed approach to vaccine passports punishes EVERYONE.”Shortly after Mr Swann’s announcement, Sinn Fein’s Michelle O’Neill tweeted: “The executive will meet again on Wednesday with a focus on the huge pressures in the health service.“We will continue to be guided by the health advice to take whatever steps are necessary to protect the public and avoid another lock down scenario.”SDLP minister Nichola Mallon commented: “I am relieved that finally other ministers are beginning to see sense and realise that we must introduce vaccine certications to protect our health service and keep our businesses open. “SDLP Leader Colum Eastwood first urged the introduction of vaccine certication nearly two months ago and I have proposed and consistently raised it at the Executive, only for it to be opposed by the UUP, Sinn Féin and the DUP. “I welcome Minister Swann’s u-turn on this issue and hope Sinn Féin and DUP Ministers soon follow suit.BMA Northern Ireland Council chair Dr Tom Black said: “We have not even entered the winter months when traditionally we see our hospitals under tremendous pressure.“Hospitals and indeed our whole health service was already struggling, but Covid and the added pressure from an increased number of patients is simply too much.“We need to address these issues now. While vaccines are doing the job of keeping many people out of hospital, we also need to see masks being worn, contacts limited where possible and for everyone to come forward for boosters and flu jabs. The Executive should also revisit the use of Covid passports as a priority.”——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

It is shocking that the UK is ranked th out of  European countries for coastal water quality and only % of waterways meet good ecological status.As a regular open water swimmer myself and someone who loves our beautul rivers, lakes and coastlines, Irsquom deeply alarmed at the ongoing revelations about sewage discharge and other pollution incidents.After UK Conservative MPs tried to block efforts to improve the situation via an amendment to the Environment Bill, the House of Lords emphatically voted to send back the amendment to end the routine discharge of raw sewage into rivers. Unsurprisingly the Government then voted to weaken that amendment.They are simply in the wrong place environmentally and politically ndash which is deeply concerning in the week of COP. We need bolder, more urgent actionwe are to address the climate and nature crisis.While the regulation of water and sewers is generally reserved to the UK Government, here in Wales there are powers to regulate undertakers whose areas are wholly or mainly in Wales ndash and Irsquom pleased the Welsh Government is committed to tackling pollution by using these powers.This year marks  years of Remembrance as we know it, as the Royal British Legionmarks its centenary..removeAs we approach Armistice Day and Remembrance Sunday, it was an honour to plant a stake in the first Parliamentary Constituency Garden of Remembrance, to remember all those from Cardf South and Penarth who have served and paid the ultimate sacrice.It brought to mind the huge sacrices of our armed forces across the years and to this day.

The rough clftop path between bushes resembled a river after previous heavy rainfall and paddling their way along it, a deviation into fields for a quick stop for morning refreshments as overhead there were traces of blue in between the clouds.Crossing a sticky muddy ploughed field brought them to the dismantled railway line where at last the sun made an appearance and following Fort Road and crossing the busy Lavernock Road, a gate led them into Cosmeston Lakes Country Park beside the Medieval Village.A lush green meadow above the Sully Brook brought them to a stile leading into the Community Orchard, planted by volunteers in  and then through a gate into Cogan Wood, where squirrels were bounding and delicately prancing along the ground seeking food before scurrying up into the trees. Reaching Mile Road they continued towards Old Cogan Hall Farm to enter the churchyard of St Peterrsquos where lunch was taken whilst soaking up the sunshine that felt more like May than November.Refreshed they walked on through what had been the deserted medieval settlement of Old Cogan which relates to the th century when the church was built. It appears buildings were set within gardens on either side of a sunken lane and there was a village pond or a well with a mill and leat set to the south of the village..removeA narrow track brought them into woodland at the rear of Myrtle Close to hop across the Sully Brook into the lovely open green space of St Cyres Park with deep blue skies overhead. Then onto pavements taking them through Penarth town by way of Glyndwr Road, Elfed Avenue and across Redlands Road, through Mountjoy Crescent and more open parkland to the lovely upgraded Golden Gates Park and past the Grade II listed St Josephrsquos Church, which took seven years to build as work was interrupted by the Great War.By lane to reach Dingle Road and across the railway footbridge just as a train was approaching and then across the A Windsor Road into Windsor Lane, across Plassey Street to Plassey Square open space and along Harbour View Road to Queen Street. Here they heard the oldest reference to Penarth goes back to Osbert a Norman Knight that granted land there to St Augustinersquos Abbey in Bristol. The land was then taken by King Henry VII and leased out to local well to do families like the Herbertrsquos, Windsorrsquos and Lewis families.This area to the north of Penarth is known as The Bowery and was a poor area without access to education, doctors or a good standard of living. Many of the Irish navvies that came over to build Penarth Docks lodged in this area which became known as lsquoDagger Townrsquo and fights, prostitution, opium dens and gambling along with no doubt a murder or two was re. The Irish making the journey by boat often arrived starving and disease riddenthe journey had taken longer than expected. Whilst to the south of Penarth, it was a dferent story as the middle and upper class residents were better dressed, had moral values and enjoyed wealth and all the other things their counterparts in the north of the town lacked. A lane between houses built into the hillside at the rear of Paget Road brought them to Steep Street for the short walk back to their start, this time with sunny views across Cardf Bay and beyond.You can follow the grouprsquos exploits at www.penarthramblers.wordpress or Facebook article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

At thelowest point, in the early summer, Covid patients accounted for around two per cent of all hospitalisations in Wales.But despite the recent rise in Covid patients, we are a long way off the worst of the pandemic, when in January this year more than one in three hospitalisations in Wales was due to coronavirus.What comes next Vaccines have \"weakened\" the link between infection and serious illness, meaning the situation Wales faced last winter should not be repeatedndash at least to the same extentndash this time around.

Mask-wearing in shops and on public transport, social distancing and the recommendation to work from home when you can.Non-essential items were blocked off in Welsh supermarkets during the fire-break lockdown in autumn .

Today, first minister Mark Drakefordndash after receiving his own booster shotndash said: \"I would like to thank all the NHS staff and volunteers that have worked tirelessly over the last few months, to ensure that the vaccination programme has been such a success here in Wales.\"I urge everyone that is offered a booster vaccine to turn up for their appointments.\"We must do everything we can to keep everyone safe as coronavirus has not gone away.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

If the evidence supports third doses for people in those younger age groups, then the JCVI will make another announcement.Wales health minister Eluned Morgan said today that \"most younger adults will have received their second dose in late summer or early autumn\", meaning they will \"still have a high level of protection\" against coronavirus.Vaccines for teenagersWales will also begin offering second vaccine doses to people aged  and  who are not in an at-risk group.That second dose should be given  weeks after the first jab, the JCVI said, and for any young people who have been infected with Covid-since receiving their first dose, the second jab should be given at least  weeks after they were infected..removeMs Morgan said the JCVIfound that a second dose offered \"more durable protection against Covid- and further reduced the risk of infection and serious illness\".This was \"balanced against data showing the rare incidence of adverse events following vaccination in young people\".The health minister said the Welsh Governemnt would now work with the NHS on both new recommendations before the new vaccine policies are implemented in Wales. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityNathan Foy,  from Cardf, is one of at least , people in the UK with Charles Bonnet Syndrome.The conditioncauses people with sight loss to experience intense visual hallucinations, usually related to things they feel or hear. The hallucinations can be simple patterns but can also be complex images including events, people, places or animals.As part of todays Charles Bonnet Syndrome Awareness Day, charity Guide Dogs has released an animated video which tells Mr Foyrsquos story to help raise awareness of the condition.Mr Foy, who has congenital glaucoma and has always had limited vision, said: ldquoLiving with Charles Bonnet has been really dficult. Not many people I speak to have heard of it before, and assume the hallucinations are a sign of a mental health problem, rather than linked to sight loss like in my case.ldquoAt one point I was slipping into depression and the hallucinations were making things worse. But speaking to Guide Dogs saved me. Diana Evans, an orientation and mobility specialist for the charity took the time to listen and reassure me. The best thing I did was talk about it.MORE NEWS:The animated film explains what its like to live with the condition and reveals the wide iety of hallucinations Mr Foy experiences every day,including seeing his daughterrsquos plaits as wiggling fish out of water when she moves, or seeing a dragon when he opens a hot oven.Mr Foy has a guide dog called Mason, who he says keeps him safe and grounded.In , the retina in his left eye detached and, while he experienced some hallucinations as a teenager, they then increased dramatically and his brain would conjure all sorts of visions to fill the darkness..removeMr Foy said: ldquoI hope that this film will raise awareness of Charles Bonnet Syndrome and also encourage others with the condition to reach out to Guide Dogs for support.Ian Morris, national head of adult services at Guide Dogs, said: ldquoDespite so many people with sight loss experiencing Charles Bonnet Syndrome, there is very little awareness or understanding.ldquoIt is thought that the hallucinations are the brainrsquos response to the gradual loss of information it received from the eyes and so is trying to fill in the gaps, therefore drawing comparisons with lsquophantom limb syndromersquo in amputees.ldquoAt Guide Dogs, our mission is to increase the independence of people with sight loss. We hope that by sharing Nathanrsquos experience in the form of this animation, we can raise awareness of the condition and reduce stigma, and let people know of the support available from Guide Dogs.If you require more information or help from Guide Dogs, you can contact them on the Guide Line telephone service on    or visit https:www.guidedogs.org.uk getting-support Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Northern Ireland has experienced a .% increase in average rental values this year[]. With the price increase, OFTEC, representing the liquid fuel industry in Ireland, is concerned that students may take cheaper accommodation options without properly inspecting the property. With this in mind, OFTEC has issued advise to help students ensure their accommodation is safe before they sign the dotted line. Raise the alarm – Currently, it is not a mandatory requirement for private landlords to provide smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, but the HSENI recommend that they do. It is a legal requirement to fit a carbon monoxide detector when a fossil fuel appliance has been replaced. Carbon monoxide is potentially lethal as it has no smell, taste or colour. Without a working alarm, it is impossible to identy carbon monoxide leaks. OFTEC’s advise is to ensure that there are working fire and CO alarms in the property, and that they are tested on a regular basis.Heating requirements - The Health  Safety Executive recommend that all boilers should be serviced annually and tenants should ask for evidence of recent servicing. If you have concerns, ask for a CD  Landlord Oil Installation Check which is carried out by an OFTEC registered technician and will give you peace of mind. For a gas heated property, ask for a copy of the annual gas safety check.Look for damp – It is easy to hide damp patches with a coat of paint, soyour house smells musty or you see evidence of mould, find out how the landlord is planning to fix the problem. Mould has no place in the home as it can cause respiratory problems and headaches.Furniture and fittings – Ask the landlord for a list of everything that is included and make note of any damage that is there before you move it. Check any beds, sofas and chairs are in good condition.Secure your home – burglars may target student areas because of lax security. Ask your landlord to fit key operating locks on the windows and lever deadlocks on external doors.  OFTEC Ireland Manager, David Blevings, said: “Quite often the excitement of moving in with friends can overshadow the concerns about the accommodation itself. We are urging students to play it safe this year and carry out these essential checks before signing a lease and moving in. “Asking a landlord about safety may seem awkward, but it could prevent you from living in a potentially dangerous property for the next  months. It’s vital that your new home is not a burden as you start your time at university.
